This game is so simple you really dont need it but I would advise checking it out. 5: Simple, Beautiful graphics for those low end computers. 6: The community itself, Tons of planes are released each day and every keeps making better and better planes. 7: Everything.. Just everything is awesome. It is definitely a game to love if you like exploding things and building things. -Ctracerx2 of the SP community! I am proud to be a part of it!",

My second plane however took around 4 hours to get to fly which was really fun i was set to one certain design and in the end managed to get it to fly!  If you aren't so creative yourself theirs plenty of planes to download online and the world is spectaclular apparently theirs heaps of islands to explore though after 20 hours of playing i still haven't even found all three main ones!  This game isn't only about planes anymore! after a recent update you can now make cars and boats!  very very fun game, very addictive (trust me I play Minecraft I know what addicted to a game is like!!!)  won't stop playing this game for a long time!!!

You can either make a 'Simple plane' Or you can make a highly detailed airplane such as a Fw-190, a P-51, A B-17, whatever your fancy. This game is definitely worth 12.99 at this point, The only thing i have to gripe about, even though i don't usually care, because to me, gameplay and experiance is better, however the graphics in this game look like they would be perfect for the Playstation 2 era games. I mean, I know this game is supposed to be 'Simple' but the graphics, Like i said, i don't think graphics are the most important, but i definitely don't think they should be the least. Now that i think about it, another thing i gripe about, and this is the 2nd most important thing a game needs in my opinion, Is sound. Sound is a very important factor on immersion, i feel like sound is more important than graphics. The thing that kinda annoys me in this game, is the fact that the Radial engine in this game sounds like a Merlin V-12 I wish we could add custom engine sounds, or atleast get to modify all that jazz without having to go to unity maker and make a new part.  Also... Things in this game explode way too easily, not in crashing, but the weapons... It's kinda boring if one round hits the plane and a nuclear bomb goes off. If i have something like a B-17 just explode after a single hit every time, it gets boring, it's not fun seeing a nuclear explosion everytime a plane gets struck once by a small projectile... Unless it's an actual atomic bomb.",

You see, I was planning a vacation course for some of my elementary students based on aviation and flight and had two weeks of activities all laid out. Still, I was looking for a nice way to polish off the course and this came my way.   I know they are into video games and the 'Minecraft' way of doing things, so on the penultimate day I got them to design their own planes, which I brought home, built through thsi game and then recorded the test flights and design modifications to play back the following day.  Needless to say, it was a hit (especially when the planes went wrong), so for my review, let's catalogue my journey to classroom success.  Game purchased and downloaded and this was followed by the basic tutorials. Yep, straightforward enough, let's go.  Ambitious start; let's build a twin-engine plane ina fighter configuration. Test fly it... Nope, that didn't work. Make a few tweaks and discover another way of creating a fireball. Forget that! Bin the design and start again.  I decide to base the next design on real-world plane and go for a SAAB Viggen lookalike. Visually it all makes sense. i feel I know enough to judge that, in principle, it should fly. Wow!  More explosions.  Decide to go back to the drawing board, but before I do i download a couple of pre-designed planes. Yep, they work, so I start thinking about where I'm going wrong and slowly, slowly, better working aircraft begin to emerge from my internal design house.  13 Aircraft in, plus 4 variants, I was ready for the kids designs.  All in all, the game has a solid learning curve and presents some nice challenges. The construction screen sometimes moves pieces in weird ways, but practice and patience gets you past this easily enough. Exploring the options and displays helps you figure out what works and what doesn't and (if you're of a problem-solving mentality), will have you sitting there pondering just how to get that centre of balance just right.  It isn;t the most visually appealing sim, I'm not convinced that the physics are always spot on and the game has no real objective beyond that 'Yes, I did it!' moment, but frankly, that has been enough for me. It is surprisingly good fun and even though the course has passed, I'm back on the game trying to refine and improve upon myown designs (and will perhaps see if I can improve a little on some of my students' designs before next semester).  As a fun way of experimenting with your understanding of planes, it is great and I highly recommend it.",

So when I found it for online, I was more than happy to spend a few dollars. And now its on Steam, and has many more features than before.   So why do I recomend the game?  Pros-  *Easy to run (will virtually run on anything). *Extensive library of player made planes to choose from. *Cross platform capability (planes on Ios will work on PC or Android). *Simple to use, but fully capable of creating good looking planes. *Excelent playerbase. *Plane physics. ie: wings tearing off, falls apart on crash. *Simple and fun.  Cons-  *Graphics are minimal (definitely not a bad thing, I personally love it). *No workshop (but is extremely easy to download planes). *No multiplayer (not that I'm complaining).

AND ... it has all the cool weaponry stuff.  put that stuff to good use with a great multiplayer engine, WITH A LOBBY FEATURE, SERVER BROWSER, and a backend you can download and run on a Linux machine as a DEDICATED SERVER.  with multiplayer, i would add obviously PvP ... but i would ALSO ADD PvE.  and, i would add more parts in the builder UI to be able to build land fixtures so that you could add those fixtures in the game to decorate and blow up.  i would think it could be really fun to take a 'heavy bomber' and have competitions to see who could do the most damage to a small town in the game !  stuff like that, along with the obvious stuff like dogfighting etc.  that sounds fun, and i don't need alot of fiddly physics stuff for that !  as it stands now, for me, i'm not unhappy i bought it and funded an indie developer, but my advice, and wish for the developer is to do 1 of the 2 things i've mentioned to make the game better at something, rather than mediocre at a couple of things, or ... best case, do it all !  keep working on it !",

Just put some wings on, strap on some engines and off you go! ...except you then do lots of flips and then crash into the ground.  This is a game that isn't for everyone- some may just play it once and never again. Others might play it loads. I'm somehwere inbetween: I only tend to play if I have some ideas about what to build. Its like a concept testing ground. I like to see what sort of unusual designs will fly.  If you want to build stuff in 3D and see if it flies, this game is probably for you. If not but you're still considering it, its probably worth watching some YouTube gameplay first to see. PhlyDaily and JackSepticeye have done gameplay videos on it, to name a few.  P.S. it really does run well on lower-end machines. I get good FPS (cannot notice any FPS slowdown) and I use a nVidia GeForce 210.

I was not aware it was acually designed for Smart Phones, it looked like PC quality. I'm not an engineer but I sure feel like one right now :) I think the Laws of Physics still apply because if your plane dose not fly well, it means you made an error and its great to get that visual feedback with humor.

Once I made a plane that could fly SimplePlanes got 1000% better. It Can be incredibly relaxing to just drift allong and listen to the music(which is great by the way) or you can enter a dogfight and destroy enemy ships. Also there is so much to explore and do it takes a while for the overworld to get boring. There is also really great workshop content if you are starting to get bored like a space map, planes capable of reaching 10,000 mph, or massive war blimps.   There are a couple of things that I think should and probably will be added. First, I know everyone is ranting about multiplayer and I agree it would be awesome to fight other people to the death,race your epic ship against theirs, or simply play around. Also I would enjoy more maps such as a dessert or city. Some new parts such as heli blades or cannons.

FSX is all about advanced aspects of flying, such as n1, n2, how to start the engine, checklists, atc, etc. Many people just want to fly a plane. Thats were this game kicks in. WIth its fair share of mods, and many other ways to create and download your own custom planes, (and worlds) This is a great game for those who want to fly planes(including military planes with bombs, missles, and guns which actually work!) without prior knowledge, or simply do not want the hassle, download this game. It's a great flying game(I wouldn't necessarily consider this game as a simulator) Final Verdict:  8/10.  PS, plane building is a skill which takes time to learn and master in this game.

You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.  You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.  To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree.",
