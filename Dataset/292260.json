Has your good old fashioned 60's style destroy things for the fact that you can villian. Good pun humor, and if you've played any of this companies games in the past before, a warm fuzzy feeling of joy that you can not get from any of the best street drugs money can buy. Do I recommend? I go beyond and demand you get this. Also you should just turn off the tape before it ends....TOO LATE *BOOM*",

            "review_text": "This game even holds up today. Maybe the sound quality is not very good and the pixelation is pretty awefull (Considering it's age it is okay but I am looking at a standpoint of today compared of games today) but besides that you get some very nice adventures with allot of gags you will still laugh about as long as you like Cartoons and everything. Kids will love this. I also love that it is made for childs the secrets are much easer to puzzle out.  So all I can say, if you love adventure games you cann still pick it up but let's be honest how many point and click adventures aren't timeless.^^ They all are and this no exception.  Also best are the quick playtroughs of 2 hours which makes this perfect for people with less time!.",

            "review_text": "Well, after all this looking, I've finally found it!  I finally found a Spy Fox game that I enjoyed, and can completely recommend.  Spy Fox 3: Operation Ozone is the thrilling conclusion to the Spy Fox trilogy, and what a wild ride it has been! I was surprised to find out that LeRoach was actually Spy Fox's uncle, and pulling MobCo's strings from the start. And while in this entry in the trilogy there's some odd choices, like a romance between Billy the Kid and Moneypenny, and delving into Professor Quack's childhood, but I feel like it helped flesh out the story a lot more. And the return of Russian Blue right at the end was a nice touch to tie everything together.  Of course, you realize I'm kidding, don't you?  Spy Fox 3 concludes the Spy Fox trilogy in no way related to the previous games, barring the exceptions that they follow Spy Fox beating a maniacal villain, and there's some slight nods to Spy Fox 1 and 2 here and there, but not enough that it becomes annoying. In fact, this game improves even more than Spy Fox 2 did over Dry Cereal.  Spy Fox 3 has a massive gallery of devices this time, and some gadgets that might potentially never be used for a playthrough. You also can control Spy Fox's spy car and drive across the planet to the four most well-known worldwide landmarks: Street... Jungle... Desert... and Lake. All very important in the history of humanity.  However, what I felt was lacking Spy Fox Uno and Dos, that Tres has done so much better is that, the world (while large) isn't completely isolated with its puzzles. There might be something you need in order to finish a puzzle in a different area, so you'll be transporting across the globe between locations so much to the point, that you start to wonder how long Spy Fox has been spending driving to all these place and how much time there really is left on the massive aerosol can. But each area you visit is beautifully colored and drawn. I love the way each location looks, and how the character fit so much better in them, than the bland worlds of Acidophilus and the World Fair.  On top of that, the music in this game is actually pretty good. You won't be humming the tunes after you beat the game, but they each fit to their own areas nicely. Even though the African deserts have a western guitar sound, and the Russian lake has northern banjos playing.  Another complaint I had with the previous entries were the villains and their plans. Between Billy the Kid trying to blame cows for flooding the world with milk, and LeRoach relying on precisely 1,000,000 people to wind up his doomsday device, it's nice to see that Poodles Galore actually has something of a slow-burning 'Death Star' aerosol can floating over the earth to slowly deplete the ozone layer. It isn't the most sensical, but I think it better fits a villain's master plan than the incredibly stupid ones from the previous entries. And I liked Poodles as a character. She played off that make-up diva angle that I'd never seen as a James Bond villain parody before, and I thought she was funny.  The humor in this game is a lot more visual now, too. Spy Fox spouts his annoying puns here and there, but a lot of jokes are sight gags, and are legitimately funny. Jokes have set ups and pay-offs through the character's interactions, because I think the Humongous budget went somewhere into the animation. This is probably one of the best looking and best animated HE games I've played in the library thus far.  Spy Fox 3: Opertation Ozone has that perfect blend of child-like charm, spy thriller action, and good humor to provide an experience that I believe is well worth the price of admission. It succeeeds in gameplay and story far more than the first two Spy Fox games, and the puzzles are much more intricately laid out this time around. I'm giving this game a 7/10. It's nice to see that Spy Fox ended on a high note before he went out.",

Although it was a point and click adventure game targeted to children, it's still really fun to play as an adult. Even today, the gameplay never ceases to entertain me. The humor is always charming, the puzzles are reasonably challenging to a kid, and the sound design and interaction really polish up the game. Overall this game is definitely suited for everyone as its both fun and educational. Thanks to Steam, every generation of PC gamers can experience a blast from the past.",

In fact I never even knew Spy Fox had a third game until I saw the Humoungus Games on Steam. Still its a game that was really fun to play through. The parodys still hold up and the enviroments were fun to explore. So yes this is one that would defenitly be a recommendation.",
