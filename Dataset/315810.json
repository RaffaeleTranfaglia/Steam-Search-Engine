            "review_text": "I wasn't entirely sure about a VN priced at $20.00, but after about ten minutes in, I realized why. It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally. That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water.   First off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long. You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in. That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling.  Secondly, the entire VN is voice acted. Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter. Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well.  Not only that, but the art in this game is amazing. At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move. Every character and background scene really immerse you into the story the developer wanted to portray.   10/10, only regret regarding this game is the fact that I didn't buy it sooner.",

            "review_text": "So I bought this game on the mangagamer website. I played it trough but of course Steam wouldn't know about it hence my lack of playtime on my profile.  For those who aren't into Visual Novels:  I'm just gonna go ahead and say if you are a gamer in the sense that you wanna 'play' with games this game is not for you. Visual Novel are about storytelling (or they should be) so most of the time you just advance the test. This particular Visual Novel is a Kinetic Novel meaning you literally can't do anything during the gameplay. It's like an animated picture book with (japanese) voice acting and background music.  Among Visual Novels this is one of the best I've ever read so if you feel you might be intrested in a good, heartwarming and bittersweetstory then you have my recommendation. This is one of the finest examples of what Visual Novels can be at their best.   For those who already fans of the Visual Novel genre:  This is not a nukige. If you just wanna buy it because 'lol it has a lol' then shame on you! It's a feel-heavy storytelling piece which really deserves it's price. If you will buy just one VN in your entire life then put this game on the candidate list ASAP. As to which version to buy. I have the PLUS+ MOSAIC from the Mangagamer site and after reading trough the game I cannot in good conscience go to the adult content. Belive me you wouldn't miss anything with the Steam version.  It's important to note that adult content was in fact not censored away from this version but THIS is the original version of the game. The PLUS+ MOSAIC were originally a DLC and it can't be patched into the Steam version but again this game is more than perfectly fine without it. (In fact it would have ruined the mood for me at the end so IMHO it's better this way)",

Eden is a kinetic novel, thus lacking any interaction with the story, the plot is simple but manages to be unique in its own way, yet I don't feel like recommending this visual novel because I believe it presents a number of flaws that annoyed me to the point of making me want to uninstall it from my HDD. The game felt nice in the beginning, I said nice because it doesn't hold a candle compared to the other VNs I read, but neither belongs in the trash, my positive opinion carried on until a certain moment in the game, perhaps near the end, either way, I can guarantee it's definitely after the first half of the story, but back to the main point, the game turned into a real chore, I couldn't stand the boredom anymore, these accurate and vivid 'descriptions' lasted far too long and there was no story progression overall, in addition, what makes it even wrong is the inaccurate timing of the backstories, which are told too late in the game, making it seem even more dull and boring rather than the opposite.  In other words, *eden completely and utterly failed to captivate my attention, making me fall asleep more than twice during reading. When I asked for something lighthearted to read, I was hoping to find something that would hook me at least for two weeks or more, but unfortunately the game doesn't appear to be my cup of tea. Luckily, I didn't buy this game at its full price, but in my modest opinion, this game isn't worth more than ten bucks.",

            "review_text": "A powerful story about love, life and what it means to live. The story involves the final days of the planet Earth which may seem like a cheap way to inject drama but, honestly, that part of the story may as well be an aside. The fact is that the main story is between our two main characters and it could have just as well been told in another setting while still remaining as powerful. It's very well written with one caveat...  The pacing for the first half is incredibly slow. If you're not a patient person, you may have trouble dragging yourself through it. Speed reading or skimming along until the main characters get together wouldn't be a terrible idea if you feel yourself getting disinterested because there is a great ending to this story, despite the slow start. This is a long story and they get together at about the midway point so you won't be robbing yourself of much by skimming a bit. Lastly, just an FYI, this is a kinetic novel meaning there are no choices, branching paths or interactions.   As far as the artwork goes, it's mostly top-notch. The characters are often incorporated into the backgrounds instead of the standard VN format of having a background layer with static 'pop-up' characters in front of it. There are a few frames of Major Inaba that are comically bad and I question how they ended up in the game when the rest is so well drawn but aside from that, it's all very beautiful.  In summary, it's a great story if you have the time (and a little patience) to put into it. A bit slow to start but it has a fairly powerful finish. I recommend it.",

My first impression was something like 'Kazami Yuuji meets Reverie Planetarian' but the end result was a rather weak plot. Planetarian made me cry like a child and Grisaia made me gasp, but Eden didn't make me shed a single tear.  Comparison with other VNs aside, the story in general was pretty bland. Whatever excitement I got from the 'research facility' arc disappeared completely in the arcs that followed. It's like they tried to follow the mirror image of the plot mountain, starting with the climax and ending with exposition. The story became some bland slice-of-life between Gary Stu and Mary Sue. It did a good job tying plot elements together but it all felt unnecessary towards the end, messily resolving any conflict.  It's a well-spent 10+ hour story, a calming ride, a relaxing experience... but it doesn't feel like it's worthy of its high ratings.

I should mention, no spoilers in this review. So newcomers, read to your heart's content! Veterans, enjoy the ride. :-)  I never believed myself to be the visual novel type person. Games where you just read text always seemed boring to me. I usually play more RPG/Adventure type games where you actually DO things with your characters, not where there is a set, linear outcome.   But this game truly altered my views on visual novels.   I like to think of my myself as a rather 'tough' individual when it comes to watching movies and playing games and not getting genuinely sad or 'immersed' with the characters in the story. Not so with this game. I can count no less than 3 times when I had tears in my eyes playing this and many many other times when I felt concerned beyond what I can describe for the characters within this game's incredibly well-presented story.   The story combines science-fiction with romance to create a very interesting situations. And the use of suspense, oh my God. The feeling of: 'NOOOOOOOO, not now!' or: 'That's not good...' will grip you and tear you apart all throughout the story. It's fantastic. Truly fantastic and engaging.   The game's soundtrack is beautiful. Although at points I have wondered: 'Oh boy, that song again?' it does not detract from the game in any way. Although a few times when it kicked in it scared me, I remedied the issue by turning BGM down just a tad in options. Then no problems.   I thought the art style was sort of weird at first, but now it is very appealing to me. I guess it may be my sister's very awkward views on what is anatomically correct, but I promise this game's art is quite incredible and that my sister is full of crap.  In terms of characters, their development, and how they change over the course of the story, I've never experienced anything quite like this. Some of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen have come from this game. I cannot applaud Minori, the creator of this work of art, enough for the beautiful creation I have just witnessed. This is off the grading scale.   I'd have to invent an entirely new grading scale to accurately rate how good this game is to me. But I'll spare those details.  I came, expecting it to be a 'crappy harem' with a 'strange' art-style and only one, 'dry' ending. Plus ew, all that text you have to read and potentially 'bad' voice actors/actresses.   I left feeling completely different. Changed. Soothed, if you will. Also, I must say my prior judgements are unfathomly incorrect. If you have any/all of those like I did, play the game. You will see what I mean after completing the game. You will be most surprised.  The game has an overwhelmingly positive rating, and I am proud to contribute to that. As my first ever review for a game, I am most satisfied it is with this glorious visual novel. I played. I cried. I left feeling at peace and satisfied with my purchase. Money well spent.  TLDR: Recommended. :-) Very highly recommended. :-) :-) :-)  PS- And don't rush through it, whatever you do (I didn't, although towards the end I was quite anxious to see the ending, although I never skipped anything). Enjoy it. And remember, do not suppress your tears. Or I probably would've cried a ton more, and especially audibly at no less than 3 parts in the game. Part of enjoying games like these are to truly take in their beauty and let your emotion express itself, as it should be allowed to.",

He enters a mysterious facility and meets a girl who has more to her than meets the eye. No, I promise you I have not confused eden* with Planetarian. That said, if you enjoyed Planetarian, then I think you are very likely to enjoy eden*.  The visuals in eden* are good. In addition to having a variety of poses and facial expressions for each character, the characters are shown to blink and their lips sync with the voice acting. There are many CGs and each one is beautiful to see. Several locations even have multiple CGs and this gives the impression of a changing camera angle. I like it.  As eden* is a visual novel, the topic of H-scenes should be raised. I did some research and discovered that the H-scenes are apparently bonus content to unlock in the main menu after completing the kinetic novel once. This means that the H-scenes are not at all relevant to developing the canon storyline. So don’t worry about characters suddenly referring to something that happened during a deleted H-scene. That said, I also read that the H-scenes add more depth to each character despite being non-canon. Anyway, it should be well known now that if you want to see H-scenes then you should buy directly from MangaGamer.  The sound is good. The background music sets the mood well. However, it does not loop well because the end of the music fades to silence before starting again. The voice acting is good. I did not find any characters irritating to listen to. I think the emotions contained in the voice acting were appropriate for each character and the situation.  The story is told using flashbacks, and it makes some of the plot developments easy to see coming. The setting is easy to follow. The plot is decent and enjoyable, but it is not great. The translation is good. There are a few instances when I think a native English speaker would find the text unnatural but the text is still grammatically correct so it can still be understood.  Overall, I enjoyed eden* and recommend it to people who enjoy visual/kinetic novels. It is not a great kinetic novel, but it is good enough to deserve a place in the visual/kinetic novel library.",

If you are looking to try out visual novels then this would an excellent way to get acquinted.  *Story is captivating. *Characters are wonderful and have depth. *Even though I don't understand a word of Japanese, I was enthralled by the voice acting. The actors made the characters shine. A match made in heaven. *Artwork is gorgeous although near the end a bit repetitive.  I highly recommened anyone to pick this game up, its well worth the money. It takes about 9-11 hours to get through the story.",

This novel lacks choices, which may disappoint those looking for multiple endings or having influence over the flow of the story. However, that story is what kept me playing throughout the novel. It's well constructed with a cast of characters that continues to make things interesting right up until the end point. The visual style is a delight as well, helping to give the story life and the music really does well to compliment the novel.   You can read a full review of this game here.  [www.neoseeker.com] ",

Nothing but pure praise. The art, the style, the music. story, and character's   Yea it may say 0.1 hrs on record, that's not true I've gone through the story twice.",

I last felt like this when I first saw Aerith die in Final Fantasy VII and that was just one moment while this feeling happens like always especially through the end. Needless to say it is beautifully done, there are not many soundtracks available unfortunately but they all do they job greatly. Character animations, music in the background, voice acting, character designs(no ecchi with these characters fortunately), story.... Everything is almost flawless in my opinion. I would give a 9/10 to this and that is a 9 because of the soundtrack.",
