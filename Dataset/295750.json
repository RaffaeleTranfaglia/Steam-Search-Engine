            "review_text": "[Edit: beat the game!]  Pros -  Great visuals Fresh physic mechanics Beautiful, relaxing soundtrack Great level designs  Cons -  Erratic fluctuations in difficulty, it'll be smooth sailing then suddenly a random level that makes you die 30 times, then smooth sailing again, repeat random cycle Wonky keyboard controls, using a controller is better but sometimes the sensitivity still feels off  Got this game from a dear friend before it hit Steam but didn't get around to playing it till now. As the title states, the floor is jelly! So every surface you touch bounces around, which creates chain reactions you utilize in the game. For example you can jump higher and higher if you time it right, because the floor will bounce you up and down. There are different 'worlds', each with new mechanics that are very creative and get harder and harder as you progress. It's a platformer, one that's tough from the second half, but it feels quite different from others on the market.  There's a great variety of levels and mechanics, and I never got bored of the art style. However as mentioned in the cons the difficulty curve gets quite random - there will be random very difficult levels between some easy ones, before I really got used to the controls. It took me roughly 6 hours to beat, but I am speaking for one that likes platformers but doesn't play very difficult ones. I've read on forums of people finishing in 2 hours or less so if you've played something like Super Meat Boy that'd be closer to what you would get out of the game.  The art style and music are both amazing, very pleasing to the eyes and ears! Music is relaxing, on the minimalist side.   Do I recommend this? Yes, it's very aesthetically pleasing, with refreshing mechanics that'll give you a good sense of achievement.",

            "review_text": "The Indie Platformer genre is one of my personal favorites so as you might imagine I was excited when I found out that The Floor is Jelly was on sale in the Humble Store. The game looks beautiful from the very beginning and the music, which changes as you progress through each uniquely designed zone, is best described as relaxing. While the controls handle well, it was initially difficult to get used to them due to the nature of the 'jelly' floors, walls, and ceilings. The minimal astheitic accompanied by tranquil melodies really does wonders for this platformer.  Now that the positives are out of the way, I can honestly say that I will not be recommending this game at it's ten dollar price point. The options menu, unfortunately, lacks numerous features including the ability to change the resolution and rebind hotkeys. More importantly, it is not worth spending the game's full price tag when you find yourself stuck in a wall after only 11 minutes of gameplay. Common sense tells me that I should be able to open the menu and restart the level. For whatever reason, there is no such option. For a game of this genre, a simple level restart feature that you can bind to a key is a must.  Restarting the game fixed the glitch and respawned me back at my previous checkpoint. After roughly 20 more minutes I stumbled upon another glitch. The new checkpoint where the game had me saved had no ground below it causing me to continuously fall to my death upon each respawn. Restarting the game has no effect as there is no way to switch checkpoints or restart the level. The only solution is to clear my save file and start again from the beginning. Unbelievable.  Evidently, there is a workaround which you can find  here  that involves 3rd party save editors. However, this should not be necessary for a game with a Metacritic score of 81.  It is unfortunate that my experience with The Floor is Jelly has been a negative one. If you decide to pick this game up, do so when it is on sale and pray that you don't get stuck.",

            "review_text": " The Floor is Jelly . No title describes what this game developed by Ian Snyder is really about more. This is a platformer game where you control a little tiny human guy and guide him through each level, with each level split up into several rooms connected by windows.  Your little guy can jump around, and can climb up walls by jumping up them like in the  Mega Man X  games. It doesn't sound that simple, though. Whereas other platform games took place on  solid ground , in  The Floor is Jelly , well, the ground acts exactly like that. As you move around, the ground beneath your feet violently wobbles and jiggles around like a gigantic waterbed. It's not just the ground that flings around, too. Even the walls and ceilings ripples and bounces as you wall jump and hit the ceilings retrospectively. It's not all bad, however. You can take advantage of the wobbly ground by using it as a trampoline, but you'll need to time your jumps right or your bounce may fall flat. It may take you a while to get used to these bouncy castle physics, but soon enough, you'll be bounding around like a pro.  There's no enemies or monsters to fight, but there are plenty of hazards along the way. Each level is strewn with bottomless pits and dark purple spiky blobs, and if you fall or hit them retrospectively, you'll be sent back to the entrance of the room. Thankfully, there's no lives to worry about or anything, and you restart very quickly as well, which is good.  The puzzles are well done as well. For example, very early on in the game, you'll come across a spiky wall which you cannot seemingly pass. You'll have to bounce on the ground next to it and then use the resulting ripples in the ground to quickly run underneath it. Had the world have been solid and not bouncy, this wall would have been outright impossible to get past. Each level also has their own gimmicks as well; two stages have water where your gravity is reversed underneath the surface, and you'll need to utilise the resulting momentum to get through their rooms at times. Another level sees you rotating several structures to let rain water reach white plants while trying to keep 'catflowers' out of the rain at the same time. Another level has platforms that only become solid while you're touching one at a time, allowing you to slide down or walk across into the inside of another platform, which then becomes inverse-solid in which the outside is solid and inside is air. Some levels are less linear than others, these levels require you to explore to find a certain number of 'keys' that will open a portal that leads to the exit.  After reaching the end of the first level, you'll come to an underground cavern which serves as the game's central hub. As you make your way through this bouncy cavern, you'll come across a large locked door, and you'll need to beat the three levels that this cave branches out to in order to unlock it. Through this door is a darker cavern that branches out to three more levels, and after beating them, you'll unlock another door that leads to the final two stages.  The final two stages is where the game starts to get more tedious. In the second-to-last level, you must jump around in low gravity to find three keys at the end of three separate sections to unlock the portal. It sounds simple at first, but then as you grab each key, the way back becomes riddled with... I won't spoil it entirely here, but let's just say 'instakill hazards' on the same lines as spikes. These hazards are erratically placed, and often requires trial and error in knowing where they are, leading to a few deaths. The final stage itself is no better, with most rooms requiring sheer luck rather than skill to get through.  There's also a few secrets hidden around the world as well. There's 31 in total, and each contains a house that contains a terminal. Activating all 31 terminals unlocks a neat secret that's fun to mess around with. However, there's 6 terminals that can be permanently missed in the second-to-last level as you start collecting those three keys, and with no warning or indication that this is the case until it's too late, it's pretty frustrating to have to restart your save file.  The aesthetics here are amazing. The environments are beautiful and dreamlike, the wobbling of the ground is very fluid, and the interactivity is incredible due to the world's bouncy properties. Objects like trees and bushes sway and move with the wobbling ground as you bounce around, and in two of the levels, if you bounce next to a tree or bush, the sudden movement of the tree or bush may scare off any birds nesting in them and then they'll fly off to a more stable tree or bush. There's other neat stuff, too, like frogs making wobbles in the ground as they hop around in the underground hub level, and the rain in the Wetlands level makes the ground constantly jiggle as each raindrop pounds down onto it. The houses in the secret areas are built on stilts, and even wobble around as you jump onto them as well as onto the ground underneath. There's also a neat window effect that let's you see their randomly generated interiors as you get close, but disappointingly, their furniture stays fixed in place, no matter how much the house wobbles. Each level is also accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack, most of which is written by Disasterpeace, known for his work on music in other games like  Fez .  Unfortunately, some effects could cause slowdown at certain times, such when more intricately generated houses are onscreen. The initial Humble Bundle release allowed you to switch to lower quality graphics in the options menu to help eliminate some slowdown, but that option seems to be missing in the Steam release.  Despite it's playful physics and unique platformer gameplay,  The Floor is Jelly  is over way too soon. A level editor would have been amazing, with the ability to create our own jelly worlds and share them online, but it's very unlikely we'll see one anytime soon.  Pros: + The whole world is bouncy! + Varied stages. + Soothing music by Disasterpeace. + Bouncy worlds! + Dreamlike environments. + Some well hidden secrets. + Some of the bounciest landscapes and caves in videogame history. + No lives to run out of, and very quick restarts. +  Very fluid  wobbling effects on the terrain, and how the background objects wobble and move around with it. + Did I mention bouncy worlds? Because the world is bouncy.  Cons: - Some slowdown in some areas. - No low quality graphics mode. - No level editor. - Secrets in the second-to-last level are permanently missable, with no warning given. - Final stage relies too much on luck rather than skill most of the time.",

This is a platformer that takes it's physics mechanic and explores it tio the fullest.  The developer takes you through the full extent of the mechnic and applications of it with a multitude of examples of how it can be used. Then proceeds to deconstruct the rules of the mechnic.   I picked it up on sale but would not have been disapointed if I had paid full price.",

            "review_text": "Cool looking platformer with tons of design problems. First off, it says controller support, but it actually doesn't work with a controller plugged in. Some people say if you plug in after the game it works, but it still didn't work for me. Its embarassing that in 2016 this game still doesn't have working controller support. Using the keyboard is just ok, but not great. It's worse because the platforming is imprecise. Your character moves side to side super fast and has so much momentum from 1 jump it's hard to adjust in the air, you just either have to hope you guess the right amount or you die and start again. This can be quit annoying. Wall jumping works sometimes, and othes you just slide down and fall. The floor and walls being jelly is a cool idea. The game problems come to a head with this terrible 'transparency' shifting platforms. There is literally no rhyme or reason to how they work. You just randomly jump and sometimes you can go through other times you can't It's not consistent, as times I should have been able to go through I couldn't. If you watch people play in walkthroughs its the same thing. Its more trial and error and luck than any sort of skill or puzzle solving. Its super annoying because with the wall jumping and the bad platforms, you can ge through 2/3 random luck parts of these and if you die on the 3rd you need to restarts entire level. Its just terribly done and in no way made sense and they haven't fixed how buggy it is. Other times I would fall through solid blocks. There's no story. Even the first level where it all starrs has no directions and you just hammer keys. Looks cool and has some fresh ideas, as well as relaxing music, but terrible game design and imprecise and finnicky platform mechanics all bog it down and make it not worth playing.  3.5/10",

Overall: 4/10  Gameplay- This game is a hit and miss, it takes great timing and skill to play, but thats mainly because you want to play it like super meat boy but it wants to be played like the heavy from TF2.. slow and steady.

            "review_text": "I have only just finished the first part of the game. Great visuals, really! Something uniquely done. The jelly physics are pretty nice, though you would need to get used to them. Jumping requires precise timing (need to time your jumps as you bounce back up from the jelly) so this again needs getting some used to. The soundtrack accompanies the cheery and colorful nature of the game well.   Only negative thing about the game for me is that the game is 4:3 ONLY. This somewhat breaks the immersion. Worse is the fact the screenshots on the store page have been 'gamed' to look like 16:9! Mind you, this is not game breaking, but I'm just peeved the developer wasn't upfront about this and would like to highlight this to others.   So yeah, from the short time I've spent on it, the game is something unique. 2D indie platformers are a dime a dozen, but this can stand tall and distinguish itself from the horde.  UPDATE: Having completed the game, I would say it was disappointing overall, but not outright bad. A lot of nice touches (the visual aesthetic especially) but the game didn't have a hook. It just didn't draw me in. I don't have any problems with the relatively short length, but this was a game that felt...empty. There was no soul here, for me at least. Given I went in with lofty expectations, I naturally come out disappointed. Would still rate it around 6/10, so it still gets a thumbs up from me.",
