            "review_text": " This is a rather long review, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend this title just skip to the  Results  section and read from there.   Fatshark created a fantastic little puzzle game which puts you to the test. Hamilton’s Great Adventure pushes out levels that pose mysteries and threats around every turn.    Story:  Hamilton’s Great Adventure starts you off telling the stories of your great exploits to your granddaughter. You relive Hamilton’s glory days as you try to get the parts for a machine required for a purpose you will learn if you beat the campaign. You and your bird, Sasha, must complete puzzles from Brazil, Egypt, India, and the Secret Islands. As the game progress Hamilton gets further into his tale and new characters are introduced. The game includes hilarious dialogue, with an interesting story that keeps you guessing, and levels that keep posing new challenges. As you progress through the game you obtain answers to the mystery and you learn all about how the story began.    Gameplay:  Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle solving game which knowing the answer is the key. Unlike some puzzle solving games where you can see the solution but be unable to complete the challenge because of a simple annoyance in clicking a button at exactly the right time. This game puts your mind to the test to solve puzzles by completing challenges by using the correct answer. It’s fun and rather simple, yet some puzzles are a little more difficult than others. The games graphics are not the best, but they are crisp and the story is pleasant. Sasha can be difficult to control and managing two characters is rather difficult if you are not on your toes.    Menus:  One of my major gripes is that the in game menu is annoying to navigate. They tried to make the menu look like a book, but this is not very useful as you don't actually know what information is on what page. Ultimately you may have to flip through the whole book if you are looking for a simple answer.    Hints:    The pink vials are used to power up Hamilton’s special abilities. You can play as Sasha at the start of the level before activating the timer, so if you want to you can gather lots of the pink vials before even technically starting a level. You can also scare off the flying blowfish that attack Sasha by using a taunt when they are about to hit Sasha (it causes them to blow up and float away).     Result:  Hamilton's Great Adventure doesn't pull you in keeping you on your toes from level to level; yet, the game offers fun puzzles which you can solve during your spare time. I would like it if they had checkpoints. I don't play too many puzzle game so maybe they all don't have any checkpoints during levels. If you like to solve puzzles and you're tired of traditional puzzle solving games that challenge a user based on luck or precise click timing then this is for you.   Pros: +Simple gameplay without too many commands to learn +Smooth movements +Fun and rather complex puzzles +Fantastic difficulty curve, the puzzles get gradually more difficult rather than exponentially +Nice art style which makes the games simple graphics seem rather elegant  Cons: -Very difficult menu navigation -Not a very riveting story (though it’s a puzzle game so you're here for the puzzles not for the tale) -Can be infuriating when you have solved the first part of the puzzle, but have to keep resolving to get to the second part of the puzzle",

            "review_text": "Hamilton's Great Adventure might be an okay casual game to waste some time with, but I don't recommend it.  The game isn't very challenging. Trying to figure out the proper paths to finish the levels was somewhat enjoyable, but in the end it came down to trial and error and memorizing the correct steps. All of the switches that need to be manipulated have markers with symbols/colors that correspond to their counterpart objects, which made their operation trivial. There are items to be acquired and used, but I had only received one towards the end of when I quit playing and I didn't get chance to use it, so I can't comment on that mechanic.  The first 'problem' I encountered with the game is the fact that the keyboard and gamepad can't be used at the same time. This isn't really a problem, but when the game loads, there's no way to skip the intro screens with the gamepad. If any key is pressed on the keyboard, the game disables the gamepad and then it has to be reenabled in the menu.  Another annoyance was the game crashing to desktop when killed by an enemy. I could not reproduce the error by reloading the game and dying to that same enemy, but as soon as I would die to an enemy on a new level the error would reoccur. And, of course, every time I would reload the game after a crash I would either have to sit through the intros or reenable the gamepad through the menu, adding to my frustration. Fortunately dying to enemies wasn't a common occurrance.  Even if the bugs were fixed, the game just feels too easy and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting time when I could be playing something else. I don't recommend purchasing this game, not even if it were on sale.",

            "review_text": "Hamilton's Great Adventure is a simple puzzle game. As in, a  very  simple puzzle game. I wish I could say more about it, but that's the only word I can think of to describe it; simple.   The graphics are simple, the sound and music is simple, the controls are simple, the gameplay is simple, and the story is very simple.   This would be a good game for a young child, so if you have one (or several), they will likely enjoy it. Adults may quickly find it boring. There is little challenge, and no goal other than to obtain all the collectibles. The charm wears off rather quickly.   However, this is not why I'm not recommending this game. The reason I'm giving this game a thumbs down is because it doesn't run consistently. The forums are loaded with posts about how the game crashes on startup or at the end of a level, or in the middle of a level. I came back to this game after two years, only to find it was crashing to desktop. I tried multiple fixes, none of them worked. What's worse is that Fatshark, the dev for this game, has apparently lost interest in making sure that Hamilton's Great Adventure can continue to offer its simple pleasures to the gaming community.   Until these issues are fixed, the only recommendation I have is that you save your money. Even if you get one of those 90% off coupons for this game, just let it expire, or if you must, buy the game, and if it doesn't work immediately get a refund.",

It seemed okay from the training level (the only section I was able to actually get through quickly enough to avoid a crash), so probably worth a go - if you get it in a sale and can risk not being able to play! Mouse and keyboard seems better, I found the bird awkward to control with a controller.",

The SFX and music sliders are set to maximum, and it just... doesn't play any music, any sound whatsoever. A minor problem that likely would've been truly troublesome had I spent any time actually playing the game and not farming it for badges.  The game itself is a fairly simple puzzle game, with manipulation of blocks, gates, and pressure plates in one area of the puzzle to unlock / activate something elsewhere. You have a bird that can travel along the Z axis, which opens up new areas of '3D' puzzling, but I didn't spend enough time with the game to see if it ever became anything truly remarkable.",

The levels are short and easy to play quickly, and there's a lot of them. However, if you really want to get a gold ranking like I do on every level, it will take you longer because it's hard to collect some of the treasure. The story's not great, and it's kind of hard to follow. The journal feature is pretty cool, and I like how you need the bird to complete some of the puzzles. A few things are broken. Whenever you try to apply a change in the settings, it stops responding and the change doesn't work.  Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10",
