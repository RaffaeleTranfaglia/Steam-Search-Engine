            "review_text": "I'm a sucker for the arcade racing genre, so I purchased this game early on (it might have been early access, I don't remember now), and I pretty much immediately wrote it off. More than anything the chunky hit boxes and punishing reset mechanics made for an infurating experience. That said, I'm glad I re-downloaded and gave it another shot. It's still not perfect but it's a whole lot better. In some ways the racing experience is among the most satisfactory of the arcade racers I play (among them, Bang Bang Racing, Mini-motors EVO, Little Street Racers) because it feels like the AI cars neither cheat nor are handicapped in an unrealistic manner. What remains imperfect are the hitboxes on some areas of some maps, which occasionally will find you stuck on parts that should clearly be traversable. Also, the heavily-mined elimination maps in career mode are almost hair-on-the-tongue annoying, at least if you're the sort that tries to get first on every map. I would rate myself as mediocre at this genre, for what it's worth, so if you're an ace at driving games, this might be too simple for you.",

            "review_text": "Great Game! Many hours of gameplay, especially when trying to win on every track with the Sputs Golem! Great for evading mines but the top end and short duration of the boost made it very difficult, at least for me. There was another car that i spent quite a few hours trying to win in, but i forget now. Once you do win with one of those cars though, it's like 'YESSS!' The devs, namely Barkley, has been here since day one and is still here solving any issues that arise and just letting the player base know that the game is being backed by Eclipse Games , the creator of STC. I am impressed and hats off to Barkley!",

I've played a RC Car game yesterday which was like 10x more enjoyable.  -Graphics The graphics are really bad. Some textures are only loading when you're in the range of 10m.  -Gameplay The gameplay was weird. Quick races are only for local multiplayer, so i've only played one race of the carrer. Didnt even try the multiplayer. I cant expect many people to play it. And even less i believe that it works flawless.  -Sounds Thats the main point why i quit the game so fast, besides to it being weird and bad. The Sound Effects had such a low bad quality, only the music quality was good, i didnt like the music though. There is no sound for crashing into a wall, which is definetly way more important than many other sounds it actually features. Well, all sound bad.  -Controls The game uses the arrow keys when started first. I changed it to WASD, Handbrake was on CTRL btw...  -Quality The overall quality was just really bad. I know some people will probably say i cant judge about a game after 10 minutes of playtime, but i think i can. Its clearly much worse than other 'Toy Car' games. Also, the game says 'Are you blind man?' and something else when driving backwards and then just resets your Vehicle...  -Overall Experience Bad. Seriously, i would not recommend you to get that game. Search for other games instead.",

I wont even bother to unplug the controllers to see what is causing the conflict.",
