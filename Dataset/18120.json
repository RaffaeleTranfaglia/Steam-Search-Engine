            "review_text": "Unstoppable Gorg is a unique, retro-styled approach to the Tower Defense genre and takes the whole gameplay into space. Instead of towers, you have a wide selection of satellites that you have to carefully place on one of the available orbits of the habitat that you have to defend.  You have to constantly rotate the orbits to move your satellites towards your enemy's routes, which is also the biggest difference to other TD games where you simply place your towers and wait for the enemy waves to pass by. This is a cool twist as it can cause quite a few hectic moments, but involves the player a lot more into the actual gameplay.  The story mode features a total of 21 levels and has some really cool cutscenes in between. Additionally there is a Challenge mode where you can replay all 21 levels with additional, pre-defined modifiers. Last but not least, there is also an Arcade mode, which is basically a survival mode where you fight endless waves of enemies for the highscore.  Good stuff!",

            "review_text": "This game was very enjoyable. The weapons upgrade nicely as does the difficulty. Some levels are hard because there are limited places to position defenses but it always fun, trying a different combination or placing towers as soon as possible. The retro theme is cute but not annoying. I played it through in late 2012 and will do it again in 2015. 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "This is a really nice Tower Defense game. It's pretty unique where you place your towers (actually Satellites) in concentric rings around whatever you're trying to protect. Most of the time the rings are moveable, allowing you to focus fire on an enemy by sliding the ring around, keeping your tower on them.  It's got a decent steep difficulty so it's no walk in the park.   The best part is the story. It's a campy 50's style with news feeds and breaking news, along with multiple aliens trying to wipe out earth. The production values, while cheap looking, actually are pretty cool in the detail presented.   It has deep gameplay - with many modes and difficulty levels and challenges. High replay value   Highly recommended if you like TD games.",

            "review_text": "a relatively fun spin on tower defense, but with some major flaws. worth the sale price, not full price.  --too much micromanagement is required of the individual 'orbits'. --sometimes satellites will reduce an enemy's health to almost nothing then stop shooting it and target the next one. --if you don't already know the level, it is often nearly impossible to achieve all the objectives (some people who consider themselves 'hard core' gamers may say that if the game isn't difficult, it's not worth playing, and that people who want an easy game are just whiners, but I disagree. if the level patterns have to be known ahead of time, to me that means you just have to 'cheat' against the aliens, and play the 'perfect' game by knowing exactly what they're going to do and when.)",

            "review_text": "An interesting spin on the tower defense genre; Unstoppable Gorg takes the preset 'trenches' that enemies travel through and allows you move your towers around them in orbit. Instead of places your towers and not needing to worry about them outside of upgrading or possibly selling them later for one that's more efficient, a lot of times you need to travel along the paths the enemies follow to get more damage done or set up towers in better ways based on how you can move them around in orbit. I powered through on Unstoppable difficulty in about 6 hours (with guides - the game doesn't really allow for experimentation on higher difficulties; it seems as though there's one strategy per level on hard/unstoppable that will work and nothing else).  Long story short, if you like tower defense games but are looking something a little different with some challenging later stages, I'd highly recommend picking it up.",
