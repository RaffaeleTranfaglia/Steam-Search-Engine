            "review_text": "  So far a nice and challenging puzzle with some rage-quit style in some levels.  The art is great, colorful and emotional, reminds me of the old platformers of the nintendo era all combined with a very cheerful soundtrack that only adds to the nostalgia of those games.  The gameplay is somewhat creative, you control gravity and your character to move to one point to the exit (I think I already saw one game called Gravity Duck in the Amazon Store with a similar gameplay) with different types of levels and mechanics to use the gravity and some hardcore levels for the really skilled ones.   I would recommend this game but not at this original price, maybe in a bundle or with some discount, it gets pretty challenging and just watching the level design with the music feels pretty nice but can get pretty boring after a while, just a casual game for when you have nothing else to play at the moment and you want some trading cards as well.  I give 7/10",
