This review isn't for you, it's for those who have played the previous game. I will now explain why this game is better than its' predecessor.   PROS + Gundam Tanaka. + The writing in this is just sublime. Some real gut wrenching moments. + Nagito + Good music + The visuals just look - I don't know - sharper? Maybe it's because the previous game was set in a dully-coloured highschool and this is based on the great big outdoors but it just looks.. crisp, brighter; overall. + Did I mention the characters (see previous pros) They are just as much a bunch of fancinating freaks as much as the first game, even more so perhaps.   CONS - (for completionists) The Monomi and pet mini-games drag on in the later stages of the game and become quite a grindy-chore.",

            "review_text": "I’ve played  Goodbye Despair  before, and I got so excited when they released it on Steam too. This game is really good, just like the first one,  Trigger Happy Havoc . I loved to explore around the island, raising the pets, and of course, interacting with the characters. The trials are pretty good too, and somewhat a bit more complex than the first game.   The soundtrack is amazing (the mini OST is so good, all the songs are great), just like both English and Japanese VA. I literally have no complains about this game, I loved all the characters and the ending was…  Awesome . Still, the first game is my favorite. But this sequel certainly is worth to play! Because of it I found Nekomaru Nidai, one of my favorite characters from the DGR franchise. Here’s some of his quotes that will change your life forever:    — “Listen up. The secret to being healthy is a good appetite, a good night's sleep, and a good ♥♥♥♥!” — “Eat well! Sleep Well! ♥♥♥♥ well!!” — “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the pants… IS A MARK OF SHAME TO A MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!” — “The name's NEKOMARU NIDAI!!!! I've been reborn in the rivers of hell!!!!!” — “As long as you have friends who have your back, you'll be able to clear a path to the future without giving up!”    10/10, highly recommended and worth every cent!",

            "review_text": " Having come off of DR1 and not watched the DR3 anime   Danganronpa 2 shares a lot of similarities to its prequel and I dare say, shouldn't be played before DR1. The grievances I have w/ the first game still stick, namely its unnecessary inclusion of trial minigames and dated look (though I still like the artstyle).  The killing game takes place in an island, which made it lost the claustrophobic feel I had w/ DR1. Being a sequel, DR2 also dumps a lot of information--especially towards the last two chapters--which might lose you had you not played DR1. The chemistry between the characters here are considerably less apparent than in the first killing game. So DR2 plays more with your brain than your heart, probably partly due to not having the novelty of the first game or having to continue a relatively complicated story.  That said, playing with your brain is definitely what its good at. The game is very, very creative and I loved all its cases, particularly the one in the Funhouse. It maintains a sense of mystery throughout and is constantly full of surprises, with a canon story that follows DR1 really, really well and wraps up satisfyingly towards the end. Just like the first game, I can safely say that this game is worth playing for its story alone.  DR2 is much larger in scale than DR1, is heavy on the exposition but makes a brilliant mystery game. The trials are still easy, but the story is still amazing. The last two chapters are a huge rollercoaster ride and there're a lot of references to the first game as well as cameos which got me by surprise &lt;3.",

It made me have to redo parts of the game. Now, since these glitches were in arbitrary spots, I don't think it's worth NOT buying this port. Overall, it's a great port and I recommend buying it to anyone who can't afford a Vita.  9.75/10  Pros - great story - great characters  - great gameplay  Cons - glitches (rare) - some of the characters died to early to really sympathize with them, but that's to be expected with Battle Royal type games - (not really a con, but I'd recommend playing this game in portions. The dialogue can be overwhelming if you're not in the mood to read it. )",

Books are hard for me to pay attention to, as is reading in general. But these two games have made me push through that for a story that has left me constantly on the edge of my seat.  Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, (I still hate how they alternated that title from 'Farewell Despair Academy', but what can you do...), has taken what made Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, and somehow amplified it even more. During the final class trial, I felt myself constantly leaned forward, paying attention to every detail I could. Even after having originally read summaries of the games, (at the time it was released only on PSP/Vita and I didn't want to pirate it), I still felt absolutely overwhelmed (in a good sense!) about how well this game manages to pull story off.  I honestly cannot begin to think of anything bad on this game other than it's odd sense of perversion as compared to the first one... I mean, I'm not  entirely complaining  about it, but I felt like there was a lot more perverted humour in 2 as compared to 1. I mean, for god's sake, you get the girls' panties when you max your free time interaction with them! Though I only know this from Chiaki's perspective. Chiaki best girl.  Admittedly, though, the final chapter's... 'asthetic', shall we put it, put me off and put a heavier strain than usual on my eyes. Other than that, I have absolutely zero complaints about the game(s).  Please, for the love of god, and for the sake of Hope, please, play the Danganronpa series. I can see why it got so popular a while back now.  *QUICK EDIT: I DO actually have to complain about the difficulty settings. Even when playing under the easiest settings, during things like nonstop debates you find yourself loaded with 3-5+ truth bullets. This was not at all the case in Danganronpa: THH. Even under the standard difficulty, you often only got 1 bullet, maybe 3 on some of the debates.  But that's what game guides are for, right?",

The story and world are much more open and the mysteries really seem like mysteries.  If you're here and haven't played Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, go buy that one and play it.

After finishing the first game, I bought #2 immediately because it was THAT good, and it certainly did live up to the hype. For the prologue I was worried that the characters weren't as good or as lovable as the first games, which thankfully wasn't the case. I can't say I care for the english dubs voices, but who cares since I usually play japanese games in the native language anyways, where the voices are near perfect to the characters (except for hajime, what happened there?). Only thing that was inferior to the first game was the minigame Panic Talk Attack, which is the first games guitar hero-esque minigame, since the display for the button to hit was very awkward and I felt like it was offbeat from the song too so I usually just abused concentration mode.  tl;dr I love DR1 and DR2 as much as I love Steins;Gate, which is another fantastic visual novel. Danganronpa 2 is a true sequel by all means, enhancing the first games formula.  If you guys are reading reviews after finishing both games, there are 2 anime storylines wrapping up the 'Hope's Peak Academy' story that'll no doubt be an exhilarating watch.",

But then, I realized I cruised my way through the first title, but that may not be the case in this title. IT IS SAFE TO SAY THIS GAME IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE FIRST ONE. As long as you pay attention during the investigations, the game isn't TOO difficult (although there is some conclusions in the game that no one would get without a guide imo). But one thing DR can never lose, is it's amazing story. While very farfetched, the story brings in interesting twists to get the most bored of players ingrossed in the game. If you loved the first one, this game makes a lot of improvements, but also butchered others (such as the afore mentioned Hangman's Gambit, and the fact that the PC port of the game has an almost game-breaking bug, where Bullet Time Battle/Panic Talk Action's rhythm is slightly off, meaning it is almost impossible to hit them unless you push the button far in advance).

I feel they're much better, but I still much prefer the Japanese VA. There's more emotion put in than the first, but it still just doesn't compare to the Japanese VA.  One example is a scene in the first trial. One of the characters has a bit of a psychotic moment, laughing maniacally. Watching the scene in Japanese just blew me away. The moment I watched the same scene, but in English, I felt so... underwhelmed. They just... sounded like they were trying to laugh with a sore throat. It just... I couldn't continue.  Yet again, as much as I love this game, the downfall for me is the English voices. And I believe, even if you LOVE the English VA, the Japanese VA is a MUST, even just once.  TL;DR One of my FAVOURITE games. Slightly better English VA than before. Don't like the English VA? Try Japanese. Like the English VA? Still listen to the Japanese, even if only once.

I try to play games from every genre so I can discover new game elements that I really enjoy, and therefore better determine which games I should and shouldn't buy. While I have enjoyed playing visual novel games in the past, they've never really left me feeling too impressed. My problem with the genresis that you can often just watch a walkthough of these games and get pretty much the same experience since they tend to be entirely plot driven with little, if any, gameplay. However, I quickly discovered that Danganronpa is nothing like most visual novels.  So you might be thinking, 'There's no way a game where you mostly read text can have good gameplay!.'  Well then, ALLOW ME TO CUT THROUGH THOSE WORDS.  The gameplay features exploration, searching for clues, literally shooting the words out of peoples mouths, and praying to every god to spare the lives of your favorite characters (Side Note: If you play strategy games, don't expect any help from RNGesus). The main gameplay takes place during the Trials. Here, you use your own logic to prove or disprove your classmates assertations, figure out how the clues you've gathered fit together, and determine truth behind each murder. The game also has a variety of minigames with each trial that require a mix between logic and some skill to complete. While the trial can get difficult at times, the game offers three difficulty settings for both the minigames and the trials; appealling to players that would prefer to progress through the story or, alternatively, overcome despair through an incredible challenge.  'Well, if the developer's put this much effort into the gameplay, then the story must not be that great.'  NO, THAT'S WRONG!!!  The story-telling in this game is beyond compare (except, to it's predecessor). The story in this game will put you on an emotional rollercoaster. The whole time you will be filled with suspense, heartbreak, excitement, depression, fear, anxiety, and determination. All while being caught in a tug-of-war between hope and despair.   'But a game's plot is never enough, unless the characters are also great!'  I AGREE WITH THAT!  Which is each and every character in this game are so well developed. As progress through the game and learn more to about each of them, you'll slowly find yourself emotionally attached to them. I'd say be careful not to get too attached like every other reviewer will tell you, but the reality is, you won't have choice. And honestly, befriending and becoming close to characters in this game is arguably the best part about it. It sucks when you lose your favorite character, but it makes you that much happier when they survive. And even when they do die, you come to appreciate the impact they had on you, and you become determined to keep moving forward for thier sake.  'WOW THIS GAMES SOUNDS AMAZING NOW! But how do I know that this game is really worth spending my money on?' I CAN PROVE IT WITH THIS!  You've already read this far into my review. If you didn't think you would buy this game this game, you would have ignored this review because of how long it was and looked at the really funny reviews instead. Clearly, you're too interested to not play this game.  (Side Note: If you haven't already, make sure you play the first game before this one. While I personally think this one has better gameplay and a much storyline, you'll enjoy it even more if you play through the first game. And if you have played the first game, why are you reading this review. You should playing this game right now.)  Now stop reading this and press that 'Add to Cart button'. DO IT. DO IT FOR HOPE.",

I had no idea what was going on at the beginning of the game but the more I played the more I wanted to figure out what the hell was going on. Danganronpa 2 delivers everything I wanted in a sequel. Awesome new characters, amazing story and setting, and tons of despair.",

This game is very fun. the characters can grab you a bit less than the some from the fisrt game, but the ones that sparkle really do shine. The story is odd. Interesting, but follows thematically with the first. A little rough in spots. Most Danganronpa stuff isn't 100% polished, but damn it's fun, the music is good, and the art is so lively!' Hghly reccomend, despite sight flaws I mentioned.",

            "review_text": "Updating Review: I finished game.  I still think as a game it is bad. In short, skip the game and read the manga or novels.  Story:  The story is bad until chapter 3 and then it gets interesting. It is the only good part of this game. The bad part of the story is that they try to shoe horn in everyone’s reaction. It is really annoying in the beginning because maybe 2 or 3 are relevant and the other 15 are just noise.  Game-play:  The game-play is bad. They try to hide it by adding lots of different types of game-play. However, not one single type is decent. The worst part of this game are the games itself. None of them are fun and I found myself trying to rush through them to get back to the dialog. I would have enjoyed this game more if they took them out completely.  Art style:  There are several different art styles in the game, they should have picked one for two. It is weird. The first person 3D graphics of this game are worse than the original Quake. They should have stuck to 2D.  Controls:  Saving the game is a crap shoot. You have to finish the mini game to save the game. Sometimes even when the menu is available, it won't let you save the game. This isn't a survival game, I should be able to save the game at any time. In a technical sense, this type of game is easy to write save game files, there is no excuse.  Exiting the game takes several steps; it is psychotic. I mean that in the sense that I wouldn’t want to be alone in the same room as anyone who thinks the procedure to quit this game is acceptable.",
