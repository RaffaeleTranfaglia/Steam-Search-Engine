Your hits have to be lightning fast but at the same time carefully calculated, which makes the impact of your every move immediately demonstrated. Enemies come and go in an almost rhythmical hypnotizing frenzied fashion and it is admirable how the game manages to make your fighting style look almost flamboyant with such little resources at its fingertips. One finger death punch is a must have for people who like beat' em up games as well as for those that don't, since it has a magical ability of drawing you in for just one more level.    ",

            "review_text": "One Finger Death Punch is a refreshing experience in an industry that is saturated with AAA games (well at least the notion of AAA).  The game takes a very simple idea, using very simple controls (just two buttons), builds on it and polishes it to a very fine level. Looking at the video on the Steam page may make you think that you can get through this 'simple' game with button-mashing. However, you're very wrong if you think that way. The game warns you from the very start that button-mashing will get you nowhere. One Finger Death Punch builds on its simple controls to create a gameplay system that gets positively sophisticated.  You will face different enemy types that require different combinations of clicks/keypresses to defeat. While the fundamental gameplay mechanic (left click/arrow to hit left, right click/arrow to hit right) stays the same, the different combinations add up to make up for a fascinating gameplay experience. Let's just put it this way - the moment you think that you've got the game figured out, it throws you a new enemy type, a different level mode that challenge you to sharpen the very skills you thought you've mastered.  There is an RPG element to this game. As you progress through the game, skills become unlocked. These skills add on to your overall gameplay experience and help you manage as the pace of the game gets faster and faster.   One thing that surprised me about this game is how the voice acting (well, if we can refer to the sensei as that) adds to the game. It gives the whole game (each and every stage) some sort of dramatic sense with the sensei explaining to you the game mechanics.  I find myself coming again and again to clear earlier stages, trying to outdo myself each time. I would love to see this game on a handheld (e.g. PlayStation Vita).   I definitely recommend this game. It's amazing how a well-polished gameplay system can bring the fun that we've been seeking (perhaps in the wrong places)  ",

Instead I ended up playing for 40 minutes, having a blast and actually feel like I had a good grasp of this, especially considering I do not enjoy combo brawlers. The simple controls makes this very easy to get into, and a steady difficulty curve makes you keep progressing. The first couple of boss battles also makes you want to play just one more round as it's never an impossible task to win. Getting into the weapon upgrades is where it really moves from a fun 2 minute distraction into a pretty cool game. The only bad thing is not being able to use the mouse for the menus if you started the game with a joypad, but I'm sure it'll be fixed in a patch.",

            "review_text": "If someone told me I could log 9 hours of a rhythm game without getting bored, I'd probably laugh at them.  One Finger Death Punch (OFDP) is a simplistic fighting/rhythm game made by Silver Dollar Games, not the most reputable or consistent of studios. It features stickmen engaging in kung-fu, to about 5 different songs, and 5 different backdrops. The 'gimmick,' if you will, of OFDP is that it is played with just two buttons, M1 and M2 (X and B on a controller). Simply put, M1 is left attack and M2 is right attack. Very simple controls.  It is surprising how addictive this game is. With a concept so simple, you would think it would be repetitive, and boring after the novelty of it wears off. The thing is, OFDP manages to use this concept so incredibly  right  that you can just keep going and going and going...  It is responsive as hell. The music is catchy, and while there isn't much of a variety of music, it never seems to matter. The animations are as good as stickmen-kung-fu is going to get. The announcer is the perfect B-list kung-fu announcer. Legitimately the only thing this game can't pull off is the transistion/loading screen. It's horrible.  Hell, there's even a  lightsaber  light-sword round.  For $5 this game might seem like a bit of an expensive gimmick. It's not. For $2.50 this game might seem interesting but repetitive. It's not the latter. For $1.25 you might as well try it.  This game is definitely worth your time, even if you just play it for an hour and see what I'm making such a fuss about.  4/5.",

There legit are only 2 keys in the whole game, only 2 and thats left and right (or whatever you configured them to be). However, do not be fooled by only 2 keys as the game is quite complex, especially as you get later on. If you mess up your reaction and timing for the different sides with your 2 keys, you may find yourself dead very fast. You basically only have to beat up enemies coming from the left and right along with different variations of that. But the enemies become more and more complex with certain boss like ones too. There are different level types as well, including regular, speed, break objects, etc. Along with the different level types, there are also a plethora of levels available that will keep you frustrated for quite some time later on. The game really does a good job in almost every aspect. The music, narration, progression, and every fits and works very well together. Don't forget that even the price for this game is very reasonable.  I'd recommend this game to anybody. I mean, for a game this cheap and this good, why not get it?

I've gotta make this review short so that I can get back to playing but even at $4.99 this game is worth every penny. Passing this one on sale is not a good idea. Why you ask?

            "review_text": "This is my favorite 2 button fighting game and here's my reasons, some legit, some shallow, some might even be a bit nonsensical why:  1. Art style - I know some people hate the whole stick figure thing but I think with the backgrounds and fighting styles and the intense speed at which enemies are coming at you the last thing I'm focused on is what my character looks like. I remember way back when a little flash series by the name of Xiao Xiao. That stick figure series was awesome and if only for nostalgia purposes this game brings back memories.   2. The developers didn't waste time figuring out how the character looks instead they developed what matters most, which is the fighting style so at the end of the day when you're playing a 2 button fighting game you're seeing a lot of fighting variations for a 2 button fighting game.   3. You don't have to button mash or press a series of complex controller commands to do the really fun moves. This happens automatically and I don't get callouses or slight carpal tunnel from twitchy thumb movements.   4. The different environments are incredibly detailed. When I'm fighting in the Light Sword round for the 5th time trying to get a perfect I never get tired of cutting up enemies or seeing the burst of flames around me in the middle of the match. Also to add to that the various skills that you gain throughout the game and the slightly challenging boss battles.   5. The game adjusts attacker speed depending on how well you're doing. So when you start to suck the game will dial back the speed so there's less of those rage quit moments and you can focus on having fun.  There's no cheap story thrown into why you're fighting hoards of guys but you really don't need one. The only down side I can see is that cheezy Asian voice announcing or giving you tips every now and then but that I can ignore because the rest of the game is so good.  I also want to say, I played this game DRM Free for a while before it got its Steam release. And I think if this game is something I'd play without it being on Steam it must be pretty good.",

I'm unhappy with the game, because for it to truly help gamers, they need an option where a person can have full range of the entire screen, and click right and left. While the limited range of attack has it's purpose. It limits player who need intensity training. I'm dissatisfied with the game due to 3 reasons. 1st you can't set the speed of attack manually, even at later levels. 2nd you can't set the range of attack. 3rd. A lot of the items impede speed training instead of promoting it, for instance the weapons take 1 click to pick up, and 2nd click to strike, randomly dropped weapons then become a hindrance, and can cause a miss due to user not clicking twice or miss due to clicking twice. Weapon pickup system needs to be perfected especially since they have 0 tolerance for hit or miss. It's also crazy that you can get hit 4 times and miss 0 and get more reward. Missing an opponent is worse than being hit by one and frustrating when playing. No reward for killing `99 ppl just consequence for missing one guy then killing him again with the second click. The miss system seems to me to be flawed.  'Oh Master Yin punched the air, he loses a point, oh he punched again and killed a man, he gets a point. '  I do realize the sys is in place to prevent spammers, though more distance or double click instead of single click miss allowances are needed. Bare min just allowing a no enemy weapons option would make me happy. Too many random weapon frustrations when playing. I've enjoyed it though it can be more enjoyable with more options. It should be ez for creators to add more fun options if the creators still exist. Either way it’s a fun cheap game.  ",

(PS: I recommend a gamepad, though it's not required - it is a two-button game, after all.)  Edit: The only flaw I've seen in it so far is that it doesn't update Achievements in real-time. I'd been playing it and figured maybe it didn't have achievements, only to find when I closed the game that all thirty-seven achievements I'd obtained just poured in at once. Not a big deal by any means, but I wasn't expecting to have every achievement I've got so far all have the same timestamp. :-p",

They have made a game of simplicity and pure fun. From the beginning to the end this game delivers.  From the moment you start up the game one thing is very clear. This game has a personality, and that personality is awesome. With an epic soundtrack that would make any Shaw Bros. kung fu movie of old jealous you are emersed in a journey through intense kung fu battles all via your simple stick figure avatar.   The controls are just as simple as the graphics, and there is a beauty in that regards that many big budget games seem to overlook. You don't need fancy GPU instensive graphics to have fun. You just need fun to have fun. From silly death animations to a variety of incredible levels involving light swords, nunchucks, thrunderstorms, and retro film themes you are a kung fu master, and often I found myself just laughing and smiling through countless sessions and levels.  In addition to this fast paced action world of wonder the devs have even taken it one step further by adding numerous levels and game modes for you to enjoy in increasing difficulty. Not only is the game immensely fun, but it's also challenging and hard as you progress. The depth and skill curve is accurately balanced as the game adjusts to your speed of difficulty finding that perfect calibration to your skill level.  There is no doubt that this is a special title. It's not often that you get to experience a game like this, but even in your last moments of hardship in the game the devs are right there sending you a sword from the heavens as if to say 'We know you might not make it, but take this.. we believe in you'. I haven't had this kind of experience playing a game in a long long time. It's nothing but pure joy, and a title I would recommend to anyone looking for a game that is fun, challenging, funny, epic, and that has a lot of heart.

            "review_text": " One Finger Death Punch  is a game that harkens back to the days of 2D animated stick figure fights like the  Xiao Xiao  series. It's an incredibly fun experience that puts you in control of the main character of one of those flash animations - the number of enemies means nothing, and you tear through them as a nigh-untouchable god of martial arts.  And yet playing as this rampaging deity requires precisely two buttons. There are no complex combinations to memorise, just 'left' or 'right'; based on the situation, you might deflect a spear, throw a bomb or slam someone into a table (breaking the table in the process, obviously). How well you do depends entirely on your timing and reactions.  The game has two main modes.  Survival Mode  has you face an infinite onslaught of enemies until you run out of health, and there are three flavours of this mode to unlock.  Story Mode  consists of a network of short stages that eventually lead to a 'final stage', and has three difficulty levels that affect the game speed and the number of enemies in each stage.   Story Mode  is the more varied of the two (despite its name, there isn't any actual story - feel free to imagine your own). There are a good variety of stages - examples are the Smash Round, which has a quota on objects destroyed rather that opponents killed, and the Multi Round, which is much shorter than the others, but has to be completed several times in a row at increasing speed.  Based on how you perform in Story Mode, the game will speed up or slow down to match your skill, though there is a minimum speed associated with each difficulty level. Clear a stage too easily, and the game will increase its pace on the next one to ensure a challenge. This sort of feedback allows for both the casual and hardcore player to enjoy the game. Failing a stage will make the next attempt a bit easier, and for some, pushing the game to higher and higher multipliers is enjoyment in itself.  Scattered across Story Mode are stages that, once beaten, unlock skills for the player to equip. Skills have a killcount that, once reached, will trigger the activation. The skills, too, are diverse - one causes weapons to drop, allowing you to pick them up and use them, another lets you throw the next weapon you pick up, and a third clears the entire screen of enemies. Crucially, you can equip several skills at once, allowing the player to mix and match skills they feel would work well together (for instance, the first two mentioned). There are some stages where skills are disabled, but most allow them. They are also available for use in Survival Mode (but must be unlocked via Story Mode first).  The only issue that I currently have with the game is that it will occasionally go into slow motion to show a particularly vicious punch, which can throw off your timing somewhat. While I do appreciate that it's done for spectacle (and rightly so), it has cost me a life on several occasions. An option to disable these would be nice.  Apart from that (small and pedantic) matter, I can wholeheartedly recommend picking up  One Finger Death Punch . It's a great game for passing small amounts of time (I get a bit burnt out playing it for too long, your experience may differ), and adjusts well to your skill level. The graphics, simple as they are, do not detract from the gameplay, which is immensely fun, and makes you feel like the most powerful stick figure of them all.",

            "review_text": "One Finger Death Punch is a rhythm based action game where the player controls a kung fu fighter who is being attacked by a constant stream of enemies from both sides of the screen. You can't move, so your only controls are attack left and attack right. Its a simple concept but it takes skill to master, because if you time an attack incorrectly it will leave you open to being hit. There is no story, so its entirely focused on gameplay.  Some enemies take multiple hits to kill, you can collect weapons which temporarily extend your attack range and there are various skills to unlock which let you use weapons for longer or slow enemies down. However, a large number of levels don't let you use any skills, which is kind of annoying, because those were the levels I had most difficulty in completing, but there is no possibility of changing tactics.  My favourite part of the game is when the ball of death is on the screen. It can one hit kill any enemy, but if you miss the ball it will bounce off screen, so its fun trying to juggle the ball between enemies for as long as possible.  It took me 4 hours to finish the campaign mode, although its possible to do it much quicker. The level select screen confused me for a while, I thought I needed to beat every level, but that's not the case. The path branches at several places and you only need to follow one path, so you can skip alot of levels. You don't really miss anything because most of the levels are pretty much identical. There are also a few variations of an endless mode where you can chase a high score.  Its probably a good thing that the game is short, because I physically couldn't play it for longer than about 60 minutes at a time before my hand/arm started hurting due to the constant clicking. The speed round is a good example - kill 90 enemies in 55 seconds, some enemies take more than 1 hit = probably more than 2 clicks every second. However, the purchase price is extremely low, so its still easily value for money.  I also feel like its almost more enjoyable to watch someone else play the game, because you can enjoy the animations better. I realised after a while that my attention was focused far more on the HUD below my character which tells you which direction to attack and how many times to attack, and I wasn't really watching the action. I couldn't tell you whether my character was kicking, punching or stabbing. This problem is fixed in blind survival mode, which removes most of the HUD, so I wish the whole game was like that.  Ultimately, One Finger Death Punch is a fun time waster that will entertain you for a few days, but I wouldn't say its an essential purchase.",

Your character stands in the center of the screen, and to your left and right is shown your characters reach. When an enemy walks into this zone, you click the corresponding mouse button and unleash kung-fu justice. It sounds astoundingly stupid and simple, but the entire experience comes together to make it great.  It's surprisingly skill based, since you can't button mash. Button mashing = Death. Every click corresponds to a move from your character. Most enemies take one hit, some take more, some dodge your attacks and come up on the other side of you. As you play each levels you get a sort of flow going, in fact in many ways it's kind of like a rythym game, but instead of music you are punching to the rhythm of enemies as they approach you. And you're not just punching, you're kicking, shooting bows, throwing knives, breaking bones, splattering eyeballs, tossing bombs, even juggling a spiked ball of death. Just the combat itself varies from the multitude of weapons and enemy types. But then there are special stages with different objectives, bosses, light sabers. The game adjusts itself to your skill level as well, speeding up or slowing down enemies as you complete levels. It's crazy just how much fun this game is.

Cheap as in 'definitely worth the money, even when it's not on sale'.  The basic premise, in case you still don't know, is to just kung fu like crazy left and right. And that's the only thing you can do -- hit left or hit right. This extremely simple gameplay makes it a very casual game -- anyone can just pick it up and play it.  However, it's not easy to master. by any means. The difficulty ramps up as you progress through the 'campaign' levels or run a survival game, as enemies get faster and you get more enemies requiring multiple hits to kill.  At any time, the game keeps you informed what you need to do: enemies show you the left/right combos required to kill them, adjusting as you actually perform these hits. The game shows you when a hit on the left or right will actually hit something. So again, very casual, not really anything to learn.  However, at the same time the game feel snappy and responsive, and every hit counts. Senseless button mashing won't get you anywhere, you need to hit the button when it counts.  The game might also look simple, but the graphics are actually quite nice. The stickmen are well animated, and you get the occasional special kill-scene which not only provides a closeup view on some bloody mess you are creating, but also gives you a short break before the frenzy continues. And frenzy it is -- there's little time to admire animations or backgrounds as enemies are rushing in left and right.  Adding to this is a speaker giving you the tutorial hints during the early 'campaign' levels -- and again, this isn't just some random guy, they got a very nice dialect one would expect from an american kung fu movie.  There are minor technical details I don't like, such as having a launcher window -- but those are minor. It's hard to find anythng to actually complain about on the gameplay... ",

Both games even have a built in system where the game speed picks up as you do better. This game is actually harder, however, since Pac Man will quickly slow down time to like 0.1x game speed when you are about to run into an enemy, while in this game, enemies can come flying from left or right and the game wont give two ♥♥♥♥♥ unless you're at 1 health remaining.  TL;DR: Very satisfying for its price, offering hours of modern innovative gameplay never really seen before in this manner in a basic easy-to-use style and the simplicity of decades ago.",

There is not really much to this game aside from being awesome. You click with your left or right mousebutton and you attack left or right, that's the entire game. It is a lot more interesting than it sounds though, because not only is it already hard as hell using only two buttons, but there a a lot of modes throughout the campaign that bring a lot of variation. There is rounds where you fight huge waves of enemies, rounds that get faster and faster, boss rounds, rounds with a nunchuck or a lightsword permanently equipped and more. There is also a bunch of skills to be gotten that kind of let you individualise your playstyle. I have to say though, these skills are what kept me sidetracking, as soon as I had them all I had no interest in completing all levels and just wanted to get to the end. This is why I do not reccomend to play this game in to long play-sessions, it just loses its fun at some point. Also: while this seems like the standard internet flashgame with stick figures it is not. the combat is actually rather complex and the campaign is a lengthy one. All in all it is a definitive thumb up for those who lick stick man fighting, those who like challenging games with simple controls and those that think that the screenshots and trailers look awesome enough but are worried the game wont hold up.",

Sure, the battles get a bit repetitive after a while, but in small amounts I keep on coming back to this game. Kudos to the developers for managing to get as many battle modes out of a simple two-button game as they have. Make no mistake though, in it's core this is a two-button reaction game in its core. But oh boy have they managed to make it interesting!  The audiovisual feel of the game fits perfectly into the theme of old martial arts movies and the combat animation is really fluid and enjoyable to watch - when you're not too focused to miss them while trying to time your actions just right.",

            "review_text": "This game is immensely satisfying...You'd think that, with just two buttons, the game would be boring, right? You wouldn't be more wrong. This game does a lot with just two buttons. You can impale dudes on weapons, kick bouncy spiked balls across the screen, and get into rapid-fire melee clashes against the 'brawler' enemies. However, this game is pretty strict about timing: you cannot button mash or mistime an attack, or you will be punished. You must time your attacks properly in order to survive...Once you get the hang of the system, it's very enjoyable to see dudes get their faces smashed in. You also earn skills that you can change between levels, and you earn medals for completing the level with no misses/no damage. Yes, they are separate, and you'll be thankful for that--trying to perfect each level is tricky, and I'm not even out of the first difficulty yet!  The art style is very striking: at first it looks like a kung-fu flick, but the characters are actually all stick figures. If you've ever watched Xiao Xiao's stick figure animations, you'll probably know what to expect. I don't mind the art style being 'simplistic' or 'low budget' at all, this becomes a nonissue once the level begins and you're punching dudes into fruit carts. The music is also appropriate, sounding like something you'd hear out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee flick. The music really gets your blood pumping and into that 'zone' where, despite all the craziness going on, you're one with the game and feel like you can do anything.  That being said...My biggest criticism against this game is the sensory overload it brings. Aside from all the enemies charging in, there are super attacks that occur randomly, combat notifications that appear as you rack up more combos, and the skills that activate once you meet certain requirements. It can be a little overwhelming, especially as the game speeds up. Thankfully, the game's speed is adjustable: if you die on a level, the game speed is reduced greatly. That being said, even at ~120% speed, the game can reach that point where it's too fast to even think about what you're doing, or try to do. I have lost many perfect runs because of misreading what was going on--the game really penalizes you when you miss, and it really teaches you be controlled in your button presses.   Another criticism I have is the lack of video options: I play in a window most of the time, and it's juuuust big enough to go beyond the edges of my monitor, and shrinking the game sizes changes the play area but not the window size. I wish there were different resolution settings we could pick from, or be able to resize the window manually.  Quirks aside, this game is probably the best five bucks (halve that if you got this during the Summer Sale) you'll ever spend. It's over the top and flashy without being some big-budget beat'em up like Metal Gear Rising, yet it has easy to understand controls and some satisfying mechanics. You haven't lived until you get into a light sa--excuse me, light sword fight, carve up a ton of dudes while explosions erupt in the background, then you get onto a slow-motion duel against a miniboss before finishing him off and seeing that huge 'PERFECT' appear onscreen. Long story short, buy this game if you enjoy the zany combat or want something new in your beat 'em up library. You won't regret it.",

It doesn't shine in art-design, story or presentation but it's the best of it's kind in the gameplay department. In ONE FINGER DEATH PUNCH you only have 2 buttons: the left and the right mouse button. This game has more gameplay with just 2 buttons than most of the AAA titles have. You play a white stickman that has to battle it out with tons of other colored stickmen. He can punch left and he can punch rigtht. Nothing more nothing less. Your foes begin to charge you and you hit them with your fists. That's the gameplay in a nutshell. But there are tons of mechanics that make this type of gameplay interesting and not tedious at all. You can pick up weapons, use skills, throw bombs, and you can do tons of other stuff that help you out. Additionally there are foes that dodge your attacks or need multiple hits to die. Those mechanics make the game feel more fun and challanging. There are even bonus rounds that keep the game fresh. And again all that with only 2 buttons. Everybody who says that this game has not much to offer don't understand the fundamentals of gamedesign or haven't played long enough to understand this wonderful game. This is one of the best games I've ever played in rescent time and the best 5bucks I've spend in my whole life. Go get this beauty.",

You get perks by beating levels, and the first difficulty available is alright. The game ramps itself up on Master, though, and the various blind modes test your reflexes like nobody's business. Normally you have colored bars under the enemies that tell you the button you have to push for each point of health. Blind mode you only have the color of the enemy (patterns vary by enemy color.) And then there's color-blind blind mode...no colors, no HP bars.   Put on some hype music for best effect. Priced well for what you get, great for fast-paced, bite-sized action. Only complaint is the relatively limited amount of fighting styles (really just determines your animations).",

There's a lot of cool weapons and animations to fit them, and the game gets quite difficult by the time special units come , some require 2+ hits , some can dodge to the other side , others will throw a spear at you , and some require a combination of buttons in a epic 1v1 duel while everyone just stares , if you miss a single button you will get prone to hit which won't net you perfect nor platinum medal and we know how important that is for our ego. There's bows , bombs , throwing daggers, spears, light sabers, spiky balls, did i mention light sabers? what are you waiting for buy this game.",

While I wish they could have added just a tiny bit more, but I really cannot complain. They have a fantastic system that increases or decreases your speed depending on how well you have been doing. It shouldn’t get to hard or to easy, which is a very hard balance to find. They have many styles of how to test your skills. They will give you multiple ways to identify how to excel in combat, but they have certain “rounds” that take away a way to identify how to fight. This prevents players from being to reliant on how a specific way to figure out how to fight. It is a good quick brain tester. ",

Rounds are bite-sized enough that there's no frustration in not reaching your goal (I found myself restarting a level a dozen times to get a perfect round without realizing).  The only two gripes I have are the music and controller support. For the music, the tracks are alright, but after watching the linked videos on the steam store page, I feel like more upbeat music fits the game better.

You're in the middle and other fighters come at you from the left and right. As they come into your range you click either the left or right mouse button to attack in that direction.

It hits a pretty damn perfect balance in difficulty; it's hard without being overwhelming, and the difficulty adjusts to your skill level as you play, though it never goes below a certain point. Of course, it doesn't hurt that when it clicks, the game makes you look and feel like an absolute badass in a way no other game I can remember has done, so that in and of itself is incentive to keep playing and get better.  The game assets are full of stick figures, generic images, bad accents, and royalty-free music, but that simplicity actually works for the game, rather than against it. If assets were more complex, it wouldn't be as easy to keep track of everything once the pace accelerates to lightning speed, and the brief animations help to emphasize the brutality and precision of the characters' movements. The game announcer can get a bit irritating at times, but if it really starts getting on your nerves, there's always an option to turn it off (at the main menu...).  If you absolutely can't stand fast-paced games, this won't change your mind, but otherwise, the low barrier of entry means you have very few reasons not to give One Finger Death Punch a shot.",

There are two modes - levels and survival. Levels is sort of like a campaign mode, where you complete different missions (kill a certain number of enemies, boss fights, timed levels, etc.) to unlock skills. These skills can then be used in the survival mode. Survival mode you try to last as long as possible.  There are three difficulty levels for each mode. For levels you have student, master and grandmaster. You unlock one by beating the prior. For survival, you have to get to 500 kills in the previous mode. Survival is a bit more interesting. The three difficulty levels are survival, blind survival and no luca no. Survival is the normal mode. Blind survival takes away all life/hit indicators on the enemies and you have to go by memory or reaction to defeat them. No luca no is a special mode that I won't spoil =].

I'm having a hard time explaining the deep strategy...  OK here's an example: the range is not close quarters you can't move normally but when you attack you close the distance... so do you wait for them to get close to line up a series of blows or do you close and attack so that you get away from an enemy you don't want to tackle?  Here's another: later on you run into enemies that take the first hit and dodge to the opposite side of you... do you continue to attack the dodged enemy or do you attack the enemy that WAS behind him.  What starts as a simple 3 rule 2 button game becomes a deep, tactical brawler, where due to its nature you feel like you're achieving from the word go, winning by mashing is one thing, beating by skill is another.",

Weapons can be picked up and used for a while but once the level starts it doesnt stop so most of the gameplay is indeed punching.  The action itself is something I find I tend to miss on the more frenetic levels as the eyes tunnel vision onto the bars that indicate left or right. Thankfully there are breaks while the game gives a slomo kill animation as you slice the face off an enemy or impale them on a discarded spear.  Other things to add to the game are levels where you can only use a set weapon like nunchaku or throwing daggers or a visual change like a sepia/b&amp;w old movie look. I'm avoiding monotony as a word as you could easily say that describes the game but with the variation of levels and a good selection of unlockable skills this does a very good job of being anything but monotonous.  And as far as levels go, there are a lot on the map screen and then you realise you can zoom the map out to see more, then zoom again to see even more.  Unless you're playing survival then each level is quite short which makes this a very good option as a filler game as well as one you could sit down and slaughter your way through for an hour or so.  Well worth the £4",

Your a stick figure kung-fu dude who is faced against waves of other stick figures coming from both sides, you have to fight them off by clicking one of two mouse buttons depending on the side there on.  Sound simple right? Well it is, but that doesn't mean its easy. Because the game pentalizes you for missing, and even 1 miss drops from platinum to gold. So you have to be careful. No button mashing in this game!  There are also different enemies who take multiple hits and the such, as well as several different types of modes in the 'adventure' type mode, which has quite a few levels.  It also includes different skills to mix things up as well.   Overall its really just a lot of fun, and very addicting to try and get the best score and not miss. And definately has challange to it.

            "review_text": "I found this game through Markiplier on youtube. I thought 'Sure looks fun. I'll give it a shot.' Now I'm hooked.  This game is so simple but that is what makes it great. You don't have to worry about managing items and the skills are simple toggle on/off unlockables that you hunt down as you progress across the map. There's no level system to worry about. All you really need to focus on in this game is what is coming at you and where from.   As you progress you'll come across more complex enemy types and modes. Enemies will begin to dodge your attacks and game modes will offer new challenges. Skills are awesome and simple. You can equip three at any time and you get them by completing certain levels that are marked with the image of the skill they reward. There's my favorite, the deep impact skill which allows you to wipe out all the enemies on screen with a single blow after a certain amount of kills. There are skills that allow you to use weapons for longer than normal periods of time, which is great because weapons increase your range of attack slightly. There are skills that give you extra throwables when you pick one up, throwables are insta kills on any enemy. and there are plenty of other skills that when you put together properly, can really give you an edge.  You have to be careful though. If you play too aggresively you can miss a striker which will leave you open. It gets difficult not to get into this game especially if you have your favorite music playing in the background. But the key is to take care and watch what is coming at you. If you take your time you can get somewhat strategic and deal with tougher enemies faster.  For only five dollars this game is a steal and if you like a challenge the higher difficulties will scratch that itch.",

            "review_text": "It is funny how a game can manage to use only 2 mouse buttons throughout its entire gameplay and still able to keep me addicted and entertained. And here it is. One Finger Death Punch.  Don't let the silly title or the simplistic graphics throw you off. The premise of the game is simple, use either the left or right mouse button to attack enemies as they come at you from the left or right. While it sounds simple enough, it can be a real test of mental endurance and finger dexterity when the speed increases and the action goes super frenetic. If you are dedicated enough to try to aim for perfect scores, you are in for a good challenge. This is a game that is absolutely easy to learn yet hard to master.  At its core, it kindda feels like those dance rhythm games. The graphics, while simple looking is brilliantly animated. Even though you're controlling a stick figure, it can be very entertaining to see him do all sorts of crazy martial arts moves like a badass. Occasionally, the game goes all 'Matrix mode' and you can kill enemies slow-mo style, sometimes even a random X-ray mode for that added bone crunching goodness.   The levels varies alot too. Some will have you only bare-fist punching, some will make use of a light-sab...erm...light-sword, others will give you just 1 life and expect you to defend against hordes of dagger throwing foes. The different variations really mix it up to ensure you'll never get bored. Unlock the main game level to open up survival mode, blind survival mode and even a really cute 'No Luca No' mode. I'll leave it up to you to find out what that does.  Music is an eclectic mix of epic sounding orchestral themes, and pulse pounding techno hip hop. The sound quality is rather muffled however but that does not hurt the game very much. You would probably be too busy fending off enemies to focus very much on it anyway. Narration is provided by a stereotypical 'Shifu' voice who does the job admirably.  Overall Rating: 9.0 / 10 They say the best games are the ones that are easy to pick up and play while keeping you entertained. No matter what your skill level, this game will make you feel like a total badass. It distills the best essences of a fighting game and breaks it down to its basics and ultimately delivers a fantastic experience. It certainly doesn't hurt that its pretty cheap too. Definitely a must buy. 2 Thumbs Up!",

One Finger Death Punch is a brawler that plays almost like a violent DDR game where enemies will advance towards you at speeds of no less that 100% (whatever that speed actually is). You can fend them off by using the left and right mouse buttons to attack your foes once they reach a certain distance from you. You can pick up melee weapons if you want to extend your reach, ranged weapons if you just want to say 'Screw it' and reign death on your enemies, and you can use special powers that you unlock over the course of the game such as freezing your enemies, Iron-Man ground-pounding them into submission, and more. For $5, this game will keep you going for a while. Survival modes, levels in the triple digits, and the different ways they push the sinple two-button fighter concept keep the game fresh (though you may only play it for an hour at a time). In short: Go play it. Now.",

If you need a game to hone your reaction time, this is a nice starter.  As for any issues with it, I have only one complaint: some of the powers you earn by playing story mode could explain what they do a bit better so that I don't have to test them myself.

CONS:  Very repetitive, full-screen mode is a bit aliased instead of looking sharp, your mouse hand may cramp up after a half hour or so, there ARE keyboard controls but they're hidden in a menu which you can only bring up by pausing a game in progress so it's hard to know they're there.",

This makes the game never to easy, wich is far to common in these kind of games.  I especially likes the time trials. They are (in my humble opinion) a lot harder. You may not instantly die like in the dagger rounds, but you have to get a good rhythm into you punches, to beat the timer.  The only issue i have had so far is the map. It is hard to find a specific skill I want to have on the map, so it took me a while to find the one I was looking for.  This is perhaps my favorite 5 Minute a day game in my library.",

This game has a difficulty curve combined with a skill ceiling that will have you sitting on your ♥♥♥ for hours at a time. Even if you don't have the time to go on a full journey of many stages, they are short enough that you can complete a few in a short amount of time. Don't let that sound like a critisim, the levels seem short, but combine the skill it takes and you have a epic experience made sweetend by the victory. This game has replayability and two modes, leaving you to fight your way through increasing waves and difficult enemies in a variety of game modes. It can get a bit repeative but still a good way to blow off Steam and feel epic. In short, a fun little beat'em with cool action and skill that will keep you entertained.",

Everything from fast paced techno to epic sword fighting music.  -No stupid multiple button combinations to memorize. All you need is your two mouse buttons. (Or whatever two keys you pefer)   - Frantic Button mashing is actually frowned upon and can make you lose a fight.   -Lengthy campaign mode that gives a genuine fair challenge. You don't feel like you're being thrown into the thick of it without some practice.   -Nice variety of modes and enemies to change things up and keep the fighting from becoming stale.   -Realistic fighting styles. (With some fantasy elements thrown in.)   -Great replayability of previously beaten levels. It's good to earn a platinum medal, but it's even better to do so and earn a perfect score. (Meaning no missed attacks or hits taken.)   - You could call this a 'lunch-break' type of game as well. It's something you can pick up and play when you need a break from work to recharge.   Cons:   None.   Overall, if you're looking for some quality entertainment that doesn't break the bank. Try One Finger Death Punch. It is one of the most addicting and enjoyable fighting games I've played. You get a generous amount of content for five dollars here and then some. It's a good game that will appeal to hardcore and casual audiences alike.   10/10 would slice open a stick figure's head in glorious fashion again.",

In case you didn't watch any trailers, this game is all about fast paced combat. Not something like Street Fighter or Tekken, instead it's all about two little buttons and whilst that might not sound difficult to master it can be tricky at the very least.  You control a stick figure character that is able to utilize five kung-fu styles &amp; the odd weapon or two. Giving you the ablilty to lay waste to hundreds of enemies in the most spectacular of fashions.  The game features around 250 stages and 3 difficulty levels known as Student, Master &amp; Grand Master. I should also mention that there are quite a variety of enemies that require some rather tricky combo's to get past.  You have to clear each difficulty to unlock the next, but luckily you won't be fighting empty handed for the majority of the time as there are various weapons in this game such as swords, throwing knives, long bows, spears, bombs and death balls. All of which have very limited use of course.  The game also features 21 skills which range from extended striking area to slowing down enemies for a period of time. Skills are activated by achieving the number of kills required for them. Most of these skills are locked when you start but they are unlockable by beating the required stages for the various skills. You can equip up to three on your first play through.  There are also various survival modes that will truly test your skills to see how many kills you can rack up without dying. I really don't want to spoil survivor mode since it was quite a nice surprise when I started it.  This game is something unique, something that I quite enjoyed and really is worth playing for a bit.",

It's a rhythm based fighting game where you have control of two buttons which kill whatever enemy is to the right or left of you respecitvely. Enemies come at you in waves and spread apart which make the rhythm rhythmic and you have to carefully time when and how you make your hits to make it through the levels. Difficulty is adaptave, the better you do, the faster things get, the worse you do, the slower things get.  There are power ups which change the gameplay a little. I felt a little slighted here since there is a 'best' combination of power ups to set up before a match. The ones which allow you to survive more hits are much better than the others.  You can beat things down in campaign mode of three difficulties and in a endless mode with increasing difficulty as time progresses.  The execution is fast-paced, simple, and fun. In all...it's a simple game which performs what it tries to do brilliantly and without adding any fat or nusance to the execution.",

A casual playthrough of the levels will be engaging, but not ragey, and an achievement go-getter will have a delightfully challenging time. I have only one real complaint: the speed mechanic. Adaptable difficulty is a good concept I've seen add a lot to games, but Speed ups and downs don't happen during the level. They happen in between levels. The result is that earlier levels can be ragingly difficult if approached from later levels, which should never be, and once you understand the system it can be pretty easily juked down to the lowest speed setting.

I'd add 'Highly addicting and you feel like Neo.'  Easy learning curve (and funny narator that shows you the two buttons you have to push in order to play it) :)) - you just punch left and right with a nice array of martial arts postures and do fatalities, combos, slow-motion combos. You can unlock skills to improve character abilities (special temporary powers or range increase etc.)  You have campaign mode and survival mode. (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of levels and the needed variety mix within them - boss levels, speed levels, mob runs)  It deserves its price and then some!  I ended up staying from 5.00AM until 11.00 AM to try to finish it. (didn't succeed; ended up playing two more hours the following night); managed to unlock the 2nd survival mode in one try but not the 3rd.  ",

It is the flashiest, most stylist Kung-Fu themed QTE I have ever had the pleasure to play. The game looks like a button masher but you need to have good reflexes and remember enemy patterns in order to do well. I'm not sure how great the normal campaign is near the end (I've gotten pretty far I think but never finished it), but the survival mode is worth it alone. My rounds have lasted anywhere from five minutes to over half an hour.  I'm just not quite sure how to properly explain this game while doing it justice. The music is fantastic, the game is simple, it's incredibly easy to learn and incredibly difficult to master, has a lot of variety in the campaign, has a fantastic survival mode, and flashy juicy stick figure Kung-Fu gory goodness.  Pick this game up. It's amazing. Just make sure to avoid the F2P Ad-filled Micro-transaction-ridden mobile version. That game broke my heart :(",
