            "review_text": "Very good, but rather short JRPG. The music in this little gem is really great. One of the best soundtracks I've listened to in a while. The graphics are rather standard for an RPG Maker game, but some effects and a distinct set of tiles for each location creates a pleasant to look at game. The story isn't very deep, but it's well written and gives enough background.  The gameplay isn't without flaws though. There's the odd auto leveling of prices for inns and items. I guess it's meant to balance out the higher rewards you get from stronger enemies, but it just feels wrong. The other thing that is worth mentioning is the 'streamlined' equipment. There's only one accessory slot to equip something and the selection of equipable items only covers protection against the various status effects, more HP or MP and a small boost to attack. There's only one special accessory that you can get for completing a side quest. At least two slots and a bit more variation could have helped here.  The enemy variety and the boss fights are again very good. You won't find any 'recolored' enemies in this game. Each area/dungeon has its unique set of enemies and you will need a bit of strategy to get past them. The overall difficulty isn't very high, but it's not a casual game either. Make sure you save up enough potions before you enter any boss fights.  The game is only 15 hours long (including all side quests) and there's not that much to discover outside of the main path. A good amount of that time is grinding for levels as the lack of equipment forces you to make up for it by leveling your characters. It doesn't get too boring though even if the dungeons don't hold any surprises. You hunt for a switch or two and figure out which paths are dead ends. That's pretty much it. Still the game doesn't feel boring because the dungeons don't drag on too much and as mentioned above each location feels unique.  Overall it's a very solid JRPG with a bit wonky gameplay mechanics, but a beautiful soundtrack, a good variety of locations and enemies and an entertaining story. Well worth the 5 bucks.",

            "review_text": "I got this game while it was on a pretty good sale so I figured I'd give it a shot. I use RPG Maker myself so I did recognize quite a bit of the RTP art, however, it is used very well. The music in the game is also great.  But I, like many other reviewers, immediately hated the princess character. I'm about an hour and a half in and I have yet to have a reason to care for this character.   I am also taking a break tonight from it because I have been going back and forth throughout the same dungeon to flip switches on opposite sides (you can't get switch A until you hit switch B and switch A lets you go onward into the dungeon (the stairs for which are back on the other side) so after clearing the enemies this makes for a rather dismal walk back and forth. Not looking forward to doing this multiple times, I hope some of the later dungeons are better laid out.  The game gives me a couple good ideas for 'do's' and 'don't's' for videogame design. I'll probably shelve this one for now, might play it during some down time.",

            "review_text": "Let me try to summarize this.... This game is not an rpg. It's more like the story of a selfish and self-centered princess who gives no ♥♥♥♥s about anyone else and just ♥♥♥♥s around with the prince of another country. The spells, though customizeable, literally require you to grind around 5+ levels to get the next one because you need points to learn them, points that you get at a rate of 1 per level. All the 'playable characters' are just a hindrance because you can only have 4 at a time fighting. Music is nice for what could have been a snes game, but nothing to brag about. there is also no open exploration of entire world as claimed. Deluxe version comes with extra skills and items? for a 15 hour game? not worth at all. they do a nice job at trying to sell their game with loaded words, but that's all it is. there are no equipments. All you get is a single weapon and a single accessory per character.   TL;DR this isn't really a game at all as much as it is a sort of anti-hero princess story that you can 'play' at least it only cost me $0.99",
