            "review_text": " Reigns  is a small, ported-from-mobile game that is nonetheless very interesting. You 'swipe' left and right (more on that in a moment) to perform decisions which will affect your kingdom. The land is represented by three groups, the Church, the people, and the army, with the last factor being your treasury. From a pure gameplay perspective, the difficulty comes from trying to balance all four 'meters', because both too little and too much focus put into any of them leads to a game over. This is hard at first but after a while, you simply remember what each card and each decision do, and learn to act on them instinctively.  You may actually be surprised that there is a story to this game — a kind of meta-storyline that occurs in between the lives of your many monarchs. I don't want to spoil anything here but the game maneuvers very deftly between a funny and light-hearted atmosphere and something more horror-like.  The atmosphere in the game, by the way, is overall really great. The soundtrack features something like a medieval monk choir, the illustrations are simple but fantastic, and even the flavor text, anachronistic as it is, somehow manages to reflect, in a humorous and irreverent way, the realities of the middle ages.  The game, unfortunately, has some flaws, mostly related to the interface. The controls were clearly designed for touchscreens and just don't make as much sense in a desktop environment. Whilst they're nice when you get used to them, for all their simplicity they were surprisingly hard for me to figure out initially. The game offers very little in the way of explanation (of anything, really), so that didn't help. Also, scrolling feels sort of laggy for me.  (There is also the obvious fact that the game, even with its hundreds of cards, is rather small when compared to many other, especially mainstream games. I've seen some people complain about that in other reviews. You really should be able to tell what you're getting by looking at the screenshots and the description, and the price is entirely appropriate. Also, if you aspire to find out all the secrets this game has, it will still take you many hours.)  A thing that I find very interesting about  Reigns  is that it is one of the few, I think, games that bridge the divide between 'casual' and 'hardcore' gaming. I mean, I don't believe there are many 'gamers' who could honestly say they never played any timewaster mobile game. But still, there is a big distinction between the kind of video games one part of the population tends to find enjoyable and the kind that the other part prefers.  Reigns  reminds me of  Plants vs. Zombies  in that I could see it being enjoyed both by a casual gamer looking to occupy themselves waiting in a queue and by a mainstream gamer wanting some unusual storytelling.",

Also, I think this game is much better on the cellphone since you can finish a cycle when you in the toilet, waiting someone/something or any time when there is a short period of boredom. It's a great game to kill small amount of time.   Pros: fun and surprising cards medival fantasy story  Cons: RNG might be annoying decks are set, you will find it repetitive eventually.  Conclusion: for a 3 bucks game, I'd say it worth the price. I wish there are more decks in the future.",

I've been actually waiting long time for another 'king-simulator' to be released (Yes your grace) which should be kinda similar - and this game satisfied my royal needs.  Even if the replayability might be kinda low (especially after you learn by heart what kind of bonuses/penalties each answer gives) the game is still totally worth the price. Hell, I could pay even more! That being said, I'm 100% sure I'm gonna continue playing and will totally show it to my friends.",

            "review_text": "This is a hard one to describe - I wouldn't particularly describe it as a game, but I would say that it's fun.  You are one king in a long lineage of kings, every time you die you come back as the next in line. You are presented with choices each year, and these choices are purely binary. They can range from things such as 'Should we have a feast this year?' to 'Should I follow this dog?' and there's a great deal of different choices involved. You'll unlock more as you 'defeat' certain situations (very similar to Hand of Fate if you've played that).  To remain as king, you must balance 4 factions - Religion, Citizens, Army and Merchant. If the power meter for any of these factions gets too low, you'll be ousted. The crux is, if you let any of these factions get too powerful, you'll also be ousted. For example - Let the army's power get too low and you'll end up having your Kingdom overrun, but let them get too powerful and you'll end up with a coup on your hands.   The game hints at what your decisions will affect but don't outrightly tell you, you'll need to figure this out yourself (or you'll likely memorise some of the more common ones over time). The game will show you if your decision is going to slightly affects or greatly affect a faction, and which faction(s) they are, but whether that's a good or bad thing is really down to how you interpret the decision. There's rarely been a decision where I've thought 'Huh... I didn't expect THAT to be positive/negative'.  There are other different aspects to the game, duels, passive effects and other bits and pieces but really the mechanics are pretty flat to discuss without actually seeing it in action. In summary, this is an incredibly imaginative text-based game where your choices are binary and what sounds like an incredibly boring premise actually turns out to be a really intriguing, surreal and absorbing game.",

And cycle starts anew. Somethimes you get good cards and best possible combinations (some must go in a specific combination for events) and sometimes you draw three and you're dead. It's much more of mobile game than Steam title. If you want something just small and it's on big discount then you may want to give it a go.

You have four metres representative of your kingdom, and the cards supposedly affect the states in different ways. You try to balance the meters otherwise you experience the lose condition and your king is automatically killed.  You do this over and over again, with really poorly reasoned actions happening from the cards; sometimes I just huffed and sighed at this game. This feels like another game poorly balanced, trying to appear 'hard' at a glance but really just designed to play longer than it has content to support.  I don't think I even made it to 2 hours. I was severely bored after a single hour. Repetitive 'cards' pop up all the time, with the same chain of responses, within just 30 minutes of playing it.  I Just don't know where they think they were going with this, but this needs content and a tighter game loop for such a simple game.  Perhaps this game is better suited to a tablet format, to pick up for short bouts, but I don't know.",

You pick an option by chosing the left or the right when the card comes up. Like Tinder but instead of setting up a date you're managing a kingdom and you have four factions, The Church, the People, the Army and the Merchants, that you have to manage. They get too low? The people will riot and the merchants buy out your kingdom? They get to high? The pope takes over your kingdom so leave them in the middle alright?  Each option will have an effect, it could be to change the metersor it could be to unlock something for the future playthroughs becuase you will be playing through as more than one king. If you've played Rogue Legacy you'll be used to the idea of generations and that's what you have here. You can unlock buildings that might help in a famine or unlock new people that will give you access to new cards and situations. The game is cheap, it's fun and it's addictive. Give it a shot and you won't be dissapointed, or at least I wasn't.    Original short review: I don't know what to say. This game is great. It's so simple but it's so fun.

            "review_text": "A seriously addicting game that puts you in the shoes of several dozen cursed medieval kings. You're tasked with keeping the kingdom - consisting of the Church, the people, the Army, and the treasury - in balance; nothing can be too powerful or too weak, or you'll meet a sorry end.   Gameplay is super simple; the game started out as an Android and iOS app, and the basic swiping mechanics carried over. You can use either the mouse or the spacebar and arrow keys to make decisions and progress in the game. Your choices are generally pretty limited to 'yes' or 'no', but the scenarios and characters are interesting enough that that doesn't matter, and with over 600+ cards in-game, it's going to take a handful of playthroughs to get bored.   The only negatives I've got to offer on Reigns are: 1. 'Winning' the campaign is a ridiculously difficult puzzle; even if you can figure out what you're supposed to aim for, actually getting there is tricky, with the majority of critical in-game clues being impossibly subtle. 2. Getting all the achievements isn't realistic - not only because viewing all 600+ cards is, in the dev's own words, all but impossible, but because the game is so absurdly repetitive after 5-6 consequetive playthroughs you'll be left wanting to smash your head against the wall (although maybe that's just a me problem). 3. The kings' names. Oh, my God. It's like the dev's never read anything but an English history textbook. You're a king in a world where witches, werewolves, and dragons run abound, but there's only two or three fantasy names thrown in the mix, and the rest are just endless repeats of Henrys, Roberts, Geralds, and Harrys (with the occasional 'Thomas' and 'Cedric' for variety).  TL;DR: Really fun game. Super addicting. Gets boring after 5-6 consequetive playthroughs.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Fun, Simple Time-Waster. Buy this.  Longer Version:  --------------- You get a lot for what you pay in this game. It's a simple decision-making, almost text-based game.   Graphics: I enjoy the art style in this game, it is simple and unique, interesting to look at, but not distracting. Very easy to run even on low-spec systems.  Audio: The soundtrack and sound effects are are good and do their job, but are not over-the-top. I enjoy the soundtrack, it fits the theme and the sound effects are satisfying.  Gameplay: The gameplay is very simple. Your kingdom has 4 core systems: The Church, The People, The Army, and The Bank. It is your job to balance out these 4 aspects of your kingdom, without letting any of them get too far to either extreme, high or low. To do this, you are given a short bit of text and a portrait of who you are speaking to and must make a choice by clicking on 1 of 2 possible options. These choices will affect your kingdom's 4 core systems, and while you can see how big of an effect the choice will have, you are not shown for sure whether it will make the part of your kindgom better or worse. Many times, you can guess this, however. For example, saying 'Yes' to building a new church will increase The Church, and decrease The Bank. If any of the 4 aspects gets too high or low, you will be dethroned/decapitated/exiled/burned at the stake, etc etc, which will lead to the end of your reign. But it's OK, that's why this game is called ReignS, not just Reign. You take control of the next leader of the country and begin a new reign, and things like advisors you hired or people added to your court will persist. This game is a randomly-generated, persistant, perma-death game, and it requires little skill/practice to play. The repetitive clicking left or right is broken up by unique events that happen, such as being cursed, a famine, getting lost in your own dungeon, meeting the devil, being sieged, and more.  Conclusion: I enjoy this game and usually play it when I have anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour to burn and I just want to kick back and relax and play a no-stress, interesting, fun game that requires little effort.  For the price, I would definitely recommend buying this game. It has so many cool little things that occur that keep me entertained and interested.",
