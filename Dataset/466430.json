One bug I guess I'll throw in here though is:      When in a romance with the king, eventually it came to say that the romance deepened and he wanted to marry you. And the thing about the parade goes forward. However in the very next slide, it says he caves and finally proposes, and then it goes through the parade marriage AGAIN. Seemed like just a bug, but I figured I'd throw it in :)   ",
