            "review_text": "This is a pretty straight forward time management game. You grow fruits, you turn them into fruit products in your factories, you buy upgrades, and you complete your timed objectives. This game is very similar to the Farm Frenzy series, but with trees instead of animals. It's not very difficult and sort of relaxing to play, if you like this sort of thing.  It seems buggy for some users, though I haven't had any serious issues. I can save and return to a later level, unlike what another reviewer has reported. I did have the factory sound get stuck in an annoying loop, but quitting out and comimg back fixed the issue. I got it on sale for about a dollar and half, and it is well worth that price. Dunno if I would have been happy if I had paid in full, though.",
