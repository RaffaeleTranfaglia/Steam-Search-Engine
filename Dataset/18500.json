            "review_text": "By far the best tower defense i have ever played. Tons of content. The game allows for a ridiculous amount of customization, you have so many towers to choose from, and you will definitely have your favorites. There must be hundreds of ways to effectively crush the enemy.  combination of towers + tower placement and which towers you will upgrade first + the resource system (that gains interest depending on how much you have in the bank) gives you so many options for strategy.  each map, and there are a lot, will have different challenges and modes - that allow for huge replay potential. different layouts and enemy pathing has you thinking tactically about how to maze the aliens into oblivion. easy checkpoint system that lets you go back in time in set intervals, meaning a small error will not force you to restart from wave 1 if you are going for that perfect run.  Practice mode give you a ton of cash to perfect a strategy you want to apply once you play the map for real. Great voice acting for a tower defense. its just an amazing game.... I cannot think of a single fault for it. Enemies are varied wth nice animations. Towers look and sound good, upgrades improve their looks and fire effects.... its just obviously handled with a lot of care and love.  If you like tower defense - you would be hard pressed to find a better one than Defense Grid.  If you do, LET ME KNOW, because i would instantly buy that game too.  I highly recommend this game for yourself, or even as a gift to strategy loving friends. This game is AWESOME.",

It allows me to work on the defense building, while the game unleashes havoc on the hoardes of invading bugs.  There is nothing here that hasn't been done a million times already, but it does it in style and it looks great. It has a great interface and is easy to pick up and play. All around, this is a good game. It's not Skyrim or anything, but it's good for what it is is. A top notch tower defense game.",

            "review_text": "A historic entry into the tower defense genre.  In many aspects Defense Grid has aged very well. The level design/variety is superb - Having very different levels is crucial for forcing the player to not get locked into certain strategies. The tower balancing is excellent compared to most entries in the genre - I think cannon towers are a tad overpowered, but not at all game-breakingly so.  Defense Grid incorporates my favorite Tower Defense mechanic - unspent resources earn you income (at least in a majority of the game modes). This encourages the player to keep their defenses as lean as possible to maximize the amount of available resources for later waves. With this, even 'easy' levels are still very challenging for trying to achieve the highest score.  With a ridiculous amount of levels and score-keeping for them, you can compete with your friends' scores.   The biggest weakness Defense Grid suffers is that it feels too 'vanilla'. Not only was its design direction not particularly brave with any novel mechanics to begin with, but due to its age, later titles have been afforded the opportunity to duplicate its successful elements while also putting a more novel spin on their mechanics.  Still, what it lacks in novelty, it far surpasses in being an overall sleek optimized tower defense game.",

            "review_text": "Amazingly good Tower Defense game. If you like straightforward TDs (no first person, no creating units to attack - just towers and baddies) you will love Defense Grid.   Great graphics - they're not CoD of course but this game does more than justice for TD with it's simple design that comes off looking very sleek and setting the mood very well. Fantastic audio - each tower/gun has it's own distinquishable sound. The music is memorable and very well suited. Moreso, the AI companion who keeps you company all game has depth and charisma. He's even got an announcer pack in DotA 2!  Tons of replayability - tons of very varied levels to play on, each with multiple different modes to change your challange, and (affordable, and imo very worthwhile) DLC content also add even more content.  Amazing gameplay - DG's gameplay is fast paced with a need for good reaction skills and planning, but it manages to also be marvellously straightforward. It's constantly skimming the line of enjoyable challanging and (occasionally) frustratingly difficult, but a well-designed 'backtrack' feature in this game takes a big part of what tends to make TD games frustrating. You can always back up a few 10-second blocks of time backwards to re-think just where you place those towers - leaving your gaming time spent playing, killing, planning - instead of re-doing the first few easy waves of a level over and over while you try and handle the challanging part.   Whether you're just looking for a fun game to pass a half hour here, or a hardcore lover of Tower Defense, Defense Grid is a damn, damn good game that will get my stamp of approval any day.",

By all accounts, this was a great game to start with, and after many hours of playtime, I have to agree. To summarize the game (as much as I can within the character limit), basically it boils down to this: a bunch of aliens walk down a preset path and it is your job to lay down various towers to stop them from stealing your stuff. The challenge comes in figuring out which tower types to use and managing your resources. The game features tons of levels in the main campaign, along with various alternate challenges for each level. A number of add-on campaigns are also available. There is a TON of content here for a very low price. Considering the addicting and fun gameplay, plus all of the hours of content available, I give this a wholehearted recommendation, even (or especially) for those who have never tried a TD game before.",

In some levels the enemies take a mostly predetermined path, in others you may shape it, which is yet another important element of your strategy. Over time, you will gain access to an orbital cannon that, if used correctly, can save your hide quite a few times.   Automatic checkpoint-based save, quick reloading of checkpoints and a 'fast forward' button provide enough control over the game to avoid boredom and repetition.  The biggest con is that even upon completing the game you can't play any mission with all the towers. Only the ones from Story mode of that mission are available.",

A wide range of turrets to do different damage gives a nice selection for you to use, as well as a system to upgrade them using the in game point system.

The challenge here is all about pathing - there's plenty of different towers to try, and each is good and bad against different enemies - but in most cases, the main issue is figuring out where you can steer the enemies with the available map and towers at your disposal.  Couple of things I really like about DG:  1. You can complete levels without being 'flawless' - the goal is to stop aliens from stealing your 'cores', but you can finish a level without keeping all of them. As a bit of a completionist, I always wanted to get through them perfectly with all cores intacts, but the point is you're not blocked from getting on with the next level if this isn't for you.  2. The balance is excellent, in that your basic gun turret tower is useful from start to finish in this game - there's no sense of 'once you get tower X just spam that'.  It's a great game, hard to go wrong buying it.",

The core mechanics which make for a fun and challenging TD game are represented magnificently; maps are well designed and plentiful, ranging in difficulty from the sublime to the maddening. Pace and enemy flow are spot on, providing a challenge without becoming frustrating and enemy variety demands careful consideration when placing towers. Upgrades for your towers can be bought using points earned killing the hordes of energy core stealing aliens and give the towers that extra punch required in later waves. For TD games I've never placed much importance on hi fidelity graphics, the game-play just doesn't demand it. Defence Grid however pulls out all the stops in it's designs and renders giving you a diverse line-up of uber cool aliens, towers and backgrounds. Defense Grid is THE shining example of the genre; a must buy for any fan.",

It is just ridculous how much enjoyment I have received for the $5 I spent. The amount of hours I have played is bordering on insane. I don't quite understand some of the negative reviews here. It is like they don't 'get it' and don't appreciate some of the finer points of this game.

Everything about it is on point. Mechanics are good, with lots of varied tower types, and many different aliens, the stages are also quite varied in design, within the limitation of the game mechanics. Graphics and sound are quite good, yet still playable on my tablet (Atom Z3775-based).  Which brings me to another point: it has touch support, and suffers little for it. Not quite as accurate as a mouse, which does result in some accidents, but it's mostly a matter of getting used to it.  The voice acted story is excellent, both in terms of voice acting quality, and writing. It was a particularly nice element of this game, actually. The player's AI ally is amusing and endearing, while also delivering the game's 'tutorial' elements.  The gameplay is addicting, and the difficulty is fair, which led me to 100-percenting this game's achievements. Replay value is decent as well, with multiple strategies working well enough to pass most levels.  The only thing that feels 'off' is the degree to which some towers are either useless in a given level, or basically mandatory. Missile towers in particular, and the flying enemies they shoot down, seem like they're only in the game to be a backdoor means of draining resources away from your other defences. Not a huge issue overall, but the tower type could use some retooling (like they did in DG2).  If you like the genre, I'd definitely recommend buying this, even at full price, no regrets.",

If you have been enjoying different Tower Defense games on your phone or in a browser and desires something similar, but of higher quality in design, presentation and graphics, this is the one to buy.  Defense Grid: The Awakening with its expansions is simply the best TD game on the market at this point, with good clear graphics, quality voice acting, towers that are easy to understand what they do and most of all, this game offers a real story that is told during the missions.  The story is simple but fun with Fletcher, an AI that have been inactive for centuries and therefore become a bit senile, telling you about the towers and the attacking aliens.  If you plan to play Defense Grid 2, then it is a good idea to first play Defense Grid 1 and the expansions so you understand the full story.  The maps are very well designed as you have limited locations where you can place the towers, but on several maps you can also use the towers to change the path the aliens walk. On a few maps you will also face flying aliens and need to balance your defenses to be able to counter both types. Shall you build pure AA towers in areas or go for canons that might not do as much damage, but can attack both land and air.  All in all, this game offers a lot strategy and all maps have many different modes, like normal story more, a story challenge with tougher aliens, grinder with 99 waves of weaker aliens but huge numbers of them per wave and many more options.  Give the game a try; it is well worth its low price.",
