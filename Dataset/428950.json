            "review_text": "From the First Time i started the game i was enjoying it  You can upgrade your car with: Armor, Better Wheels, Nitro Boost, Different weapons and mich more  But when you are not Driving you are able to walk around. You are also able to equip your character with a pistol, a shotgun, a grenade or even use a Katana. When you arrive at a village you must survive waves of enemies.  Another Great Thing: You must buy Fuel, repair you car and buy bullets. So you have to think what you buy .  I think the game is really worth buying",
