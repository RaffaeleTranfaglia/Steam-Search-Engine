            "review_text": "As a friend of mine so eloquently put it: 'This isn't a sequel. This is an upgrade.'  Almost every issue either of us had with the first Xenoverse has been corrected with Xenoverse 2, along with a plethora of new features and improvements that makes this game a direct upgrade to the first. Unless you're super-duper-ultra-interested in playing the first game's story, there's no reason play it over this one.   Melee heavy striker builds are my preferred way to play, however, XV1 suffered from various issues that made strikers more of a pain to play than anything, such as constant rubber-banding issues, sluggish response to player inputs, and the hilariously easy and overpowered nature of ki blast builds making them more attractive in comparison. All of this has been corrected in XV2, as well as giving strikers new ways to use their stamina offensively. Overall a huge improvement to melee oriented playstyles.  XV2 also revamps the trainer system, completely removing the stupid RNG spawning of the first game and allowing you to learn skills from everyone, not just your personal instructor. Running around and doing all of the instructor quests is a great source of new skills, and they give a decent amount of experience as well.  Speaking of experience, there are many more ways to get it now. From the Time Rift quests, to the instructors, to various little events and quests around the city, the experience flows like it never did in XV1. Now I do Parallel Quests because I want to, not because I need to grind them for more experience because the current story mission is being stubborn.  Unfortunately, the story is still only single player. This was one of my biggest gripes about XV1, and it's the same in XV2. I understand why, from a technical point of view, but it would give players more things to do together other than quests and beating the daylights out of each other.  Overall, Xenoverse 2 is a huge improvement over the first game in nearly every aspect. If you liked XV1, you will love XV2. If you strayed away from XV1 due to it's flaws, then XV2 might be worth looking at, as many of those flaws have been fixed. If you're a fan of the various Dragon Ball anime and want a game that shamelessly uses Star Trek levels of time violation to make popular characters from the different series and movies fight each other, then this is definitely the game for you.",

            "review_text": "So I just beat the game. Here are my thoughts.  Short Version: Xenoverse 1 had a better story. Xenoverse 2 has better multiplayer.  Long version:  The first half or so of Xenoverse 2's story mode is almost entirely recylced. Including cutscenes (I get why, but...). It feels much less epic. Also, any choices you thought you might make... don't... exist... at all. There is one choice near the end, but I can't tell if it even did anything.  Your character from the first game is almsot entirely an afterthought and does almost nothing of note. They're the hero of Toki Toki city but they feel weak and pointless. They killed a ****ing god (solo if you play it right) in the last game but in this game they do NOTHING.  It feels very rushed and disjointed. It's not BAD, but... coulda been better.  Unfortunately, allies are still a burden in this game. Being precise and decisive with your actions is SO MUCH MORE important in this game, but if your ally punches your target at the wrong moment, your very costly ultimate can miss and a HUGE amount of effort can be wasted. If you just want the win, this MIGHT not be a huge deal, but if you want to have a cool moment or get more points for Z rankings... this can be ****ing infuriating.  Also, it's so easy to collect a good chunk of TP medals (especially if you did a transfer and started with over 200 like me) and just buy every good move from the shop with minimal effort. There's almost NO NEED to do PQs... at all. In fact, PQs are a HUGE chore that I dread having to do at any point in this game. Why? Because you'll either be dealing with the burden of allies or facing multiple opponents. Fortunately, in many cases it seems your enemies are programmed to only attack if you're targeting them. Otherwise they hover around and wait their turn. A bit odd to see but it's honestly necessary and I'm glad for it. However, they'll still occasionally shoot ki blasts at you and you CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT and it will ruin your combos... every time.  And it's worse when they DO all attack at once. It becomes and almost insurmountable nightmare, especially if you don't have good skills equipped.  In XV1 it was almost fun to jump into a PQ and gamble for equips and skills (or horrifying if it took more than 3 tries/was a long mission...)... if you were a saiyan with infinite Ki. In this game, there is no infinite ki and the enemies are HAPPY to smash your stamina... over and over and over. They weren't smart enough to consistantly punish you before, but now they are.  This is good for making it a challenge, but mostly it's annoying if you ever have to deal with multiple opponents. People too prideful to use items and heal will suffer unless you're REALLY good at this game. It's nice to have a greater challenge, but it's often hard to call it fun unless you're in a nice, fair(ish) 1v1 battle.  To play this game and land many of your more decisive skills you have to be VERY precise and manage your stamina and ki carefully. Often I'd get flustered and get royally screwed with no chance of making a come back. Not enough ki to ult? Oh s**t they're no lnger staggered, your opportunity is gone... and you're dead. But that's fine, of course. Mistakes should be punished. Except... when you DO hit the right buttons... and nothing happens.  Enter the stamina break feature. Your new best friend and worst enemy. Hitting UP + HEAVY or UP + LIGHT does a stamina break... sometimes. If the game feels like it. I don't know if I'm missing something, or if my controller is f***ed or what, but often my character refuses to stop their combo and use a stamina break. The thing is, you CAN do it mid combo, but... for some reason it's very inconsistent whether or not it'll happen.   Unfortunately, this move is now somewhat necessary. It's VERY risky as if you miss or it is blocked, you're gonna get punished by the PC or any competent player. And yet to land ALMOST ANY ULTIMATE IN THE GAME you have to land one. That or you have to break their stamina by smashing their guard or interupting their ultimate... if they're dumb enough to use one while you're still free to move.  It would be nice if comboing was a bit more rewarding. To an extent it is. If you force someone to use all their stamina, you can get in a very brutal melee combo, especially if you have some stamina left yourself. LInking ANY powerful skills into your combo, however, is... hard. The stamina break is such a slow, risky technique and windows to use it against a skilled opponent are small.  I guess it somewhat makes these big ults more satisfying when they land, but quite frankly, some ults can ONLY be used on an opponent with broken stamina. Sometimes they won't land even IF you break their stamina.  For example, I learned that weak enemies with less than five bars of stamina are effectively immune to some big ults as their stamina will recover so fast that they will just recover and float over the attack before it can land. Even if you link the ult in as fast as possible. That leaves you with breaking their stamina via guard breaking which is... rare.  It'd be nice if there were a few more windows to land an ult and actually have the entire thing hit. It can be hard just to initiate some melee based ults, and then to have the full force of it not connect (even when sometimes it looks like it does.........) is disheartening. It's like 'Ha, I've got y- Awwwwww....'  Basically, for 90% of the ults, if your opponent isn't stamina broken or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's not going to hit. You're gonna have to learn to fight hand-to-hand and link fast, quick acting supers for a majority of your damage.  But I still like the game. It's not that these features are entirely unfair, it's just a ratehr high skill floor that will probably aggravate more casual players (*coughmecough*), especially if they were used to being a SSJ spammer from the last game.  It's just that the somewhat unreliable/glitchy gameplay will occasionally (if not regularly) exacerbate these issues.  However, for the most part, the combat has been greatly improved and allows for some fun as hell 1v1 online battles. They're fun to watch if you're viewing them online on youtube or on a stream, and they can be very intense to play yourself. The last thing I did before i put the game down to write this was finally do some online battles myself. I found an opponent who I was pretty much even with and many of the battles (where I didn't royally f**k up) were intense and down to the wire.  The only complaint (aside from finicky controls and whatnot) is that it's easy to become a one trick pony and use gimicks to win. My opponent often won because they would combo me into a stamina break and then ult me. A few times I could recover and roll out of the break, but then other times I inexplicably couldn't... This was basically their main goal in all our fights so I did get bored and leave after a dozen matches with them.  If I had wanted to be a d**k, I could have abused skill that reliably (except when it randomly does nothing...?) targets any opponent you've knocked back for a lot of damage... but that would have been boring and a bit too easy.  Well this review has been a bit... messy, but I'll come to a conclusion here: If you loved the story of the first game and were excited to see your old CaC come back and join your new one... I'm sorry. You're probably gonna be disappointed. It's a bit of a disappointment from start to finish.  Multiplayer and fighting nechanics (if it's 1v1) have defnitely been improved. For the most part, being skilled is rewarded far more than before. Still no good way to fight multiple opponents though.  Also the camera often ends up at an annoying angle... but... meh.  You can have fun with this game and I'm looking forward to future additions to it.  Overall, I'd say it ranks about equal to it's predecessor. Perhaps better than if you were in it for PVP.",

The game is really good when you play in singleplayer: a good story, lot of things to do (teachers, PQ) but the multuplayer is full of bugs: - lags when you play against other users in ranked matches - enemies don't spawn or simply freeze so you can't finish the mission - you often get disconnected from the PQ/Exper Mission room - the raid quests have a lot of server issues....

This means jack however - as of yet I have yet to have a single online pvp or PQ match due to constant DC's or simply not being able to find a room. So this and this reason alone is enough for a 'not recomened' as of right now - and no doubt it will remain so as BanCo don't seem interested in adddressing said problem.   which is a shame. Offline play has been, while not without its own faults, enjoyable in it's own right - to a point. (Expert and PQ missions a little dull on my lonesome.)  The little in the way of new content for CaC was also disappointing, given that the role-playing aspect of this game is one of it's biggest draws for many, myself included. They even created an entirely new problem of not beeng able to switch avatars in the same manner as XV1 which is incredibly frustrating. (Having to replay all tutorials, story and PQ missions AND unlock aall characters INCLUDING wish characters is some next level BS.)  So while creating your own DB avatar and the initial playthrough of the story is fun, replay value is a lot lower than the previous game.  Overall a frustrating experience.",

            "review_text": "Making a serious review this time.  Xenoverse 2 is the successor to Xenoverse 1 (obviously) a game based in fixing a broken and currupted timeline, which by this point it is no surprise to anyone, Towa and Mira are the ones behind it all.   Story: -(I will avoid spoilers if possible, despite most of the community already knowing most of it even without playing the game) -While the first game surely felt short plotwise with uninteresting plot devices and weird twists at times, the second one managed to redeem itself and bring out a better story than before, while still being able to use what was previously established. A decision that was not bad at all and created a new non cannon interesting turn for the franchise.  Gameplay:  &gt;Pros&lt;  -With a great and fun singleplayer experience on your first run, with a lot to explore, a new hub world that is beautiful in its own way, and offers a lot of mini quests and interesting gimmicks. This game in single player is definetly a beauty. Mentors are easy to find, quests are interesting to do, and now with enemy rushes that sometimes can be annoying, certainly do improve the experience.  -While it certainly did improve from its previous instalment, with far better combo game and much more fluid combat, even adding new types of combos and attacks, Xeno2 sure has brought a lot of new mechanics that make the game feel fresh, challenging and honestly, leaving the feeling of a true dragon ball fight. Well, almost.  -Before we move on to the next part of this review... MODS!!! One of the greatest things in this game. A lot of oportunities and creativity with what the devs have allowed us to do! Creating attacks, characters, transformations and hopefully maps and more in the future that we would love to see in game but never really got to! Boy it's good to play as super saiyan blue Vegito and Buu Gohan Absorbed. But that's just scratching the surface, with characters such as False super saiyan goku or even Bojack!  &gt;Cons&lt;  -But oh well, It's true xenoverse 2 feels a lot more like fluid and with fights that leave you feeling like a true warrior in the game, however this is if you play it fully for fun. Online has far too many exploitable issues and don't get me started on hackers. On PC it is far too easy to hack without getting punished.  -Some of the issues gameplay wise are more related to the fact that this is the second instalment and we still dont have beam clashes like in previous games. A real dragon ball game, having an epic battle ending it with a struggle in a life or death situation, where you mash your button hoping to get that win you worked so much to achieve... Nothing beats that great feeling. Even if you lose, it was still a worthy match ending with an epic and flashy struggle. I hope in the future we get to see this both in beams and even on melee struggles where both players clash with fists and mash. The one who mashes more times, wins and sends the enemy flying.  -Broken moves. The devs do try to balance them out but there will always be that one cheap combo, you can do nothing about, and will always lose to. By the time of this review, attacks such as Absolute Zero and Prelude of Destruction (just two examples) leave a player feeling robbed of that mach and with 0 fun during this unfair fight because he could not move during the whole time and just had to see his health drop like crazy.  -Camera issues, game crashes, constant DC in certain missions and many more. Only a few of the many many bugs this game has. Devs seem o never be able to successfully patch them... so this really becomes an issue to us all.  - And let us not forget about certain design choices. Such as every new character has to start everything from the very very beginning expect for moves and zenni but everything else is lost which now caused players to use max level mods more frequently so they dont have to play everything from the start and not be able to farm exp as easily as before. Also the loading screens are horrible and please get rid of the tutorial levels... I've palyed them way too many times.  Developers:  -Sure they patch the game once in a while, sure they get to fix the issues we get... but every time we require it, even when it comes to DLC being released, it always takes too long and there's some problem which leaves me and other players wondering about the developers skill to program a game. But despite all of that, we still get what we were promised even if dellayed, and this game does indeed grow better and better. Let's just hope the crashes and hackers end for good sometime in the future.  Final Rating: 7/10 Needs Beam clashes.   This has been my review for Xenoverse 2 but before I leave, I'd like to comment that I have a group on steam for players to group up for raids, quests and even battles easily without having to go online and just spammung around Coton city that they want friends to play with. At the moment we are small but once we grow we will start making tournaments, streams and more to not let this game die, much less become forgotten to its console under realm counterpart.  Make PC Version grow, make PC version Better!  Check it out on my profile! My main group! (Xenoverse 2 Fighting Community!)",

Xenoverse 2 has a few small flaws but if you played Xenoverse 1 you're gonna ignore a clipping cape or a minor lighting error. All in all it's a hell of a lot better than Xenoverse 1!  The graphics are even better than before and the animations look awesome! They even fixed almost every hitbox error. With that said the fighting animations are as smooth as it gets plus they increased the overall speed of battle. Last time i was this hyped about a game the games name was 'Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3'.  I'm most certainly not a verified reviewer and i want back to playing Xenoverse 2 so...

This is really an game killer for me .   After that , the story is basically the same , you appear from nowhere in the story line , defeating always the same enemy ever and ever, no one wonder where you come from . No background story , just fighting , fighting, fighting...and yeah the vilain...oh i forget, but well they are nothing to tell about it , they are the same from XV1 .

            "review_text": "Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2  Well in this review I will be talking about: - What I like about this game - What I dislike about this game - Dragon Ball Xenoverse vs Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 - Should I buy this game?  What I like about this game Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is a fighting game with ALOT of content to it. For players you will have the story quest, small side quest, small minigames(fx. deliver milk), Huge freeroam lobby with good transportation possability, ALOT of emotes to play around with in the lobby, TONS of PQ to play and farm, special missions, Expert quests for up to 6 players at the same time, and for what I know an upcomming raid quests again for 6 players but the enemy will have a TON of hp. If you got alot of spare time you could find all the secrets to the game and do those or mainly Z rank everything. Some parts of the game can feel like a huge grind unless your RLY lucky to get everthing on the first try. I reached max level - 80 before I even finished my main quest, if you are only doing main quest this will not be the same for you. I did alot more then just the main quest since I did not want my town to be filled with quest in the end so I cleaned up in town bit by bit. The combat in the game is complex with alot of possible ways of playing where the melee combat has some tricky and hard combos to it. Can you master every single combo and move in the game then you will end up getting unbeatable almost. There might be more to it that I did not mention of the good stuff but those are the top spotlights I could remember right now. expect if it aint on the dislike list I probably find it good.  What I dislike about this game There is some big bugs in the game as I write this review. But the game just got released I am sure they will fix it, and its almost to be expected in new games now and days. Here is a list of bugs I have ran into. - Making a wish with the dragon balls makes me crash everytime at least it's saving right before the crash - When scrolling trough ALL PQ the game will crash - Easy fix until dev fixes it.. simple just pick difficultys instead of all and it wont crash. - Expert missions The boss dissapeares - If one of your players are outside the playing field try and fly HIGH in the air that made him respawn for us so we could finish it. The boss shoots the ki blast into the wall - well this one is annoying and will make you wipe only way of dealing with this is to try to keep the boss in the middle as good as you can. - Lost connection to the server and kicks the party - Everyone should restart their client and that fixed it for us. most likely a desync problem. - Fullscreen tab dc - run borderless or dont tab out while in a game as fullscreen since its making you out of sync and kicks you, Your game will either freeze or pause for you when tabbed out but not for everyone else thats why you get kicked and if your the host you will kick all. - Falling trough the ground in the lobby - I dont know why this happens but happend once for me when I jumped right after a quests while the screen was still fading in. My brother also experiences falling trough the ground from tabbing out and in of the game. now to what I dont like about this game. Well a minor thing is the english voices does not fit to the video at all and its so bad from time to time that it feels kinda weird to watch, but I could see trough fingers with that since its not a gamechanger. The expert missions well its kinda good that you can play it with computers but they dont rly do anything but beeing meatshields for you and helps with the special skills that he is doing. but as 3 players the mission is just way too easy and I can not start to think about how it would be with 3 other players who will actually dead high damage as the 3 we are. I bet that it will get harder and harder the longer up we get but we just did golden freeza and he was the first and only one we had any trouble with so I guess it will get harder the longer up you get and well we will have raid for the tough experience so I guess its fine thats why this will only be a minor thing also. MAJOR thing that I dont like is the PQ, Expert missions progression. PLEASE do so when you join a host and win the mission you will get progress aswell when you have that mission. If we dont get this funktion we will end up playing alone in all the content or get forced to do the same mission 3 times so 100 pq suddenly becomes 300 missions O.o with more to come on the next dlc's + expert Another major dislike is the way you play with your team for the PQ once you selected a PQ missions and finishes it you only got the possibility to replay it or leave. You should be able to change the mission doing the lobby imo so there would be less loading time. - I havent tried out the Kame House if this is the place where you could do the exact thing I was talking about. but would make sence but then we need some guidence in game that tells us this. An annoying feature is the Lobby Idle timer. We need this changed plz or at least explained in game why this feature is so important to have. I understand if the lobby will have too many players standing afk it will maybe slow it down but then make a timer when you havent moved and stuff instead fx. 15-30 min of idle in the lobby will result in a kick. when you play you will just get annoyed by the idle message telling you that you got 10 min until you get kicked are you doing a mission you just get a dc and its fustrating plz fix.  Dragon Ball Xenoverse vs Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Well I played both games and to be honest I like both games and I like the secound one way better then the first. we have alot of new combos to pull out and a great tutorial to try them out. I did 1-12 of them but the last 13. I can get to the third part of it and never pull that combo out the npc either does not fall all the way to me or keeps teleporting or jumping away. I ended out leaving it. They have alot of costumes and moves to use and the way they made stuff more balanced in the secound one is nice to see aswell. You can no longer spam ki blast as a sayin but this also makes the ki blast less effective since they intend to miss alot when people keeps pushing them around. And blue hurricane cant one shot everything now. The lobby is way cooler and better also way easier to navigate trough and figure out where to go. The PQ can remind you alot of the first one but the story is a continue from the first one and without spoiling the story it can from some times feel like the same but still have a new kind of story to it and its a thrill to see who is going to show doing it. I would prefer DBX2 over DBX but if you have the extra money to spent and the extra time then I would say play trough DBX before DBX2 to get the full story it will make your playtrough of the DBX2 story line way better. But dont get me wrong you can still play DBX2 without the need of the first on you will still get the full story just with a slight twist.  Should I buy this game? If you want my opinion well if you like fighting games and if you like the dragon ball universe then YES you should buy this game its alot of fun and even better if you can bring some friends to play with. Is it then worth the money I would say with all the current content there is right now yes it is you will be spending ALOT of hours in this game if you want to complete it 100% I still havent done it 100% and I have alrdy passed the 30 hours marker and I bet there will be over double that time at least still to play",

As many people can tell there's always going to be something wrong with a game, and I'm not the type to go into detail and find out what's wrong. But I simply couldn't help that local co-op hasn't gotten much attention. The amount of characters you can play is phenomenal, and the impact and dynamics put into each and everyone one. But only 6 maps? Which is pretty lame because you can play a lot more in bot matches. Why not with local co-op? I do realize this game has 1 year to be worked on. But this game is really fun to me and I can't get away from the action and replay-ability! I almost beat it twice, and I will beat it more times over!

Actual review where 100% of it isn't complaining:  This game at the moment is really a hit or miss. I personally enjoy it, have played it for a small bit, but lets go over a few points:  Pros:   - The combat is really nice, feels fluent. New moves, even the training system kicks ♥♥♥♥. - The new city design is actually pretty cool as well. It will be possible to eventually FLY, but in the meantime, you get a vehicle to traverse around the area! - The story already feels different, despite some similarities.   Cons:  - DLC hasn't appeared for what appears to be everyone. (Playable character Black) EDIT: The DLC has arrived, at least on my screen. I went to do a quest, and both Black &amp; Future Trunks were avaliable to choose from. - Some of the audio doesn't appear to be synced properly. (At the beggining, Trunk's mouth isn't synced with his voice) - Lags randomly (Some people even report frequent disconnecting) - They reused a lot of stuff from the old game. It's ALMOST like it could've been expensive DLC, if there wasn't so much other new stuff the game has to offer.   Overall, I still recommend this game. I rate it 7/10 for quality. Keep in mind I've got slightly less then 4 hours, and this review reflects what I've experienced so far.",

            "review_text": "I'm torn over this one. Xenoverse 3 will probably be a recommended item, but to anyone thats wondering if they should get this game:  Are you a dragonball z fan then yes, get this game. There's a lot of flaws in here, but you'll be able to look past them and have a really enjoyable time.  Not a dbz fan: The gameplay faults are still too big. Wait for xenoverse 3, or better yet.. raging blast 3.  _____Extended review_____  Gameplay: The gameplay tries to take what worked best in xenoverse 1 and improves upon it. Allbeit the combo system is relatively simple, through combo cancels and teleports can you chain together many different combos and juggle your opponent around. While this system seems to work for the most part, the problem seems that a lot of combo's, even basic ones are programmed in such a way that they will randomly miss and have your character strike air instead. This seems to become truly apparent in the first cooler and frieza fight, where it seems the hit detection is just abysmal.  The customization seems to be plentiful and will give many a fan enough to create his ultimate z warrior with. Allthough for most of us, wanting to experiment with other characters, the current system of being forced to restart storymode, is problematic. (This may be fixed later.) The much hated RNG system from xenoverse 1 had made place for one that is far more reliable. No more hours of searching for that one item that you so despirately want. No more looking for specific trainers, reloading the game multiple times to find the person you desire.  You still can not make custom created characters fight against eachother, or choose offline 1vs 3 matches. But the removal of super armor(a mechanic that pretty much broke the game) that was present in the first game, has made this game far more enjoyable.  Graphics:  Simply put, the graphics are wonderful. Allthough there's a glaring difference between the character models and the backgrounds. The models look close to their animated counterparts but the backgrounds are a bit realistic in comparison. Problem lies with the way backgrounds are modeled. A problem that the lead designer should have picked up on. Backgrounds were not modeled to work together with this shader.  Story:  While it's nice to see yourself placed in a dragonball story, the complete idea of having a time patroller is one that is filled with plotholes. You're the protector of history and have to make sure no alterations get made. Sounds good in practice, if it wasn't for the fact that you're protecting an already altered history. (Trunks coming back to warn the z warriors, anyone?) Add this to the fact that the entire story is shallow to begin with and it becomes a more painful grind rather than anything else. Having said that, some of the dialogue will surely make you dbz fans squeel with joy.  Music:  Ouch. Spend 5 minutes in the main hub and you'll find yourself marching to the beat. And not in a good way. More in a 'Lock me up in an asylum' kind of way. While the battle tunes work great, mixing from a variety of genres, from metal to a more techno vibe. Never does the music really take away from the action. Done well enough, with the exception of the hubworld.   In conclusion. Xenoverse 2 is the game that xenoverse 1 should have been. There are still blatant flaws that need to be addressed and show a lack of caring from the developers side. But dragonball fans will be able to see past these flaws and have an enjoyable experience. The combat system, while miles ahead of the first game, has fundamental flaws that can seriously ruin one's day. Dragonball fans will easily be able to look past these flaws, but if you're looking for a fighting game, best keep your money in your pocket. Atleast till hit detection is fixed.",

            "review_text": "I was really hoping that this game would improve upon the original. In a few ways, it did. In most ways, it's exactly the same. In some other ways, it's markedly worse.  Most of the improvements over XV1 come in the form of the hub city. It's bigger, better, and you can (eventually) fly around most of it. I liked the new instructor system - it felt more like I was being trained and there was less guesswork as to when I could learn a new move. It was also easier to find instructors and the guesswork was taken out of that as well. There are almost always things going on in the hub city, but make no mistake - this is still no MMO. Also on the plus side is that some (but not all) of the randomness surrounding parallel quest rewards has been removed. Still, it's far too grindy. If I have to repeat a parallel quest more than once to get its skill reward, that's one too many times for me. Also, quests are still graded very arbitrarily. You can get tons of achievements and still wind up with a bad grade and no explanation as to why you got that grade. I'd rather they just do away with the grade system if they can't make it make sense.  The story feels a bit stale this time through, but honestly, I can't completely blame them for that. You're still going through Dragon Ball's history, from Raditz to Golden Frieza, and there's only so much they can do with that. The combat mechanics are both different and the same. The enemy AI still cheats like there's no tomorrow - they recover stamina faster than they should, have an impossibly fast reaction time, and can even interrupt your interrupts. If you like to shift behind an enemy that's pummeling you to stop their combo and take back control, get ready for them to inexplicably turn around and sucker punch you before you can even move.  Worse still is their interruptions of your ki blast ultimates. These do more damage than they used to in XV1 (or at least I think they do), but with them comes a HUGE risk - you're no longer invulnerable while using them, and if you get interrupted during one, you instantly lose all of your stamina. This leaves you about as helpless as Yamcha against a Saibaman, except you can't even self-destruct. You just get to sit there and watch while the AI decimates you, and there's nothing at all that you can do about it until your stamina replenishes. Given how long most ki blast ultimates take to charge and fire, and how easily they miss, they're pretty much useless in a four or five star difficulty mission. At best, the AI will simply dodge them, and at worst, they'll kill you for even trying.  The friendly AI is no better. I can't think of a single instance where friendly AI was helpful. They are all strikers now and keep the fight highly mobile, meaning on the rare occasion that a target doesn't dodge one of your ki blasts on their own, one of your allies will probably just knock them out of the way anyway. Additionally, if you're in the middle of a strike ultimate, they'll use a ki blast to knock the target out of the way. Allies are a complete hindrance. Towards the end of the game, I found myself just letting the AI fight itself untill all my allies were dead (in cases where I could allow allies to die, that is), and then I could get down to business without any interruptions.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a game about Dragon Ball, right? Where are the ki blast clashes?! It's one of the biggest hallmarks of DBZ, and here we are in XV2, and STILL no clashes with ki blasts? Really devs?! You might as well make a game about World War II with no Nazis in it.  So, yeah, I can't recommend this game. It still has tons of potential, just like the first, but if this is their second attempt, I doubt they're ever going to realize that potential. I won't be buying XV3, if it's ever made.",

Most of the issues with the first game have been largely fixed and there is quite a considerable amount of stuff to do by comparison, and the abysmal RNG of the first game is also largely gone as skills and items seem much more frequently obtainable from the PQ's. (Parallel Quests). And while no it is not as refined mechanically as some of the older console titles, it isnt really a fair comparison to say that a game designed around 1v1 battles is better designed than one that handles much more chaotic larger scale battles consisting of multiple characters... just ignorant that...  So far my only real issue with the game itself is that it does recycle some content (cutscenes and PQs) from the first game, though there are changes even to PQ's taken directly from the original. I just kinda shrugged off all the Bamco BS as none of it actually effects the game itself and considering that Steam was the only source I know of to change the 1 year thing to 6 months and back it may very well have been a mistake on the part of Steam, which is not entirely unheard of. And the Pre-Order characters were unlocked within 24 hours of the launch so everyone who whined about that was just QQing over being impatient.  There was also an issue for me in getting the game to launch, missing dll's and such but is an easy enough problem to fix if you take the time to actually look it up and I had the game running in a couple of hours. And it was only an issue because I hadnt fully updated my windows since a recent fesh install as well as some general windows 7 issues. it is also something that is supposedly getting patched in a few days so won't even matter anymore.  ------p.s.------ To all the people still moaning about the 'bait and switch', even if it were an underhanded tactic on the publishers part, the community won and the change was reverted... so really all you people are just whining about getting your way at this point.

The gameplay,thanks to the new stamina break and backhits attacks is more refined but in the long run it feels pretty repetitive,especially against the AI. In pvp (which is almost unplayable if you have a slow connection,mind you) the fight boils down to whoever runs out of stamina first loses,but it's still quite fun if you manage to find a good opponent.  The character roster is disappointing,with lots of characters being retextured versions of others added just to inflate the numbers.While the brief story mode offers no innovations whatsoever compared to the first game since it keeps the basic formula the new hub city is pretty nice and there's a decent amount of content to clear with the Parallel Quests,mentor missions and what not.  Overall if you're a huge Dragonball fan who hasn't tried out XV1 yet,or someone who greatly enjoyed it the game is worth its price,otherwise not really.",

            "review_text": "While it feels more like a sizable update to Xenoverse than a fully fledged follow up, Xenoverse 2 manages to improve upon its predecessor in meaningful ways. The most immediate improvement is how much more there is to do in Conton City over Toki Toki in the original. There are random encounters, events, and special pocket dimension spaces that hold a set of quests for each race's transformation, in addition to the main story and parallel quests. You can also fly or drive vehicles within the city, which makes travel time much shorter overall. Transformations also got an overhaul, with each race getting their own unique transformation options in addition to Kaioken and Unlocked potential, which remain universal. The RNG has also been much improved, and grinding for items is cut way down as a result.  The story and parallel quests are kind of hit or miss. This is where the game kind of feels more like a Xenoverse 1.5 instead of a sequel, as the main quest hits many of the same story beats of the original game. There are even some quests that are exactly the same as they were in the original Xenoverse. They are still fun to play through though, and some new story content is added from other DBZ films, as well as Dragonball Super.  Overall, Xenoverse 2 is a successful improvement over the original. While some things may feel pretty similar, the changes that were implemented make for a much more polished and enjoyable experience. Recommended for fans of the original game or Dragonball in general.",

            "review_text": "Dragonball Xenoverse 1 was an amazing stray from the conventional Dragonball games of the past decade or so. Instead of a straight up fighter, as most of the predecessors have been (excluding Sagas and a few of the portable games), XV1 introduces a slightly more open feeling as well as a refreshing revamp of the Bandai fighting system. The story was linear and understandable, not completely 'non-cannon', the game was solid.  With the announcement of Dragonball Xenoverse 2 needless to say, I was extremely excited. This is the first game I've pre-ordered in since Call of Duty Black Ops 1 when I was a teenager, and the first I've ever pre-purchased on Steam.  However, I cannot in all good faith recommend this game to newcomers or people who aren't completely into DB/DBZ. I'll give a pros/cons list followed by a non-biased conclusion below;  Pros;  +Tons of characters/variations to choose from (aside from your own created character) +Bigger Hub World than XV1 with a lot more to do +Fan-service is amazing +DLC and updates rolling out pretty often +Covers the DBZ story from beginning to end very well for newcomers and fans alike +Tons of customization for your character +Tons of side quests/parallel quests to keep you busy  Cons;  -Essentially XV1 with a fancy coat of paint and a slightly different story -Combat is still just as clunky as is was in XV1 -Gets pretty repetitive after a while -Definitely a 'grind-fest' (not a con for me, but a con for most) -AI is awful when you need it and 'great' when you don't (Team AI will knock opponents out of your combos, while Enemy AI will completely destroy you) -The PVP elitists have found the broken 'builds' for their characters, not a fun time -A couple of new mentors, but not enough to really write home about -Co-op is horrendous, creating a team and getting your friend in is bad enough, but once you finish a parallel quest you have to back out and do it all over or face doing the same quest over and over  My biggest complaint about the game is the lack of new quests and the fact that Bandai used the same story as they did in the first Xenoverse. The story is also very short. I completed it in ~12 hours, and that's with grinding for loot and trying to get the damned online co-op to work. Bandai said they'd be releasing a patch that makes it so you don't have to completely redo the story over when you start a new character, and once that patch rolls out I'll probably pick the game back up and level a few more characters. Until then, even the occasional raids (only on weekends, when I work a ton, thanks) can't convince me to launch this game again.  For what it's worth, I actually love this game. But that's only because I'm extremely biased. I grew up on DB/DBZ/DB:GT. If you're like me, and you love DB no matter what (even through the awful live action movie that we paid to go see in theaters), then pick this game up. You'll get enough nostalgia and 'wow that's really cool' moments to make up for the price tag.  For everyone else, I'd stick with XV1 first (while it's on sale too, since it's not for everyone) and if you like it, you can continue to this game.",

Each race and gender for that race so far from my experience each have thier own individual combo's and combat style for example Sayians, Males are geared more towards melee and Females towards Ki attacks and as such the males can combo alot more and easier but the females cant combo nearly as much but in terms of Ki damage they bring down the hammer.  Transformations are very enjoyable, you can start from stage 1 and work up to top form or jump the gun and go max form right off the bat, power down and take it easy, the choice is ultimately yours and how you want to play it, kaioken takes a bit more thinking when you decide to use it so powering down to normal state is a must to prevent staggering your character but while in it different stages give slightly different boosts such as increased damage and reduced dodging costs and final stage drains stamina but dodging costs no energy so very effective up close choice if you can learn to use it, other forms ive tried without mentioning generally increase certain stats or change the way character behaves in terms of ki blasts, speed, ki damage and so on, but as you more than likely already know the Majin transformation is extremely dissapointing but theres always the choice to take a different transformation skill instead.  Story, yeah its pretty much XV1 with a time over-lapse but this is a Dragonball game I wouldnt have it any other way, anyone thats played Budokai or Tenkaichi will know every game you play all the saga's start to finish, same sagas same battles but more characters and a better fighting system each time, thats exactly what this is, but you get Dragonball Super added into the mix and I predict like XV1 we will get GT arc as a DLC in the coming months and maybe add more super as the anime develops, but in all very enjoyable and even added some humor into the mix this time round, there are a couple more things I would touch upon but they will ruin the experience so ill keep that to myself :p  So, worth the money? if your a big Dragonball fan then yes it's worth it, some online content is slightly broken but it can all be done in offline mode so it wont ruin the game for you, if the price is what your debating on then id say wait a bit and see if it drops or you get a season pass thrown in, I had this pre-ordered and didnt get my Day 1 content on Day 1 but no suprise, either way you wont have that problem now.

However, if you were someone who was a fan of the first game and enjoyed playing it, you will enjoy this game even more because it takes the first game and builds off of it. The AI has been improved immensly and the PQ's are a whole lot of fun. Expert missions are also a nice addition to the game because they provide a fun challenge to players. The expert missions at the moment through are a bit broken to where it is near impossible to beat certain missions (mission 15). I feel like the issues will be fixed in time hopefully so im not going to give this game a thumbs down. The only other compliant I have for this game is the awkward camera angles. They do not always occur but they mess up combos and sometimes might cause you to lose a great deal of health from your opponent if you dont see where you are fighting. A lot more characters are in this game than the first one and a lot of the new characters were characters I was disapointed were not in the first game (Majin Vegeta, Android 16, First Form Cell, etc...) Overall, I highly suggest buying this game if you throughly enjoyed the first one and if you are just a huge fan of Dragon Ball in general.

A quick look at the pinned post about technical issues on the forum should provide ample reasons to not bite on this right now. Many crucial parts of the game don't function properly, and it's also got a nasty memory leak that's not affecting everyone, but makes the game barely playable for those who do get hit by it. I've been hit by the memory leak so many times that I can barely have the game open for more than a half hour before the stuttering becomes unbearable and/or the game crashes to desktop and takes other open processes with it. The mandatory Expert Mission tutorial is broken, and many can't progress past it. With how much of this game is locked behind story progress, it's debilitating that this has no signs of being fixed any time soon. There hasn't been a single patch in the past several weeks, and there's been no communication on when or even if one is coming soon. Some people aren't experiencing these issues at all, but the chance of being hit with the memory leaks and softlock glitches is enough reason to avoid it. I will change this review if the game is patched to a more acceptable state, but given the lack of communication, morale in the community is obviously rock bottom right now.",

While there's only so much you can do with a Time Patroller story in the game (DBZ only has one linear story), they still managed to change it up with new and revamped villians. There are a few new times and locations which is great. Story missions you played often make returns, but they don't play like they did in the first one (for some it's entirely different, but same story).  I feel the best addition lies in the fact that there's so much to do. There's never a time where you feel like you can't be doing something, and that's beyond the massive PQ grind. There's Elite Missions, Faction-themed groups and quests literally everywhere. Not to mention the time-gated events that only happen on weekends or periods throughout the day.",

            "review_text": "EDITED: Due to new changes made to the game with the recent patch / patches, it seems I have had to alter the content of my review.   NOT AS ADVERTISED!!  'Outcomes you wish were different' is what we were all hyped about during the promotional trailer, and unfortunately, we got to see none of it with the official release of the game. The only time you get even a hint of being able to alter history is with the bonus story unlocked after completing the main game, and even then, it's only two missions long and we don't get to see the outcome of what we've changed. Instead, the game hints at the possibility of these changes being further explored with upcoming DLC.  Does that mean that Xenoverse 2 is a bad game?   -------------------------------  Well, it's not terrible, but it's also not fresh, either. Once you strip away the hype, you realized that Xenoverse 2 is nothing more than an upgrade to Xenoverse 1. It's the way the game should have been from the start, or at least that's how it was during the initial release. But now, it seems like the game is going back to its original flaws.   Practically every racial transformation with the exception of Saiyans has been so heavily nerfed that they are practically worthless.   The Giant Nameks were nerfed to laughably pathetic degrees because some players complained they were too strong. Now, the transformation moves at a snail's pace (hah), and burns off your stamina bar within seconds of activating it. And without stamina, you can't dodge or block. It's basically a giant waste of time that hinders you more than it helps.   Majin Purification is also a massive stamina dump, AND it turns you into a carbon copy of Kid Buu. Seriously, you don't get to keep any of your skills, you get an exact copy of Kid Buu's. So if you aren't built as a Ki Blast specialist, you're going to find the transformation extremely weak.   The Turn Golden of the Frieza Race has been stripped of its speed boost (you know, the thing that made it useful) in favor of a basic ki blast upgrade (not, supers, just the basic). Unfortunately this upgrade has no auto tracking on it and is designed to be attached to a combo chain. So unless you're trained in the art of lengthy combos (i.e, a hard core gamer), you aren't going to find much use for this transformation which you won't even unlock until after the Buu saga, due to its high level requirement!   The human transformation is garbage. You can actually be knocked off the Flying Nimbus after just a few basic hits. Once again, it's a transformation that requires you to be a hard core gamer, because casual players won't be skilled enough to masterfully dodge all the enemy's attacks while laying down their own.   In other words, the thing that we all complained about from day one, Saiyan favoritism, is back in force. Every other racial transformation in the game is worthless, and not only that, but Saiyans have gotten EVEN MORE transformations this time around.  Super Saiyan now goes up to Super Saiyan 3, while Super Vegeta still goes up to Super Saiyan 2 level. But that's not all, because they also unlock FUTURE SUPER SAIYAN, which only goes up to rank 1, but can charge Ki faster than all the other forms.  And if that wasn't enough of a middle finger to non saiyan players, they've been dropping subtle hints throughout the game that future DLC will allow players to unlock the various forms of Super Saiyan God.  Nice job, Dimps, you've completely missed the point of why we wanted transformations in the first place!  ---------------------------------------------  And as for those 6 man raid quests (expert missions), they are currently bugged to the point of being literally impossible to complete. Expert bosses have a common glitch in which they will teleport outside the invisible walls of the map, becoming completely impervious to harm. Meanwhile, they will spend the rest of the fight bombarding you with Ki blasts until either your whole team gets wiped out, quits, or the timer runs out.   This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY!   ----------------------------------------------------   As I mentioned in my original review, Xenoverse 2 tries to upgrade Xenoverse 1, but does not add anything new to the game to make itself stand out. Roughly half of the 100 PQ's are ripped straight from Xenoverse 1, except they've added some extra enemies or power ups in an effort to make the fight seem harder.   Even the main story, if you pay attention to it, has almost the exact same plot as Xenoverse 1 (minus Demigra). The only difference being movie villains are sprinkled throughout the time line to aid the saga villains. And none of the heroes seem to have any memory of the Time Patrol's existence. Including Goku, who actually met the Time Patrol during the previous game.   --------------------------------------  Initially, I gave Xenoverse 2 a supporting thumbs up. But now that the hype has died down, and I've noticed the glaring flaws, the racially biased gameplay, and the lack of creativity this time around, I have to change my support to a disapproval.  Don't pay full price for a shinier new version of Xenoverse 1. Wait until this game goes on sale before you spend money on it.",

The netcode is also pretty bad, online matches are a complete toss up as to if you'll even be able to hit anyone with them lagging everywhere.  I would recommend this game for PC if it actually worked, so I will change this review once bugs have been fixed. However given XV1, im certain it will probably never get fixed.

What really ticked me off is the story, I only played for two hours, but within those two hours I saw The same raditz vs goku/piccolo fight, an unnecessaryly long tutorial missions, and the same bad guys from the first towa and Mira. And for some reason you can't fly at the start of the game so you have to walk everywhere at a slow pace. I did like some of the new missions like the places cut off by time distorsions, but that's not enough for me to justify the price.

You can play the Main Story + the big Sidequests in one row without much leveling and farming, you don't need to change your Master everytime, just do the lections to gain more nice attacks.   The best thing for me is, they changed the SSJ. You aren't on infinite KI, you don't waste KI to transform, you just transform when you have enough KI and gain a little less KI after then (by attacking) and you're stronger.  This is a realy good change and pretty good balanced.  Overall, buy it, play it, love it.",

This is terrible design and both rage and sleep inducing. - A ki based character is not as rewarding as in the previous game, many ki ultimate abilities are so bad compared to others they're nearly unusable. - NPC cutscenes when they appear during battle, often interrupts your ultimates and make them do nothing. This could just be a pop-up while you maintain full control of your character. - The cutscenes can become annoying when you want fast paced action. - Still no male Super Buu male Majin as custom character. Super Buu is like the true Buu, the fat one is fat because he absorbed a kai. - No option to play the story as regular character.   It's good almost everything got added from Xenoverse to this one while having more content added, but some combat changes are just terrible and does ruin the fun sometimes. Overall this game feels more clunky than the previous game, because of things like the stamina staggering and the scripted cutscenes. This makes the core of the gameplay less fluent and enjoyable. This game can't be considered an upgrade if you already own Xenoverse.  6/10",

            "review_text": "Resumed review: Xenoverse 2 is an improved and refined Xenoverse 1 and if you are a fan of Dragon Ball, or like fun, fast paced fighting games, get it. The game has a much improved combat system that is miles better than Xenoverse 1 and the options for customizing your character (with clothes) make it much more enjoyable. A lackluster campaign and lack of anti cheat are the only downsides for this game in my opinion.      Long form:   Now, I will start out with the biggest problem for me: The story mode. This game's story feels rushed and inconclusive for the most part. Your CaC from the previous game seems added like an afterthought and it really is useless to have it or a generic time patroler. If you don't have the previous game, you are not missing out. This is a shame really and a big lost opportunity imho as having your previous CaC interact with your CaC more and go on missions with you would have been awesome!  Also, the villains feel weak and kind of tacked on. For instance, I didn't realize that I had beaten Turtles and Slug for the last time until I saw them as Instructors and finished the story. You just defeat them in a normal battle without anything indicating that this will be the last time you will face them and the dialog will not clue you in.   So, the story mode is my biggest complaint as a missed opportunity and I think that Xenoverse 1 had a better story.  Now, the bad parts of the game: Bugs and lack of anti cheat system... The game suffers from some annoying bugs and the lack of an anti cheat is really apnnoying for online combat as it makes combat outside of limited matches annoying since you have the random chance of catching a cheater and it can ruin the immersion. However, if you manage to beat one it is very satisfying.  Now for the good part: The game itself is awesome. Seriously awesome. The game hub which I never cared about in the previous instalment is really cool and really busy. So much so that you always have things to do be it talk to instructors, get new emojis (surprisingly funny) or just travel to special quests and challenges that the game keeps throwing your way. This makes leveling up very easy as the side quests provide you with a lot of XP. I was level 40 before I unlocked the online portion of the game for you to have an idea... Also, the game feels a lot less grindy and that is good because it lets you focus on the best part of the game. Another good change was the RPG system where you have a nonlinear progress which makes the game much better. You start getting 2 points for the first level up, then you get 3 until level 20 or so, then you start getting 4,5, 6 and 7 points per level!!!! As you reach level 60 you start going backwards to 6, 5, 4 and 3 again which is really cool. It makes high level characters feel that much more high level. Which brings us to character costumization which is amazing thanks to the QQ bang system allowing you to wear whatever clothes you fancy without worrying about the stats.   The best part: The combat. The combat in this game is so awesome. Serious improvement over the previous instalment and I mean it. The combat is extremely fluid and you can really get the feeling of each character playing differently and, your CaC changing as you progress through the game. You also have different ways that super attacks and ultimates work making the game just feel tighter. And, the game ranked match with limitations is a really welcome adition as it makes cheaters a non issue since you get a set ammount of stats and a level playing field so that skill is the factor that matters.   In Conclusion: A very good upgrade from Xenoverse 1 and a very nice fighting game overall. Its combat changes and transformation changes alone make it worth to get it. Best dragon ball game I ever played and I have played a lot of them (Budokai 2 and 3, Budokai Tenkaichi 1, 2 and 3, Dragon Ball Super, Burst Limit). This is by far the best.",

In fact, the gameplay, story progression, and even character design are actually worse. The only two things they did improve on was the graphics and the special attacks (ie. the two main things they needed in order to market the game in trailers).  I was a huge fan of the original and pre-ordered the DLC for both. That said, I will be returning this game for a full refund. (I didn't even bother to mention all the early releases bugs either)  In essence, they ironically did the same thing as Skyrim Special Edition, except that SPE was at least honest about what it was.

            "review_text": "This game is hard for me to review, because I really want to love it, and there are a few things it does right that make me feel like it's still worth the amount of time I've invested into it thus far, but the worst parts of it shine through way too much and keep this from being one of my favorite Dragon Ball games.  What it does right is fix some of the more annoying issues from the previous Xenoverse game. Originally, only one mentor would show up in the hub world and it was pretty much up to RNG whether or not the one you wanted would be there (alongside your current master) so you'd have to go in and out and repeat missions over and over and then search the whole hub world hoping to find the master you wanted, and even then, it'd take grinding missions over and over and over again to unlock their next lesson by building up their friendship meter. Thankfully that is gone this time around and whenever a new instructor appears in the hub world, they stay there for good and you only need to complete advancement tests every so often to unlock new lessons and therefore moves, and the map shows you where they are at all times and when they have a new lesson available or not. Another small but welcome change is an indicator during Parallel Quests that show where the next gate you need to go through is and whether or not there's still an objective to do in that area. This wasnt present in the last game and it was easy to waste time looking for where you needed to go in missions. Also with the presence of so many mentors and so many quests to complete, it's quite easy to come across experience points in this game, meaning you're likely to hit the level cap or at the very least get fairly high up there by simply playing what's available in the game, which can make leveling up feel like less of a grind fest.  As for the cons...there is a lot wrong with this game that keeps it from being as fun as it could be. For one thing, AI is still very annoying whether they're on your side or not. You could be trying to combo an opponent or hit them with a super or ultimate attack and either they run away or sidestep your move or your allies are throwing them around, making you waste all of your energy you built up and more or less forcing you to stamina break opponents to reliably land ANY ki super attacks. Sometimes all they do is run away, which on top of there being time limits to missions (which is still stupid as some missions last so ridiculously long that there is no possible way to beat it in that time frame and you lose to the clock more than you would losing your health) is infuriating to say the least. Also while the new combos are a welcome change and make the fighting look much cooler than in the previous game, these require precise timing, and if you're having performance issues, it's going to be hard to ever land some of these, and sometimes you just knock them so far away that chasing them results in stopping short and missing them anyway. Also while more content is nice, the sheer number of parallel quests is absurd, and it doesnt take long for completing these to feel like a chore, especially if you've already hit the level cap and you're just going for completion.  Unfortunately this game is also riddled with glitches that on top of the other problems with this game turn it into a rage fest. Quite often objectives, especially enemies will get stuck inside geometry or under the map and force you to retry missions or hope that you have an energy attack with enough splash damage to damage them while they're stuck in the floor, and this glitch happened to me A LOT which for a game like this is absolutely inexcusable. Some attacks are glitched too such as Innocence Cannon, which result in failing a training mission over and over again because no matter how many times you use the attack, it wont fire, and if it does, you're more than likely to miss due to the godawful tracking in this game (as in the last one, the camera zooms in on your character when you do these moves and you cant see where they're going to go and enemies can move while this is happening, so it's sometimes a matter of pure luck whether or not you'll hit with any of them) meaning you'll be redoing some missions over and over and over again because broken or flat out awful moves and frustrating AI make it absurdly hard to land attacks on your opponent. This game crashes a lot as well even if you have a powerful rig, so there have been times where I lost progress or had to hard shut down my computer altogether due to this game.  Altogether, it's not an awful game, I wouldnt have invested as much time into these games as I have if I hated them, but they are far from perfect, and frankly I wouldnt have minded if this one had perhaps come out a year from now to give the developers time to polish it and remove the obnoxious glitches plaguing the game. Wouldnt say it's worth the price I paid for the season pass on top of the game and pre order bonus by far, do yourself a favor and just get the base version if you're going to play this. You'll enjoy most of it if you enjoyed the first one, but this is a seriously flawed game series that had a lot of potential that it failed to meet.",

Us as a community has to call them out in order to make change, Eventually they have to listen to us, or else they won't have any business.   I've been having some glitches at the moment, I can't really hear any of the dialogue while I'm in a mission, I can hear the characters clearly when they're in a cut scene, but while I'm in game, I have to rely on the subtitles. I've also have been having problems with getting Black Goku, I have the Vehicle, but not the character. Also, I've also have been getting issues transferring one of my characters from the previous game, I have not come across a Tutorial on how to do that yet.   All though it has it's flaws, it's pretty solid. It needs a couple updates for it to be a fully polished game. All we need is patience. Keep in mind that this is been the second day of it's release on the Pc, and it's pretty common to have a few glitches in a game; Although, I'm kinda upset that the developers haven't double checked before releasing it, but Imma give them the benefit of the doubt (for now).",

That said, if you are familiar with the series and played Xenoverse before, then this basically Dragonball Xenoverse the Deluxe Edition. It’s not exactly a sequel, more of a refined and expanded Game of the Year edition of previous title!  Pros –   * Lots for Dragonball fans to enjoy!  * Expanded Xenoserve with larger HUB town, more tasks to do, and things to collect.  * Very good graphics and runs stable of higher end rigs.  * Playing with friends is delightful.  * Game is fluid, fast, and very deep. Will take a long time to master.  Cons –  *Currently, Lots and lots and lots and lots of bugs. At the time of writing there is a huge list of issues on the forums, check those before you consider purchasing. Joysticks get inverted controls in menus, which revert back in some instances. Custom layouts reset to default in Multiplayer, various crashing, connection drops, etc etc. They are releasing updates and patches, but it may take several weeks if not a month or more before things start being stable overall. Purchase at your own risk and expect things to mess up.  *On the surface it feels like a bargin-bin game, but it's better than it the character animations and bad voice acting suggest.  *Online Multiplayer is lacking a lot of depth and control. Room creation is a chore.  *Denied access to the Multiplayer Lobby and Flight in HUB until you complete Frieza Saga, which saps some fun out, but you can join Multiplayer rooms via NPCs though until then.  *AI in PVP matches cannot be controlled or scaled, it’s set to extreme difficult by default and can be very, very hard to deal with. If you’re new to the game can get decide to fill a slot with a Computer AI, expect the AI to destroy everybody in the room unless your friends are well-versed in the game.  *Story Chit-Chat often goes on for ages mid-fight, even after you’ve beaten everyone in the zone. There is no way to skip in-mission dialogue and it can force you to take more damage than you desire. It’ll make certain NPCs invulnerable at the last sliver of their health, which can be frustrating. ",

The time that I would spend on the aspects I find fun, like hunting down rare moves and perfecting your character, now has to go into just doing the same pretty big project I already did  Its just a detail and besides that the game is much better than X1, but its still a really dumb thing that makes me feel less enthused about the game overall. Hopefully it will be changed",

The concept, control, and setup of the game has been somewhat difficult to grasp initially because I've never played anything like this before, PC or otherwise. But it's more or less intuitive so thankfully I was able get the hang of it relatively quickly. Now something to consider is instead of using a keyboard/mouse type setup, a controller (e.g., Xbox One, Steam) may be a more suitable alternative for that fluid and responsive gaming experience. Furthermore, it is a very enjoyable game that's charged with fulfilling adventure and encapsulating lore ─ it'll keep drawing you in! What's more, the allure of improvement and constant progession is slow but sure. Lastly, the camaraderie here in DBX2 is absolutely invigorating ─ the entire experience is accentuated with friends!  Quickly, some things I would change/enhance would include:   -Enhancing the trading system to allow for a more diverse range of items to be exchanged amongst players to include all ranks, not just Rank 2 and below -Implement a more comprehensive clothing customization system with clothes other than Gi's and combat armor -Allow modification of the player model without having to use a wish -Allow for more than one accessory to be worn at one time -Allow funds transfers between players -Implement a way for players in teams or otherwise to be shown in the map for quicker locating -Enhance the multi lobby system so that friends are able to join in the same location instead of having to create a team and manually locate each other ",

(I'll probably update my review if there has been any changes or fixes later on within a few months).  EDIT: In the current state of this game, I don't feel like it should be played anyone who is willing to play a game that has tons of bugs at the moment. I do like this game (I say this a lot), but what I'm hearing about the Bandai Namco rumors and such, this should not be recommended to anyone yet.  I really like this game, mainly because I am a huge fan of the Dragon Ball series. The game is for those like grinding in MMOs, and/or those who are fans of Dragon Ball. When I played it, it wasn't bad considering that this is my first time playing the second game of the Xenoverse series (Never played the first, got to see the gameplay of it and it was interesting). The game's MMO style really kicks in for me, and because of that unique style of gameplay, I grinded out the entire game out as much as I could. I'm hoping they would release more content, maybe relative to the Dragon Ball Super arcs, because after finishing the entire story, everything fell short and all there was left to do was to do the parallel quests, and/or expert missions (those were annoying to complete considering they had TONS of bugs). However, as I played the game continuously for hours on end, this game had a couple of bugs here and there when I played by myself. For example, there are bugs such as Great Ape being outside of the arena (unable to reach), not-so-smart AI, bosses placed under the arena, etc. These things usually happen in expert missions. The game could use some improvements for gameplay, such as skipping the tutorial when a player has already done it (and was playing for the second time). There still needs to be polishing since the game recently released this year. PC seemed to have a lot more issues than it did for console, however, the gameplay and content is very much fun to play as a solo-player, or with a group of friends. Would I recommend this game? Hell yeah I would, especially those that love the Dragon Ball series. If you ignore the negative reviews, and the bugs/glitches, and focus on the content, and gameplay (as a fan), it really isn't a bad game. Though it will be some time to get these bugs fixed up in a next few months. I guarantee it will be worth your fifty-dollars enjoying this game.  Pros: - There are variety of characters you can use when you do regular quests; you don't have to use your own character. - Plotline is very interesting (no spoilers). - Graphics are smooth, regardless of what settings you put it on compatible for your PC/Console. - Fight style is also interesting, has several combos to choose from to defeating an opponent. - There are TONS of skills to use from, from the Saiyan arc, all the way to the Beerus arc, and those from instructors. - Intriguing designs for character looks, ranging from the first quest all the way to the end.  Cons (Bugs/Glitches): - EXPERT MISSIONS can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥, considering that bosses can glitch out of the 'box zone' as I like to call it, and a ton of bugs/glitches involved.  - The AI in EXPERT MISSIONS are really bad at determining whether to help you or not - CHALLENGE QUESTS are a little wacky on PC; when your instructor teaches you to follow a combo pattern, they mess up and they get stuck trying to figure out what they did wrong. - Game crashes at the random times, may crash after you make a wish to Shenron (might be just me)",

This game is basically what Xenoverse 1 should've been from the get go. It expanded the rpg elements and the story elements vastly. It includes charcters that are rarely seen outside the movies or maybe manga. IE Turles and Lord Slug and Bardock. The combat is bit more fluid and better done. My primary issue with the first game is as you got the higher levels the game got easier to play. That was a case of a poor AI programming. The AI is vastly superior to the pervious game. It will give you a challenge.   Some nitpicky thing I have but I think its a matter of it being a Japanese game primarly and not made for the english market. The voice and movements are sometimes out of sync but I do notice when the voice is switched to Japanese its synced. So this issue would prolly require a patch engine level. I've only had a handful of framerate issues. (Only when their was a lot of NPCs and doing a lot ki based attacks)   I've personally only experniced one crash the whole time. So I have no clue why others having issues with bugs.   I cannot comment on the Multiplayer expernice as I am not really a Multiplayer kinda guy.  8.5/10",

All the games that have come out so far have fell on their face and need more work, but this one only need a few patches and it will be great.",

No the issues I have with this game are that the combo system doesnt work well with all races ( namekian, sayian *cough*)  the issues and bugs that are being talked about I do experince but being a long term gamer I know that ALL GAMES have issues. We use to call them gliches and used them to our advantange lol.  Wish the game could be better but still a fun game.",

Because that is why I do not recommend this game.  The issues bombarding this game range from horrible game connections that cause both disconnects and (rarely) crashes. The amount of content that is blocked by bugs is beyond the realm of 'Oh its just some release day bugs' considering the game has been out for (more or less) 3 weeks at the time of this review. The thing about the game currently is that it is riddeled with bugs with the servers, the expert missions, the cutscenes, and multiple more crippling glitches that hold this game back from being what I would consider an amazing game and a perfect sequal to Xenoverse 1.  If I could make you a reccomendation, I would purchase this video game with the knowledge that this game is riddeled with problems.  If you want some examples: -Cutscenes have glitches in them such as beams not going away after being fired -[SEE REVISION] -Crashing is frequent as it is unpredictable -Expert missions cannot be completed due to enemies going outside of the map and/or dissappearing altogether -Multiple issues with super attacks working correctly -Character transfer problems ranging from incorrect former character appearance or (in some cases) the character being replaced with a male human with no items to transfer -Day one DLC not working (Supposedly this has been fixed for most people) -Multiplayer servers being comparable to Xenoverse 1 multiplayer servers -And more problems that I feel arent nessecary to get into (chances are you'll find them yourself)  This game has potential. Actually, no this game is at the penticle of realized potential when it comes both to the Xenoverse line of games and in Dragon Ball Games in general, however the amount of glitches in this game are far to vast for me to be able to say 'go ahead and buy this game, you will not be dissapointed with any part of it.'  **REVISION** -Through some anger-induced atrempts I have found that 'Innocence Cannon' does work on occasion. -Massive Fixes as of update 1.03 thankfully",

I meet the reccomended specs, and yet the game runs like liquid ♥♥♥♥ down a brick wall. to give you an idea, I can't progress in the story because by the time I can manage to attack, the enemy has ♥♥♥♥ed off to the other side of the map. I'm sure it's a great game, but I wouldn't be able to tell you myself, as the ♥♥♥♥ing game doesn't want to work. As well as the preorder glitches, the ♥♥♥♥ing glitch where an enemy will suddenly root themselves into the ground, or when you jump in the hubworld and suddenly fall through the ♥♥♥♥ing floor, and the blatant bait and switching, this game gets a big thumbs down. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ So, with the latest updates, the game actually runs decently. If you liked Xenoverse 1, you'll probably enjoy 2. There are some key changes that make the game more fun, I think. It feels more like a Dragonball game now. Every race has a transformation (which strikes me as odd for humans but whatever, nice the humans get some love too.), and the combat has been improved. It feels a bit more fluid now, less like the stiff spam of Xenoverse 1. Speaking of spam, Super Saiyan no longer gives you infinite ki. Sorry ki blast spammers, you have to actually think about what you should do now. Transformations aren't just for show now. they provide a rather noticeable buff to your stats depending on which transformation you use. There are more colorable clothes now, too, which was a complaint I had with the first game. Sure, most of them are basically just the same outfit but with a different logo stuck to it, but atleast now you can have some sense of individuality. Speaking of clothes, the skill boost from clothes are still a thing. But you can combine two articles of clothing and an item to create a QQ bang at Capsule Corp. You can now wear what you want to wear, not what your playstyle dictates that you must wear. The game feels like it's less about chance, and more about skill. Now that the game's bugs have been more or less fixed, I reccomend picking up the game. Especially now while it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR - Not Budokai 3, more like Tenkaichi 3.  It's a good game, but it's lacking in depth. If you're a DBZ fan you're likely going to enjoy it of course, and there's a lot of fun to be had customizing your avatar and playing parallel quests. There's a lot of content on the surface: a ton of quests, a story mode of average length, and many playable characters from the DBZ universe. However, once you finish the story and do the parallel quests you're interested in, there isn't much else to do.  Of course there's always going online and fighting other players in PVP, but the system wasn't designed to be a competitive fighting game, there are tons of exploits and cheese strats all over the PVP ranked gameplay. You can get really good at the game, but doing so would require slogging through a bunch of matches where you don't really have fun because you're getting beat by an exploit or using one. Not to mention hackers run rampant online on the PC version, there are no checks for them. As a matter of fact, someone started hacking against me in a Player Match because he was losing too often for his tastes. There was nothing even on the line for him, he just did it because he could get away with it.  That's not to say the PVP is all bad. It's honestly a lot of fun as long as you're playing with the right people. The cheese strats can be evaded and countered if you're willing to learn. Beating people with your favorite Dragon Ball character feels great. There is skill involved, of course there is skill involved. The better player will win most of the time, countering exploits comes down to the knowledge you have. But why counter the broken stuff when you can use it and win twice as easily?   Basically, what I'm trying to say here is if you're looking for a deep, possibly competitive experience with Xenoverse 2, you're looking in the wrong place. However, if you want to just have a good time playing with the characters you know and love, and even building a powerful character from the ground up to fight alongside them, this is definitely the game for you.",
