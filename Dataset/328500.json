            "review_text": "Not sure how much simpler things can get and still remain entertaining, but if the mobile market is any indication of this, then there is still a LOT of creativity left to play around with using the bare minimums of entertainment. Sometimes all you need is a stick, a ball, and an endless road.    Gameplay: 82/100 B- Potatoman Seeks the Troof is a little game that took me two minutes to download and just a few more to finish, but those were some of the most enjoyable minutes I have had with such an easy game. You have two controls: left, right, and jump. With those at your disposal, you make your way jumping and dodging various obstacles. You will soon learn that this game is not easy at all. Obstacles don't just sit, some jump, some grow, some multiply right into your path, and so on and so forth, it's enough to keep you on your toes...that is until you figure out the patterns for most of them. The aerial obstacles are a bit more difficult to navigate, which actually makes the replayability a little bit better.  Audio: 70/100 C- The sounds, like the gameplay is simple and basic, reminiscent of the Colecovision and Atari era of gaming, both paying homage and still being a modern game. It's charming, but nothing special.  Visuals: 74/100 C- 8-Bit galore, at first. The game sports the simplest of graphics, having a ton of colors and animations here and there, but things come alive when you die, of all places, as a semi 3D, blue and red hue filters everything and spins away.  Content: 75/100 C Like I mentioned at the start, this isn't a particularly long game, but it is one you can play at a party over and over, it's simple enough that anyone can get, has enough variety to keep it challenging and definitely something you can share with others. And I'm sure kids will have more fun with this game than they will with Flappy Bird.  Design: 75/100 C When dealing with the limited movements it really isn't hard to screw up and while they're not perfect, they are solid and do what they need to do. Sometimes there is some detection issues, but then again, that could just be me as well.   Performance: 80/100 B- Potatoman plays very well on my PC and probably works very well on the mobile platforms as well. It isn't processor heavy at all and doesn't have the common issues higher end games.   Verdict: 76/100 C+ It's charming. It's cute. It's colorful. It's solid. Share it to your friends. Give it to a kid. It'll keep them occupied. It's nothing grand, but not everything needs to be.",

            "review_text": "The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum L. The word 'potato' may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were introduced outside the Andes region approximately four centuries ago, and have since become an integral part of much of the world's food supply. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize, wheat, and rice. The green leaves and green skins of tubers exposed to the light are toxic.  Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas from the United States to southern Chile.The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex), where they were domesticated approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago. Following centuries of selective breeding, there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes. Over 99% of the presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes.  However, the local importance of the potato is variable and changing rapidly. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. As of 2007 China led the world in potato production, and nearly a third of the world's potatoes were harvested in China and India.   10/10",
