    "description": "The Sherlock Holmes series returns with this updated version of The Awakened, which brings a whole new dimension to the original title developed by Frogwares. Keeping with the traditional Point &amp; Click gameplay style of the original adventure games, The Awakened has been totally rethought, offering players a new third-person view...",

            "review_text": "The setup sounds great, Holmes &amp; Watson inexplicably drawn into a world of fantasy horror... Except the follow-through is a boring and groan inducing embarrassment. It has little to do with either the works of Conan Doyle or Lovecraft and the tonally devoid hot mess that follows is evident of that. Looking at it simply as a game it's a frustrating series of clumsy and broken puzzle mechanics; if you've come for a narrative or engrossing world though then you're really in trouble. The plot attempts to string together kidnappings in England, an asylum in Switzerland, a swamp in New Orleans and finally a lighthouse in Scotland using some vague Cthulhu cult to no definable end. It's all so disjointed you realize about halfway through that none of the developers actually read any of Lovecraft's stories. Professor Sullivan has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo but nowhere in the narrative is Innsmouth (home to The Esoteric Order Of Dagon) or any of the creatures of Lovecraft's mythos. Cthulhu himself is never even mentioned by name! So what you're left with is less a sect and more a social club that stuff dead people full of squid and call it a herald of the apocalypse. It's also really, really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. It doesn't work as a mystery, it doesn't work as fantasy horror, and it just plain doesn't work as a game.",

            "review_text": "This game has too many flaws to be recommended on its own. I bought it as a bundle containing a lot of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed it thinking that the other games were enough for the price I payed but I wouldn't pay for it on its own.  The reason I don't think it is worth buying itself is the badly executed gameplay mechanics. Through the game you have to switch between third person and first person. A lot of the first person perspective gameplay is just too difficult. The areas are huge. I don't think many people like pixel hunts in giant 3D environments.. There is a hotspot highlighter but not all hotspots highlight depending on which perspective you are playing from. You also have to get really really close to some of the hotspots to make them highlight.  The trigger mechanism of the game is also annoying. The game will wait until you have located all the hotspots in a certain area before the plot can advance and some of these aren't very relevant to the plot and can be really hard to find.  In theory you can consult the game's built in hint system but it reveals more spoilers than help.  This is all a shame as the plot and character scripts are really, really, good. Playing it with a walkthrough close to hand I actually really enjoyed the story and some of the puzzles which didn't require too much hunting in huge 3D locations.  If you happen to be buying a bundle of Sherlock games then 'Testament', 'Silver Earring', or 'vs Arese Lupin' are worth about $10 each on their own so don't be put off by the inclusion of 'Awakened' but I wouldn't buy it alone.",

I have checked and have definitely been through and done all I am meant to but for some reason the cut sequence will not trigger. Damned if I'm bothering to go through all that again. Shame, as it was great before that. Poor show, Holmes.",

I found myself looking up a couple of walk throughs as some seemed pretty difficult to understand. The 1st person was awesome for the type of game this is(detective puzzle solving). I still recommend it even though it is a little outdated.",

            "review_text": "It's a riff on Lovecraft, with everything that entails. I mean, I enjoyed it, and I'm not a huge Holmes fan. There's some pixel hunting, and the controls are straight up never actually explained, and there's one point in the game where those two things combine in a terrible way, because you can't continue until you've found every single hotspot in the area, and there's a lot of them, most duplicates of each other.  But it's a fun romp, technical problems aside. There's a really cute vaugely in-joke during one of the cutscenes, and of course if you've ever read The Call of Cthulu the endgame is hugely obvious from about five minutes in, though the game tries really, really hard to conceal it, which I found hilarious. If you're a fan of Holmes, you'll more than likely enjoy it. If you're a fan of Lovecraft, you'll more than likely enjoy it.",
