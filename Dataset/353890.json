            "review_text": "I really like the other games from Big Ant (especially Don Bradman Cricket 14, but Rugby League 3 too) and I bought Lacrosse 16 because it's from them. I had never seen a Lacrosse game before, I only knew it's a rather exotic sport from Canada and I was curious. And hey, it is like Ice Hockey on grass. Similar pace, similar fun, similar rules, easy to learn. The controls (especially the shooting) seemed strange to me at first (moving the right stick instead of pressing a button), but I got used to them and won some matches already. I love sports games, and I love them even more if they are not from EA and cost less than EA's games.",

            "review_text": "Casey Powell 16 is an excellent game that captures the speed, physicality, look and sound of field lacrosse, plus it strikes a good balance between being a fun sports title and a realistic sports sim.  On the field, the controls are tight and responsive ensuring fluid offensive and defensive play, while the AI keeps a realistic flow to play and player movements. It really does look and feel like lacrosse. And speaking of looks, this game looks fabulous. The players, field, and stadium are all decked out in lush current gen graphical goodness. Note: More on graphics below.) For an indie game, it has the visual look and feel of a big studio product and in my opinion this makes CP16 a milestone achievement for a crowd funded game. And there’s plenty of ways to get to the field - there’s single games, a decent (but not overly deep) career mode, and tournament modes.  And special mention for the excellent Lacrosse Academy in-game editor that gives you the ability to fully manage tactics, rosters, and starting lineups, plus create custom teams, players, coaches, and even referees. While this game doesn’t carry official licenses from either the NCAA or Major League Lacrosse, the developers have invented a fabulous trick the very first time you start the game. The first time you turn on the game you have the option to update all the rosters to the highest rated teams available from the community through the Lacrosse Academy. That means you can instantly update your rosters from the generic teams that come with the game to 67 real NCAA teams or the nine MLL pro teams. Granted, there’s not official logos for any of the college or pro teams, but it’s a great feature and one that I hope other studios picks up on with their titles.  With all that said, here’s the downer. As noted above, this game is beautiful but be forewarned that you’re going to need a powerful PC to play with decent graphics. This is an all out current gen game and to get the max out of the graphics (PS4 or Xbox One equivalent) you’re going to need a rocket ship of a PC.  All in all, as a representation of the game of field lacrosse, this game is very well done and compares to any sports game offered by 2K, EA, or other big outfits. Even if you’re not a lax guy, this is a great sports title.  Now how about that box lacrosse title?",

            "review_text": "This game was in the works for quite some time. It was originally called LAX 15... Majority of the time wasted making this game didnt go into actual gameplay. It went to getting its kickstarter backers in the game. The devs were completely quiet about the release date for a long time and then when they finally released it decided all those kickstarter funds werent enough, so they slapped a 50 dollar price tag on something which should be 30 at most. The gameplay is ok at best and there isnt much to it. If this game was priced at 25 bucks id say absolutely yes and thumb it up without thinking about it because its lacrosse and i can play it on my pc. However, the devs got greedy and asked for 50.   Thank you for bringing a lax game but some of the ways you did it sucked. Hope to see better from you guys next year i will change my review when the price drops",
