I love a good challenge and this is the most challenging game in the Ys series. Many people won't ever complete it on Normal difficulty (you can choose an easier difficulty though). The boss battles in this game are extremely challenging, yet not cheap in the slightest. You need to learn how to dodge all enemy attacks and you will feel great about doing it with this fantastic combat system.   Theres nothing special about the storyline or graphics in this game, its obvious that everything was spent on developing the combat system and boss battles. You have a main town that you visit for supplies and forging new equipment, while traveling the world for new dungeons to explore. Theres lots of secrets, upgrades and new abilities to find throughout the game. Theres also some small sidequests you can complete for achievements and other rewards.  The game will last you around 15 hours and you unlock a Boss Rush aftering completing the game. If you like action RPGs, this is a must buy.",

            "review_text": "No nonsense ARPG. This is what all RPGs should strive to be. No melodrama. No sissy boy main characters. No overly dramatic crap. No desire to be a movie masquerading as a barely playable game. No 'OMG look at these graphics' to distract you from how much crap the rest of the game is. Here it is the rest of the game that wows you.  The plot is simple and I like that. It doesn't take itself seriously. What this game does take seriously is the gameplay. The combat is fun. You can avoid enemies. No random encounters. No crap loot either. Everything has a purpose. You don't need to waste your time doing inventory management. No useless items. No useless spells. It is a finely balanced game.   After playing this game, I wonder, why the hell are all other games not like this.  Where other games randomly generate crap loot for you to search through. This game has a very very limited inventory, all useful during the time they are available to you. You don't need to manage inventory, wondering if you need to drop X to make room for Y.   Where other games randomly generate dungeons for you. This game gives you hand crafted dungeons that require some good platforming to get hidden treasure.  Where other games throw a million abilities and spells at you; half of which are useless against the majority of enemies, this game gives you 4 abilities. All of them useful.  This game is a masterpiece. You cannot take away anything from it without totally ruining. And if you were to add anything you would probably just ruin the precise balance of it.  If you enjoyed Dark Souls/Demon Souls. These games are a level of precision above those.",

            "review_text": "Ys: The Oath in Felghana reminds me of Secret of Mana or The Soul Blazer series. It's a hack and slash rpg where you slay monsters and kill tough bosses to progress through the entire game. I liked Oath in Felghana because after playing Ys Chronicles, the game remains true to the series even if you can't bump into enemies anymore. So what did I think about it? Lets see...  Graphics: This game is a port from the PSP version that was released a few years ago. I liked how Oath of Felghana now has 3d backgrounds or monsters but still maintains a 2d layout. The sprites look nice if you set your graphics to the highest, but I personally think they are simple. I still find the game to great, even with it's cutscenes which look decent but could be better.  Sound: I really thought the sound department went forth and had fun making the music. There are good songs, but I just don't find myself to play over and over again. Sound effects are pretty basic, but I don't think that matters. There was never a moment where I just wanted to put my own music to the game which is a plus in my own opinion.  Gameplay: If you played Ys Chronicles, you realize that you can't bump into enemies like you used to for exp. There's now an attack button which can be used to string combos to gain exp. What I find the most rewarding is the three magics you obtain in the game. My favorite is probably the wind power since you use it to get to treasures and to another section of the level. If there is one thing I really enjoyed the most are the bosses. Playing on past normal is a challenge as it requires you to be quick about your actions and for you to time your attacks. The game is hard if you're not leveled correctly but it doesn't take you long to be strong enough to take on a boss.   Overall: I consider Ys: The Oath in Felghana a great purchase if you enjoy J-rpgs that aren't complex, yet easy to play but difficult to master. I think falcom did great with this remake because it adds a new chapter in the Ys storyline for American audiences and it is faithful to the first two Ys games in the series.",

            "review_text": "It's too bad the Ys games aren't more popular, because they're a ton of fun. Although I can understand why this is the case; if you want a deep story with well-developed characters in a rich, vibrant world, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. (Or you could read a book.)  However, if your cup of tea happens to be runney-jumpey-hackey-slashey-swing-your-swordey-things-get-deadey gameplay where you mow down swarms of monsters, all building up to fights against gargantuan, screen-filling bosses with heavy rock music playing in the background, then you should totally give the Ys series a try. Like I said, they're a lot of fun.  I haven't played all the games in the series, but out of the ones I have played, I feel that The Oath in Felghana is pretty good game to start out with. I &amp; II are fun, but very much showing their age; Seven is a good one also (and was actually my first Ys game), but it's only for PSP. I would actually argue that Origin is better than The Oath in Felghana, but being a prequel, it does have some spoilers for Ys I, and it doesn't have everyone's favorite mute redheaded berserker.  Every Ys game also comes with multiple difficulty settings, so if you want to let off steam by making everything that looks at you the wrong way your ♥♥♥♥♥, there's Easy and Very Easy. If you like a really good challenge, there's Nightmare and Inferno. And yes, holding down your jump button (at least I think it's the jump button, off the top of my head) speeds up the text scrolling in the cutscenes.  Speaking of buttons, if you have a USB controller, you're definitely going to want to dust it off; in my opinion, Ys games weren't meant to be played with a keyboard.",

            "review_text": "After months of wondering if I'd lost interest in video games, this one got me hooked from beginning to end. As a long time gamer, I enjoyed Y's 3 back in the day on the SNES. This is a great example of a re-imagining done right. The people who worked on this game seem to have a deep understanding of good game design and know what keeps a player interested without adding any fluff. There is plenty of new content that wasn't in the original, and all of it improves upon the old foundation.  If I had to suggest improvements, I'd ask that the easy mode was a little bit less easy (maybe 2/3rds damage instead of half damage from enemies. There is an included 'Very Easy' mode after all.) Normal mode required a bit more dying, grinding, or perfect pattern memorization than I'd prefer, and bosses often had a few moves that seemed to be unavoidable. It would have been great if the original soundtrack was included as well, but I wouldn't hold that against the game.   I'd love to see more games like this in the future. 9/10.",

It was a side-scroller, played a lot like Zelda 2. However, it received a lot of backlash from fans, but Falcom took notice and eventually remade Ys III in the style of the previous game (released before Oath in Felghana), Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, but greatly improved on its' engine. And not just that, but the story was retold in both a different and yet similar way and the music was given a complete overhaul as well. It's easily my favourite game in the series, I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a challenge. And Zelda-like games.",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely phenomenal !  Not because of a story, which is barebone and extremely cliche, but for the action and gameplay. Ys is of course from a long line of older ARPG, but if you would like to compare it to a modern game, that would be Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls. All 3 of theses games share the same philosophy. They are tough as nails, but they are fair.  Ys is all about skill. You discover new enemies, new bosses, and at the beginning it seems completely impossible, all the odds are stacked against you. Then you start noticing the attack patterns of the enemies. Then you start countering them and damaging them. Then you start feeling in control. But suddenly, with the boss at mid health, it is now using new patterns, and killing you fast ! But then you start noticing patterns again...and the circle can continue again...  You will die in Ys. You will die a lot in Ys. You will despair, you will rage against the game. But in your heart, you know the game is fair, it is just asking you to hone your skills to prove worthy of victory. And when finally, after countless retries you will manage to defeat that boss you've been stuck on forver, all your previous despair will turn into pure joy, and a feeling of true accomplishment.  All of that will also be amplified by the beauty of this game. Even though it's obviously dated, the rich environements and superb boss attacks will make you wonder how modern games can look so boring. There are some attack patterns and bosses that just look fantastic, original, and never before seen. That truely makes the game unique.",

            "review_text": "Arguably the greatest game in the Ys series.  Ys takes nearly all the extraneous elements of RPGs and tosses them all out in favour of a super streamlined action battle system with some of the greatest bosses gaming has ever seen. I'm not exagerating here, Ys really does have some of gaming's greatest bosses.   There were 3 ys games to use this style of engine. The ark of Napishtim (which was the first), The oath in Felghana and finally Origins.  Felghana has the greatest soundtrack of them all and arguably the second strongest soundtrack in the entire series (In a series famous for it's soundtracks (look for a psp or psvita for Ys 7 if you want the best soundtrack)).  Felghana, on it's hardest difficulty has some spectacular bosses. However the game doesn't put it's best foot forward at the start. Initial bosses are pretty simple and hardly inspiring, which is unfortunate because the later bosses are absolutely spectacular. Thematically unique bosses all with their own interesting quirks and unique mechanics make each big baddy feel wholly unique and incredibly satisfying to down. In fact Felghana and Origins are spectacular examples of good boss design (with a few very obnoxious exceptions).  There's also a bit of exploration and secret discovering involved in Ys, and because a number of your abilities give both combat and traversal options there is some fun platforming to be performed in the game.  So this all sounds super positive, are there any negatives then? Actually yeah, quite a few.  This game isn't pretty, I mean let's be fair it's old (2005) but that's gonna be a turn off for some people.  Then there's the plot, Ys' localization is about as good as it can get (Xseed is really good at that) but this isn't a plot that's likely to do anything for you, and not much time is spent on either it or its characters.  The game is also very grind heavy, especially on it's higher difficulties. Levels and weapon upgrades in Ys make a huge difference, to the point where a single level can make your attacks do almost twice the damage and can turn some boss fights from cruel jokes into fun encounters. but there are humungous experience penalties once you start over levelling, and even then you're going to have to farm normal mooks just to avoid being underlevelled, which may have been alright except for the game's final weakness, fights that aren't bosses.  Ys's combat is simple, but the way it blends with each bosses unique mechanics make it incredibly satisfying. This doesn't occur with normal enemies though, which means for many, normal combat in Ys isn't very satisfying, which is unfortunate because you'll need to do a fair amount of farming basic enemies to be able to afford upgrades and avoid being underleveled.  So to sum up: + Awesome soundtrack + Awesome bosses after the first couple of dungeons  - Not very pretty - Grindy on higher diffculties - Fighting basic enemies isn't that fun - Playing on easier difficulties wont let you appreciate it's great bosses properly  Ys will appeal extremely strongly to a certain crowd, and that crowd absolutely SHOULD play it, because it's one of the best examples of it's genre. But most other people will likely find the game to be more trouble than it's worth.",

            "review_text": "One of my all time favorites and the game that got me into the Ys series which I criminally ignored until a couple of years ago. Great hack and slash game with tight controls and high replayability. You're definitely going to play this more than once.  Be advised though, this game is HARD. As in, don't start it on the hardest difficulty if this is your first time playing as this game is actually an old game, not something that was made in the last 3 years. This means this game was developed back when 'hard mode' actually meant HARD MODE and not just a slightly harder normal mode where you still pretty much streamroll through the game. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, this game is HARD and you're going to die over and over and over until you finally learn to get good at it.  For people who hate JRPGS and whatnot don't worry, this game, much like most of the Ys series games, is anti grind so you'll never be underleveled. You also don't have to fiddle around with a bloated inventory or anything like that as your character's progression is pretty straightforward (You don't get different type of swords with different properties, just better swords with more attack power so you can just ignore your old gear).  The soundtrack is easily one of the highlights of this game. It's probably one of the, if not THE game with the best soundtrack in the entire Ys series and a pretty close contender for game with the best soundtrack ever.  Getting 100% completion is something only the most hardcore players will be able to achieve due to how insanely hard the last difficulties are, so be ready to invest a huge amount of time on that task dying over and over.  Special note: Don't pay attention to the store images, the game actually has full widescreen support which was added shortly after the game came out so it won't look as bad as in those screenshots, don't worry.   Bad stuff:  * Cutscenes. You can't fully skip them, you have to hold a button to autoskip every bit of dialogue and waste tons of minutes doing nothing. This is especially aggravating when you're on your 3rd playthrough or so.  * Xbox 360 controller support: Game has no native xinput support so your left and right triggers wont work. Easily fixable by using joy2key or something but to be honest you don't even need those buttons to begin with.",

            "review_text": "Note: I already beat this game a long time ago.   Ys games tend to be very well done action RPGs that are accompanied by a story that isn't nearly as interesting as the gameplay and some of the most bad ♥♥♥ music in gaming.   Ys: The Oath in Felghana is no damn exception to this rule.  Though it may suffer from a plot that is less deep than a small pond and yet deeper than a puddle, it packs a damn good punch in the gameplay department with its fast-paced hack-and-slash combat. But just because the game is a hack-and-slasher RPG doesn't mean it's an easy game to play, as you will have to use certain abilities and time your attacks in all of the game's boss battles, as well as plan your attacks at the right time in the right place to pull off combo attacks to gain an XP bonus. Yes, the game gives you an XP bonus for your combos. Magic is also important in the game, but unlike other RPGs where you learn magic through training, you gain magic abilities through rings that can be found throughout the game (three in all), and you can find gems that are of the same color of a specific magic ring to improve the strength of that ring. The game also allows you to better your current equipment at the blacksmith's shop in the main town, but it unfortunately does kinda fall flat in terms of scope, although it is still recommended to better your current equipment in order to reduce damage taken.   Like most Ys games, Felghana has bad ♥♥♥ music. The tracks range from orchestrated instrumentals to bad ♥♥♥ guitar riffs. The game's graphics are often compared to that of an original PlayStation game, albeit with a better framerate than most PS1 games dream of having. The graphics are mostly okay. They could have been better, but they do their job well enough. The game runs well on PCs that tend to be extremely shity, so those who have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PCs should not worry about this game running horribly on their PCs.   Overall, the game is an essential game to play for those who love action RPGs and should be a game that gets more love. The game is also for the PSP, so if you're still worried about your PC not being able to run it, and you own a PSP, you can get it on that.",

A SNES cult classic enhanced every way for the PSP before being flawlessly ported over to the PC.  Pros: Strong story with plenty of characters while maintaining a narrow focus that keeps the pacing tight. Colorful graphics and entertaining sondtrack (which can be switched out for the SNES version if the guitars get old after awhile).   Cons: Controls can be a little loose for the platforming from time to time, and the existence of only one town and a half-dozen other locations are unfortunate carry-overs from its SNES origins.  Rating: ****1/2 / *****",

I also updated this information on here because my old review for this game was only one sentence...  Great gameplay, hard bosses.  Recommended!",

            "review_text": "For first time players, who did not play the PSP/Vita release, it's a worth picking up. Released way back on various consoles and computers as, 'Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys', it was brutally hard and I'm sure led to many a controller tossed in frustration. Back then it was only a 2-D side scrolling platformer, though in this go-around it has been given a massive facelift and brought into the 3rd dimension. There are lots of pretty visuals, excellent music, and the game play can be tailored in difficulty for the meek or the seasoned. It's got a good storyline, a lot of content, and great graphics.  Now, for those of us who DID play the PSP or Vita download versions of this game: they cut out a lot of content. Not game or quest-wise, but you'll notice that the people of this Redmont have a lot less to verbally say than their PSP counterparts. There is no way to program your controller to your liking, and the special bonus pictures and such you could earn throughout the game are gone. If you already own this and are thinking of getting it for the updated visuals and such, know they're NOT widescreen, and honestly, they don't look much better than the PSP in my own opinion.   So, if you don't have a PSP or Playstation system you can play it on, it's worth getting. Especially on sale. If you have the PSP version, stick with that one, you're not missing anything really.",
