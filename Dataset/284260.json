            "review_text": "(I've now explored every scenario of PANORAMICAL, and my awe is palpable. I don't believe I've ever had some many friends 'wish list' a game I've reviewed or suggested.)  I’ve just begun experiencing PANORAMICAL, and I’m damn near speechless.  It’s not a game, there’s nothing to win, no one to defeat, no points to score (as far as I can tell.) Only a world of your own making, or at least “fine tuning”, to explore in literally endless variety and scope. The intro and first two scenarios begin to display the possibilities, and so far that’s where I am. I wanted to report this “discovery” as quickly as possible, for all my friends (and others that understand such worlds of imagination.) The “player” (“conductor”, more like it) can use keyboard and mouse, game controller, or MIDI device to control nine aspects of the image on the screen. Color, texture, detail, weight, proportion…I don’t even know what each is, but it's pretty easy to see the specific results of each key. Each aspect is controlled by one of nine keys, and selecting a position on an XY graph. The Store Page indicates that there are actually eighteen controls, so I can’t conceive of the complexity, or uniqueness possible (though that may refer to nine keys times two dimensions.) The screenshots are recorded by the TAB rather than F12, a non-issue, but important to know.  And the music of PANORAMICAL…even at this early stage it’s so suitable to the wonder and magic of the images. (And it doesn’t cost extra!) Apparently there are fifteen very different landscapes, all within your control (you, and the music.) This is one of the only of over 600 games that I want on both my PCs. I want this running while I play other games (offline), and while I watch movies, and while I read and while I sleep. I want this to be the background to my life. And all this after seeing the trailers, and less than ten minutes of the actual program.  My friends, and the Community Hub, will be seeing many of my screenshots, so each of you can be your own judge. And as I learn more, I’ll report more in this review. It would not surprise me if this becomes one of the highest rated “games” on Steam (as long as players understand what they are purchasing.) They can only be surprised that it’s more than was ever expected.  Thank you.  (As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",

This is the most intuitive piece of interactive audio I have ever witnessed. I think it's brilliant, ahead of it's time, and under-appreciated.   The controls are easy to use, intuitive, and perfect for exploration. The story you are lead through has an arc and an incredibly inventive interface. Do yourself a favor and allow yourself to experience this masterpiece.",
