            "review_text": "First 3 hours: interesting story line. But more of a point and click game with occasional combat than an RPG. Certainly the levels are very linear - not an open-ended world but interesting so far nevertheless. The art is pretty, voice-acting is well done as well. In addition, the game feels polished.  On the downside, two irritating points so far. First, the companions' AI just loves to cluster your companions together in the middle of area of effect damage. This can be avoided, for sure, if you take over their behaviour but then combat becomes very micro-managed. Second, I sure wish there was a 'save' game option, rather than autosaves at select story points. Being forced now to play the same trio of (increasing difficulty) battles over, and over, and over again only to die towards the end of the third battle has ceased to be fun.",

            "review_text": "I'm a Kickstarter backer. I've seen more of the game than what my gameplay time says, no worries. (We finished the game at the 20 hour mark)  Okay, so there's a very specific group of people out there who would love this game, and also a very specific group that would hate it. This is entirely due to design and what this game is, and what some people expect it to be even though it's not.  FACTS:  - There are NO branching storylines here, and NO decisions that 'get you to an alternate ending'. There is ONE storyline, and that's the one story line there is. Not a pro nor a con, it's what it is.  - The game is EXTREMELY linear. In the sense that you proceed forward, forward and forward. It's like Transistor in that regard: you always went forward, and there's no real point to going back. (Not one of those CRPGs where you get quests from random people and stuff, you mostly go do the main quest and that's that).  - The game is fully voiced, all dialogue between characters is voiced, it adds a lot to the gameplay value. (By the way, it's very high quality voice acting too! Names like 'JENNIFER HALE' the Female Shepard from MASS EFFECT, or 'CRISPIN FREEMAN', these names might ring a bell?)  - The game is text-heavy because people talk to each other. So if you just want hack and slash, there are less dialogue-heavy games out there for that, in which case go play some Bastion or something.  But if you want lore and codex entries like back in the Dragon Age Origins games, you'll be pleased. The game is heavily focused on telling its story.  - There is skill customization. Multiple skills to choose from, different upgrade 'paths' to take on said skills. They differ from character to character, element to element. Fun times.  - The music is superb.  - The art is pretty.  - The battle system is okay. The companion members' AI is downright stupid, so you need to tell them to stop being stupid manually.  - Auto-saves on screen transition only. No manual saving. An odd design choice. Not really a fan.  - Recommended because of the music, story (from beginning to end!), and world design.  Final verdict: - If you have enough money, this game is definitely worth buying, even full-price (if you believe this is something you'll enjoy) - If you don't have enough money, wishlist it and buy it on a sale, you should definitely get this one (if you believe this is something you'll enjoy)",

            "review_text": "I backed Masquerada on Kickstarter and I'm so glad this game has finally been released!  The art and voices are definitely the highlights of this game. I enjoyed looking at all the little details in the maps and the rich colour palette. The voice acting is top notch, lending an incredible amount of immersion to the world. I can feel that a lot of love went into making this.  Although the story is linear (you don't get to make any dialogue choices to pursue story branches), it unfolds at an engaging pace so I hardly minded.  Highly recommended if you like: rich world-building, isometric games, art history (seriously - check out some of the handdrawn details on the maps and buildings), and tactical pause-and-play (great for people like me who get easily flustered by real-time combat).   EDIT: I have finished the game, after sneaking in a few hours here and there over the past few nights.  I have to say - I was blown away by the ending. The game was trotting along merrily as an investigative mystery (see the earlier part of my review), and then shifted tone in the third and fourth Acts. I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, I was tearing hard at the credits. I give it a solid A+ for handling such deft storytelling.  After moving onto the harder battles, I feel the key is to pause often (and pause at the start of the fight) and plan your movements. You need to pause and reposition every few seconds to line up a combo, but when you do, the fights are much smoother than fighting in real time which often leads to companion AIs going kamikaze. I think the latest patch also improved the companions AI a lot more, especially the ranged fighters.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of the story, there is no replay value for more plot (only 1 main storyline).",

            "review_text": "***There are no spoilers; only a full review of what I took from this game. ***  I do recommend this game. The 16.4 hours is what it took to complete it. But honestly I approve this purchase only for the quality voice acting and storyline put together in a graphic audiobook format. The gameplay, on the other hand is severly lacking. The voice actors I was already fans of. Brought from both the Geek &amp; Sundry (how I found out about this game) and Nerdist websites the actors give depth to the characters to build the connection throughout. If you are looking for a decent written story set in a graphic novel theme you will come to the right place... But if you are looking for a game similar to a Dragon Age or Mass Effect...disappointment will follow you. The art is beautiful. Designers took time making the city this takes place in. Its definately fantasy by nature and beautiful nonetheless.  Don't expect to explore it though. This game is STRICTLY linear in a isometric POV. One path to follow (albeit one section deviates from this) from beginning to end. There is no interaction with the environment, except buckets of fruit you can kick around. Principle charcters are set to move the game forward. All the other NPCs are there for show. Some will have bubbles over their head in conversations with others talking about what's going on and you will have to stop your running (there is no walk) to read these bubbles which will distract from the play because they will go on for a bit. Safe to ignore unless your goal is to read everything......because that in itself is a chore.   PREPARE TO READ A LOT. Codexes for backstory and history, characters, settings. Almost everything has a codex, set in a way that is so distracting from what you were doing that you might forget what you were doing before you decided to read the entry (some are extensive in text). Except for the character codexes I pretty much ignored the rest of it, but you might get upset if you don't get all of them. They sit in the path so easily seen (for the most part), I honestly wondered how I missed a few (which also ruins an achievement). The codexes are designed to enrich the story, but it becomes very tedious and doesn't effect the current events because...  ...the story is already written for you. There are times in the dialogue where there are choices present (making you wonder in a Dragon Age sort of way if I choose this what will happen) but in this reality only one choice exists and the other...is why there are checkpoints. So there are no player choices to worry about. Whatever control scheme you choose just button mash to glory (with some battle strategy mixed in) because even though there are skill trees and inks and such all the characters and all the skills really do the same thing: to get you moving with the story (the difficuly does spike at times making the use of ill-placed checkpoints and restarts a chore but trial-and-error will rue the day). Speaking of spoken dialogue...they are ALL TEXT-BOXES. I found myself closing my eyes and listening or lowering the scale of the GUI because they were so distracting. Reading along to spoken texts is OK when its paced right. This isn't that. I found I sped up the dialogue in places because I read faster than they did (which I think ruins other achievements as well). But the character animation is also these boxes (which they did a real good job with the sync), so having an option to remove these from play removes a lot of design (and so the option doesn't exist).  The music reminded me of 2 things...1. Final Fantasy where the music never stops and doesn't match the situation (most of the time) and 2. That Knight Rider made-for-TV movie with the mall chase scene where this calming soothing music existed instead of exciting get-you-pumped music (to this day I still wonder why). I turned off the music because I found it distracring but then turned it on because silence during scenes needing music is even more distracting.  With all this you could be asking yourself 'he's recommending this?' The combat isn't satisfying. The lack of environment depth (you will feel compeled to roam and be saddened with the waste of time). The tedious reading and visual distractions that take you away from the story and gameplay...  But the story IS awesome. The dialogue and the voice acting DO bring to life this story. You will laugh. You may tear a little. You will feel connected even if the try of backstory and history is forced. If you are anywhere familiar with the voice actors you will smile with the knowing 'it was her' or 'that was amazing'.  There is minimal replayability. If you are a completionist and didn't get all the achievements the first time you may go back but for as rail-linear as it is and all the chapters to choose from, getting those last few codexes isn't worth the extra time IMO. Even though it crashed on me twice near the end (restarting the game fixed both) I felt satisfied and not-at-all cheated. I adjusted how I played and thought less comparing it to another game I was used to.  Is it worth the price? I paid $25. For the quality acting and artwork it is. But with the lack of player involvement in the direction (think any game where it shows you a button to press to survive peril) of the game, it would probably sell better as a graphic audiobook.  There is no surprise why the file size is so big. There are a ton of voices and its visually appealing.  But, unless the story plot draws a hectic situation, there really isn't a sense of dread or peril to rush for anything from a player standpoint. It is a very-elaborate storytelling game.  I don't regret buying this....(The quality is there. It just could have been so much more.)... but you might.",

            "review_text": "Reviews aren't really my jam, but I like Masquerada. Disclaimer: Yeah, I backed the kickstarter.  Don't step into Masquerada expecting a Pillars of Eternity-style experience. It's very much a linear story game (if the tags don't give it away). If you're a completionist then make sure you're done with an area before moving on! Very rarely do the blue-teleporter-whatsit-circles have a return trip.  Pretty much all interaction points are coloured-whatsit-circles. General rule of thumb is yellow = key dialogue/progression or crafting, purple is optional/collectable and blue is moving to a new area. The exclamation mark on the edge of the screen points to the real quest progresser, which is good to keep in mind when there's more than one yellow point.  If you don't like Codexes then bare in mind that Masquerada really does - if you want to avoid them I'd say you can skip the lore. Towards the end of the game they start tossing extras at you that didn't fit neatly into a scene but, wahey, they wrote it, so here you go. That said, the entries are at a really nice length and I found all the Character entries particularly good reads as they're from the point-of-view of the main character, Cicero. I can't buy into lore for a world I'm not going to see but I'm always down for seeing more of a character's thoughts.  It has bugs, but none are game-breaking and no more than you'd expect. Their chapter system makes it easy to jump back if you feel you've missed something. It's an auto-save system so watch out for the notification in the bottom-left of the screen before quitting.  It's not really a micro-manager experience. I ended up sticking to one character and occassionally skipping to one of the two teammates to use certain skills, but largely I let the AI handle who to auto-attack. I've only played the game through on NORMAL (it may be very different on higher difficulties). There's a Party Behavior menu which offers some extra customisation and the Pause still came in incredibly handy. I couldn't just mindlessly send them into combat, and in the early stages of the game I felt the pain of not optimising my (then) meagre skill points.  I've only played it through once with Air where I went for teleporting around the map. This made any 1 v 1s Cicero had unintentionally hilarious. Totally winnable... if a bit slower than other playstyles. There's some depth to the combat and I didn't dig deep beyond respecs to pay better attention to Threat and Focus.  Thankfully, they introduce you to a skill-reset which you have access to in one form or another for the rest of the game. You only get enough skills points to max out a character's Passive and the 4 skills they get additional to that. There's really no point investing in more than 4 skills - you can only use 4 at the time. Experiment with what works best for you and read ahead in the skill trees to see what'll work out best. I'd reccomend making Kalden into a beefy heal tank ASAP. He's fantastic by the end of the game but my poor choices made him into floor-decor for most of the early-game.  I really enjoyed it and would buy a sequel (which they certainly set up a hook for), but I very very very much buy into story-based games. The voice-acting is stellar and really helps in that regard. It also has little snippets of non-voiced dialogue that you can find in the world, the standard 'oh we're just funny little NPCs making Dragon Age references' or 'we're an ongoing side story that will probably end in tragedy'. I appreciate that, especially when I'd find those same NPCs later on in the game. Don't expect any animated master pieces. When in-game visuals don't cut it for the scene they want they go for a pseudo-comic/still-frame approach instead. (You can see one in Steam's preview images.)  Give the demo a try but bear in mind that the bulk of your in-game time will be the story. Not the gameplay.",

The mixture between beautiful writing and amazing Voice Actors as made this a trully immersive game. I found myself reading every single bit of lore the game handed out.   Using an approach of storytelling where the narrator is a character and everything is filtered through their personality, really makes for an experience much closer to a good book.

The world is very imaginative, lore, and excellent voice acting and story. It reminds me of a combination of Avatar: The Last Airbender, plus Saint Seiya combine with Phantom of the Opera and Victorian style novel.

            "review_text": "I helped kickstart this game and I was really looking forward to playing it, but having finished it I am disappointed. First the good parts.  -The voice acting is superb across the board and it really helps to tell the story. -The world is very well fleshed out and there is a lot of lore available within the game (I didn't read it all). As much as I -didn't enjoy the game I would be intrested in a tabletop RPG based on this world. -The art is beautiful and the areas are varied.  -I enjoyed all the characters and the character interactions that you could chose to see. The story was decent, unfortunately the other areas got to be bad enough that I lost interest about halfway through and focused on finishing than enjoy the story.  Things I didn't like so much about the game.   -It's way too linear. I'm a big RPG fan and in general they are linear, but this took linear to the point of dragging you around by the nose. It's rare if there were two exits to an area. You can pretty much only go directly to the next scene/location.  -There's no option to interact with the world. You cannot talk to a random NPC. At all. As much as they rarely say anything all that useful one of the things I enjoy upon going to a new town in a game is running around and hearing all the random stuff the NPCs have to say. There is some talking in the background that helps, but it's not common. This ties in with the previous complaint. - Battles. Maybe I chose a poor element, or a bad skill set up, or I'm just bad, but it felt like the best tactic for me would have been just putting the character on autopilot. It didn't feel like I was effective at all in battle. Also the targetting for me was a bit wonky as you both right click to target an enemy and right click to swap to an ally. So when your ally is in melee you can accidentally swap targets instead of attacking. I did that... a lot. I didn't usually micromanage my allies and in general the ai was fine, but there was one boss battle where one of my allies just sat there in the middle of the map because she was too far away from my party.  - Skill points - I liked the magic in general, but the game uses on a progression based system where after certain fights/bosses you get skill points to allocate. My issue with this is that it makes me feel like the other fights where you don't get skill points are a waste of my time that I would want to avoid, but can't. Since I don't enjoy the battles in general this quickly made some areas feel like a slog.   - Masquerine customization. While this seemed like a nice thing I don't think I ever once noticed the effect as they're all fairly small effects with only a chance of happening. I'm sure it helped a lot, but it just wasn't noticeable so it kinda felt wasted. Also the engravings could have used more variety.  - Complete lack of agency. I've kinda already touched on this, but it just didn't feel like I got to make any real choices other than do I want to collect and read the lore/talk to my allies or not.   All in all if you enjoy a very story driven game and don't have the same issues I did with the combat you may enjoy the game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without highlighting my issues with it.",
