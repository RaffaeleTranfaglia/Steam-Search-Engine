            "review_text": "One of the most frustrating, yet fun to play platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. A game based on the hit, internet sensation the Angry Video Game Nerd, a character portrayed by James Rolfe whom reviews older games ranging from the Atari, to the SEGA Genesis to the NES and a bunch more.   Off the bat, the game starts out by introducing the Angry Video Game Nerd (or AVGN for short) before he is sucked into the TV (by the balls no less!) and is forced to play through what he calls hell. The stages, quotes, etc are references to older video games and episodes he has done in the past. The game itself conveys a traditional 8-Bit art style for the majority of assets used in the game aswell as play the expected 8-bit style music to go along with them.   Now, personally, I love this game and actively recommend it to everyone that loves/loved watching AVGN and likes tough platformers in general. The game plays out very similarly to classic MegaMan games and Mario Bros, since the Nerd has his standard jump, shoot and crouch, as well as a few nifty temporary power-ups you can pick up across the stages - these range from the Glitch Gremlin (a green creature that glitches the game and often helps with progression as it halts both stage hazards and enemies), the Super Mega Death Christ (Yes lol, a power up that destroys every enemy present on the screen at the time.), an upgraded gun for the Nerd (Has a much bigger hitbox than his standard light gun) and rocks (Yes rocks, like those found on one of his older episodes that he says is useless because of the low travel distance and low damage).   The game has a 3 damage health system and lives (unless you pick a higher or lower difficulty setting in which the game alters these). 3 beer bottles pretty much signal how many more hits you can take before dying, and the lives, like in older Megaman games, means how many times you can retry before being kicked out from the stages. There are also toasters (checkpoints) scattered across the stage to mark your progress on any given stage, but they are optional to activate as there are also beer bottles scattered across to help restore health to you - and there's also secret characters you can unlock all based on his show.   Stage Progression~ Generally, excluding the tutorial stage - you pick a stage in a similar fashion to MegaMan games, there are 8 in total. Each stage has their own deathtraps, some will take a point of damage, and some, like the golden skull blocks found across every stage, will kill you in one hit. Some zones are based around very careful and timing based jumps, movement, etc - like some zones will have an enemy type that is there to hinder you while you do a section, it's all very much reminiscent of the old formula of games back in the day - and like those games, this game isn't very forgiving.   In general, if you're a fan of the AVGN no doubt you'll already have this, but if you're a fan of tough NES-like platformers, get this game. From the obscenely ridiculous references to the appealing art style, this game screams AVGN charm.  B+",

            "review_text": "First off, I wanna say that even on Easy, the game is very hard, and it reaches ridiculous levels of hard in some places; Especially the final boss in my opinion, though that's probably because I don't play hard platformers all that much.   Other than that, this game gives a pretty damn good challenge, but at the same time, it really does make you wanna rage; It's basically showing you what's it like to be in a frustrating game that AVGN played, so if you're inexperienced with platformers, I'd think about it real hard before getting it, or try playing some free ones or emulated ones.  Though I do feel that the difficulty is fake at some parts. You probably can't even get through some parts without dying, and if you're just here for a fun-filled game, that kind of can hinder the enjoyability, at least in my opinion. Hoping the second one is a bit more easier.  Other than that, it's a good game.",

If you enjoy AVGN and infuriating platformers this game is something you probably already have, if you want a really hard, true to retro, platformer this game is for you. It's not evolutionary in any way and the physics are dated because of the old games it's trying to emulate.   If you want a hard retro platformer; this is something you may enjoy.",

            "review_text": "After finally completing The Angry Video Game Adventures for the first time i can only say...WOW.  STORY: The plot of AVGN Adventures goes like this: One day the Nerd and his friends were playing a ***** game, when suddenly the TV sucks them in, the nerd tries to escape, but he gets grabbed by the sack and he enters Game Land to complete 9 levels and find out who the **** is responsible for this.   PRESENTATION: AVGN Adventures, like many other games, looks like an old retro-NES-SNES-game and by that i mean that the game has a mixture between 8 and 16 bits type graphics and sound (all tho you could argue with 32 bits for the sound, but that's besides the point). The sprites and backgrounds are well done and detailed, the framerate is consistent (at around 60fps) and the music ¡is kick-***!, everything in this game looks colorful, eye catching and different from one and other.   GAMEPLAY: AVGN Adventures plays like a 2D platforming shooter from the NES era with a very high difficulty. You platform around and shoot the enemies with the NES Zapper to progress and you can get upgrades or sub-weapons to add to your arsenal.   The game has 4 Characters to play with and each of them has some especial attribute, tho you do have to find the other characters. First there's 'The Nerd', which is my personal favorite, he's the most balanced character of them all with a decent run speed, a decent jump high and he does decent damage, BUT! he is the only character who can use the upgrades and sub-weapons + he can stand in place and shoot in 8 directions, he is personally my character of choice most of the time. Then there's the 'The Guitar Guy', he might seem like an awful character at first since he cannot use any sub-weapon or upgrade, he can only fire straight forward and he's jump is very...meh, BUT! he is the fastest of the bunch and his proyectiles can go through walls, proyectiles and barriers and believe me that doesn't sound like much, but he is very useful later on, especially on the final boss. Next there's '************ Mike', he has decent run speed and his weapon has a little range, BUT! he can use that weapon to destroy certain walls and he can jump the highest. And then theres '********-Man', he is the slowest of the bunch and he's jump is TERRIBLE, BUT he's the strongest and he can do a 'not-so-helpful-double-jump', personally i never used him, and i feel he's the worst of all the characters. You find these hidden characters (excluding the Nerd) by using the abilities that each of them have.   Now while the game does have all of those characters, they are actually not required to beat the game. YEAH every level was designed in a way so you can complete all of them with just the Nerd, but while this is true, certain parts of the levels will be a **** ton easier if you have a buddy along with you, so keep that in mind. Speaking of the levels, the level design, for the most part, is pretty good...that's all i can say about it. This is certainly good level design, but i feel like sometimes got lazy when designing some parts of the levels. Each level has some sort of gimmick in them, but aside from that each level plays pretty much the same way. One of the things that this game loves to throw you is death blocks (pretty self-explanatory), there's like a bizillion of them throughout the game and the placement can be very brutal at times. The levels have some very fun set pieces and creative enemies (tho some of them are just re-skins of other enemies).   Overall the level design for the most part is really good, but there are some parts that are designed to anger you AND OMG they succeed. The game is hard, in a Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Zelda II, Megaman type of way. Now don't worry it's not as hard as any of those, but some of them can make say the phrases that the nerd says every time you die. But quite frankly only 2 of the 9 levels legitimately angered me and by the 2-3-4-6-8 playthrough of the level...it wasn't that bad and i felt like most of my deaths were fair and even if you feel like you are having a hard time, the game has different difficulty levels. I recommend normal mode for your first playthrough, it gives you 30 lives and 3 beers (which are this game life bar) and even in the highest difficulty, there are a lot of checkpoints throughout each stage.   At the end of every level there's a Boss which will require a different strategy to defeat and you will have to memorize the patterns in order to beat them, tho some of them are very easy.   The game has a lot of references to the Angry Video Game Videos and any AVGN fan (like me) will feel right at home with the over abundance of references, jokes and even cameos from other youtubers and enemies of the Nerd.   So overall with great graphics, music, bosses, characters, controls, decent level design, references and much more, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures gets and 8/10. Definitely worth your money...and i can't wait for the sequel!!!.",

            "review_text": "Since I'm a HUGE fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, I decided to purchase this game recently. And after a few days, I'm definitely not disappointed.  The game is very reminiscent of many old NES sidescrollers, mainly Mega Man, as it uses the 'choose your level' kind of gameplay like Mega Man does. And there's also.. running while shooting a zapper like in Mega Man.. yey. It makes it rather fun to play, while being rather nostalgic at the same time, which is also added on by the 8-bit style of this game. I also like the bit of challenge within the game, as some of the levels do make you think what you need to do, and being careful in general, giving a bit of strategy.   Another thing I like is how it has references to the actual show, with the powerups like the 'Glitch Gremlin' and 'Super Mecha Death Christ 2000,' as well as having some of the characters such as Mike Matei, and even the levels do reference some of the games he's played. Not to mention, some of the things he says within the game and the cutscenes add some decent humor as well.  So, overall, It's a fun game that is definitely a good purchase if your a fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd, or even if you're not a big fan, but you like to play old NES games like Mega Man. Either way, it's still a good purchase.",

Being a fan of the AVGN series I wanted to support that as well. But boy do I regret spending those buck.   The controls are so stiff that jumping on a platform fails in most cases. It feels like they were intentionally made stiff to subtract from the ability to steer the nerd. The truth I however fear is that the guys who made this game are inexperienced game devs or simply have no skill in their trade whatsoever OR were so busy thinking of foul words that they didn't have time to test if the game was actually playable.  The good humor from the series is more or less absent in place of just swearing endlessly. In regard to the indie AVGN fan games I've played (watch episode 115 if unsure of which I'm referring) this doens't present much original content.   The level design is really bad as well. I haven't played for that long because I more or less ragequit due to all these issues I'm adressing here. But I did play all stages. And they're the same: Unfair when they should instead be challenging. I've played and beaten tons of platform games. Especially old and hard ones. But this simply isn't fun.  I wish there were more positive things to say about this. Unpolished, frustrating, insulting and unworthy of my time.  To sum it up: FreakZone Games did an awful job with this game, and why ScrewAttack would have them make a sequel is beyond my comprehension.",

AVGN Adventures is a 2D sidescroller platformer inspired by alot of retro classics...and alot of retro disasters, but we'll talk about that later. Anyway, you should know who the Angry Video Game Nerd is. He single handedly started everything to do with gaming videos online. He's a foulmouth nerd who has dedicated his life to warning the world of bad games, whilst being absolutley hilarious at the same time. If you have never watched him, what are you waiting for&gt; Go watch an episode right now 'cause you're really missing out.  Anyway, the game starts the Nerd being sucked into one of these terrible games and must get ou. Simple, right? Ladies and Gentlemen, I now present to you my least favrioute thing about this game...  THE DIFFICULTY IS OFF THE CHARTS!!!  I never usually loose my temper with games. However this one really started bugging me within 5 mins of boot up. Not trying to spoil anything, but I was in sweat and tears during the final boss fight. I tried for an hour and couldn't do it. I managed to develop a stratergy for part of the fight, but died something like 400 times. I gave up all red and in tears. The next night I went back and my strategy still worked, but I was still struggling. So I used a walkthrough, combined it with my stratergy and I finnaly did it!  Anyway, the point is this is easily the hardest game I've ever played. Even on easy. I'm impressed just beating it once on easy only having to use a walkthrough once!  But, the real problem here...  If you watched AVGN for as long as I have, you probably will have memorised some of the things he complains about in games. And, without listing them, I can tell you this game has ALOT of these problems. Its like it took inspiration from bad games!   WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!  (Sigh...)I usually decide whether I'll reccomend or not reccomend a game beofre reviewing, but this time I'm really struggling. This game almost ruined AVGN for me. I went through sweat and tears just to beat this game on the easiest difficulty! However, it has gogeous retre graphics, occasinally fun gameplay and, of course, the Nerd. Due to it taking too much inspiration from bad examples of games and not being entertaining 100% of the time, it is with great sorrow and regret that AVGN Adventures is the first game I dont reccomend on Steam. Still buy it, play it but not till the end. It is the most brutal and unforgiving game I've ever played.  Did I mention the feeling when you finnaly beat it...?  ",

The control is good and unique in its way, comparable to Mario, but slightly stiffer. Be warned for very frustrating level design. Fortunately, there are many many checkpoints on the way and you get 30 lives to start with. That should give you a good idea of how this game is designed and I like it a lot.  The reason for not recommending this game is because of technical issues. This game does not play well on a keyboard so I highly recommend using a controller, but besides the Xbox 360-controller, getting standard Windows controllers up and running is way too hard to do and required the use of third-party software, plus there's a bug that introduces 8 seconds load time after every death when using the controller, which is horendous. These are issues that were mentioned a lot in the forums, so I am not the only one. As such, even though the game is fun and creative, I cannot recommend a game that is technically underdeveloped. I have tested version 1.7.1 from february 2014.   Other than that, this game begs to be played on a tv with a controller in your hand, rather than on a PC. I would like to encourage the developers to make it run natively under SteamOS. This is one of those games that would benefit from an open console platform.",

            "review_text": "It's good, worth a couple dollars no more. I've been watching AVGN for a long time now, and this game is very suiting. But don't pay too much; to won't be worth your investment. Catch this game on sale if you can. This is the short answer. If you want to know more read on.  The good:  The controls are good, though definitely use a controller. A keyboard has felt clumsy for me and the developers definitely had using a playstation or xbox controller in mind.   The story is VERY AVGN. It's a bit of fun and makes it worth playing for a while. If you've watched AVGN a lot, you'll see a lot of references to his videos throughout the game. The humor is funny for a little while, but it gets a bit tiresome.   The music is great. Every stage has different theme and it's some of the best 8-bit music out there. The sound effects make it sound like your zapper or sound waves are really inflicting quite a bit of damage on the enemies you hit. These are great compliments to the game.  The difficulty is quite hard, but once you get used to the controls, you'll be blaming yourself rather than the game for deaths. The first few stages aren't terribly difficult in comparison with the later stages (they'll give you a run for your money though), but the later ones aren't nearly so easy. More on that later.  I haven't had any major gripes with the types of enemies.  The eh:  The stages get very repetitive and by the end, you don't feel like you're really playing a different stage with completely new enemies. Most of the enemies are reskins from other levels. For example, the fireballs, the happy faces, the flying ghosts, the squids are all the same, just different shapes. These are the most common enemies, and you can't even kill them. Furthermore, there aren't enough enemies for the diversity of weapons. So many times have I wanted to slaughter a band of enemies with my light saber but rarely do any come. And the ones that do come are so difficult to hit, it's easier to just avoid them than to risk getting hurt by one.  The extra characters are cool, but they're usually impractical to use. The guitar guy has a better weapon, but he can't aim it and he can't jump as high as the Nerd. It's too bad there aren't quite that many enemies that can be killed. Mike jumps higher than the nerd, but he's a bit clumsier and his weapon isn't nearly as good as either of the others (kind of like Luigi in the recent 3D Marios). The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t man gets a special second jump, but even with both jumps he still can't jump higher than the Nerd. His weapon sucks, don't use it. There aren't really any points in the game where you realize you HAVE to use another character. It's a shame because this could have been a real good opportunity for a bit of a puzzle design.  Powerups are in the game, but they're too scant to be useful. Plus sometimes they don't even do anything good anyway! The glitch gremlin will stop all enemy movement, but what good does it do if you have standstill ghosts everywhere and there's no way to jump over them all? It's impossible to freeze them at the perfect time.  The later stages are just tedious. Multiple obstacles face you in every direction and the game isn't even fair for most of them. For example, the haunted stage involves moving platforms that you have to keep up with. But if you haven't played that part of the stage before, you're bound to fall off because of the unpredictable motions of the platform. I understand a couple deaths to this, but the coupling of the platforms, enemies, and those wretched death blocks make the game outright frustrating.  In fact, my biggest gripe has got to be the death blocks. The death blocks are everywhere and they don't add to the game experience. If you touch them, you'll die instantaenously; it doesn't matter how many beers you have left. With so many in the game, you will come to realize that there's no reason to avoid the other flying enemies since your main obstacle are those death blocks. The death blocks are strategically placed in stupid locations designed to make you die and start all over again. They just seem like cheap deaths. With so many death blocks around, it's nearly impossible to beat the game on normal difficulty, let alone hard.  The humor feels much much darker than the Nerd is in his videos. Maybe it's the open-mouthed shock-face that James instills in his character every time something goes horribly wrong that the game developers didn't manage to recreate in-game. The nerd starts dissing the game too early and never stops.  Conclusion:  If you're a fan of the Nerd, get this game under one condition: don't buy this game for more than $7! The game gets a couple things perfectly right but then forgets or gets too lazy to change it up. If the developers didn't want to spend the extra time to program new and intuitive enemies, better levels, and more exciting uses of your teammates, you shouldn't pay the extra money to buy this game.",

Enemy placement isn't a problem, but the over reliance on instant death blocks makes some parts an absolute joke until trial and error kicks in. And although the harder difficulties are there for the challenge, YOLO mode is made to be quite the horror thanks to the problems.  ACHIEVEMENTS: The difficulty will cause a long and extended frustration.  FINAL: The game is well put together, however, the over reliance of annoying and cheap tricks used in the NES brings about it's failure to push the game to a standard of higher quality. Instead of becoming a game to poke fun and improve the formula, it falls squarely into place. A solid title, but one that could have been a great deal better.",

This is a piece taken directly from Screwattack homepage: Some say 'hard,' but we're saying 'rewarding!' Why? Because every check point you get, every boss you beat, every accomplishment is something you've earned. You feel like a stud. This is a game that allows you to brag to your friends if you beat it.   I strongly disagree with that statement! You won't brag to you friends instead you'll ask yourself why you put yourself through this half-baked mess? The single biggest problem with the game spells: DEATH BLOCK! An extremely cheap way to make the game hard without any finess or thought! If you play this game you will come to hate those, I promise.

However while it tries to be unfair to stay on character and retro, there're severe difficulty spikes once in a while. You might find very rough obstacles and various trial and error challenges, while in others you will face simpler counterparts. This is specially the case on the last stage, where you encounter a part with bouncy platforms which a previous stage made much harder to pass through. This is not exactly a big flaw, but is highly recommended to play first with infinite lifes and then try the other modes once you figure out the stages.  However there are are few things i really didn't like. There's a severe abuse of instadeath blocks, and while that makes the point of AVGN nature and behavior, is more about lack of obstacles graphically, as in some stages uses lasers but others goes with columns of death blocks acting the same way. Another thing is that in some segments there's too much noise on screen, and combined with the soundtrack can be hard to concentrate.  AVGN Adventures is not the perfect game, but behind that bag of references and trash humor there's a solid game for an hour or two of gameplay.",

The AVGN is notorious for playing bad games and being rather crude while presenting such games. What I find interesting about the AVGN game is that they actually incorporated these game design flaws and made them into something great. From impossible jumps to unfair design, AVGN Adventures takes these monstrosities of game design and turns it into something fresh, exciting and just fun.  The difficulty on this one is worthy of the title 'NES Hard' and the actual game itself plays like a mixture between the original classic Mega Man games and Contra. The music is reminiscient of nostalgic 80s chip tune and brings gamers back to a time where the basics were all you needed. The sprite art is beautifully built from the ground up with some clear inspiration from other titles, again, such as Mega Man.  Many people seem to say that this game has hardly any replay value which I would like to say is complete bogus. There are three different characters to play as in AVGNA, two of which need to be unlocked by finding them hidden throughout the 8 different stages (All based on episodes of the AVGN.) Also, the game can be played in different difficulty settings, allowing for more than one gameplay experience. A true completionist will want to not only beat this game in more than one way, but master AVGNA, much like those of retro gaming tastes do.  The in game dialogue (in text boxes) is crude, filthy, disgusting, and downright hilarious. AVGNA incorporates many of the Nerds' iconic quotes as well as invent new terms that are definetly NSFW.  Overall, this game is definetly worth purchasing and playing through. The difficulty is extreme at times and I would recommend a controller rather than a keyboard. Those with a taste for retro gaming will find this a masterpiece. Even, if you're not into retro gaming, pick this one up when it goes on sale. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "In the barest of descriptions, this game is a piece of interactive fan-art. It distills 8+ years of content from it’s legacy, The Angry Video Game Nerd (produced by James Rolfe, who is a pretty awesome guy) into a Nintendo-length and Nintendo-hard adventure. For those who have watched the web-series, it’s a short walk down memory lane, a challenge to find all the references and easter eggs, and a way to experience the trials The Nerd has experienced over the lifespan of the series. It was lovingly produced to be an intentional experience, and for fans, it’s delightful.  It’s important to point out that this game is not for everyone. Like most fan-art, you can appreciate the aesthetics if you approach it unaware of the original work, but a lot of the heart, depth and meaning will be lost. Yes, the “retro” graphics are charming and the game handles well, and you may even see inspirations in the level design from games like Castlevania if that’s your generation. However, with no other perspective, you will soon be frustrated by the games seemingly poor level design. The game constantly cheats and frustrates you, killing you time and time again at no real fault of your own. Things appear skewed against you in some very unfair and unfun ways, never relenting.  For fans of the series, however, this is expected. This game emulates the experiences of The Nerd throughout the video series, constantly subjecting himself to terrible games from the genesis of home gaming under the premise of warning others against their trespasses. This game takes a sampling of those horrors and concentrates them into one experience, each level its own little snapshot of gaming hell. The joy of playing this game is largely derived from nostalgia, remembering the Olde Games and the despicable things that they did to you, that they made you do to beat them. We remember afternoons and evenings spent dedicated to conquering just one more level, despite the awful controls, the contrived traps and the straight-up horrendous level design. It’s all we had, and we didn't know better. This was just the way games were. We hated them, but we kept coming back, learning to love them like digital Stockholme-suffering prisoners.  Conceptually, the game helps us remember simpler times, and for that I do recommend it, but with a caveat: If you aren't from the Nintendo generation, or you haven’t seen the Angry Video Game Nerd web series, then I highly suggest you experience those things first.

The game itself is fun but challenging to a fault – it’s nearly unplayable except with the unlimited lives option. The levels are designed to be a throwback to the challenging platformers of old but they go too far and create something that is borderline unplayable.

The game mirrors the comedy that fans and viewers of the show are familiar with and honestly really well done.  Graphically speaking ... yes it is pixelated but thats the style and I found it quite gorgeous both everything in the foreground as well as the backround. The different levels have there own unique environment that is loaded with the color and atmostpheric look of the game it is trying to mimic.   The sound track is simply awesome ive played a little over 3 hours and it has yet to be boring to me. Also i found it quite helpful in executing platforming that required precise timing.  The challenge element of this game is incredible and lives up the the games of the 8-bit era. your given 30 lives and ive found myslef burning through at least half of them on one stage (this could be because im not especially good in 2D platformers). I would definitly compare the challenge to that of Mega Man... yes it is a difficult game even on a normal setting but practice makes perfect and after playing for a while I did definitly see improvement in my own abilities. The learning curve is perfect and it provides just the right amount of challenge. Since starting to play, ive only be able to complete 4 of the total stages.

This game is hard. Tough as ♥♥♥♥in nails If anything there is an easy mode for the less hardcore, but even then you'll be restarting some areas several times. Youd better be on top of your ♥♥♥♥ to play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥, but after you get through all the ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ pretty funny 9.9/10",

It would be better if your grandmother ♥♥♥♥ed your grandfather and the schmegma from his balls afterwards fathered a child, then you licked the schmegma from your now uncles balls. i mean sure the graphics and sound are nice but I would rather have beethoven playing while being castrated by a flock of flamingos and watching it all on replay over and over and over again with nothing but my castration screams cackling in the baqckground than continually die in this piece of ♥♥♥♥. If this game was even qualified to be ♥♥♥♥ it would be worse than the diarreah ♥♥♥♥ of big foot after hitting a taco bell hungover and then finding out that taco bell was overrun by the ebola virus! This game sucks the upchuck of the ♥♥♥♥ you sucked from your last ♥♥♥♥ out of your ♥♥♥.   Seriously though big shouts to James Rolfe, Mike Matei, and everyone at cinemassacre! you guys are awesome keep up the good work. I bought the game and movie bundle and they both were great!",

The game itself is amazing even with its 2006 funny toilet humor, and it says ♥♥♥♥ about every 10 seconds, but if your looking for a challenge for a small price, I highly recomend this! Inspired from the AVGN series on YouTube, this game features the Nerd, and many other fun and pointless characters. If you want to play this game, make sure you hide all your knives, bleach, rope, and ledges because this game will put you over the edge of sanity, but who said thats not the fun part!   Only thing I dislike is the game is a bit 'too hard' for starters, but otherwise theres not to much to say no about!  9/10 in my book :)",

            "review_text": "The Angry Video Game Nerd is something most internet dwellers today know about (at least, I hope they would.) A Phenomena in the gaming genre. Its only fitting that he gets his own game to complain about. With fantastic level design and bosses, this game is probably the best the AVGN has ever played- Don't forget the music. It's a good example of NES hard (at least on old school it is) Which contrary to some belief, difficult can actually mean better gameplay (That is for those Veteran gamers out there) I think its best not to make some games too easy on the normal difficulty setting, but have an easygoing difficulty for any newcomers, that is to allow people to get into the game easier. The AVGN Adventures is a platformer that has a good difficulty setting, an easy mode to compensate, and brilliant level design to make things even harder. To end things off, the AVGN and his friends consulting about the game:  AVGN: 'This is crazy! I'm not playing this!' Friends: 'But you wanna play it.' AVGN: 'No, I don't wanna.' Friends: 'You do wanna.' AVGN: 'I don't wanna.' Friends: 'You do wanna.' AVGN: 'I don't wanna!' Friends: 'You do wanna.' AVGN: 'I don't wanna!' Friends: 'You don't wanna!' AVGN: 'I do wanna!' Friends: 'You don't wanna!' AVGN: 'I do wanna!' Friends: 'You don't wanna!' AVGN: 'I do wanna!' Friends: 'You don't wanna!' AVGN: 'I do wanna!' Friends: 'You don't wanna!' AVGN: 'I do wanna! And you're not gonna stop me!'  AVGN: 'I recommend it.'",
