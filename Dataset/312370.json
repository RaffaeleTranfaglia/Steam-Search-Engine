No, it is NOT a direct port of the tabletop game, which seems to be what many were expecting, based on the negative comments here. Yes, it IS a 2D game, which is quite obvious based on the screenshots. There's a lot to enjoy here if you are perceptive and intelligent enough to have realistic expectations. Slitherine has an excellent track record for hex based TBS games and also for the immense amount of post-release support they give them. I have enjoyed playing this one very much and have great expectations for the future supporting releases for the product. The Lordz Game Studio does great justice to the venerable license with their work here.   All in all a great, deep, and atmospheric INTERPRETATION of the 40K universe. But if you purchase this expecting 40K tabletop on the PC, you'll be sorely disappointed.",

Pros: -nice amount of unit selection -good missions -fan-goodness of seeing all these units in a tabletop format  Cons: -no coop, just 1v1 -no ability to make your own skins (not super vital i guess in this game, but we have had it in almost every 40k game. wtf) -most of the scenarios make you play as the imperium, making playing as orks pretty rare outside pvp -ONLY imperial guard, space marines (blood angels, salamanders, ultramarines), and orks. WHERE IS EVERYONE ELSE?!?!?! I understand for the campaign but for multiplayer, that's just bad -almost ZERO customization (units are all pre-built, can select shoota boyz or shoota boyz with big shootas. also can upgrade with transports. that's as far as the customizing goes)  basically this game shows nothing of what has been developed in the past decade. while that doesn't mean that the game that's there is bad, it does make it a disappointment because it could be so much more with very little effort.  COOP is easy to do, other races are a MUST!!! why no 2v2? why does this not use battle academy's engine at least so there is MUCH better cover/sight mechanics. i cant even tell if there is a bonus to infantry vs vehicles at close range. there also is no front vs rear or side armor plates that i can tell. i don't see a template for any sort of ambush. I don't see where i can really customize my units with specific weapons and gear. this is the tabletop dumbed down to a starter version for 7 year olds.  i understand that this is going to be large-scale battles, but the only reason i will ever play this again is for the 40k fanboy in me. game is barely worth $20. and in today's market, I shouldn't pay over $10 for something that within a week could have loads more features. stop being lazy and make a proper game   EDIT: the campaign and scenarios are just the same missions twice in a row. its just do you want to play with story or without story. the multiplayer missions are just slightly modifed versions of some of the campaign missions (mainly so that orks have a normal deployment instead of all your units already on the field lol). and i see on the steam page that it does have 'coop.' really? where? i tried in-game, looking in the manual, flipped through the scenarios....hmmm nowhere  EDIT 2: steam removed the coop tag",

If you ever enjoyed turn-based Hex strategy you will like this, even if you are not a Warhammer fan. Alas, if you do enjoy the genre and are a Warhammer fan you must pick this game up.   This game is a 2D game and it's not about graphics! However, for a turn-based Hex strategy game it is what it needs to be. The unit icons are accurate and the types and styles of units are MANY. Slithering did a good job delving into detail and types. Codex friendly if I may say so.  Running this on an HP Elitebook with 1440p screen resolution, Intel Core M processor &amp; 8GB of RAM, runs great!!!",

The game plays as a very fun and engaging tactical experience. Your units really do matter, unlike say Dawn of War II where you can just throw the biggest units at everything and watch them troll over them. Just like in tabletop 40k, you want to use the right one in the right situation to overcome the onslaught of the WAAAGH!  Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid 40k experience. If you're not a fan of 40k or TBS war games, you can probably overlook this one.  ",

            "review_text": "While this game seems to hold the promise of Panzer General meets Warhammer 40k it doesn't quite live up to expectations. The gameplay appears similar, but it is only superficial. It lacks some of the bits that make PG/C great though it is hard to define what those are. Sure the UI is slightly deficient and there are some unit balance issues, but the problems seems more fundamental than that. It is hard to build raport with your core units as they easily get wiped out, and unit replacements only dilute experience. There seems little value in keeping those last few remaining figures alive. Almost all of your experience will be wiped out anyway and the cost of replacement is on par with a new purchase. I cannot comment on multiplayer since i have not played it yet (I'm not ready to recommend this to my friends yet), but the campaigns while maintaining the Warhammer ethos, don't ignite my grognard passion. There seems little to reward your victorious efforts. There are no bonuses to early victory. And your forces are sure to be in tatters due to the sheer volume of enemies and will therefor be no better than green recruits for your next mission. While this game may rise to greatness after a few more patches, tbh I have little faith the dev team will take it there. I think they have made some design decisions that they are not willing to revisit that are key to unlocking this games potential. They will continue to tweak the game in its current form, but that special sauce will continue to elude them.  I think the common answer to what people think of the game will continue to be 'It's OK'.",

Got that in your mind, now throw in the Armageddon Steel legion, ultramarines, blood angels and salamanders and you have a general ideal of what to expect.  This is turn based strategy on a managable scale, with retention of your core units throughout the campaign. The   Pros:  - Core units that can be upgraded/ refitted and carried through the campaign. - Huge diversity of units. - Great fan service - Tried and tested turn based strategy formula - Ranged combat and close combat are differentiated clearly (ie: adjacent hexes are close combat) - Great potential for future campaigns. - Campaign and battle editer included - Potential for futire DLC's - Sound strategy/ tactical game  Cons:  - It can take a while to figure out the mechanics of the game, ie: support weapons, explanation of unit stats etc - Mission objectives can be a bit vague - Missions can be a little constrictive or formulaic (I like latitude on how to complete objectoves) - Veteran status of units not very obviously represented in their performance (ie they don't seem much better) - Feels a little 'ropey' or crude at times, (ie: animations and sound could be better)  What stands out:  - very nice and clear unit sprites - great potential for fine tuning and future expansion (ie: new campaigns, factions, armies, chapters)  What it needs:  - Unit painter (even a rudimentary army painter would be great) - more factions and more campaigns - a dynamic campaign (remember dune?) on a strategic map, with counter offensives etc representated - Custom perks for veteran units (like you get in civilization,.. ie: defence bonus on hills or against infantry etc)",

They will continue to polish the game and will in turn reach a much wider group of players.  A really good game which could be even better if they reviewed new rules and codex books.   Fliers should be much harder for Non aiming orks to hit at speed. Also Imperial Titans would be Way Cool if added.  Still very playable in current format and very fun to play.

For fans of Warhammer 40K the playing out the Second War of Armageddon is awesome. With each battle, more troop and armour options (and later Titans) open up. Each mission has a maximum number of turns and differing victory conditions to keep you entertained. In between some of the missions you partcipate in some dialog and your choices there influence parts of the game.  In terms of turn-based hex-based wargames it plays very similar to Steel Panthers World at War. You have predefined deployment hexes, and each unit has a visibilility range which determines if that unit detects an enemy unit. Units have various ranges for any ranged weapons they possess and have differing types of damage based on whether the target is armoured or not.

Me and my brother are old school WH40k fans and fight a long and endless 'tabletop war' between orks (me) and marines (him). So this game was a no brainer to buy when we heard about it.  Being a fan of Final liberation i can say that it is very similar in many aspects and i like it. BUT! This game with it`s cool drawn units has no movement and death animations at all (something that old Final Liberation HAD!), has no decals like craters and burns being left after barrage (something that even Steel Panthers of old 90th had). So i was a bit dissappointed by the high price and the lack of 'technology' behind it.  Next, multiplayer - it is PBEM and it has no turn replays! So you have to recall everything that was prior to the current turn and burn your brain imaginating what caused the outcome. Multiplayer feels like being wired in as the last and heavily untested feature. Also we were promissed to have a hotseat mode. There is no hotseat in the game right now.  I would recommend this game to WH40k fans, but be aware that it has little difference from what you get on the table, except for miniatures producing sounds and fancy shotting effects.",

Also there is a bug that if you restart a level while on an opponant's turn you can't finish you deploy step and start the mission over.

Ok, the price didn't drop and I was eager to try this game so I bought the complete pack on Steam (no such pack on Matrix games unfortunately, because I prefer to buy my titles straight from them),  First impression after playing through most of the tutorial is very good.  Although familiar to anyone who played the orginal Panzer General series, it kan stand on its own. The graphics are crisp and the many 40K models look great. Game mechanics are more flexible as much of the fighting takes place from longer range, until you go for the assault.  The tutorial has the player learning the ropes as an aspiring officer in the Imperial Guard training against other Guardsmen and militia.  On challenging, the 'mid level difficulty', it should pose no challenge to the seasoned PG player.  I tried one of the free DLC scenarios on hard and I was defeated, mainly because of underestimating the enemy Orks and blowing much of my money on the cheapest Titan.  During the last tutorial mission - playing on my i5 5200 laptop instead of desktop - I had three game freezes. This happened while my system was busy processing the latest McAfee update, so it might have been caused by this. Lets see if the happens more often.  On an average desktop this game should pose absolutely no challenges. My HP Spectre x360 13 needs to work, although the graphics are smooth the processor is working hard and the fan blowing to keep the CPU cool - which still feels warm through the aluminum casing.
