            "review_text": "The latest patch has ruined this game. The developer has added in a 'morale' system that cannot be turned off. To keep crew morale up, you must not flee or evade combat -- which means playing peacefully (i.e. as a trader) is now completely worthless, as your crew mutinies because you're not being bloodthirsty enough.  Prior to this patch the game was excellent. Good graphics with simple, yet compelling gameplay. I'd argue it's on par with Windward if you want a pirate sandbox-type game.  (If the developer removes the 'morale' feature or makes it optional, I'll change my review.)",

But Pirates! on steroids basically.  If you played windward, you're getting there. The graphics is better. The gameplay in the battles is fast paced and a lot of fun, especially in multiplayer.  I can only recommend this game at this point. ",

            "review_text": "It is a naval combat game and basically there is no difference between these type of games BUT Tempest has a certain something that mnakes it appealing to casuals and harcore fans as well. Graphics and sounds are great and it can run on low spec PCs. Don't expect much variety but the battles are intense and quite hard in my opinion. The developers really show they care about the game and put their hearts into it. Buy it if you are a naval combat fan, Buy it if you like sailing vessels, Buy it on sale if you just want to have a naval combat game on your collection. It is definitelly worth the money.",

            "review_text": " TLDR: Only buy if on sale. This is a decent RPG but the combat is lacking.   The combat mechanics make this game very irritating to play. It seems like the developers listen somewhat so I hope they pay attention to this. This review will focus on the combat since that is the core of the game, and also the core of most of the problems. There are other small bugs in the game but generally nothing is game breaking. Everything else about the game is decent, but the combat makes me want to rip my hair out sometimes.   Don't get me wrong, the game can be very satisfying especially if played with friends, I just want to focus on some of the some of the things I want the developers to fix.  The following is a list of things that I find unbalanced, or generally annoying about combat.    Too much wind.  Ships are so slow in combat, it needs to be faster, more exciting, and action packed.    Enemy ships have high accuracy  and usually fire immediatly upon you entering their range. For comparison the player may have to spend several seconds charging and aiming canons to get the most damage potential.    It is hard to check how much ammo you have before entering a battle , sometimes you will enter combat and find you have little ammo left.    Boarding is slow, boring, and not very interactive.  You can weaken enemy crew before boarding but sometimes you weaken them as much as you can only to find they still have a huge crew with full health. The crew strength number does not seem representative of how strong the enemy crew is at all.    Fights with legendary creatures (eg The Kraken) can be annoying and generally not fun after the first couple of times you encounter them.  I believe changing the wind could fix this a bit. Usually in fights with these creatures there is little to nothing you can do to avoid their attacks. You just sit there taking hits and whoever dies first loses. This makes the mechanics seem a bit pointless and makes the fights lose the unique feelings they should have. For example the Kraken will have a red circle where its tentacle is about to hit and after a second or two it hits, but the ships are so slow you usually cant do anything to avoid it anyway.    Smoke shells should only reduce accuracy  instead of making you completely miss every shot.    Artifact mechanics are kind of annoying.  I feel like the whole system needs to be rebalanced in some way. In each fight the enemies appear to endlessly use artifact (and you could be facing multiple enemies) whereas you only get to use it a couple of times until you have depleted all your energy. The only way to recover energy while in combat is to use a special cannonbal that is very expensive.   The combat does not succed in making you feel like you're in the action enough.    The biggest issue I have with the game is the wind and generally just how slow it the ships feel.  If this one thing were changed I believe it would be much more enjoyable. Yes I know, ships in this setting are supposed to be slow but this is just an action RPG video game about pirates so if realism gets in the way of fun then why bother keeping it?  This is still an alright game and very fun to play with friends but I would not recommend paying full price for it in its current state. I will try to update this review as I see fit. If the combat is made more interesting then I would be glad to change this to a positive review. From what I have seen the developers seem to still be working on this game and communicate with players so it is not completely abandoned.",

And i really do hope the developer improves this game alot :) So here are my pros and cons.  ========== Pros    Trading System    Open World    CO-OP    Battles are amazing    ITS PIRATES!  ========== Cons    Docking needs to be improved    Other than that... NO CONS!  ",

Money wasted, unintalled. ",
