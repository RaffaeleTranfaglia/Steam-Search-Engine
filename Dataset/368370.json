            "review_text": "Her Story consists entirely of entering key word searches into a database and watching short video clips (often &lt; 30 seconds). The 'mystery' exists only because of the arbitrary restriction imposed by the database--you have to find clips by searching rather than simply browsing them in chronological order. Eventually the game will cue you when it feels you have watched enough of the clips to grasp the entire story. For me this was after a little more than an hour, though I got the gist of the story after about 30 minutes or so.   This is not a detective game, it's an exercise in fractured narrative. I'm not sure why so many reviewers have pointed out a need for pen and paper, it makes as much sense as watching something like Eternal Sunshine with pen and paper. Narrative games are fine, but the story in this one is quite absurd and many of the clips are poorly acted/written/just nonsensical (e.g. the song, so 'on the nose' and completely inappropriate given the context). I hit on the main twist about 15 minutes in and spent the next hour expecting a counter-twist because the initial twist was so ridiculous.  Over all it's entertaining until you realize there's actually nothing to it, and it won't last you more than 2 hours.",

            "review_text": "'Her Story' is a bit of a throwback to the days of the FMV/live action video adventure games. Those games would play out stories in a linear fashion based on some choices that you made in a choose your own adventure format. Then real life actors would act out the scenes of the story as if watching a television show, or movie. There were actually some well known actors in some of these games even if the stories and writing were incredibly cheesy even for the time. 'Her Story' uses these FMVs with live action video just like these old games do, but it doesn't follow a linear path, nor does it have you choosing the adventure based upon choices. Instead you are able to view all the stories and mysteries of the narrative by hitting points along the time line in a totally random fashion. Making it an interesting and fun way to piece together the mystery.   When you first boot up the game you find yourself sitting at on old fashioned police computer's desktop. It appears like you are using something along the lines of Windows 3.1, or Windows 95. It is exactly like using a computer desktop so it feels like using a computer playing this game. On the screen in front of you is a police archives search engine with the word 'murder' typed into the search box. Upon clicking the 'search' button you are presented with several videos of what looks to be an interrogation film from a suspect interview, which we find out immediately that it is. This woman is being questioned about a murder. Specifically the murder of her husband. Now where do we go? We have 4-5 videos here we can watch and now we are on our own. We are tasked with investigating this story ourselves to find out everything.  So how does this work? Just as you found the word 'murder' typed into the search box at the start, you figure out that to find out more about this story you need to search other terms in that box. Based on the videos you watch you pick up clues like names, or other meaningful words, then search them to find more videos. Also, like anyone who may be questioning a murder suspect you think of things you would normally ask them as well that you may not have even seen in the videos such as the location of 'the body'. Every time you search a term, or phrase a new set of videos will pop up for you to view. They will be from random dates from the 7 or so interview sessions the woman was brought in for questioning. Each search term and phrase is something that was in the transcript from these interviews. So basically that first search of 'murder' popped up every video in which the term was used. The game doesn't make it that easy though to find all the videos. You can't simply search 'the' for instance and have 200 videos show up. It limits you to only seeing 5 of however many have that term, or phrase so you must either expand on the phrase to eliminate videos, or search another one to end up with those other videos. You can unlock more options after 'finishing' the game to help make finding 100% of the videos easier.   It sounds simple, and it really is, but the story being woven through the randomly watched videos becomes a very fascinating mystery. Not just about the murder case you seem to be looking for information on, but there are many secrets that are uncovered through clever searching into the archives of these video interviews. Things that first seemed to be quite straight-forward end up being something else entirely. You begin to question the reality of what you have learned thus far, and you start to consider many alternate theories as to what is going on, who this woman is, and what she may be lying about. In fact, most players begin to start scrawling notes on pieces of paper so that they can remember all the things that they want to search for next. They want to find a time line, or even just want to connect some dots, but if this game gets you interested I can almost guarantee you that you will take out a piece of paper and start taking notes while you play.   I very much suggest that you DO NOT read about this game, or its story before playing it. There are many secrets that can be spoiled by doing so, and it will hurt the fun of having those internal debates with yourself that everyone carries to the forums after they have completed the game fully. It is much more fun, and fascinating to try and figure out what you think is going on yourself, and maybe even create your own theories as you play than to have a few handed to you by someone else before you get the chance.   I found 'Her Story' to be a great way to tell a story. Not just the format of giving you small pieces of it at a time through videos, but also due to the disjointed time line you watch it in. Everything is learned in such a way that you will be pulling a handful of jigsaw puzzle pieces out of a hat randomly without having the picture on the box to draw reference from. Only when you have pulled a large portion of these pieces out of the hat can you begin to sort them and put them together in a manner that shows you what the picture is supposed to look like. It asks you to ponder on what you have seen and allows your imagination to work out some theories while you play, which I found to be incredibly rewarding.   I would recommend this game to all adventure fans of both point and click adventures and Visual Novels. Obviously anyone that has enjoyed FMV games in the past must grab this immediately as well since many reviewers actually claim it is the best one of these ever made. I would say that fans of detective stories and mysteries will find this format appealing too. If you like to use clues to solve problems and mysteries you should enjoy this. This game will take you about 3 hours if you speed through it and don't bother trying to discover all the mysteries and unlock all the videos. For someone that wants to find all the depths of the story, unlock 100% of the videos present, it will take you 5-6 hours most likely, and could take more if you take your sweet time. There are achievements and 3 trading card drops. Getting 100% in all Achievements is fairly simple, but will require that 100% videos found and it will take you 5 hours most likely to go through.",

Her story is an unsolved murder case which you try to solve by putting the disordered interrogation movie puzzle pieces together. It's much more like an interactive movie compared to the classical type of game. For me this is like an alpha for the upcoming movie industry in '20' years - interactive movies, one audience and dozens of different perceptions at the end. But don't get me wrong, her story has no open ending if you are a good detective.   Pros:  + great idea + good atmosphere + good story + good ost + nice detective database researching + okay controls + fair price tag +++ beautiful&amp;good actress +++ win 3.11 ui :)   Cons:  - no replayability (if you mind) - the clicking might get repetitive - I got too early to the (end)credits =100min.   but truly all my questions were solved after 200min.   Rain outside, no good movie atm (&amp; maybe on sale) - grab her story and enjoy an interactive detective story movie. ",

The silly 'ghost-like imagery' that pops up every now and then is unnecessary and distracting, but I understand the creators may have felt it necessary to keep the UI from being too static.  I do wish the game had a 'goal' to it, like a 'whodunit' kind of mystery, but that just may be my desire for familiarity and nostalgia talking. I had a great time piecing together the story and getting to know the character(s), which is the point of the experience.

If it's a good concept you're looking for, Her Story certainly has it - but I feel that the execution falters on a couple of levels.  On the gameplay level, the restriction to five videos per search gets rather annoying, especially when new keywords aren't always easy to come up with. It seems like a necessity, to avoid trivializing the game (you'll realize this if you think to input   a blank search, which returns all videos  ), but it doesn't improve the experience any.  But more significantly, on the story level, the game feels a tad  unsatisfying .  I won't say too much even behind spoiler tags, but essentially,   what the precise state of affairs is with regards to the interrogated woman, is never confirmed. Instead, after viewing enough clips, you receive a 'call' asking if you're done; answering yes is your game ending, with a single, final revelation about the player character.    Her Story is a game based on a concept and a story about a woman's life. If that overrides the questionable execution - both story and gameplay wise - then you'll like this game.

The story was very interesting, though I don't think that it was necessary to cut the clips to be so short. That being said, I did enjoy the process of searching the database to find ALL of the videos, even though I know that this is what a lot of reviewers disliked, finding it tedious.  All in all, I really liked this game and I recommend it, but really think of how much you'd really enjoy searching for 271 short videos using nothing buy keywords in a database that only shows 5 results at a time.",

Read me files tell the player how to play, Dbchecker shows player process in how much data they have seen and what I think is key plot points in the volumes missing text.  Premise: game already starts with you having a search case “murder” - creating player interest and pushing them into the core loop.  Narrative: told in a non-conventional method, where the player gets bite sized pieces based on their search term (which is limited to the first 5 queries). You find search terms through watching videos since they are all transcript/keyword linked together in some way.  (Spoiler) Length : ———————Running time is 2-3 hours, however can be abrupt once some search terms (or % of db/plot points discovered?), where you get a chat message and taken to the credit sequence of the game. I didn’t really know the full story or what just happened and seemed disjointing in the experience, but could be a way in how the game creates meta around by getting players discussing the game based on where it left them.  Other: does a great job in creating a roleplayer experience as a detective (even grabbing pen and paper at times to write things down). Great use of FMV, makes the person being interrogated feel human (than if it was CGI/modelled). The simplicity of your interactions with the game would make it feel great to play on tablet (I played on PC).",

The story of  Her Story  only works if the actress is believable and the acceptance of your mysterious blonde identity plugging away at an outdated computer. Viva Seifert is astounding and I tried my very best to uncover all that I could about her life. Accepting and utilizing the search function as best as possible is its own obstacle. The challenge is player created as there is no end game. Search terms come five at a time from keywords the actress uses or your own guesses and interests in her life.   My time with  Her Story  was extremely enjoyable until I hit a wall in my leads, searches, and patience. I used the game-given option to leave satisfied and the credits rolled. Afterwards, I went for all achievements and quickly quit the game. As I said, the second that you remove yourself from the story and play this as a game to complete to the end, it loses all interest and the remaining clips become an achievement trudge. Even though I hit a wall, I have to recommend this for how interesting and memorable this brief FMV clip searcher and watcher is. Whatever you put into  Her Story , it will give back double.",

Not the best in the world, but still pretty good. You can tell that a lot of effort was put into the game, unlike some of the rushed unfinished indie pieces that get thrown onto Steam.

Sadly for this game, I am really good at google foo. I am not bragging, but unfortunatly I stumbled upon the 'twist' of the game ridicilously early. First three minutes, to be precise. While the story itself is still interesting, it had exactly nill mystery or atmosphere to it for me, which it obviously tried very hard to build with some of the clips hinting and suggesting wildly while not giving away too much. Too bad that someone savvy or lucky enough can just randomly scroll over right to the ending and spoil themselves within the mechanics to the game. Again, Analouge did this much more elegantly by limiting how much you can access. I am not going into details since I am trying to avoid spoilers to both games. Point is, Analouge had multiple moments of story discovery which felt like gutpunches because you uncovered resolutions to previous hinted or told stories, while in Her Story the pacing is left completely to the players hands. Without any guidance. There is exactly one single guideline, right at the beginning, and it feels like a tutorial guideline while also being one of the most important puzzle pieces.  The five video at a time search limit is a mechanic obviously meant to stop people from typing in some of the more obvious to occur words by obfuscating the database with 'filler' clips. Problem is this is quite a tad annoying as the filler clips are often under 10 seconds and not very interesting, and it also obfuscates any kind of overview one would have while doing an actual search. The other tools provided by the game are good enough, and the desktop enviroment is immersive and I'd even call it clever, if it hadn't been done before. No not by Analouge, but by an even earlier game by Love: Digital a Love Story. Now that I've written this out, 'Her Story' seems to be a bit of a reference to these games, both ending on story? Or just coincidence? Anyway, even other games have been doing this before so while its nice, I can't give it originality points.  Loves games tend to include quite a bit of engagment with NPC's/characters inside the games world. Her Story also tried this, but this kind of interaction is surprisingly limited. The one time it did occur, it was effective and the game predicted precisely what I wanted to say at that moment. But otherwise you will feel isolated and as if you are watching an indie movie, not playing a game. As much as Analouge and other VN's get trashed for just being 'read and click' games, Her Story sadly has even less interaction for a game. What the game did make me, is pull out a pen and tiny note paper to write down all the search terms that came to my mind while watching the videos. Striking out terms as I search them was a small game in of itself, and felt very satisfying.  Her story is actually a interesting story, when we are talking about the story itself. It was surprisingly simple, when you break it down, but it is represented well, the acting is surprisingly good and I am sure if watched chronologically this would make for an alrighty thriller found footage movie or an ok episode of a crime TV show. There's been thought and details put into it despite the main premise being a bit... stretching believability.  Too bad about the pacing being dictated by pure luck. Still, this is quality work trying to experiment with the medium and format, and I certainly appreciate it. It doesn't have nearly the same catharsis or emotional engagement as Analouge or other Love games had for me, but it is interesting in its own right, hence my recommendation. I can see the criticism, and despite my general inide game elitism I can agree that this game can feel a bit of a chore and uninspired at moments, and that it has very little interaction to offer. The story itself is just a bit above average. And yet it is an interesting way of spending a couple hours, and if you are a person who appreaciates a bit more artsy videogames, the indie dev scene or alternative ways to tell a story, you should certainly enjoy this game.",

The way the story was told was indeed very cool and innovative, and I can see this general concept being used for much larger stories and games. And the story itself was also pretty well-written and was really interesting to unravel. The acting was pretty cool, and the more of the story you understand, the more you notice little things that slowly start to make way more sense. So if you're open for something new, this is going to make you pretty happy. It has this 'not actually a game'-vibe, similar to 'Gone Home' or the likes, and the gameplay is kept to a minimum, but still, I did feel involved and it did feel I'm not just watching a show, I was really actively piecing together a story.  I'm a little unhappy about how short and simple it all seems when you're done. When I read all the reviews about people going 'oooooooh I'm gonna need pen and paper for this one!' I got pretty excited for something really complex, but once you're through, you could sum it up in about 3 sentences. Also, it has absolutely no replay value, but that's a given with story-focussed games like this one.  So in general, I'm relatively happy with this game, and would say it was worth the 5€ for the general experience, but it was an even shorter experience than it had to be, really. This whole concept and piecing-together mechanic could make up for pretty big games and complex stories, and that is what I would really love to see.",

It is a game because the mechanics aren't what make it, the actual murder mystery is what makes it. Your goal is to unravel the mystery, or more likely, come up with a minimal half-baked theory that could be a solution as to what is going on. And that's the big part of Her Story - all those searches will paint a broad, weird picture of things I will not care to spoil for you. Let's just say that   once you decide where to go after the 'murder' keyword, you're gonna be trapped in a ♥♥♥♥ing maze. A maze where there's a lot of weird fairy tale ♥♥♥♥ going on.    The proto-vaporwave look of the game is important because the game needs to separate you from the things that are going on. The grainy Windows 95 ugliness and the warped VHS-to-digital transfers of video really aid in the immersion, putting you right there in the seat of that crime database, ready to do some super-sleuthing. Hell, even the search engine is archaic, because it won't give you more than five entries at a time. That's where you gotta put on your thinking cap and figure out how to narrow your search to get what you want. Or you could, like I did, type in random swear words and get an achievement for it.  I can't say anything reliably about the bigger topics that the game wants me to explore, but I liked how I simultaneously felt lost and yet still in some kind of control in the game. The game's narrative is very non-linear and is largely powered by whatever keywords you pick that sound interesting, and by either accident or design, you'll either come to how the murder was done, what the murder was about, who the interviewee (played by Viva Seifert) is, or even what happened in certain cases. You'll find out some things and other things will be completely in the dark. The thing is, the game still manages to lead you to where the necessary facts of the case are just through topics brought up in the discussions, and that's how I played - jumping from one topic to another depending on what was brought up. I don't understand it all (and if the discussion boards are anything to go by, there is no real solution), but I enjoyed getting lost.  So yeah, it's cheap and it's a mind-bending experience that threatens to change your look on the case at every turn. Fantastic stuff to play through!",

I turned it off after 5 minutes. I heard the youtuber describe the concept, i went and checked the reviews on steam and just bought it. The concept to me was awesome and from hearing about it for 5 minutes i realised it could be easil spoiled and i knew i wanted to experience this game for myself.  Her Storyis a really really great game. I've not seen anything like it before. If you have any interest in murder mysteries, shows based around detectives and their cases you'll love this game. You're not told anything about the case you're just thrown this database containing a bunch of clips of this woman and it's up to you to first of all piece together what the case is and then to solve it. What i found made it such a unique experience is that there is no way you can play it without a pen in hand and to be constantly taking notes on things you hear or things that dont sit right with you. I ended having a big board full of character details, timelines, keywords to search for and theories and ideas i had about the case. Never before has a game involved me so much outside of the computer screen.   Pros: -Unique gameplay -Involves you outside of the actual game itself -Makes you come up with theories about the case without ever acknowleding what happens so its up to you when you think you've cracked it -Complex story (at least what i think the story is) that is left to you to fabricate -Makes you feel like a badass detective if you make some form of a breakthrough -Very simple mechanics, you wont waste any time trying to get the hang of things  Cons: -It was slightly annoying never being able to hear what the interviewer asked, only the womans responses -Some clips seem to be broken down into very short pointless sentences  -Can't see any replayability value To be perfectly honest it's tough to come up with many cons. Even with the ones i've chosen, i'm not completely happy with them it's really me nit picking with them. The reason i can't come up with anymore cons is that i've nothing to compare it to, nothing that done it better or had one mechanic that really helped in playing the game.  Conclusion: I love this game. Its unique and involves the player way more than any other game i've played. While other games are left to interpretation this whole game is open to interpretation. Whether you find that a bit annoying is completely up to you. Personally i love it. You go through the game coming up with whatever theories you can conjure up that you might think are solid but the next minute can seem ridiculous. Its a great game and definately worth the small price tag. It makes you feel like a proper detective, especially if you get a big notice board and write out everything your thinking.  Great game, really the biggest problem i have is that i cant see how you might replay it, but some games are just like that i guess   9/10",

So, Hannah finds out about her sisters pregnancy and wants eve to move in with simon and her (which is in THEIR dead parents house with some attic dollhouse playroom they kept.. just to add another creep factor) and its then that simon realizes OH NO, I IMPREGNATED HER SISTERRRWRWRWR! After that, on the sisters' birthday since they share the same day, simon makes two mirrors for each one, but really wants to be with Eve the beezy B, and Hannah just aint having it, so basically she throws a fit, breaks eve's mirror, and in a jealous rage, she wildly, uncontrollably, tantrum-throwingly slashes simons throat with a shard of glass from the mirror. In the end, They think theyre smart enough to fool ol' detective gumshoes and he basically finds out whats going on and that theyve been switching places between interrogation sessions. Unfortunately by the 7th interview, Hannah has made her boring escape in their crappy chevy cavalier (or maybe it was simons work van) and eve takes the blame for the murder (but she tries to play that 'oh but you dont have a murder weapon so I cant be charged EVEN THOUGH I just told you exactly what happened' card and it doesnt work because the 1st regional court #302 at Portsmouth's combined court centre in England convicts her @$$ for a life sentence in a maximum security facility.

Basically, you're given this large database of videos you can watch that were recorded during multiple interviews with the main character. The order in which you watch them is determined basically by what you want to see first. If you type in a word, then every video where the main character says that word pops up.  So some videos appear to just be filler, but most of them contribute some sort of info to the plot. So the helpful ones give you more terms to search to get more information.   I think I had a little more than 50% of the videos discovered when I 'beat' the game. I use that term loosely because the story is very vague, and largely up to the player's interpretation. However I will admit that there are some bits of the story that you can learn very early on that get endlessly repeated.  It's not a game without its flaws. It doesn't really have you solving any puzzles (other than piecing together the story). There's no information you technically need to 'beat' the game, you just type 'yes' and then 'yes' and you're done. Also it's become a bit tedious to find every single video, which is a task easier said than done, considering there are 272 videos.  However I will ultimately recommend Her Story because, well, it's never been done before. It may not be the best new experience ever but I'd be damned to say I didn't find it interesting. I definitely believe that this is also something worth experiencing on your own, because the odds of someone having the exact same playthrough as you are incredibly slim.",

I had to cheat (you'll learn how when you finish the game) to view them. 3) Don't expect a message like 'Congratulations, you have solved the case!'

            "review_text": "If we're being frank, this isn't really a game so much as a puzzle. But it's an intriguing puzzle and enjoyable to put together. You're presented with fragments of a story, and it's up to you to put the pieces together and figure out who killed whom and why. It's definitely an engaging little oddity of non-traditional storytelling, and worth the price of admission in my opinion.  This is a narrative-driven game, so it lives and dies by its story and characters. If this were a crime novel, I think the story would hold up but maybe feel a little cliche to veteran crime drama enthusiasts. In this medium, however, it's harder to see the various twists and turns coming, so the whole thing feels fairly original and quite compelling. Considering all you have to tell the story are a few basic text prompts and a single actor going through all these interrogations, it all carries a surprising weight. I definitely had a few little 'holy ♥♥♥♥' moments along the way as the pieces started to click into place in my mind.  If you were looking for a detective game, this really isn't one. You do investigate and find clues buried in the archive of video clips, but there's no real in-game mechanic for tracking or using the clues. If you want any visual aids to track all the things you've discovered, you'd better have a notepad on hand to jot down details, because the UI offers no real help in that area. Considering the complexity of the plot, some note-taking may be necessary, especially if you expect to come back to this game and be able to understand any of it later. It's not too long, so I would definitely recommend trying to get as far as you can (or as far as you care to) in your first few play sessions while it's all still fresh in your mind.  The keyword search mechanic is an interesting way to work your way through the clips in a somewhat logical (if not chronological) order. It's a basic tool the player (viewer?) is likely already familiar with, and even haphazard use of it can turn up unexpected results. As it turns out, there is a way to cheese this core mechanic and easily unlock and view all of the clips very quickly, which is a bit of a relief for completionists but could potentially harm one's enjoyment if discovered too early. The user tags function doesn't seem terribly helpful in general, but it does have its personal uses. I assume the local clip storage area does as well, particularly if you need a refresher on clips you deemed important to remember or wanted to view in a different order, but the game is short enough that I haven't had much use for it.  I'll try not to spoil the ending, but this isn't a game you beat so much as an experience you choose when to walk away from. I intend to finish tracking down and viewing all of the clips (with only sparing use of the aforementioned cheesy way of doing so), but the ending can be reached well before that. Eventually a chat window will show up, and you'll be asked if you're done with your search. If you say yes, then you're done. View ending, roll credits. It's a bit underwhelming, and definitely not as satisfying as the sense of discovery that the rest of Her Story gets across so well.  While I think Her Story has its flaws, I've definitely enjoyed it all the way through. For me, any story that keeps me thinking about it well after I've put it down for the night is worth investing more time in. I've unraveled most of the big secrets at this point (I think...) but I know there are more details to explore and I'm more than willing to burn a couple more hours finding them.  Should you get Her Story?  If you like a good crime drama, yes.  If you can enjoy games that aren't really games in the traditional sense, yes.  If anything I said in this review intrigues you, yes.  If you read this far and don't understand why someone would enjoy something like this, then it might not be for you. Everyone else, give it a try. It's worth a few dollars and at least an hour and a half of your life.",

No complex mechanics or learned gaming skill set is needed. A player only needs to know how to search and deduct information from the next video they find. I played this with a friend who had no gaming experiencing whatsoever and we both enjoyed it on an equal level.  The events/drama are akin to a solid BBC Crime drama, but with you as the detective. You cannot be a passive audience though and you wont know 'whodunit' until you work out the case and ask the right questions (that is, search the correct terms).  It has twists and suprize moments as well as the occasional red herring. There is great satisfaction in figuring out an element of the story and having a large peice of the puzzle fall into place.  My only criticism is the open ended nature of the searching, technically you could throw random words in and risk early spoilers. I would recommend avoiding this type of guess work and simply search for terms that are natural follow up words to the information you have learned.  A play through will last a few hours, making it the perfect night in game. I recommend playing with a friend or partner. Sit back, search, down junk food and solve a mystery.",

I just wish there had been more investigating required. More visual and audio clues that wouldn't come up in a search. Of course getting 100% of the videos is certainly difficult if you try to manually search for key words, but that's mostly because some of the videos are super short with only a handful of words spoken that are off topic even. But clearly, and thankfully, there is a way to view all the videos chronologically...a method that is searchable online and therefore I will not spoil in this review.  In the end I had some fun with this game, but it was brief and ultimately the brevity and simplicity was disappointing.

Each player will have their own interpretation and conclusions based on their specific research.  Cons: -The game does not set a task before you. You are seriously just tossed in front of a display without being told what you are supposed to be doing. -No motivation to do so. -No reward for completing the task set before you. You respond to a chat and the credits roll. Did I beat the game? Did I discover the truth? What was the truth? What did I accomplish, exactly? It's very unclear how or when you have solved the crime.

As we learned more about Hannah's story, someone would randomly shout out, 'Scissors! Search for scissors!' (not a real example). We drew pages of notes, timelines, and apparel descriptions and got into side arguments about what was really going on. We returned to earlier videos with new information and the game became puzzle-like, deducing clues from minor variations in her behavior.  This game accomplishes what LA Noire, another fantastic game, attempted to do with interrogations. Clues are very subtle, and both red herrings and legitimate insights are anticipated by the developer and rewarded with big revelations and sometimes jokes at your expense.  I was under the impression that solving the crime was the goal of the game, but don't expect that to be the case. We 'solved' the crime very early on in the investigation, but the goal turned out to be somewhat different. This is not a Sherlock Holmes game.  As long as you are not expecting anything different, this game is absolutely worth the price. Instead of renting an on-demand movie, grab your significant other and a few friends and try to decipher the story of Hannah Smith.",

You just stop when you feel satisfied (or when you've watched every single video). Despite not having a strictly defined pace, the game still manages to have very interesting twists and turns. I sat down with a pen and paper and was furiously scribbling notes as the videos played. My time with this game was short, but it was very enjoyable and very interesting.",

If you're interested in an interesting story and fresh way of storytelling, I would recommend Her Story. But if you're looking for more gameplay in a game I'd say stay away from this one. The time spent trying to get all achievements for this game felt more like a chore than an added experience of discovering every nook and cranny. Finding all videos was met with dissappointment when I just missed out on videos that felt like they could have been ommitted in the first place.

From a story standpoint, the game is excellent. I will not give away the clue, but let's just say I found the story intriguing, while somewhat easy to figure out, and even heart breaking at times. The way the story is told, out of order and in the way you piece it together, makes for an experience I have never seen before in a game. It was very refreshing. This is further enhanced by the terrific acting the actress shows in the shown clips. The game is also very atmospheric. The game makes loud keyboard noises as you type in search terms, the light flickers at times, and the computer makes weird noises. It adds to the 'investigative feel' of the game.  It has major flaws though. First of all, it is very simplistic. All you do is watch video clips and type in keywords to find more clips. That's it. I love detective stories and figured out the mystery pretty quickly. It would have been more engaging if we had the option to do some lie detecting, delving into archives, answering questions, etc. Just looking for clips made the experience slightly underwhelming. Also, finding some of the clips was extremely hard due how specific some keywords have to be. I spend over an hours typing in random words just to get the final clips (to get the 100% achievement), which was one of the most frustrating experiences I ever had in a video game. There is little skill involved and thus feels very 'unfair'.  For what I got, especially at the low price it is at, I can recommend it. But with great caution. This game is not for everyone. But if you are interested in games that transcend the medium and deliver an interesting experience, I would definitely give it a try. And I am very interested to see a similar game with more varied gameplay elements.  + Great story + Good acting + Does something unique  - Could have been much more - Tedious to look for clips",

Watching the trailers kind of gave me flashbacks to  Night Trap  and other horrible full motion video games back in the 90s but this is much more than just a novelty.  2. The reason for number 1 is Viva Seifert's acting, very strictly. It was a performance that required a heroic amount of subtlety to even be decent and she made it great.  3. Honestly, the rave reviews for  Her Story 's writing are more indicative of how low the writing bar is set in gaming than it is of the writing actually being good. This is really about made for TV level. Sure there are some interesting bits but it's nothing fans of the mystery genre don't see a hundred times a year.  4. I only realized number 3 after thinking about the game quite a bit after playing. The reason for this is number 2.  5. It is worth emphasizing that this is the kind of game you will think about quite a bit after playing.  6. Though the gameplay is not at all the same, I feel like this fits in the with the walking sim genre in terms of feel. The difference is instead of wandering around and discovering little bits and bobs about the story in the manner of, say,  Dear Esther , you input searches into a database program and the story is revealed to you through the videos that come up.  7. This was way more engaging than any walking sim I've ever played. Te explain this, I will simply point you once again to number 2.  8. As a story telling medium, this type of game really works but I think it could have been done a lot better. It only took me an hour or maybe an hour and a half to figure out essentially everything important but it took me four hours to finish the game.  9. Number 8 brings us to the essential problem with this style of story telling, which is that it kind of inherently can't have a planned climactic moment. Maybe it's your hundredth search that gives you the big reveal, maybe it's the second.  Her Story  seemed to try to get around this by having many small reveals but the problem remains that you may find all the good stuff early on and then find yourself watching unimportant garbage for the next hour or two.  10. This game doesn't really end. After a while, you basically get an option to say you don't want to play anymore and then when you quit, the credits roll. This is again kinda the same problem as 8 and 9.  11. This does not wrap up everything in a neat little package for you when it's done. The ending such as it is is intentionally ambiguous. If that bothers you, grow up.  12. I went and rewatched the videos in order after playing and I do think the story works better as it was presented than it would have been in a more traditional manner. I don't think this is quite so ground breaking as some of its little marketing blurbs would have you believe but you have almost  13. It is worth emphasizing that  Her Story  is good enough that I wanted to go back and rewatch everything immediately after playing. See again: number 2.",

The first few videos may confuse you, or have you believing in something else completely unrelated to the core story. You will continue to poke around and start to separate the truth from the lies. When you finally get to the big reveal, you're in for a treat.  From a design perspective, information is presented to you in a way that is very clever. If you miss a key word, certain videos repeat key words to get you on the right track. If you hit a dead end, there is a history that saves your recent searches. You can also save videos in a timeline if they seem as if they hold a vital clue to getting a little further in the story. All of these elements will ensure your success despite the vague nature of the videos.  Highly recommended for those who are looking for something different or mystery fans.",

            "review_text": "'Her Story' feels quite similar to last years 'Cloud Chamber', which also was a FMV based investigation game, but instead of having a social-gaming component and trying to harvest 'Likes' to advance the plot, 'Her Story' lets you search through a database via keywords on your own in single-player.  The game puts no restrictions real restrictions on how you search through the database, you can randomly guess keywords or use keywords you gathered from the video files. The only restriction is that the search results are limited to five videos, so that overly broad keywords don't automatically reveal half the database. Each video is very short, often just 20sec or less, this allows the game to keep a good flow of user interaction going even so the player is for most part a passive observer. The order in which you get to view the videos is completely determined by your keyword searches, so it can be pretty random.  The game does not contain any kind of puzzles or code to crack, it's all pretty straight forward dialog and focused on names and events for most part. So it's mostly about paying attention to the video, a bit of note taking can however help to keep track.  The biggest problem I had with the game is the lack of a way to watch the videos in order, there is a database-checker that will keep track of your progress and give you an idea of where the current video fits in, but it can't be used to rewatch past videos, the keyword search is your only way. I would have liked the ability to manually having to order the videos in the correct sequence, functionality for that is essentially already in the game, but it doesn't work for the large number of videos the game presents you with.  Overall this is a fantastic game or interactive movie or however you want to call it. It's pretty small scale as it is just one actress in a rather mundane room, but the out-of-order'ness of the videos keeps your head working on piecing it all together. The whole presentation with the low-fi digitalized VHS tapes is also pretty nice. ",

But to the contrary, there is indeed an ending, one I find very emotionally satisfying and which successfully changes a player's perspective on the game. (You will know it when you find it.) Another common criticism is that the game lacks basic gameplay elements, and that the 'play' aspect merely consists of keyword searches. That is a valid criticism, up to a point; after all, the game isn't Overwatch, nor does it try to be.
