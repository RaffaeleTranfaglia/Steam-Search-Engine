            "review_text": "Eh, you know what? This was worth the $1.50 or whatever it was I paid for it. I got 3 nights' worth of entertainment out of it, which is about the perfect length for something like this.  None of the puzzles (including the last, bonus content ones) will stump anyone for a long time, but theres enough of a challenge that you don't always feel like it was SUPER easy. The story is good enough, and there's some variety in puzzles - though you can break all of them down into:  1. Find hidden things in a picture 2. Find where fragments belong in a picture 3. Gather items and put them somewhere to unlock something 4. Gather items and put them somewhere, then manipulate them to unlock something 5. Manipulate something to unlock something   If you're a fan of the old point and click adventures, this is a reasonable game - best enjoyed when you just want to do some really casual puzzle solving, with your brain more or less turned off. The lack of complexity is countered by the lack of stupid mechanisms and minimal backtracking - I didn't feel like anything in the game was added to pad it out, either. Well, maybe a couple of the 'find stuff in a picture' puzzles.   This game is like a jigsaw on a rainy day (if anyone remembers or still does stuff like that) - it's not life-changing, but it's entertaining enough.",

I couldn't believe getting this game almost free with the sale...I would have paid alot more to experience the adventure. I was also surprised I didn't experience any glitches either. I would recommend anyone that enjoys playing point and click games to get this one! The one thing I was disappointed about was the ending seemed to be cut short alittle. It seemed to end but referenced they were waiting for the main character to come back. If they didn't mention that, then I would have felt the story ended completely and felt satisfied.",

            "review_text": "As someone who's not very good with scary and jumpscary things, this game was surprisingly enjoyable int hat aspect. Scary enough to get the creepy atmosphere, but not so much that I need to hide under a blanket mountain or change my underwear.  The story follows first person Ms. Frost who visits an old rich scientist (?) to see if the valuable object he has acquired is the real thing. As she says it is not, he break the item and a curse is released on him, Frost and the man's young daughter. Miss Frost now has to fix this, mostly to save the young girl. She collects items that help her on the way through hidden objects and and other minigames.   The game looks really good, and the music is fittingly atmospheric.  The difficulty is pretty good; varying between easy and not-too-frustratingly hard. This game uses the same HO scene more than once and does not remove the items found on the first go, other than the ones used to something before. There is a lot of backtracking and no option for teleporting.  There is a hint with fairly long cooldown, and there is a fitting 'punishment' for spamclicking the HO scenes.   The story is a bit confusing, though the bonus chapter that is unlocked after finishing the game partially explains some things, but much is implied rather than properly explained.   The voice acting is not the best, but not too annoying either. There are a few lines that get irritating as they are repeated a lot, either when location is opened or clicked on, that cannot be skipped.  Overall I really enjoyed this game and will probably play it again in the future.",

            "review_text": "Despite its beautiful artwork, this is a really tedious, repetitive game. The puzzles aren't challenging in the slightest, the characters are thinly drawn and poorly acted, and worst of all, it falls short on horror. Yes, there are demons, but there's no sense of danger, nothing uncanny, I kept waiting for it to become either creepy or challenging (or both - both would have been great!) but it never happened. I just slogged through one pointless hidden object puzzle after another until I unlocked some really uninteresting bonus content.   If you're looking for adventure, something scary, or just an engaging point and click, I wouldn't bother with this game.",

Too easy, too fast, the story is really meh and kinda stupid....  some parts made me giggle, like when the demon is all like ' YOU SHALL NOT PASS' then gives you a tip about the next puzzle... eh....   Well if you have absolutely nothing to do and nothing better to spend you money on, buy it and be happy. I'm glad I bought it almost for free or else I'd be regretting it an awful lot.

The puzzles are simple enough but fine, there's minor suspense/thrill to it, the graphics are simplistic but nice to see at the same time.  However I got through 2/6 chapters before becoming bored of the same item finding puzzles, especially when they started using the same boards to find items from, with some of the same items as last time too.  I'm sure though that if you're a bigger fan of this genre then you may get more out of it than I did.",
