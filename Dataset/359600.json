            "review_text": "This is the third in the series of Assassin's Creed Chronicles. They are 2.5D platformers in the vein of the far superior Mark of the Ninja (developed by Klei Entertainment). I really enjoyed the first entry in the series, China, and immediately bought India when it was released. India was significantly more difficult than China, but never frustrating. I enjoyed it tremendously.   So when Russia was released, I bought it without hesitation. These games, taken as a whole, add a few things to the Mark of the Ninja formula (such as bushes you can hide in), and they are nothing but a treat as far as visuals are concerned. Russia certainly looks great and I enjoyed the story. As far as difficulty is concerns, this is on par with India with one notable exception: the chase/escape missions.   My goodness, how I hate those missions! They are an excercise in frustration. The timing is brutal and the controls sometimes are more than a little dodgy, meaning you won't got off a ledge or up from a ladder before some sniper gets you in his crosshairs. At that point, it's game over and you'll have to do the whole thing again. I was struggling to get through a sequence with spotlights, snipers, and a train, and I kept dying over and over again in a way that didn't feel like it was my fault, but rather the game instead.   Having just died for the umpteenth time, I just don't feel like continuing. I've deleted the game from my drive. Perhaps at some point in the future, I will revisit it and try if I can get further. But for now, other and better games demand my attention. As such, I recommend you check out the China and India entries in this series, but skip this one for now.",

            "review_text": "I got this as part of the trilogy bundle and so far I've finished China and nearly at the end of Russia. Not much to say about this, except what is already known - it's a 2.5D platformer unlike the other games, it's not open world, though, yes, large portions are non-linear. The story is good and the art style is unique. One comment, though, is on its difficulty. This applies to both the titles I've played (and I presume, applies also to India, which I'm yet to try), and it's that you can either play through the segments perfectly, or desynchronize. I'm including in this the chase sequences as well as the combat mechanics. The stealth allows some room for error, though still not much. As for the combat, if you thought Unity's combat gameplay was tough, wait until you try this. It's still good, though - you never feel like an outlandish hero, and at times, distraction and discretion can be the best way, if not the only way. Overall? Did I mention it's really good? Alrighty then. Toodles!",

            "review_text": "At first this game shows a lot of promise. It went back to the methodical stealth action of the first installment in the series. I even though Ubisoft might have actually learned from the mistakes of ACC:India. But, as it usually happens with a Ubisoft game, they remembered it was an Ubisoft game and latter part of the game is another piece of ♥♥♥♥. What part of 'ASSASSIN' don't the understand? If I wanted to play an action platformer, I would play one with precise controls and quick retries. Well, at least these games are cheap and the look the part.",

This was a disappointing work for sure and I expected more from the franchise than a ridiculous comic book styled PLATFORMER with very little depth.
