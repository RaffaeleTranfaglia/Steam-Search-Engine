            "review_text": "While it's a tad bit pricey in it's current state (at least for me, as frugal as I am), I'm really impressed by the quality (especially graphics-wise) of this game.  It feels good to move and shoot, there's a feeling of satisfaction upon completing a challenging level (similar to Hotline Miami in some respects), and the Anomaly mode is a ton of fun.  It's also worth noting that the developer is quite heavily involved in the community hub, regularly responding to all kinds of criticism, both positive and negative.  In this day and age, the indie game scene is really taking the PC market by storm, and while this game doesn't have as many maps as I would like it to, I think this a good game to show people who believe that the indie market can't produce fun little things such as this.",
