    "description": "A psychological 2D puzzle platformer. You must switch between two versions of the past: dark &amp; light, positive &amp; negative, hope &amp; despair. Every action is innately tied to this dualistic battle. Traverse a surreal landscape of memory to try and mend a fragile mind.",

            "review_text": "I was initially attracted to Disorder not by reading the development diaries, or what the game was about, but by the post apocalyptic like imagery the screen captures portrayed (they also have a vague terraria like look with respect to the graphics, though not in game play mechanics).   On playing the game I was really surprised and pleased by the way the developer had created an otherworldly platformer, with two dimensions that you have to swap between to be able to progress. The imagery is a pixelated delight and the music and sound effects add substance to the artwork. Disorder is a creepy atmospheric platformer the like of which I've not come across before. Well worth buying IMO, even at full price.",

            "review_text": "Disorder is a great platformer with simple, yet entertaining mechanics and a ton of other original ideas. However it's really short; I sucked at it and still I've finished in 2 hours. So the price tag is a little bit too high, you may want to wait for a sale. What's not so good: Very strange menu controls. You access the menu by pressing 'P', not Escape. But Escape has its function, it switches the game from fullscreen to windowed mode. I never got used to it so I constantly had to go to the menu to switch the game back to fullscreen. Also, there is a free expansion pack but it's so difficult I wasn't able to get past the second screen and I finally gave up.",

            "review_text": "Uninteresting and very stock puzzle platformer with a not terribly engaging premise. I don't recommend on this basis alone but it's also SHOCKINGLY buggy!  Bugs I ran into while playing:  * Sound crapped out 5 minutes in and never ever came back * Moving platform cycles actually de-synced from one another rendering the puzzle impossible until I died a few times to get the cycles back in some sort of sync with each other. * I randomly became so slow during a particular puzzle that it made it really difficult to complete and actually almost put the game into an unwinnable if not for the fact that getting myself killed via fireball managed to unbug the game * 'GAMEPAD NOT SUPPORTED' text getting stuck on the screen for the entire final act of the game and all the way through the credits. It went away for the entire game but came back and wouldn't go away during what should've been a climactic finale.  garbage don't buy",

But I don't know how long I can play a game without shooting or punching someone. I'll have to get that agression out elsewhere.  Note: you can touch the spikes looking things if they are not animated. I didn't realize that so I was stuck at first.",
