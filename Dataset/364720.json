            "review_text": "Plays a little like a slower version of  Hotline Miami  with co-op (Coop Miami?). You control 2 characters Ronald Reagan , 40th president of the United States of America and Mikhail Gorbachev, the 8th General Secretary of the Soviet Union with plenty of flavour text and political digs throughout the in between level 'cut scenes'.  You are both abducted during peace talks in Iceland and must work together to escape the terrorists and foil their plot with Gorbachev's KGB know how and Reagan's action man heriocs. There are some nice game play interactions, your currently unused character can be called over as a sentry who auto shoots after you unlock/hack doors and some stealth elements requiring carefully timed switching between characters.  Keep in mind you get one shot at each level, if one of your characters dies then you immediately start the level from scratch. The levels are a good size and offer a variety of different challenges with most of the guards weaponry randomised giving you unique options on some playthroughs. I haven't played the co-op mode with another player yet but I imagine it would be even more fun strategising on the fly to overcome the enemy. I recommend  Reagan Gorbachev  to players interested in a politically themed twin stick shooter with puzzle and stealth elements.",
