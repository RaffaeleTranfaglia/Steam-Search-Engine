            "review_text": "If you are looking for a well rounded horse game, then this is a *very* well rounded horse game. It covers many aspects of horse life that other games do not usually include. These aspects include, but not limited to, horse riding, horse caring (beyond just cleaning and feeding), training, working with multiple horses, breeding and selling said horses, and running a profitable stable yard (where guests can rent your horses).   It takes a realistic approach to horses where it can while keeping in perspective that it is still a game. Some of these realities are the fact that your horse does get tired if run for too long, can get stressed, and even sick if not properly taken care of.   The in-game books (used for increasing skill levels) are not limited to in-game information, but rather information on the game's aspects in general, such as actual horse care, behavior to be taken when caring for a foal, etc.   As far as the technical aspects of the game goes, there are many positives. The graphics are not as realistic as most modern games, however, what it does have is beautiful. The controls are extremely simple, even if the concepts of the game are more for children 8+. The game restricts the player to an '8 hour day' where it will auto-save at the end of said day, so no night rides.   I would recommend this game for children 8+ and can go as high as teens to twenties. Definitely a fun, well rounded game for children and adults of all ages.",
