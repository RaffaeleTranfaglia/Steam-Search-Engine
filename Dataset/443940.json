This game is made in Unity. What the ♥♥♥♥, man? The game physics are practically non existant. The game mechanics are unlike anything I've ever seen. It's actually horrible, oh man, time to dodge more bear traps and lasers. The traps aren't fun or engaging or innovative, it's the same BORING REHASHED ♥♥♥♥ over and over. Oh look, MORE BEAR TRAPS. The voice acting is terrible (and russian, go figure.) This game isn't even worth 3.00 dollars. This game isn't even worth $0.50. I would ACTUALLY rather play bad rats. This is just torture. MORE BEAR TRAPS. The CIA should force guantanamo bay inmates to play this game to extract information. They'll be begging to snitch in 10 minutes or your money back, guaranteed. MORE BEAR TRAPS. MORE LASERS.  Overall I gave it a 9/510",

            "review_text": "  Do not buy this game. By any standards.  I recieved this game for free from an itch.io thing. And I want to refund it for free. Please.  Now of course I could just leave it here but I need to explain why. The FPS sits on a solid 3. Even on low graphics. Now I could blame my computer but it doesn't take 60 FPS to see this game looks like trash.  The battle isn't even 'Unknown' as it tells you what you're battling 3 seconds into the main menu (which lagged as well).  I died in the first 5 minutes of the game because of the horrible frame rate even though I could clearly see what was ahead.  In conclusion, do not buy Unknown Battle. If you recieve it for free, do not play it. If you play it, review it. Spread the word.  EDIT: When I originally tried to post this, it said I only had 1 minute on record, when I actually played 20. It even stops you from reviewing it.",

BUT you cannot play this with a regular keyboard... i had to switch my keyboard into turbo mode (i have a ducky mechanical keyboard) so your jumps always work and you can take high jumps too which are very necessary...  but the part after the jumps, where the robots come in, it's just totally bullcrap... it's again lasers and traps, and those little robotic spiders hunt you down and you can't do nothing against them... and as soon as they get to you your character loses control, starts to turn around and stuff like that and you just die .. you can't run away from them because you need to go into a room with only one door to deactivate a shield; then those spiders come from the other side of the lasershield where you have to go to... so you need to go into the hall where they are coming from, without any escape possibility... so you re just running into your death... you could try to run back a little through the field of bearclaws and lasers, but they only hit you and the mechaspiders (which are only 1ft high) are not hit by either of those... so that won't help either...   also, at this part of the game something is spoken in russian without english text translation, the text now is russian only too... nice...  this game should not be on steam if you ask me... it's far from finished... it should contain more of the jumping part and should work without having to enable my turbo mode so any one can enjoy it.... and the lasers/claws need to be a lot less, a hell of a lot less...",

After playing for about 30 mins (25 of which was spent trying to do a jumping puzzle that should have taken no more than 1 and a half minutes at most) I realize this game was either a first attempt by a new dev, or, he really didn't care about the product he was releasing.  Let's break it down into pros and cons...  Pro: - Good concept, interesting idea - Decent presentation at start  Cons: - Poorly optimized with lots of random frame lag - Sluggish controls and broken jumping (Pressing jump is not garunteed to make you jump... at all) - Every time you die you start from the beginning waking up wondering where the hell you are - Dated graphics feel like something from around 2004-ish - Sound is buggy, occasionally raising and lowering in volume on it's own  I was able to get past the broken English translations as that doesn't always mean it's going to be a bad game. This game however proves itself to be poorly designed within the first 5 minutes. Concidering this game has been out for 4 months now and hasn't recieved any major patches, I highly doubt it will happen.  TL:DR  Don't waste your money, there are better and bigger fish in the s(t)ea(m)",

Why?! you cannot finish this game by conventional means, and if you want to spend time trying to finish it with unconventional means, you need to find a better hobby. Terrible graphics, Terrible game design, terrible performance, just terrible everything.   Don't make games unless you are willing to really try, 'developer', this is unacceptable. You should be ashamed.  0/10",
