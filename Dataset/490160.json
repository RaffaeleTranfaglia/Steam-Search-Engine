BGM was just as great as it was on the first Time Tenshi (and once more, I’ll ask: please release this game’s soundtrack! The songs are really catchy).   This was a fairly good sequel, with a lot of fanservice (of course, this is the essence of this game — if you’re looking for a “deeper story” you’ll probably be disappointed with TT1 and 2). Like the first VN, it surprises me that the story itself isn’t that bad, and it goes smoothly without becoming boring.   5/10.   Some of the descriptions were really cheesy and laughable, like describing boobs by saying “mammoth mammary mountains”… lol  ",
