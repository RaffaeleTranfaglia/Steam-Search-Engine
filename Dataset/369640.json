The visuals and the colour palette are so vivid and well done that it really makes you feel like your in the game. But as for the gameplay, it seems lacking in that department. The game feels like it was all threw together, but it works. It's so hard to explain so let me try to summarize it for you..  -Good visuals -Bad layout.  I'm torn about this game, but it still gets a thumbs-up from me. Do give it a go!",
