            "review_text": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues right where Assassin's Creed II finished, so if you haven't played Assassin's Creed II I'd highly recommend playing that game first. Not only was it a good game, but it's almost essential at this point to play it so you can understand the story. This may not seem important, but for me the story is the most intriguing element to the entire franchise.  The gameplay continues to improve game-on-game, but it's pretty much the same mechanic we've seen since the first Assassin's Creed game. Sure they've removed the terribly rigid design to the missions where you MUST scale this tower before you can do anything else, and I'm personally grateful they did this. However, overall the gameplay isn't that amazing. It's fun, sure, but at the same time it's played it's course now. Don't get me wrong, you can still scale the towers to remove the fog of war, but now it's optional. In fact it works well within what is slowly becoming a very sandbox style world, and this is another area of the game I'm starting to enjoy with each Assassin's Creed game. Ubisoft seem to be aware of what people enjoyed from Assassin's Creed II and disliked from Assassin's Creed and have done a good job of doing more of the same, and removing the offending elements of gameplay.  Gone are the insane amount of collectibles, and instead we have more Tombs/Lairs to explore, Glyphs to discover and solve and an entire city to manage. While these elements aren't essential to complete the game, and at times they don't seem to to do much to the story at all (and I personally found the city management side of the game to be over before it begun), it's nice to see that there are options there for people who wish to slow things down and invest into the Assassin's Creed world.   It's not all roses though, there are a few elements to Brotherhood that confused me. I'm hooked into the story, I want to know more, I want it to expand and progress, and sadly Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood never truly felt like it got going. It felt that it was one long prelude into Assassin's Creed: Revelations, with most of the Memory Segments feeling more like tutorials for the new gameplay mechanics or refreshing into franchise staple gameplay mechanics (most of which any Assassin's Creed fan would hopefully already be aware of). It's a minor fault, and if anything it's something of a Ubisoft Trademark to have excessive gameplay hints/tips/tutorials throughout the game. It doesn't really distract from the game, but it does slow down the buzz and adrenaline that has built up after the huge climax to Assassin's Creed II. Now that I've finished the game, I'm not too concerned about the lull as I can fool myself enough to believe it was perhaps intentional pacing to bring you backdown to build you back up for Brotherhood's ending (which was decent).  Yet, I'm still left feeling 'what really happened' during Ezio's memory segments. I know who the main target was within the story, but you have so little interaction with them directly that you don't really focus on them (unlike in Assassin's Creed II where The Spaniard is referenced and featured in most segments).   Sadly there is one element to the game that is lagging behind Assassin's Creed II and that's the soundtrack. I was convinced it was a new composer as it just felt alien compared to the previous work of Jasper Kydd. I just couldn't connect to it.   Also, once again the character modles have changed ever so slightly but strangely noticably. A minor point of annoyance.   Overall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fun game, and somewhat fast paced (almost to the point where it feels like it's over before it even begun). If you're hooked into the series by this point I'd recommend buying Brotherhood as it continues the story in an easy fun game. If you didn't really enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I think it's best you bow out of the series now and leave Brotherhood, as it's more of the same. The characters are slowly developing, and the plot is thickening. I also know that some people don't enjoy the 'future tech' side of the game, namely the areas outside of Ezio (such as being Desmond and the whole Animus side of world). I personally enjoy the mix of history and Sci-Fi within the game, so I don't find this to be a problem; however for those who do find it a problem there is a somewhat large/significant portion of Brotherhood that centres around the 'adventures of Desmond', so again it might be best to avoid Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.",

Not much different from AC2, but for me, that's a good thing. You can ride horses in cities, call them from anywhere, recruit assassins to your brotherhood, carry double-handed weapons, use parachutes, and play with Leonardo's war machines. Also has a few nice flashbacks to Florence and Venice.  A few glitches and hiccups here and there, but the setting is otherwise stunning. Beautiful graphics and visuals, combined with a killer soundtrack, makes 16th century Rome look very enticing.",

            "review_text": "The missions are much more varied than in AC2 and they added some pretty neat new gameplay mechanics, like the assassin scholars for example. On top of that, every mission now has a secondary objective you can complete for 100% synchronisation, which adds a fun extra challenge. The gameworld is not as interesting, mainly since you only have one city instead of the 4 featured in AC2.  Also, in order to buy something at a shop, or unlock a fast travel location, you first have to liberate the district by lighting a heavily guarded tower on fire, and then buy the shop. You have to do this for EVERY shop in the game, which is incredibly annoying. This annoyance is however balanced out by the fact that you don't have to go all the way back to the villa every ♥♥♥♥ing time you want to deposit your feathers or collect your income.  In order to get the best items in the shop, you have to collect specific items of vendor trash that are dropped by enemies and are found in chests. Luckily this is completely optional, since just like in AC2 you get the best armor in the game for free by completing enough freerunning levels.  (Aside, someone needs to find the guy who thought it was a good idea to have sudden switches to a fixed camera in the middle of timed jumping puzzles, and grant him a swift punch in the stomach)  The combat is a lot easier, since the window for counterattacking is a lot bigger and you can chain counterkills. There are also more ranged weapons and if you're lazy you can just press one button and let your assassins murder everyone for you while you sit on a bench nearby watching the fight while eating popcorn.  As for the story, there is a lot less character development for Ezio, but the game does have way more interesting villains, and there is a fantastic subplot concerning a conflict between the assassins themselves about halfway through. Especially Bartholomeo, Machiavelli and La Volpe get some nice character development.    Overall, the pros and cons compared to AC2 pretty much balance eachother out, and it is definately worth buying.",

Without giving too much away you leave Rome only to return where the main game takes place.  In Brotherhood a new mechanic was added that let you perform kill streaks much more easily. This new feature included easier kills and the ability to immediatly take out enemies one after another. This made combat a lot faster however it felt almost too easy. The city is quite large however it is lacking in actual buildings too parkour across once outside the region. Even though the main story was quite short it is made up for in the free dlc and side quests. Hope this review has helped you form an opinion on this game. :D",

            "review_text": "Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is a direct continuation of Assassin’s Creed II, in pretty much every sense. The story picks up exactly where the last one left off (both in the past and the present), and the game mechanics are more or less identical. In some ways, the need for this game to exist seems a bit unnecessary (i.e. it feels more like the result of a corporate mandate to make an annual franchise than a creative decision). That said, it’s forgivable if only for the fact that it’s just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Part of what feels forced is the contrived story revolving around Ezio losing his Apple of Eden and having to retrieve it. But there you go... it is what it is - basically, a flimsy excuse to move to a new setting and do more cool things with a well-loved character.   The game takes place in the early 1500s, almost entirely in Rome. While that may sound like a reduced scope in setting from the prior games, it’s actually not. Rome is huge. Like, really huge. There are also a few other places that you get to explore in some of the main story missions as well, so there is plenty of variety in the environments. As usual, it’s a lot of fun just to explore the city and discover its secrets. Brotherhood also greatly expands the role of horses (you can ride them pretty much anywhere), and there are some fun combat mechanics added as well. The missions in the game are similar to those from AC2, so nothing major has changed on that front. The other primary mechanics introduced in AC2 (notoriety, blending, etc) all return here as well and are also just as good.   The main addition this game brings to the series is the titular Brotherhood. Ezio can now recruit citizens to the Assassin Brotherhood. As you progress through the game, more recruit slots are unlocked. Once recruited, you can call your Assassins to assist in combat or send them on missions in a sort of optional sub-game. Doing either of these things awards XP to the recruits and eventually they level up and become more powerful. Though hardly revelatory by any means, it’s a fun new aspect to the game and is a welcome addition.   While Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood doesn’t really do anything groundbreaking or expand on the established formula in any major way, it is still worth playing if you enjoyed AC2. While it is essentially more of the same, at least it’s a *good* more of the same.   Grade: A-  Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.",

While there is one game in this series that really stands out, this one, again, isn't it.   What you have here is polished, prettier Assassin's Creed II. I'm not really sure how I logged 117 hours on it. I think some of it was me trying to convince myself that there was more to this game than there really is.  In contrast to ACII's sprawling-conspiracy-web story spanned across several cities and decades, here we get a more tension-based story based in one city over about 5 years.  That change is for the better, though the story doesn't improve -- we still get the same absurd plans.   Befriend the courtesans then use them to acquire an outfit to follow a chest of money back to a party to kill 'The Banker' to cut off Cesare's funds to stop his war effort? What? Get a key to the Castello di Sant'Angelo by befriending the thieves so you can steal outfits to a play so you can sneak into the play so you can save an actor Cesare wants dead so the actor can give you the key? Again, what? The plot is nonsense.  Fight Cesare to the death of his neck armor. His neck armor is endless.  Particularly painful, and Assassin's Creed as a series is often guilty of this, are the missions where you are assigned the task of killing the primary antagonists early in the game. It is so obvious that you will not succeed in this task and that it will turn into a 'mission-gone wrong' situation that it's painful.  Clumsily extending 1 memory in 1 sequence into 5 memories to make the game seem longer than it really is -- pretty common for this game.   The soundtrack, while it does use some of AC2's great tracks, develops its own style. This style is sort of a lower, thumping, tension-building sort of music. It works, the game succeeds at developing its own atmosphere apart from AC2.  Visually, the game is still gorgeous. The beautiful color saturation and the way the whites and reds stand out in this 1500s depiction of Rome really add to the atmosphere and feel of the game. Rome is great to look at.   There is plenty of side content, most of it fun. Christina missions fill in some blank spaces about Ezio's past with Christina in AC2. Leonardo's war machines are entertaining but ridiculous -- destroy Leonardo's machine gun, tank, and air-cannon to stop the Borgia from using them. The followers of Romulus missions are similar to the crypt-exploration missions from AC2. There are also many thief, courtesan, and assassin contracts to undertake.  So there is definitely plenty to do. I should warn that most of these things simply have little replay value. The novelty and enjoyment of completing these tasks wears off the first time you do them.  The reason for this is that the game is incredibly easy and there is not much way of making it harder. Assassin's Creed has always lacked difficulty settings. In Brotherhood, especially, they would be appreciated.   The simple addition of chain kills makes the game so ridiculously easy that some form of higher difficulty is really needed to justify playing through this game again. This is even without using your assassin recruits.   However, higher difficulties often involves taking different strategies, new approaches, rethinking how you play the game. Clearly, every task in this game was designed for there to be 1 way to complete it. It's not really all that open in what approach you take.  So, in the end, what we have here is a beautiful expansion pack to Assassin's Creed II that outdoes Assassin's Creed II in nearly every way. One can excuse it's horrible story because, well, every game in this series prior to this one also has a horrible story! What did you expect? Pick it up for $10 or less for a good time.",

I'm not really sure how I logged 117 hours on it. I think some of it was me trying to convince myself that there was more to this game than there really is.  In contrast to ACII's sprawling-conspiracy-web story spanned across several cities and decades, here we get a more tension-based story based in one city over about 5 years.  That change is for the better, though the story doesn't improve -- we still get the same absurd plans.   Befriend the courtesans then use them to acquire an outfit to follow a chest of money back to a party to kill 'The Banker' to cut off Cesare's funds to stop his war effort? What? Get a key to the Castello di Sant'Angelo by befriending the thieves so you can steal outfits to a play so you can sneak into the play so you can save an actor Cesare wants dead so the actor can give you the key? Again, what? The plot is nonsense.  Fight Cesare to the death of his neck armor. His neck armor is endless.  Particularly painful, and Assassin's Creed as a series is often guilty of this, are the missions where you are assigned the task of killing the primary antagonists early in the game. It is so obvious that you will not succeed in this task and that it will turn into a 'mission-gone wrong' situation that it's painful.  Clumsily extending 1 memory in 1 sequence into 5 memories to make the game seem longer than it really is -- pretty common for this game.   The soundtrack, while it does use some of AC2's great tracks, develops its own style. This style is sort of a lower, thumping, tension-building sort of music. It works, the game succeeds at developing its own atmosphere apart from AC2.  Visually, the game is still gorgeous. The beautiful color saturation and the way the whites and reds stand out in this 1500s depiction of Rome really add to the atmosphere and feel of the game. Rome is great to look at.   There is plenty of side content, most of it fun. Christina missions fill in some blank spaces about Ezio's past with Christina in AC2. Leonardo's war machines are entertaining but ridiculous -- destroy Leonardo's machine gun, tank, and air-cannon to stop the Borgia from using them. The followers of Romulus missions are similar to the crypt-exploration missions from AC2. There are also many thief, courtesan, and assassin contracts to undertake.  So there is definitely plenty to do. I should warn that most of these things simply have little replay value. The novelty and enjoyment of completing these tasks wears off the first time you do them.  The reason for this is that the game is incredibly easy and there is not much way of making it harder. Assassin's Creed has always lacked difficulty settings. In Brotherhood, especially, they would be appreciated.   The simple addition of chain kills makes the game so ridiculously easy that some form of higher difficulty is really needed to justify playing through this game again. This is even without using your assassin recruits.   However, higher difficulties often involves taking different strategies, new approaches, rethinking how you play the game. Clearly, every task in this game was designed for there to be 1 way to complete it. It's not really all that open in what approach you take.  So, in the end, what we have here is a beautiful expansion pack to Assassin's Creed II that outdoes Assassin's Creed II in nearly every way. One can excuse it's horrible story because, well, every game in this series prior to this one also has a horrible story! What did you expect? Pick it up for $10 or less for a good time.",

It is such an open world game and the things to do sometimes can see limitless. The game definitely builds off of the success and completely bada**ery that both Assassin's Creed 1&amp;2 had to offer. I played this game so many times on the Xbox 360 that purchasing it for the PC was just a must. The new additions to the game make it just even better than the ones before it and it just keeps building up in a positive way. Especially with the most amazing thing they could have ever added, but I won't spoilt it ;)  If you have the extra time and money, definitely get this game. Especially if you love platforming, action/adventure, with some stealth here and there. It is very much worth it.  I also recommend Assassin's Creed 1&amp;2 as well.  EDIT: I would also recommend to play this game with a gaming controller.",

Also probably gonna ignore multiplayer for this game and all other AC's so forgive me. WARNING:Contains Spoilers  STORY:Again you assume the role of Desmond Miles as he,Lucy,Rebecca,and Shaun head to Ezio's villa to escape Abstergo. You find the room where Ezio had attained Altair's armour and set up shop here but not without doing a little mission. After that you assume Ezio once again going into his final memorie where he fought the main antagonist of the game Cesare Borgia but Desmond is locked out of the memory. Just like AC1 he must go through the earlier memories before he can go back to the final one. This story honestly is one of the best, second to AC2 and better than Revelations it's gone it's own deaths, accomplishes, twists and turns. Again it wasn't as good as AC2's story but at least it was better than Revelation's story. 7.9/10  GRAPHICS: The graphics here are better than AC2, cleaner textures, better frames, ect. It's great for it's age (2010) and still in my opinion hasn't dated yet.9/10  GAMEPLAY:Oh boy here we go where do I even start.......the gameplay was okay? If I just spill it out this game made me ragequit it multiple times, not for the main missions but for the side missions. The tank mission was horrible, one hit and you were done you couldn't get hit once or your full sync would fail. The young at heart sucked too, and those side missions where you only had 6 minutes to complete the mission or no full sync. Also to clarify, full sync is supposed to represent how Ezio did completed his missions and side missions but honestely Ubisoft shouldn't have integrated this yet because there was extreme difficulty issues in some missions. Yeah it would be a breeze for normal fans, but full sync fans would learn that the levels did not suit for full sync, they had to find that out the hard way and it was a pain in the ♥♥♥. Sorry for the rant but the other gameplay elements are at least better than this, with you calling out Assassin's and taking out your enemies like a boss you truly feel like a grandmaster assassin also mentioning finding items to get armor, fast poison ect was stupid on Ubisoft's part too.6.5/10  CONCLUSION: AC:B was honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There was too difficult side missions, finding ridiculus items to get other items, and full sync. But it balances this by putting in a good story, calling assassins and new gear and weapons but I still can't forgive it's frustratingness and hopefully I won't play this game again.

Main problem with this game is repetitiveness, it's just more of the same. Nothing new. Still, the world is beautiful and the fact that you get to focus on a single city and improving said city is very nice.  The characters are paper thin, aside from Ezio, who sadly feels much darker in this installation and Desmond remains pretty unrelatable.   What annoyed me with AC2 and this is still the infurating use of the in-between-english-italian with americans trying to do an italian accent and replacing random words with italian. It's not enjoyable - just annoying. Also with this game, there is a lot of jumping from one scene to the next with no understandable transition in between.

Without the first (and especially 2nd), games under your belt, this story will make no sense, you won't care about the characters, and you probably won't enjoy this at all.   This is a filler sequel.   The gameplay is extremely similar to Assasin's Creed 2. It is hard for me to identify too many new elements. I don't know if any of the weapons were actually new, of if the ammo for them was just more plentiful, but I definitely used the gun, poison darts, and crossbow a lot in this game. I also found myself playing a lot less stealthily, possibly because the crossbow was so much fun to use, and I could loot ammo from any dead body.  The one new element is that towards the midgame, you start an Assassin's Guild, sending assasins out on missions throughout Europe. They reward you with money, and some rare 'shop quests' (i.e - crafting) items. You can also summon them during any battle and they will fight well. It almost feels like cheating compared to previous games, but it is kind of fun to say, 'screw this stealth crap, everyone dies now.'   ",

Me, I stopped there after a while. Here's a few reasons why (it's basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying it's unbearable):  1) You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because 'this memory is not available'. 2) You want to return to a place you've been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? You'll notice that, other than in every other Assassin's Creed before, areas you've been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are 'not available' anymore. 3) I feel like I'm squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of 'available memory', with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I can't continue because 'this area is not available'. Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassin's Creed experience I came to know and love. 4) I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is 'not available'. WTF?!?  At this point I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.  Seriously, it's a great game. Gameplay-wise, it's even better than the original Assassin's Creed 2. But the way it limits the player to a rather small area really kills it for me.

I'm sure this is a GREAT game, just due to the fact that I can't even play it, will make me reer AWAY from UBISOFT in the future.",

If you can be ok with a ton of repitition, other wise avoid or take caution.  Brotherhood is probably one of the more boring games i've played, which is dissapointing considering I thought Assassin's Creed 2 was quite good. All the story missions are the same thing over and over game, kill that thing, go here, don't get caught, and of course FOLLOW MISSIONS, which are one of the worst mission types for any sandbox game ever considering the stealth in this game is shoddy.  In comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 it is staggering how much quality has been lost.  Optimization: Assassin's Creed 2 was nicely optomized for pc, it ran well and I don't recall many issues. For ACB the game is laggy, it looks kinda bleh at times, and the video settings keep going to their defaults every single time you re-enter the game, and I found no way to fix this.   Gameplay: Already covered above; story mission too repetitive, and not really varied. Nothing memorable here.  Setting: Rome is dull. The landscape is bland and honestly uninteresting. We wen't from the streets of Venice to the open grass lands of...Well Rome. I don't know if it might suit someone else's tastes, but I find it uninteresting.  This is honestly a pretty weak game in my opinion, not bad persay, but following Assassin's Creed 2 it just doesn't hold up as well, considering its more of the same plus it being incredibly boring and repetative at times. I wouldn't really recommend it that much, not even if you are trying to follow the story because the two timeline plots have simple start and end points, no real inner 'meat' to add anything signifigant or worth noting or caring about.

Game very tightly continues after ACII story, so i think there is really need to know ACII before playing this (and before playing AC:Revelations too).  Pros:  - again and again you can feel absolute freedom of movement, you can go and climb really almost everywhere - beautifuly modeled Rome, Vatican and its surroundings - beautiful and believable atmosphere of living city and living story, everything fits very fine - on PC version there is just one click activation (no pay, only activate it) of nice DLC 'Leonardo disappearance', wchich adds pretty few hours filled with anothet part of main story - very good audio enviroment modeling/engine - parachutes from Leonardo (but it has its dark side, see cons also) - almost no bugs or glitches.  Neutral (aka 'not sure' ;)):  - same combat system as in previous AC, maybe with slight differences which i (sorry) didn't noticed.  - possibility to ride horse anytime and anywhere ... which comes boring after while. Or, for long distances traveling - if one doesn't want to use sewers system the horse is only choice. But not in tight streeets of Rome, you can get really hard times with your horse stucked somewhere on the corner etc ;)).  - there is no more killing from back of your horse with your sword possibility. You just can't draw your sword while being on horse. Which looks strage, but to be honest - it gave too much overpower to Ezio. Ezio was almost immortal with sword being on horse back. It was fun for a while, but with that were some parts of game too much easy. Specially liberating Borgia towers was like 'one finger in my nose, second hand on my mouse', i just took a horse, draw my sword and even hardes Borgia towers were cleaned of Borgia soldier within minute with no need to use of medicine.  Cons:  - as i play third AC in row (started with ACII, then AC:B, now i play AC:Reveletaions) i start thinking there should be difficulty setting, i fell very often like as guards are totally blinded or def  - parachutes from Leonardo! Worst thing ever, for what is it if you can't use it as primary tool for escaping some fight/battle which gone wrong? I was unable to use parachute almost everytime i was 'known, seeked and chased'. In time of peace i had no problem to deploy parachute.  Conclusion:  Who loved AC and loved ACII will enjoy AC:B. And i have no problem with strictly continuity of Ezio story (so one needs to know ACII before playing AC:B and needs to know AC:B before playing AR:Revelations).",

Being able to use a parachute glide anywhere is quite a nice feature, but I didn't find it useful very often. The best bit is being able to recruit and call-in your own assassins to take out whoever you like.  Unfortunately, it's all let down by the implementation and design being inexcusably sloppy in places. I found quite a number of bugs which made me lose progress (although in most cases the check-points are quite frequent so I didn't lose much time overall). I also had almost constant controller problems. I'm not sure if this is specific to using the Xbox 360 controller, but it was very hard to make Ezio actually go where I wanted during climbing/free-running. He frequently leapt in the wrong direction.  The worst part though is the mission design. A ridiculous number of them assumed you'd do things in a specific way which wasn't obvious at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why mission events didn't trigger and so on. In addition, the tasks were often very repetitive and dull. Way too many 'follow this person' objectives.  Having completed the story now, I wish I hadn't bothered with this game. The plot is quite weak and un-engaging. Playing through it became a frustrating chore, and I certainly won't bother trying to get 100% sync. It's a pity because (as I mentioned above) there are some fun bits. I would recommend steering clear though unless you're madly in love with Ezio.",

WTF).   The story did not grab me as much as part 2. Leo Da Vinci added a nice touch in AC2 that was sorely missing in Brotherhood. Many story and optional missions were quite grindy and drawn out. I'm not a fan of the lengthy escorts or tailing missions of which there seemed to be too many. There was also too much trial &amp; error, in part due to the absence of mission critical info, which led to IMHO unnecessary repetition due to the console checkpoint save system.  I liked the 15th/16th century depiction of Rome though. The atmosphere and ambience was great. The story, while not stellar, was still motivating enough to make me keep playing and finishing the game.

Great additions/improvements for this game; let's start with:   - The combat system was improved, giving you the opportunity to see Ezio's fighting abilities giving an improved and rewarding experience, in other words was improved 4 or 5 times compared to the previous games in the series.  - Fast traveling is included as well, of course it's a big city, it will be really annoying to be running and running to travel from point A to point B and even though you can do it, you've the option to save minutes or even hours of travel. - Lots and lots of content which will keep you busy; the main and side quest have an optional way to complete them in order to have full synchronization (if you want to complete the game 100%). - and such much more (don't really want to spoil it for you)...  Unlike the previous games, this game have a multiplayer mode; a really fun and interesting one (when you find people to play it, because sometimes you can be waiting around 10 or 15 mins for people to join). I had fun hours playing multiplayer; which have several modes were in most of them is not how many people you kill, but the way you get the kills, the more sneaker is the way you do it, the more points you get.  In the end, I had a blast playing both single and multiplayer modes!! This is a good installment and recommended by me if you like the Assassin's Creed series!...",

            "review_text": "Coming in off AC:II, which is undeniably one of the high points in the Assassin's Creed series, the bar is set high for Brotherhood. Set in Rome several years after the events in AC:II, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city (and then the entirety of Italy).  Personally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a '100% Sync%' on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the (sometimes ridiculous) extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and it's impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.  Rome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassin's Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100% sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.  Combat hasn't really evolved from the second game, you'll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassin's, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassin's and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezio's name.  Brotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like they've tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassin's Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just don't expect it to light up your life.  (Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.)",

The gameplay is smooth and their is plenty to do on the side to get more florins for your coin purse. The story is incredibly well done and has been done so that even in short play sessions you can make enough progress to leave you wanting more . Overall, assasins creed brotherhood is a perfect 10/10 and remember nothing is true , everything is permitted!",

That was all. The game runs like a charm. Despite Ubisoft being, well, Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed is a great series and I'm glad I can finally resume playing through it. Brotherhood has all the great things about AC2 and takes a little further.  Good times.",

I really enjoyed the upgrades they made for this game which made the gameplay more enjoyable, which includes the recruitment of assassin's to help you fight along the rest of the game, very useful. This game also has a great setting of Rome which you can explore. However, one of the things which I hate about this game are they included the 100% sync requirements in every mission. It's satisfying once you have completed it but some of missions are impossibly hard. The worse thing is that you can't revert to the last checkpoint if you failed the 100% sync. Apart from the cons, this game is still a must play for any AC fans out there, I give it a 8/10 overall.",
