            "review_text": "It's just a point n' click game where you have to click on the dark creatures and light up the room to get rid of your nightmares.  It's not a bad game, but sometimes the hitboxes can be screwy and cost you to lose. Each round lasts around 1-3 minutes. Each level has 4 rounds. If you lose on round 4 of a level, you start back at round 1 of that level. This is extremely tedious, especially when you reach the tentacles in level 3 because their hitboxes are very hit or miss.  If it wasn't for the bad hitboxes at times, I would probably recommend this game.",
