            "review_text": "This is a lovely little game for what it is. It's a little more than a movie, a little less than a game: you guide your a growing flock of birds. That said, I DID feel a soaring sense of exhilaration at some point, and panic for my flock at other points. The soundtrack is beautiful. If you enjoyed the film 'Winged Migration', you would enjoy the game, 'Gathering Sky' captures the magic of birdflight, or watching birds fly. Don't expect an adrenaline rush as if you were playing 'Call of Duty': this is the opposite, the perfect game for passing time when you just want to be able to relax.  ",
