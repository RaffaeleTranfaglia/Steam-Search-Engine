            "review_text": "Actually quite good. I have played quite a few VN's and they all follow a similar pattern. This one does something different with your personal strength stat and randomization with key plot points. Which means you can play it the same way twice and end up with different endings.  The Characters are better than your stereotypical 'ignorant of others feelings' protagonist and the decisions you need to make are pretty tough.   The only bad I noticed was that mid/late game there were hardly any events happening and it felt like one of those repetitive dating sims. It could be that I had just unlocked a lot of events early in the game through sheer luck and ran out of them but it's worth mentioning.  It can be short... but so are the other VN's available on Steam. Replayability is high and that should make up for it a little.",

It's amazingly written, the music is fantastic and I couldn't imagine many ways in which it could be better.  10/10 would buy a sequal... And a sequal to that sequal.  For anyone interested my first 3 endings were: The sunrise and sunset of happiness, Dazzling heart and Best friends forever. Good luck to anyone who plans to give it a play :3",

            "review_text": "After 100%-ing the game in a few hours, I can come to a varied set of conclusions about this piece. If you are completely new to these types of games, keep reading. If you aren't, scroll down a bit. (There's also a TL;DR for both types.)  First and foremost- if you think this is an eroge, it is not. It doesn't even have fanservice. Those of you are opposed to such AO content may now be able to give it a chance.  Secondly, if you've never played any visual novel before, and are on the fence about ever trying, this game may put you off. It complicates the traditional choice-making system by adding a light grind-based RPG combat system (whose difficulty just goes out the window once you command magic,) and a bar-filling 'work' system wherein the character spends time coding for disposable income. Thus, if you want to not have to play rpg-lite on every playthrough, you may want to find other VNs.  That being said, this game's entire style leans towards what VNs can be found coming out of Japan. If you've played Magical Diary, Long Live the Queen, and Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, know that the whole feel of the game will be different, even if the genre is largely the same. If you like the style, then you'll like VNs in general.  So, for those of you who have never played VNs before, know that I recommend it, but be aware of the needless bar-filling.  --- If you are new to these kinds of games, you can stop reading now. The rest is for people who have played a number of VNs before. Or be my guest and keep reading; I'm not your parent.  -Presentation: The art is good. It's clean and works well for its purpose. The characters are nicely done and the backgrounds are fine. Be aware there are only a handful of CGs, and no options to view them again from the main menu, as is traditional. The music is fine, if a bit repetitive, but provides the atmosphere needed to read in peace. Again, there isn't a jukebox to access from the main menu, but none of the music I remember liking so much to listen to it again. 7/10.  -Story: Listen, I'll be honest with you- this game skirted around a really awesome idea that it never brought to the forefront. To be fair, you may not even understand what I'm talking about until your second or third run through, but when you do, you'll also go 'aww, man.' Putting that aside, there are about five or six actual endings, not including the ones where you just 'flip the switch' at the end and get different flavortext. There are two heroines (don't bother going for anyone else, even though they do have a subplot) and, interestingly enough, there are ~35 manga books you can read that give a backstory of a world with magic and the adventures of people within them. There is a single good twist that isn't give to you unless you understand it first - one of the gems in this piece for sure. Unfortunately, in one of the routes there is an antagonist that is never seen, and on top of that, the choices you make to complete it and save her can be largely paralled to just ignoring the bad guy entirely. In short, it's no KEY visual novel, but It does okay. 7/10 for one route, and 5/10 for the other. 6.5/10 for the backstory.  -Choice: There are only two heroines, so that limits your choices right there. Like most VNs this game has branching plot choices but after finishing the game for good I can tell you that they don't have as much of an effect on earning better endings. You'll actually find that leveling up in general is worthless past lv 4 because once you get magic you wreck faces sideways. In fact, combat is largely unnecessary; it is barely needed in one route and completely not in another. You'll also find moneymaking to be mostly unnecessary- at no point in the game are you forced to spend money, but you do need it to buy manga that gives you magic spells (which you should get). If you're on the way to a bad ending in the 'no magic' route you'll get plenty of warning. In fact, getting a bad ending actually takes some serious neglect, not necessarily bad choices.  -In short, if you have a lot of experience with VNs and have a picture of Jun Maeda on your wall, you may want to pass this over. -----  TL;DR - Try the game if you're on the fence and have little or no experience with visual novels. Avoid it if this isn't your first time around the block.",

I feel like this game can be played trough rather differently for few ways, so it bares another playtrough. The problem with the game for me is that there are many things that could have been explained way better, but you kind of have to feel around what everything does. Playtrough for me took five hours, but i'm not sure how long the different paths will take.  I suggest this game for VN fans.",

            "review_text": "First of all I recommend this game only anime or J-RPG lovers. It is really short (~4 hours of gameplay). This is a game that you're not killing enemies or chasing after bad guys. There is a story and you just make decisions. This type of games are so popular in Japan but, actually that one is not a good example of its kind.  In game you are a guy (Ryou) that lives a normal life, go school, hang out with friends, and make decisions about your life. Your decisions directly manuplate the story which you will see.   Art of game is, um.. terrible. Most of the game you always see same places and same guys. There is nothing that makes you feel surprised in the story. Music is OK I think. Most of music made by piano, not that good but average. Animations and sound effects are not good.  If you got $14,99 to spend nothing important, feel free to buy this game. Yeah, I vote as 'positive' because there is no game like this.  I don't think I will play again and again. If it was a mobile game and $0,99 or $1,99 it would be more successful.   6,2/10",

The writing is, to be charitable, exceptionally poor, and you will see rather a lot of it even before anything interactive happens - near on to 20 minutes of it, in fact, even if you're hammering the space bar to advance through it at a quick trot.   When the choices are reached, they are inscrutable and meaningless, and every button makes the sound of a mouse being murdered. The plot veers wildly into often contradictory genre spaces, most ripped from stories you've seen told better elsewhere, in a way that feels like plagiarism more than homage.   The visual novel is a wide and wonderful genre and there is no good reason for you to descend far enough through it to reach Fading Hearts. Spend your money elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "The pitch behind this game really cheapens the experience. I picked it up expecting a weirdo multigenre choose your own adventure story, but was instead treated to an unimaginative, honest-but-half-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ attempt at, uh, something. My biggest complaint about the game is the writing. It's very, very bad. So bad, in fact, that I thought the game was a weird meta joke for an hour or so because the primary mechanic behind the 'combat' in the game involves learning magic powers from manga.  Also, you're a high school student whose parents have died, but luckily you're a genius programmer who has to make tough, decisions between coding for an indy game that doesn't pay very well or collapsing the world economy by not helping an IT worker. It's really bananas and I'd definitely click the reccomend button if this costed a dollar and didn't describe itself as a game that adapts itself to your decisions.  Here's a non-spoilery description of what your decisions affect: One of two of the anime high school girls will kiss you. One of the anime girls has an abusive boyfriend and you spend the first half of the game trying to figure out a way to get her to love you instead. The other girl is in love with you but to understand why she can't love you now you have to go fight monsters in the forest.  This game is terrible in a cool way, because it's sort of a sublime interpretation of what it is. It's aggressively dumb, but in a way that you can almost see every hilarious piece of the author's inadvertent self-awareness puzzle.  Buy this game if you want to laugh or to break up an anime girl from her abusive boyfriend by making decisions like talking to her about it or passive aggressively not talking to her about it while getting dating tips from your asexual otaku love-sensei.",

Visual art looks really nice, and the first time I played it, I thought it was a good game. The audio was a plus, even if it could get a bit repetitive. However, the story isn't very interesting, nor engaging. I wasn't very enthusiastic on having to go through the story another time to pick a different ending. I know there is a fast forward feature, but it still feels troublesome. I may sound like a typical 'I-want-this-now' kind of person, and maybe I am, but I'm sure I could have felt more compelled to redo this game if I deemed it a more complex or varied game.  This game gave me a good couple hours of playtime, but I got bored of it a bit too quickly. Sometimes, I felt that some characters were a bit bland or cliche; they had their own personality, but not as interesting as I hoped. Unfortunately, this game isn't very 'eyecatching' in many ways besides the art. I'm lucky that I got it on sale, because it is a bit pricey for what I got. On the positive note, it wasn't 'bad' for my first story-type game. Also, I liked how they sometimes poked fun at ideas from an 'average' romance story. Still, if I had a choice now, I probably would have picked something else with my money.",
