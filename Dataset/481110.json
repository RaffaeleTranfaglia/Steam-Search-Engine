            "review_text": "This is a well crafted FMV interactive movie. It is a game in the sense that you must, at times, click the prompts. But that is not the essence of this little gem. The well balanced story telling is where this game shines best. Yes, at $20, one could argue that it's overpriced for a movie, however that is what one would spend on a Blueray or digital download of a new release title. I personally have no problem spending such money to support a studio that is creating a unique experience. Others may feel differently and that is just fine. If you want to wait for a price drop, good on you. But the price should not reflect the review.  The Bunker is a story about love and what it can make a person do. It is a story about survival in the worst possible conditions. It is a story about the ghosts that haunt the choices we make. As the protagonist you must push forward through difficult odds and in so doing expose the story of The Bunker. It is a well thought story that reveals itself to you as you move to your ultimate goal.   As far as FMV games go, this is one of the best acted I have ever seen. The lead actor, Adam Brown, was given a difficult role in a difficult medium, and at times can seem over dramatic or forced, but that is a limit of the 'game' format more than a reflection of his acting. The cut away scenes are well directed and believable. I would have liked a bit more written background in these scenes as it would have made the story richer, but it's likely the creators had to balance the flow of the game with the story itself. In the end all is revealed and it is a satisfying and some would say disturbing tale.   People who enjoy FMV and games such as 'Her Story' as well as a story with a twist will enjoy The Bunker. It is not ham-fisted or corny like 'Contradiction' which I also loved, but it has it's place as a serious FMV story game. I completed it in under two hours, so it can be done in a single playthrough. There are acheivements, it is not possible to complete them all on a single playthrough. I did not get all the acheivements because I did not feel that was a purpose behind the product, but more of a steam addon.  I would recommend this game to others, and if the price is too steep go ahead and wishlist this and wait for the holiday sale. Enjoy.  EDIT: Nominated for 'I thought this game was cool before it won and award'. Because I think it really deserves one.",

            "review_text": " The Bunker  is a tense, thrilling and, in places, scary (albeit largely in a jump-scare sort of way) FMV story set in a bunker in post-nuclear-apocalypse Britain. I was interested to pick it up as soon as I saw it played on Jim Sterling's YouTube, as I love post-nuclear scenarios, and the 1980s UK setting was particularly appealing to me as a 30-something Brit who grew up with the threat of The Bomb still hanging over the world.  It's important to understand that it's short - around 2 hours - and basically an interactive movie. Interaction is largely limited to clicking on the next step in a linear path, with the occasional QTE. There's only one puzzle in the game, which you'll probably solve quickly and which will be irritating if you don't. There's very little optional content, just a few flavour items in each area that you can choose to read/listen to or not. I'd recommend you do, as they help flesh out the background.   That said, the interaction does generally help to involve the player in the story, although there are times when it can also hinder. If you fail a QTE - as I did once to see what would happen and a second time accidentally - it simply repeats the last few minutes of (unskippable) video. There's no branching story, no way to change the linear path the character is on. If you do the wrong step, the character will tell you so: 'no, I need to do X first' and the like.  As a FMV game it lives and dies on the script and the acting, and these are pretty good. Both are realistic and believable. The protagonist does veer slightly towards chewing the scenery at times, but much can be forgiven for a character who has spent their entire lives in a bunker surrounded by the constant threat of death. The FMV itself is of good HD quality, and well shot and directed.  The plot becomes a little predictable as you near the end, and would seem extremely shallow and inconsequential if it had to survive alone as a TV episode or a movie. It's really just about what happened and how, with no depth of character to anyone. But it's unusual in a game setting, and padded out by the interactions and with tension raised by an excellent score and suitably atmospheric sound effects, there's just enough to work in this setting.  Things fall down a little right at the end, where the final scenes feel the need to force home what happened, when any player is likely to have worked out most if not all of the details already. After this there is a choice for the character's final ending, which is notable as the only real choice you ever have in the game. I appreciated the fact that it gave the player one chance to decide what the character might do - or to decide for him what they think he  should  do. Beyond that though the choice has little meaning, as the two alternate endings are each only about 20 seconds long and show little. You do get the chance to go back and do the other ending without repeating the whole game, though you will have to replay the final five minutes.  After you complete the story you shouldn't expect much, if any replay value. There are some collectibles in the game, and I failed to get them all, but feel no interest whatsoever in finding the rest given they appear to add nothing further to the story or even to the background flavour. The only scenario in which I can see there being replayability is if you avoid all optional flavour items the first time around and then go back in later to access those.   I played on Mac and had one worrying glitch within minutes of opening the game, where it crashed on one of the first interactions. But after reloading it was fine the rest of the time. As the game is basically just a fancy video player, technical problems should not be expected on even low-end systems. Given this, there are a few more loading screens than I would have expected, though none lasted more than 15 seconds (playing the game on SSD.) Perhaps there are/will be console ports which necessitated this. It would have been nice if they hadn't have been there, but I didn't feel that they impacted the mood.  Overall I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who thinks that they will both enjoy the setting and themes and who is OK with spending the money for a two-hour experience. A little more ambition and depth would have been nice, but if you know what you're getting it's worth your time.  I definitely hope this developer and others continue to make new new FMV games because I think The Bunker - and Her Story before it - proves they can work if done carefully. The stench that the 90s smeared on the concept is long behind us :)",

I loved the idea, the story, and the work that was put into this. I got super excited when I saw the first few minutes of gameplay and rushed out to buy it.  That said, I don't think I could honestly recommend to any of my friends paying $20 for it.   It quickly devolves from a mystery-style game where you're looking through old logs and exploring this bunker into scenes where there's only one, maybe two, things to click on. At that moment, it stops becoming a game and is just a movie where I need to click my mouse on the dot that appears on the screen every so often to advance the plot.",

This brings FMV that has died out and also the acting is extremly good , storyline is very strong ( No spoilers sry) .   Why negative ?  Controls control controls . Button mashing is as very poor game mechanic to the etent that this uses it , i compare it to the track and feild on the C64 inb the 80s where you have to flick the joystick as fast as you could leading to many broken joystics . needless to say i am not killing one of my controllers for this game  It is a pity since like i said in the first paragraph it did have some stregths in it , off to play the ps4 viersion to see wether they have changed the settings",

Lead character is one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've ever had the unfortunate experience to encounter. Don't buy this game for $20. Buy this for $10 or less.  I streamed this for what was meant to be a minimum 3 hour stream and the game lasted 2 and a half hours with minimal checkpoints to return to if we wanted to find another ending. This game doesn't want you to play it. It wants you to shut up and listen to the nonsensical short-film it has created.  If you want to cram your creativity down my throat, at least be a dear and release a 20 minute long YouTube video instead of charge people $20 to get dragged through your weeping exposition and flat out dreadful sound design.",
