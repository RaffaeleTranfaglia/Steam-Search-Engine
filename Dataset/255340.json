            "review_text": "I played the first Escape Goat tons of times and this pretty much blows the first one out of the water. It adds a lot of new features while keeping some old ones, despite the new features being there for a few short levels. However there is a lot more to do in order to go through a lot of levels so there's more things to do rather than going through ten worlds and four extra worlds. There's a strange diffculty curve in some levels where you might spend ten minutes on one level figuring out what to do, then the next might take you two minutes. Either way the puzzles are interesting enough that you might even take some of them on in different ways, rather than going through what the game intends you to. The graphics are way better than the first, moving from pixel graphics to fancy drawn graphics and neat little idle animations. Soundtrack is also really amazing. If you liked the frist Escape Goat, you'll really love this sequel. If you haven't played the first, then I'd really recommend just moving onto this one, since there's nothing much to miss on the story.",

            "review_text": "Decent sequel to Escape Goat 2, featuring more detailed graphics, new soundtrack (though I liked soundtrack of the original game more), some new mechanics (include a new type of enemy that's basically is living and moving level tiles), longer campaign (took me around 4 hours to beat without extras) and Steam workshop support.  In general it's a puzzle platformer where you solve one-screen puzzles, usually requiring some quick thinking (or replaying the level until you figure it out) and acrobatics, pulling levels, pushing blocks and dodging hazards (usual falling blocks, bottomless pits, projectiles). Magic mouse companion is back, it's basically a projectile that travels along most surfaces, allowing you to reach unreachable buttons and on some levels you can swap places with it (which doubles as a weapon, since it kills some enemies and destroys some blocks while you travel towards the mouse).  Core mechanics isn't too complex but the game manages to build a decent amount of puzzles using it, although, unlike the previous game, a couple of puzzles are really obtuse for some reason.  You preferably should just play the original game first to build your impression, it's on Steam too and is much cheaper.",

Using that power, the sequel also has way more elaborate/difficult puzzles. If that is still not enough, there are hidden levels which you can continue hunting after beating the 'normal' game. I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I say this is the best of the genre I ever played. 10/10",

A lot of different gameplay mecanics (the mouse that follow you have different powers), so each level feel fresh and exciting. Tight and simple control, compatible with the Xbox 360 (and Xbox One) controller.  I love this game, I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the puzzle-platformer genre.",

The game is differently crafted but you definitely will find in here what was in the original goat escape, though I would have liked an option to play with the graphics of the first because I really loved them.   This one has cool goat animations though, seeing him stand with his legs closed... really nice finish!   This platformer is just as magical in its puzzle design as the first. I also highly recommend it.  you can defintely play this one without having played the first, but I recommend playing the first first, because it is a magical experience.  yes, the goat is magic too.   games with goats are awesome, that's what I came to think recently, but I only saw those two and undertale.",

There are also some achievements that will require you to rethink how you approach a few rooms.  Spent a little over 11 hours on it and it never felt like it overstayed its welcome.   All in all, highly recommended.",
