The damn globe's stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ inertia of course, you need to time where you should counter your move to stop the ♥♥♥♥♥ globe from banging anything.  Price is reasonable...  Anyway the pros and cons  Pros: +Leaderboards, get fast enough, and your name gets to pop on world record, and ppl get to see how u wasted ur time breaking it +Decent graphic  Cons: -Well, Cant thought of anything for now.
