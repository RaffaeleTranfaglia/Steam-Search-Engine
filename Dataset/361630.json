It's a 1st person / 3rd person parkour game with platforming elements that's fun, fast, lovely to look at &amp; listen to, and completely free to play. It's also very smart, adding the theme of net neutrality into the gameplay and storyline, as well as some fantastic visual effects, such as the pixelation when the player is hit by a lag spike or falls off the track.  Good job!",

            "review_text": "Very nice game, one that you could easily charge a few bucks for.   However, it needs some performance tweaks. I was able to run it smoothly for the most part, but there was one or two areas where it lagged for a good few seconds when a lot of inhibitors dropped. I have a pretty powerful PC, so I don't think this should not happen at all, even once for a game this simple. I have a few friends with more casual PCs that can't even play it at all. So fair warning,   you're not going to have a fun time if you have a cheaper PC.    You could make net neutrality a bit more of a thing in the game as well; Other than the start screen, there isn't much connection to be made.  But, loads of fun and it's FREE. So, can't complain too much! I very much enjoy playing this game so far.",

            "review_text": "I would deem 404Sight of those artsy, games - low in content, the most important part being the ideological message. 404Sight was made in support of net neutrality: the concept that all bandwidth should be equal, that no service would have more, faster bandwidth than others for reasons of e.g. money or the whim of the ISP.  It looks nice and futuristic: you're a person, depicting a data packet, in an information highway, observed from 3rd perspective. You can see the highway in two different perspectives: without ping, where everything is equal, and with ping. With ping you see and can take use of the highspeed roads and jumping shortcuts but are also vulnerable to slow lanes and ISP blocks. All of these directly affect your speed.  Levels are pretty linear, with one or couple different ways towards the exit. There are straight ways, fast turns and 3D platforming sequences as well as quick labyrinths of slow and fast lanes that become meaningless in no-ping mode. 3D platforming sequences are annoying: it's easy to jump too short or even long distances and have to restart some way behind. In some levels, you might even fall to the beginning of the level and have to do it all again if you accidentally encountered a check-point down there.  However, levels are pretty short, lasting just a few minutes at a time. The change between levels is smooth: you merely continue running after the level switch. You can also choose to start from any level, skipping any annoying levels if you want to. Nice but fairly generic feeling electronic music keeps you going.  Game keeps track of your par time for each level, so you can beat your previous times. This has no other consequence and thus feels unfinished: e.g. there are no speed running achievements whatsoever despite the game looks like it would thrive on those. The achievements that are there can all be gained in a bit over an hour.  Without additional, more challenging levels to keep you occupied, 404Sight is a fine, and also free, distraction for one afternoon. However, it's unlikely I'll ever return to it.",

It's hard to ignore the Mirror's Edge influences, and it's done well. Graphics are clear, sound is great, with some sweet synth going on in there. Also neat is the 1st/3rd person view, although I only played in 3rd person.  It's a free game, but I recommend it over so many other more costly games. Would have gladly played a few $ for this experience.  The only gripe is that it's over already! But I love it, hope we see more. Play it now before the devs change their mind about it being free ;-)",

Out of the few probems I have with this game, here are the ones that I think are most important. Frame Drops- I have a PC I custom built for gaming, so it being a computer issue is out of the question. I usually had this happen to me during instances where slow zones appeared in great quanities. Player Guidance- There were quite a few times that I had trouble figuring out where to proceed to. In a game that seems based around parkour, I shouldn't have to think about where to go next. Jump animations- On some of the jump pads they trigger a special animation when activated. I noticed that when these jumps happened, I had a large drop in frames. When viewed in thrid person, they look fine but since I play in first person this was an issue.  Other than that, it's great. A few recommendations I have for any future updates would be things such as boundaries so that the player dosen't fall off the edge as easily, and sound effect improvements. I also enjoyed how the developers built net neutrality into the story line, smart idea. I would absoluteley reccommend this game to anybody that liked games such as Mirros Edge and probably a few other titles I can't think of. Wonderful game, all for free as well.",

There are launchpads in the game, these will not always launch you and if they launch you, you might be launched too far or not far enough. I had to redo some parts over and over to finally hit them.  The graphics are... Weird but nice. There seem to be a lot of issues with them though. I can hardly play because of the lag sometimes. Sometimes you're travaling quite fast and all sorts of things come down from the sky and particles shooting around. For an average laptop like mine it doesn't work. I do have all the required specs except for the video card, which is an AMD HD 4650. Furthermore and i7 core, Windows 7, 8gb ram. Even with all of the settings at low there is lag. Due to these graphic issues or something entirely else the mouse seems bugged aswell. Turning the screen goes slowly (even with max sensitivity) or too fast.  I'd say: try play the game, it's nice and free! But be wary of bugs and performance issues",

(+) - Too bad my processor can't handle the graphics even though I have 8 Gigs of RAM (-) - This would be much better with a gamepad instead of a keyboard, something like a Sonic game - I could 'complete the game' by starting at level 14, and 'end the game' after that. (-) - Instructions/objective/motive weren't the most clear at first, but I got it eventually - Map would sometimes load partially, the finish line would be blocked off by a wall I could not pass through (-) - 'purple jump pads' threw me off the map or missed the next jump pad (-) - I got nothing for destroying the Inhibitors aside from an achievement. (-) - A 'Compare scores to friends' would be a good use of this stopwatch counting seconds instead of minutes  Being a month old game, I expect more updates arrive to fix some issues, or I get a computer from the University of Utah.  tl;dr: Kinda like Mirror's edge, get a better computer to play, maps are interesting, definitetly room for improvement to make a great game.",

I'm inclined to thinkthis was some sort of student project that the working group in class couldnt agree on a topic so they just picked whatever was affecting gaming politically at the time, and did a 48 hour game jam of it.  Story? What story? the entire narrative is placed at the very start in a boring, skippable bunch of windows with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chat interface and the scene in the second advert video. nothing more. there is nothing noticeable about net neutrality in the game, like it seems to advertise.  The Audio in the game isn't bad. the soundtrack is fast and dance like, which fits the game's intended gameplay  The gameplay itself, however, is nothing to write home about. Essentially its a corridor runner (read:  NOTHING TO DO WITH PARKOUR AT ALL, WHATSOEVER ) with spped up, slow down and jump tiles. the roll mechanic is literally pointless, and the speedboost is redundant 90% of the time, theres no actual parkour, only jumping and running. literally the entire game is jumping and running.  Don't waste your time. this was a student project or something and if so, it functions as a game and is a proof of concept for the students, but you are honestly much better off playing something else, like mirrors edge, if you want to play a parkour game.

The gameplay is agonisingly clunky and clearly has not been playtested correctly, and if it has, then none of the glaringly obvious problems were addressed from those sessions.  The optimisation is beyond bad, with the frame rate dropping below 15FPS when many effects are on the screen.  Large parts of the interface and design are clearly stock UDK components (the Area Complete 3D text being a glaringly obvious example).  The interface otherwise is mediocre at best.  Many elements of the game are not explained (bandwidth is your health, not your speed, boosting takes up bandwidth).  The game's story desperately needs fleshing out, as currently it feels more slapped on than Rihanna.  The soundtrack starts strong but quickly gets repetitive, which really disappointed me. I really expected to enjoy the OST throughout but I was actually grinding my teeth by the end, fed up of hearing the same song rehashed a million times.  Mechanically, this game is a mess. The ping-toggling system is not even useless, it actually hinders the game in my opinion. You should NEVER reward the player for doing something that isn't fun, and turning off pinging, and your access to boosters through that, is agonisingly un-fun.  Nobody wants to gently walk around traps; they want to blast through them or avoid them at blazing speed. Pity that 80% of the traps REQUIRE either ping toggling or boosting (which drains your life, penalising the player for doing something fun is poor design). The other 20% of traps, which can simply be avoided, are painfully easy to avoid.  The game could have been incredible, with only a little more polish.

            "review_text": "While 404Sight's pretty fun to play, there are a few gripes I have with it, two of which are massive for a platformer.  For one, the controls can't be rebound properly, at least not in game. I play using ESDF, and I usually have jump on right click, but because of the way the controls are, I have to use WASD, and space to jump. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you have all of your muscle memory built on a very specific control setup, changing it is very difficult.  On top of that, the game seems to run pretty poorly for how it looks. It's not ugly, but with my PC (i5 4590, R9 280, 8GB RAM) I should be getting more than 45-55 FPS. I may have to fiddle with the settings, but even with a lot of them turned down I'm having issues.  A lot is this is probably because the settings are pretty poorly labeled (For example, Resolution has an 'Ultra' setting. What is 'Ultra'? It could be standard 1080p, it could be 3840x2160, no way of telling) Normally 45-55 FPS wouldn't be an issue, but in a platformer where you need precise controls it's very annoying, especially when I tend to have drops to 35-40 when there are a lot of obstacles and particle effects.  But, don't let that stop you. The game's pretty fun despite the issues, and I could very easily see it becoming one of my favorite games with a bit of updating and fixing. It's somewhere between Mirror's Edge and Super Meat Boy in an odd sort of way. Good platforming, with difficult obstacles. Admittedly the obstacles are pretty easy to avoid if you have your speed up high enough, but you have to be able to maintain that and know when to use it, which keeps it challenging.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr Short, glitchy (see glitches below), linear game but with a unique charm, fun gameplay and great music.  404Sight is a free and quirky little game from the people at retro Yeti Games.  You play as Alice (I think) and your job is to deliver a data package to a server (I think). The story is simple, told to you the moment you open the game and nothing else is said of it until the very end of the game. The game has a focus on gameplay.  Speaking of, 404Sight is a Third Person Platformer in the same vein as Mirrors Edge. It's alot less detailed, alot shorter, alot easier but hey you get what you pay for. There are a few wgameplay elements to stop the game from being tedious. You have a Bandwidth Bar (which is like a health) bar that fills up as you go over 'Fast Lanes' (green lanes that when you run over them, they speed you up). The bar is depeleted by entering 'Slow Lanes'. They are less like lanes and more like red patches on the ground you shouldn't run over.  Another feature are the inhibitors, which are basically drills that come from the sky and land in front of you producing an area of slow lane that, if you run over, your health disappeares entirely. The last are bouncy pads that when you run on they, they bounce you in a certain direction. You do not choose the direction.  The last unique feature is the 'Ping'. Left Clicking activates Ping which allows you to actually see the fast/slow lanes, bounce pads etc. You have to turn it on and off at specified times but generally you have it on at all times and just turn it off when coming up to any red areas, then turning it back on.  The game is VERY linear. Sure, there are numerous paths but everything leads to the same destination. You have a time counter but it really doesn't seem to matter how fast you go as no achievement is tied directly to this.  Speaking of achievements, they are VERY easy. You can not only beat the game, but also earn every achievement within 1 hour. Seeing how the game is free, there's no opportunity to pass this up. Free, easy achievements. There's really no better.  However, there are ALOT of glitches in this game. Infact, most of the time the glitches popped up in the first level. Here they are, in the order they happened: 1. After dying in the first level, upon repsawn the characters feet were stuck in the ground. I couldn't move. This happened numerous times throughout the game and the only fix is to quit the game entirely and retsrat. 2. Upon getting to the exit, after running through a small tunnel I fell dowwn. As this was the first time I reached the end I thought it was what I had to do but it just turns out I fell through the world. When I respawned, problem 1 happened. 3. Upon getting to the exit a second time, it was completely blocked by a wall. Had to exit the game and try again. 4. Sometimes Ping does not reveal any of the lanes. 5. Moving the mouse sometimes does not change the camera direction.  Overall the game is short and sweet with easy achievements but can prove to be very annoying if you have a short fuse.",
