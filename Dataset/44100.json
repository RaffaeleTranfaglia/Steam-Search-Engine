            "review_text": "What a crock this is.  Every vehicle handles pretty much the same as the others, aside from very minute differences, the power-ups are a joke, and the difficulty is completely artificial.  +Soundtrack is okay, I guess. +The style is nice. Lasers are pretty cool. +Top down racer.  -Controller support is a joke. You can't pause the race with anything but the escape key. No modern controller support. (A big 'screw you' to ExBawks and PS users.) -Power-ups aren't remotely balanced. You can get hit with a tractor beam off-screen and be slowed and unable to turn for as long as they're behind you. So you could drop from first to last because of one power-p. -The vehicles handle the same, and thus the stat values mean nothing. 20% of what? 80% of what?  All in all, glad I got this in a humble bundle for a dollar. Any more and I would've dragged Valve to court to get this refunded if I had to.",

But despite being a very cheap indie game this game fits neither and is actually really good. Think of a 2D, Vector Graphics, Top-Down view version of Wipeout. And if that sounds good to you then I would certainly recommend buying this and even if you're not a Wipeout fan I would still recommend this!",
