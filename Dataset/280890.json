            "review_text": "UPDATE: I played the game again and to see if there were any changes and was killed twice in utterly nonsense ways. Once by a noclipping stiffy mode zombie and another time because aliens and zombies dropped through a solid ceiling to land on top of me and swarmed me  Pros: *Solid Atmosphere  The sounds of metal creaking and the quiet breathing of your character as he runs is very intense and can give you a deep sense of immersion when nothing else is going on. You find yourself checking corners and worrying when the next enemy will pop up. Sounds will echo throughout the ship and have you looking around wondering what could possibly be doing that. Sometimes the ship will make no sounds and the silence itself then becomes eerie. Very well done.  *Innovative Design  The whole 'No playthrough is the same' concept is really really cool. My first playthrough the ship's AI was very helpful and gave me weapons, warnings, and helped me detect enemies. My second playthrough the ship's AI was deranged and crazy and barred my way. My third playthrough the AI was completely dead and I had to go through the whole ship with no backup power or systems and many areas were closed off. That is just one storyline aspect that changes the game. There are hundreds of those kinds of things that make each playthrough unique and throw you curveballs as to what you expect.  *Interesting Weapons  Okay so you have your standard rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. But with the fact that some weapons can replenish their ammo supply infinitely but take a long time to charge, and some weapons can reload fast, but magazines are limited, really changes the game. If you get down to a laser rifle and no other weapon you can probably do okay against a small group, but a large group could easily kill you because it only holds 80 shots and then it takes about 2 minutes to recharge. Minutes you really don't have. This really ramps up the difficulty and intensity of the game when the going gets rough and can make you have to strategize on the fly.  *Decent Story  Okay so I know the story changes based on how the playthrough goes, but I really got into it when I started finding out why the ship was infested. Knowing what I know in one storyline adds a huge sidelight to the others, and makes the storyline fairly intriguing.  Alright now time for the cons. =(  Cons: *Erratic Controls  They say it is controller compatible, but they kind of lie. The controller works, sure, but sometimes it won't sprint on controller anymore after certain storyline events. Sometimes your aim gets twitchy and wierd and you can't really lock on an enemy because your gun sight aims too far right if you even slightly tap right and too far left if you even slightly tap left basically forcing you to use the mouse and keyboard. Even after I switched I found it clunky and difficult to hit enemies even when they were right in front of me. Not good guys. This is 90% of the reason I died every time I did. Oh yeah and invert Y turns on when it wants. You don't get a choice in the matter.  *Little to no Graphics settings  Its okay to make a polished game and all and I've got a decent computer, but I'm the type that will turn down the graphics even if I CAN run it on the best just so I can crank out a little bit more FPS. Thats kind of important to me, and I'm certain it would be more important to someone who is using a potato computer. The fact that you only have 2 resolutions, little to no particle effects options, and absolutely no bloom or dynamic lighting options really limits how people can customize their graphics to suit the game. Which leads me to my next point  *NEEDS to be optimized  Alright, they are trying to make it look pretty but fact is that the graphics in this game are decent at best. But hey, its an indie game. Whatever gets the job done works you know? But come on guys, I can run Planetside 2 on high graphics with no lag and the same deal with Bioshock Infinite, Rage, Far Cry, ect. So I can play some games with high graphics and have little to no lag. Yet your game with meh graphics lags like a tired horse in a caravan the moment a large group of enemies shows up. This is rather irritating and can easily get you killed as that is the WORST time for the game to lag. I don't need pretty, I need playable. That is what is MOST important about a game and needs to be put on a higher priority.  *Enemies move in glitchy movements, sometimes slide on surfaces.  I was fighting some aliens and I jumped over some boxes and kept running. What does the alien do? It flips sideways in the air and slides THROUGH me to land in front of me and kill me. Um. What? Yeah that kind of garbage shouldn't happen. Its one thing if an alien crawls on the roof all scary like to jump in front or something like that. However, unless the alien is also a ghost, it shouldn't be phasing through objects and people. Many times aliens would appear out of an area I just cleared through the floor or something and attack and left me wondering wtf just happened. I died early game my first run because of that floor effect. Very frustrating I assure you. Especially when the enemies get trapped in the floor and run around underneath the map freaking you out by making attack sounds, which leads me to my next point.  *Wierd glitched sound FX  I killed some zombies and expected the sounds of them attacking to end. Nope. Kept hearing moaning all throughout Deck 4 until I left which made it hard to detect when other zombies attempted to attack me because I couldn't hear them. Sometimes enemies will make no noise and instead just soundlessly attack me while I shoot at them. Sometimes my guns would make no noise. Occasionally both gun and enemy sounds would be delayed and would happen all at once after I killed the last one. Yeah it was wierd and kinda broke the immersion. A game based on atmosphere needs sound to be top notch in order to really keep the player into the game.  *Terrible, TERRIBLE voice acting  Look, I know this is an indie title but there are plenty of talented voice actors out there. I've done voice acting work before, as have many of the people on newgrounds who are hurting for recognition and I'm absolutely certain you could find a guy who would be willing to work for free just to have his name out there. This guy you hired to be the foil for the main character is not an actor. As a matter of fact I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume he is a programmer who just is doing it because you guys needed one.  When you first enter the ship he laughs this awful fake laugh like a million times that reminds me of Tommy Wiseau from The Room (Nothing should EVER remind me of that) and his line reading is both annoying and without much emotion or tone. The character he plays isn't much better considering he makes fun of you being in danger constantly and it made me want to hit him. I'm always happy when he shuts up even when he is giving me pertinent information because his false emotion and wooden acting hurt my ears to listen to.  However, I will concede you this. I don't know if the AI is a programmed voice or a real person simulating one, but she is actually okay. She seems as robotic as she is supposed to be. Thats good. She isn't bad to listen to and whenever she gave me orders I was okay with listening to them, mostly because I didn't want to roll my eyes whenever her vocals played.  _-_-_-_-_-_  So overall this game has some very good ideas and would have potential if there weren't so many things that hold it back. I wish you guys spent a lot more time fixing bugs on this game and making it playable, reducing clunkiness, and making the game have more actual gameplay to give you. If someone is looking to purchase this game, I'd reccomend they wait until version 2.0+ is out and then see where the game stands. Until then, this isn't really worth 12 bucks.",

            "review_text": "I seriously don't get why so many people are complaining about this game. Ok yes it has some bugs but that's allowed in my opinion (think of SimCity when it launched).  The graphics are pretty awesome and so far, from what I streamed last night, the game is immersive and the story is very gripping. Yes the creatues have some issues but they will be fixed when the patches start rolling out.  Highly recommended for people that love survival horror games with gun action. Also for those that like Rogue-like elements, this game always starts differently and came have some very major impacts on the game itself.  Video review will be forth coming as I have to sit down and script it, but it's an awesome INDIE game for what it's worth and I loved every second of playing it.  -EDIT as of VERSION 1.2-  This game has only gotten smoother since the latest update went live. So many more startings and scenarios have been included and someone just blow my mind (no giving any away). I streamed this a few nights back and actually managed to finish one of the story branches (videos currently uploading to youtube) and I have to say, the amount of thought that went into each story is breath taking.  Don't believe what the haters have said (yes they came in troves simply to make the game look bad). If you want to see the game in action don't hesitate to message me on steam. Be happy to point you in the right direction.",

            "review_text": "I don't know if I can reccommend this one. The atmosphere and graphics are really kewl, but game play is lousy. It's hard to manuver, its hard to pick things up, it's hard to aim, and you run out of ammo too quickly. I had a horrible time just getting the game to load; I 'played' 78 minutes of the game (according to steam) before I ever saw anything past the loading screen. I'm going to give it a 'thumbs down' because of the difficulties. If the gameplay and controls can be smoothed out, I'll change that.",

            "review_text": "Again, like many 'indie' games on here, this title has some decent concepts which tend to give players hope that they aren't playing a 'lemon'. In fact, this game is pretty much a solid turd. 11/10 I would poop on this game if it were a hard-copy and wipe my butt with its instructional manual.  1) The environment is a bit ridiculous. I mean blood bathed walls with like one or two human corpses present... That's sort of poop.  2) The aliens seem like they just don't know what the Hell they're doing. From the way they look, to how they interact to attack the player. The aliens range from giant flea-like creatures which come farting at you from nowhere to smurf-like zombies that make you feel like you're trapped in some cheap Haji rip-off of the Goonies with cloned versions of the Sloth; made even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through the cloning process and rapidly multiplying cellular generation.   Oh yes. Watch in horror as those things crowd into a narrow corridor swarming you, and smile with glee as you dump endless rounds of the worst possible ammunition from what could be high-tech airsoft rifles from the far future into their sponge powered bodies. Then die... :/  3) Go here; do this; maybe run from that? 'Eh I don't know, what the Hell, why not?' basically sums up the every play-through. Try as you might it doesn't get much better than that.  I tried flushing the toilets in the bathrooms to see if they would suck my player out into oblivion because I was having so much fun. But much to my dismay the character I was controlling did nothing of the sort while he breathed heavily in his space 'suit' (probably hoping he'd just passout and be eaten by a giant-flea or something).  If you MUST be curious and buy this game, don't do what I did, and don't be sober. Maybe get smashed on a bottle of cheap vodka beforehand if you are of age.",
