Got it in a bundle, was excited for some mindnumbing hours of clicking on artificial animals. Instead I barely played half an hour listening to vague instructions and wondering why the screen was so darn bright.   The animals, the ones I have seen, were cute but aside from that the game is too slow and does not live up to the '2' in the title. If this is two, how bad is 1? (I would not know, it doesn't start on my laptop for some vague reason).   ",
