            "review_text": "Trick &amp; Treat is a sweet and entertaining 8-bit RPG. The story and dialogues are rather mysterious and the various quests never get boring. If you like riddles, an halloweeny atmosphere and kawaii, tough pixel-girls, this is just for you! I enjoyed every character and the funny fact that there are several options to die in the game, as some sort of personal achievment. The combo of cute and horror fits well too, only thing bothering me was that I had to finish the game twice to unlock the achievments, because finishing it first time over your desktop won't work unless you play it over steam directly.",
