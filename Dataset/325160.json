Animations are bad, sometimes barely can be called animations at all. And you know what? i still love this game to bits. It's funny, characters are likeable and I find myself rooting for them almost immediately. Plot is surprisingly exciting and i couldn't stop playing at times, simply because i had to know what happens next. And thanks to build-in dropbox support for save transfer i could keep playing on my android device at work! It's just an amazing space adventure P&amp;C game with good puzzles and charm, making it one of my favorite games of 2014! I did not expected that from a game like this. As for the graphic? After few minutes i lerned how to stop worrying and and love the game:) 10/10   As for the Linux port: No surprises here really:) 10/10!",

            "review_text": "Bik: A Space Adventure is a point and click adventure that rivals the graphics and gameplay of Telltales The Walking Dead.  Anyway in all sersiousness this is a gem and I would highly reccomend it, the writing of the story and characters is witty and funny. The game itself looks like it belongs on an NES and has a somewhat nostalgic feel to it. So if you can pick up this game on sale for a buck or two you should, I mean movies cost like five times that and this will give you so much more entertainment. So when your friends say 'Lets go see (Insert new movie title here)' you say 'F#@% OFF, Im playing Bik A Space Adventure'.  R8 10/10  would turn off oxygen again",
