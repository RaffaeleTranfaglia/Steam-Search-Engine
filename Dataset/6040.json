            "review_text": "A legendary game, yet one of LucasArts' lesser known pieces due to its somewhat-awkward presentation. The DIG started as an idea by Steven Spielbeg that he soon abandoned with nowhere to take it, handing it over to his friend George Lucas' studio to make something out of it. What they created was something magical. An odyssey into space and the man's determination to survive and explore.  Playing as the aging astronaut Commander Boston Low, you must traverse a strange and marvellously deadened world beyond our reach, of a planet long abandoned by most of its former inhabitants. Joined by his two crewmates being the severe reporter Maggie Robbins and the cool-minded geologist Ludger Brink, Boston must use his natural survival instincts and quick-witted skills of human engineering to try and formulate a way to escape, explore, and uncover the origins of this mysterious planet, and how they must find their way back home.  While the DIG may not be LucasArts' best work by far, it is certainly not one you should miss if you love their library. The graphics are not the best, being that while the LucasArts style works well for more cartoony games such as Sam &amp; Max or Monkey Island, it's a little more uncertain to do so with actual human characters and as a result they can look rather off during cutscenes. Like 'monkeys wearing human masks' off.  Nevertheless the rest of the game shines through with its pure atmosphere. The graphics for its weird alien backgrounds are gorgeous, the sound design is just absolutely at the top of its game more than ever from LucasArts with roaring waves, howling winds, deep resonance within space and the most oddest of creatures wallowing and shrieking from all around you.  The dialogue is rather snarky in about 80% of its places but that only makes it more fun with the likes of Steve Blum and Robert Patrick delivering the most deadpan of deliveries. The puzzles are...infamous to say the least and in truth one or two of them could have been much better designed. I'll give you a hint for free, the head of the skeleton is not meant to be on the top left, but bottom right.  Regardless, I say go ahead if you love LucasArts' work, and try out this gem from the past that, while is a little rough around the edges and is perhaps at the lower end of their library, is nevertheless one worthy of playing if you are a fan of such games.",

            "review_text": "The Dig is one of the best science fiction games ever created, maybe even one of the best science fiction stories ever told. Sure it's a dated game, but in my personal opinion the story is what counts. The puzzles offer some difficult challenges to the player. If you can't figure out a puzzle, by all means, use the internet (It's better than complaining how you spent countless hours because you suck at the game.) The soundtrack was created by Michael Land, and it is definitely one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.   As for the 'Outdated feel' of the game, I wouldn't let that sort of thing bother me since it's full of AMAZING and UNIQUE layouts, backgrounds, characters and creatures. The cast is brilliant. Robert Patrick (T-1000 from T2) lent his voice talent as Boston Lowe. You get some great one-liners any classic and true Lucasarts fan would hold dear to their heart.  This game is amazing. I would love to see it as a film some day.",

            "review_text": "The Dig is one of Lucasarts' less known and less succesful point and click adventure games. Unlike most of their comedic fare, this one's played entirely straight; a sci-fi story of exploration and solving puzzles. The interface is very simple, no 'use, look, pick up, etc' commands, just a simple choice between interacting or examining. Despite that, it can be pretty challenging at times and even have you stumped for a good while.  Good: fantastic music, seasoned voice actors (Robert Patrick, Steven Blum), nicely painted backgrounds, challenging puzzles, good gameplay length and some lovely animated cutscenes.  Bad: at times frustrating, dialogue can be kind of stilted and will endlessly repeat as you try to solve puzzles, simple interface makes for less creative adventure gaming, low res sprites, and two or three puzzles that will really send you runing for gamefaqs.  Overall: still a great classic. Avoid a walkthrough as much as you can and you'll definitely enjoy the experience!",

The game’s opening is effective and catching with a wonderful sense of mystery and foreboding. As the story progresses, the plot does take some odd turns but I found I enjoyed it. And it must be stated that even late into the game the art direction is fantastic and settings feel alien and strange.  That said, there are some big issues holding The Dig back: namely the puzzles. After the opening segment, the puzzles quickly dive into nearly incomprehensible territory. A great many of them are just frustrating and lacking any sort of direction or hints. While this may be intentional, as exploring an alien world without guidance would undoubtedly be trying, it doesn’t make for a fun game.  Overall, The Dig does have virtues but they are obscured by some terrible puzzle design. I’d recommend the game only if one is exceptionally patient or willing to use a walkthrough.",

I spent 17 hours on this game it says, there were a few moments I just got lost, I never looked at FAQ hence why the time is SO long.

I decided it was finally time to jump back in and boy--was it worth the wait.  The game is done in the storied Lucas Arts adventure game style which works perfectly for this piece of Steven Speilberg sci-fi. If you're a young pup and you don't know what this means (i.e., you haven't played Curse of Monkey Island, Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, etc.) you may want to watch a Let's Play or something to make sure you understand what kind of game this is. As a whole, these kinds of games have trouble 'holding up over the years' in that they are very different than most games today. For folks who are familiar with the genre, this is a shining example.  The art is great. The music is fantastic. The dialog is charming (written by Orson Scot Card of Ender's Game fame).  The budget was obviously large for this game as it was clearly put together with a lot of care. Stunning use of cinematography to draw attention to the features of awe-inspiring alien landscapes and technology.  I hate puzzles in games. I'm just not a puzzle game guy. Most of the puzzles in this game are very approachable. I suggest giving them a whack but not being too proud to consult a walkthrough if you are getting frustrated. I did do this myself in a few places where the 'adventure game logic' was spread a little too thinly and to save myself unnecessary walking around once I knew what I was supposed to do.  I spent six hours enchanted by the characters and the story. Well worth what I paid for this game.  Edit: Don't forget to use Alt-Enter to force the game into full screen. F1 is your menu where you can turn on subtitles and save your game.  Edit edit: You can also double-click on most location labels to quickly jump from screen to screen. You don't have to stand there and wait for Boston to walk across the screen.",
