            "review_text": "First (after) words: this is NOT a game of diplomacy. I don't know if they plan to update and add it, but there's little to no diplomacy whatsoever. The AI does diplomacy sometimes (Finland announces it has joined the Communist Bloc! O_o), but you can't. If you play Sandbox with the pre-set alliance disabled (neutral, Allied, Axis), everyone fights everyone. It's still really fun, but I thought I would warn you. This is a combat game, not a diplomacy game!  There isn't any other reviews yet, as far as I can see, so I thought I'd write a super-quick 10 minutes first impression on launch, so you might be spared the hassle to refund if you don't like it.  First things; graphics and sound is very dated. The game does not look pretty in the least. There also is no sound slider, but with the rather sad quality of the audio you might as well mute it.  Now for gameplay. I haven't played enough to find the real depth or tactics yet, of course, but I can say that altough the UI is a bit clunky, the game works well. It seems to be the straightforward WW2 sandbox game I've always wanted. Hearts of Iron is too complex and slow for me, while Risk has too much luck. This is a middlepoint between the two extremes, more towards RISK but without any stupid dice.  Would I recommend it as of now? Yes, yes I would. It's clunky, and looks bad, but you probably already saw that from the pictures. There's a specific type of gamer that would enjoy this, and if you are already looking at the reviews, you probably are that person.   ((45 Minutes later edit)) - the AI is pleasingly competent, and I feel there's more than enough depth and content already to justify the price. If you are looking for a milsim game, this is not it. If you want to play Risk with no luck against AI that's surprisingly skilled, this is it.",

            "review_text": "Ok, here's my take on the game. I'm used to playing Axis and Allies, both the Milton Bradley board games as well as the old Nova Games, which was the best...I also play the triplea version, which is excellent. This game is much more in line with the Milton Bradley games. A relatively simple game, simple mechanics. That being said, there are some very nice features that I enjoy. You can plot out moves in a step by step fashion. Moving infantry to take the first territory, then 'relocating' mech units into the newly taken territory, and then launching an attack with them into the next. You are not required to to plan out every move for all your troops, they can be executed one at a time. This is definately a 'beer and pretzels' kind of game.  There are, of course, things that I feel need to be addressed to make this a truly awesome game. And I do believe the potential is there. One of the issues that I saw in other reviews was that there is no diplomacy. Since this game is based on WWII, the sides are pretty much determined. Don't let that stop you from buying this game. However, it is true that you are unable to move your troops through an allies territory. This is quite problematic. England is pretty much handicapped until Germany makes the mistake of taking a coastal province. As long as you don't do that, and there is no compelling reason to do so, you've effectively blocked any invasion from that front. As Germany, you are completely unable to send troops to aid Italy. English and French navies will never combine. Spain is pretty much on its own. Think of it as a first come, first serve kind of war. If I get there before my allies, they are going to have to figure out another way around, and if they get there first...oh well. This is the one thing that I feel needs to be addressed. The war was Axis and Allies...oh, and Russia. Axis and Allies and Russia. Not Germany, an independant state that promised not to attack Italy, Italy, an independant state that promised not to attack Germany, France, an independant state that promised not to attack England, England, an independant state, Romania...etc. Once that gets fixed, I would definately recommend this game. As is, it's enjoyable, just could be better...",
