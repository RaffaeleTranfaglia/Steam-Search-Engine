            "review_text": "This game has some strange fetishes included in it, and I'm not going to lie when I say they're disturbing as hell.   A naked lizard man, naked lizard children and a topless lizard mother are all in this game. And yes, all three are sexualized in some fashion. From one of the characters being  happy  the lizard child doesn't want to get dressed, kissing the child on the lips, and doing it all in front of the mother - this game's pedophilic undertones are a bit more than just 'obvious'.   I've always loved the old school point-and-click adventures but this is something different entirely, and it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ profane. Personally, I think the devs should be ashamed. Not just becaused they released a game that takes about 10 minutes to beat, but that they have the audacity to release something like this on Steam.",

The next 30 minutes of my life were the most uncomfortable I'd felt in a very, very long time. Reality swirled around me, creeping in at every impossible angle - This game I was playing was more than that. Like a plastered-over door to a serial murderer's lair, as if I was watching an uncut portugese dub of the August Underground, there was a daft scent of uncertainty about. Things that should have been innocent or natural were instead replaced with a twisted, perverted effigy that secreted a rancorous stench that pierced my mind and sinuses like a stilletto.   This is not an innocent adventure game, no, it is something far more sinister. There is not a trace of shock or awe, but perhaps that is what drives the knife so deep; rather than a bludgeon or a stab it is a slow and gentle slice that never quite breaks the skin.  7/10 it's okay.",

At first glance, it didn't really seem like a game for me. But... something in the back of my head was telling me to play it.  Trusting my instincts, I decided to buy this.  ...Boy am I glad I did.  This game has a really emotionally powerful story, and I was just a crying mess near the end. It also has outstanding, realistic graphics.  This is a really good game. Not just for adults, but kids, too! If you're looking for a good game for your kids to enjoy, this is definitely one you should look into!  My Rating: 10/10",

No where on the store page does it say this is only Chapter 1 of a series where each chapter costs money. There is almost no shading on the art, giving it a MS Paint vibe. Overall this game is not even worth the dollar.",

All in all, worth the price of admission, if only to enjoy a short but cute game.",

I thought i'd at least see something fun. Its just boring. Seems like a game you'd make as a kid. Seriously, if your thinking this will be a little entertaining and considering in buying it for a laugh. Don't. Its not fun its not even 10 minutes long. I normally write funny reivews of games even if their bad, but this doesn't deserve it.",
