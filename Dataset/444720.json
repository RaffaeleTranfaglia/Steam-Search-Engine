            "review_text": "I'm not usually the one to give aggressively negative reviews for games. But honestly, this is TRASH.  This is the definitinion of plain uninspired level design. Empty hallways, empty hallways all the way. The combat is offfensively bad, consisting of a one two dodge mechanic for all encounters.  I actually lost a little bit of self respect for putting myself through the first boss twice, once on each difficulty level.  If I have something good to say about this prototype of a game is that the characters and enemies visual design are sort of cool, but they are recycled to a deggree that they sometimes just don't fit with the stages they are in. It's like the developer thought 'okay, I need an enemy here, let me just pick whichever from this list'  Believe me, I actually was very excited for this ever since I voted on Greenlight. I followed development through the facebook page and bought it close to release. But honestly, if you're thinking about buying it, go away and pretend it doesn't exist. I can't imagine even the developer having any fun with this.",

            "review_text": "A quite short but very well-packed Metroidvania.  You won't have any trouble to know where you should go, as the game is very linear, even if you can still explore a little to find weapons, armors, items and puzzle pieces, sometimes after defeating a powerful foe. Yes, the storyline is short, and the scenario quite anecdotal. But you won't be disappointed with the action/plateform part of the game, which works perfectly, with a good dodge system and some epic boss battles, including a challenging one (who didn't lose against Scylla?). The game's not very difficult to beat however, since there are a lot of save points, which is perfectly fine to me.  The pixel-art graphics are good (especially when you play in windowed mode), depicting the classical environments you can expect from a Castlevanai-like, but the soundtrack really is the biggest surprise of the game, with some true audio gems inside (the moutain's theme).  So yeah, Inexistence can't pretend to equal its model, but is good enough to keep you hooked for a few hours, and even make you go back to it from time to time.",

Why do I want my fifty-nine cents back?  - Sounds are ridiculous. Every time you jump it sounds like somebody banging on a very large, very cheap drum. - 'Combat' consists of stringing together a whole two button presses...one shortly after the other...and firing a magical projectile in a straight line. - The levelling up system consists of a point dump that seems worthless to do anything but pour into strength, both from what I've seen and what others have stated. - Uninspired level and monster design right off the bat. Small, green haired, two-footed things that looked suspiciously like reworked goombas, plants with yoshi-shaped heads that spit fire and don't even turn when you jump behind them, and pit-dwelling hopping critters with big eyes and pincers. - A Legend of Zelda reference. Seriously. The shop-keeper is named Sahasrahla and even is an old man who helps the hero.  These simple sins alone take away and detract from the entire experience. The game isn't fun, it isn't challenging that I can tell, and it sure as hell isn't original given the monster designs plug off of goombas and petey pirahnas and the first helpful NPC you meet is named after a LoZ character.",

It's babby's first metroidvania.  The game is not necessarily bad, but this is something you would expect as a school final project, not a commercial release. The best weapon in the game is available before the one that precedes it.  And then you beat the game, and you get the cliche indie artistic ending. Wont spoil it if you want to play, but it's painfully dumb. It's the kind of ending that likes to say 'No, the game was simple so that you could get my really clever ending'",

(Love the little nod at the final battle to another very famous Matroidvania battle ;)...hehe)  I bought this full price (6.49 CAD) and felt I got my money's worth. Attentive developer as well...I had my save game listed at 98% and posted about it on the forum, wondering what I had missed. Dev stated it was a bug and they fixed it. Sure enough when I updated my game, the save was at 100%. Excellent dev!  Buy this game. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "A decent indie action platformer. A very basic beginner's Metroidvania maybe (though only two skills are added later, and they have minimal effect on pathing. However the game is mostly competent all around, and I look forward to future games by the developer. The bottomless pits are a pain if you haven't saved recently, but you start with a skill to keep you from being knocked into one by an enemy, so that helps. The game is well paced, and the retro graphics and music are decent. I had a good time playing through it once on normal over a couple hours or so, but don't really have interest in replaying on Hard or Time Attack mode.",

            "review_text": "I don't remember how I heard about this game, but I had this game on my wishlist for months and kept forgetting about it until I was 50 cents short of a trading card during a winter sale purchase. It's not much, but doesn't really claim to be more than what it is, either. I played this while waiting for another game to download in the background.  Pros: + Tight controls (Not the tightest, but still tight enough to where most of your mistakes are your fault) + Costs less than a soda when it's on sale + Trading Cards and Achievements + Great controller support with rumble + Visuals and audio are mostly consistent and make the game really feel like a SNES game  Cons: - Requires administrative privileges (Why??? This killed any desire I had to keep this on my living room steambox. Means I can't play it without a keyboard attached to my living room PC.) - A little too linear for what claims to be a metroidvania - Magic is useless beyond shooting at a switch or teleporting; while I didn't spec into it, your magic pool is so small and regenerates so slowly that it just ends up being quicker to rely on melee - The writing is almost embarrasing at times  Mixed: ~ Story is weak/forgettable, felt like the twist ending was shoehorned in and could have been more impactful by having the world you explore, equipment you gain, and enemies you fight tie in with it somehow ~ Level design goes from linear to labrynthine without warning and makes the last level arduous ~ The skills you learn, while nothing new, serve mainly to progress the story, don't add anything to the other mechanics, and doesn't give much of an incentive to go back and explore areas you've already been to. ~ The most expensive equipment you can buy ended up being underwhelming and not worth the time it took exploring to find enough coins to buy it with, but it's still entirely possible to play to the end without them without much trouble  All in all, it's genuinely not that bad. It's not without its flaws, but for the price of admission ($0.59 at a 90% discount) it's a fun action platformer. I hope the developer learns from this game and improves on the next game he makes in this genre (if he ever does).",
