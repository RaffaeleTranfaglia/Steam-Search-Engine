I would class this game rouge like and tedious, as this game will rip you a new hole to go with the bleeding one it left. I would like to say this game does provide a unique experiance and expect to die a good deal and there are some outlying bugs with the game currently that need to be patched.   Update* So far after playing a little bit of the second mission which could take some serious planning. I've noticed that the ai are competent in what you would expect, your marines will back away from enemies charging and do a particularly good job of murdering them and some times they like to dance around each other if you place too many marines in one area  P.S I had the paitence to sit down and play this game due to playing dwarf fortress. Losing is fun!",
