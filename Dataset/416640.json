You're in for a cartoony romp with a straightforward plot and lots and lots of deus ex machina if you play this game. I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I might but that was likely because I went in with the wrong attitude but I'm certain many people would find its silly and irreverent tone to be quite entertaining as long as they were aware of it before getting in too deep.",

The characters are unique, interesting, you can choose to be a completely bloodthirsty psychopath, a kind-spirited villain or a shameless flirt, or even more, tbh. ♥♥♥♥ing love it!",

If you don't like reading then buy something like Evil Genius, and if you do, get a book so you don't need to be at your computer, when there is something much more enticing such as Team Fortress 2 (or Evil Genius). If you like where you are that bad guy you have Payday, Evil Genius, and even flash games. Speaking of flash games this feels like a flash game in fact this is something DOS box I see no point in buying a $4.50 game when $4.50 can buy you much more than this 'game'",
