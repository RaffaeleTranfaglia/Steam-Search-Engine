            "review_text": "'Oh boy, I love back tracking!' - Said no one ever.  This game is a bit of an odd ball to me. While I enjoyed it better than the first installment I also can't pin point what exactly I liked about it. It's a classic hidden item game, nothing about it breaks any molds. You play Owen who is looking for his kidnapped daughter Olivia. It's fully voiced, beautiful artwork, good mini games and hidden item scenes and the story is decent...so I don't know why I feel meh about it.  The story is what I'll touch on first. I liked it, I liked the mystery element and the hunt for a killer. What I didn't like was waiting until the very end to know who did it. There were no clues or build up to the identity, the cops didn't figure out jack and I wasn't given enough info to try to figure it out on my own. Instead, the whole game is spent wandering about and doing puzzles oddly placed in people's homes while Owen shouts and acts melodramatic.  This isn't a huge issue but it really annoyed me, however, the general story itself was alright so I continued playing until the story played out. The mini games and hidden item scenes offered nice challenges and I was able to skip any that I wasn't in the mood to play since there are no achievements attached to this title to worry about. Gameplay was fine, except for the map. The map doesn't do much, you can't even use it to move around quicker. Instead be ready to back track a lot constantly.   The game slightly connects to first game, it's set before  Brink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome  and one of the characters in this game is related to Oscar, the main antagonist in the first installment. Not going to say who, though it seems a bit tacked on as an after thought. You don't need to play one to play the other. Story is alright, the gameplay is enjoyable and the artwork is nice on the eyes. While not a favorite hidden item game of mine, I do recommend giving it a shot.

Game breaking bug 0/10.  EDIT: For some reason I was pulled back to complete this game. I experienced another bug, where it would not save at the end (meaning I had to complete the entire extra bonus level in one sitting). There is a fun HOBO game here, albeit with stodgy acting, but the bugs prevent me from being able to recommend it. 5/10",
