I enjoy the story and the characters (way more than The Black Fortress) and all the hidden junk for me to find! The branching paths can be frustrating because I’m trying to exercise my inner Paladin and Redbeard always comes off as a bad-guy even though he’s trying to maintain peace, but you’ve got to feel for all the people who end up being oppressed in certain aspects… it can rack a person’s brain. While you may not be able to punch a bear here, you can light wolves on fire and stab demons and that comes off as more satisfying. Avadon 3 is a fantastic addition to the series and I believe a must-play for people who love RPG’s! You don’t need to play the other Avadons before you venture forth here, but you may end up wanting to near the end.",
