(definitely don't do this) Memory: 3 GB RAM Graphics: GeForce GTX 1080 (It couldn't hurt) Storage: 501 MB available space Sound Card: By this point, writing all these sound card lines for each of my games, you have to understand I am running out of ideas that are clever. If the others were even clever in the first place. Ugh. Accidental Introspection. Additional Notes: If you really want something in this life, you have to work for it. Now quiet!
