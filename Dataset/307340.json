It may look like a game for kids but it gets frustratingly hard at level 2. The music is simply awesome and the controls are crisp. Sadly this game suffers a few throwbacks like: Enemies will often enter through the left side of the screen killing you instantly. Bullets will dissappear behind scenery. Enemy bullets will have the same color as the background. And overall your ship is a little too big to dodge most of the stuff in the later levels.",

Even if you don't get any kind of royalties from Idigicon, we'll always know it was you who made it.   This is a game that I've wanted since the days when Gamehouse had a Steam-like game browser thing called Real Arcade (anyone else remember that?... No?... Just me?). My younger sibling and I used to download the demo and play it nonstop(one hour) until it expired, but the furthest we ever made it was mid-second level. Fast forward about 12 years, to when I saw on steam, AND that it was on sale, and I immediately purchased it. The claymation graphics are great, the music fits the whole atmosphere of the game really well(as it should), and you can play with up to 3 people. Overall it's really a fantastic game. For me, and judging by other reviews, a bunch of other people, it's a huge nostalgia trip. I'd definitely reccommend this game.",
