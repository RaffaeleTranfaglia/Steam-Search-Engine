            "review_text": "Think of the gameplay as like a Mount and Blade game but set in WWII and with ships instead of soliders. There's two sides to the gameplay, in campaign you manage your fleet, you build ships, attack ports, raid convoys, and such on the campaign map all in real time. Once two fleets clash you then pick out the ships you want to fight with and ones you want to keep in reserve and duke it out as an RTS.   In the tactical battles, you can issue orders with the tactical view, and command a ship personally aiming weapons and steering it about. The orders themselves are pretty simple, you can order a ship to move, attack, defend, or retreat. The main thing about your ships is the varitiy and the modling of the different weapons on board. The game features, destroyers, various crusiers, battleships, carriers, and submarines, in along with some minor patrol and convoy ships. All of these ships have different subsystems in place modling the damage to the weapons and other departments of the ship. In the images above, the green central buttons are the weapons and the little icons below them are all the different subsystems that can be hit.   I see Victory At Sea being a very ambitous game. I haven't had the chance to push through too much of the campaign so I'll just say that it looks highly promising. The game delivers not only one but three campaigns, one pacific, one atlantic, and a mediterranean one aswell. The game features seven different nations, though a couple such as free and vichy france aren't too fleshed out. I like the faster pacing to Victory At Sea though I can see it being a tad simplistic and too fast for someone looking for more of a simulator experience.

            "review_text": "Important Edit: I may have mis-remembered the asking price of this product. I recall it being USD $24.99 according to TotalBiscuit's review on the same product on 12Aug, 2014, which is dated. The current asking price, HKD $148.0, translates to ~USD $20, which may be that this product has lowered its asking price or Steam being, well, Steam. The developer has also showed continuous support towards this product, which also factors towards this edit being more favorable towards the product.  Short version: Victory at Sea subjectively straddles the line in terms for content versus asking price, with the deciding factor being how much you enjoy seeing WWII ships tear one another apart without being able to nitpick every inaccuracy the in-game vessel assets process.  Long version Victory At Sea, or as I like to call it, 6x speed simulator, is a light RTS game featuring...ships! (*audible gasp*) To the best of my knowledge (I played Battlestations: Pacific once, so you know my naval knowledge is certified). You start off with a puny destroyer, accumulate war bonds (sole currency of this game) to purchase bigger and better ships via taking over hostile ports and sinking roaming hostile fleets, or to recommission destroyed vessels in your fleet, cumulating (hopefully) in a full fleet of battleships, carriers, subs and whatnot. During battles, you can choose to sit back and do nothing (you casual scum), issue orders via a tactical view of the battlefield, or manually control ship(s) in a more close-up fashion.  Besides 3 (albeit somewhat same-y besides the flavor) campaign (you can choose sides), the game also has custom battles and historical battles, which does exactly what it says on the tin.  ...and that's about all there is, unfortunately.  The game seems to be geared towards simplicity and accessability, with the AI, both friendly and hostile, being moderately fustrating in some situations (they, however, become more competent as they accumulate combat experience and level up). Graphics and sound design are marginally servicable, especially aggrovating is the lack of puncture behind the sound and effects of a battleship firing its main cannons. Game depth is comparable to that of a peddling pool, with a rather skewed grinding curve and somewhat unexpectedly punishing consequences for losing vessels (any damage substained will be repaired for free upon visiting a friendly port, but a fee has to be paid to recommission a destroyed vessel, which somewhat prohibits experimentation and effectively locking you into a spiral if you lose too many ships in a rapid fashion). The skewed part comes into play by over-offseting the 'death punishment' with most of the roaming enemy fleets being overly easy (end-game, you can easily accumulate, say, 5 Iowa Battleships and 8 Essex Carriers, while most of the enemy fleets will still be 4 vessels at most, each often no heavier than a cruiser). In other words, the game has a serious pacing problem, with the game over-rewarding skill and over-punishing mistakes.  The game also lacks some features that I would love to see implemented, namely vessel descriptions, vessel upgrading and customisation, capturing vessels (currently you get a new vessel whenever you accumulate sufficient XP from killing hostiles, I'd love to see the ability to capture crippled/surrendered vessels), and maybe even the ability to build your own vessel from the ground up (say, Yamato's cannons on an Iowa hull).   All in all, Victory at Sea is a somewhat pricy game for what it provide, but then again you don't really get one of these that often, so you may find it easy to let slide some of its aforementioned flaws.",

            "review_text": "It is the right game, but the wrong war.  Destroyer actions can exciting dual rushing in to launch torpedoes at point blank, while turning hard to avoid the enmy tin fish. Curisers really do feel like a step up and make nice fights.  And then you have aircraft carriers. Yes, they defined WWII, and the ability to send out flights of aircraft is a powerful one. Too much so - they break the game. If you have a carrier and the enemy does not - you can esentailly win the battle on auto-pilot. In the reverse situation, practically nothing you do can stave off defeat.   The interface is simple to use, and while sometimes the missions can get reptitive - these can go by quickly. If the game was set during the first world war when guns and armor made a diffrence, the fights would be great.   But as is, its a game about battleships, where you will never actually want to have an Iowa or Yamato on your team, because you can get a carrier that is better for a lower cost.",

I've read through all the negatives and honestly most have a different expectation of what this game was suppost to be. From what i've played of this game it wasn't suppost to be a really deep real tiem stratady simulatior. It was suppost to be a casural fun game with a bit of stratagy and planning mixed in. What we got was a well crafted, arcady, action naval sim with fun fluid gameplay. There are always a few issues here, sometimes the ai can be a little easy, can't aways see were you've hit, camera honestly Really hard to manage/awquard at times but I would recomend this game to anyone who just wants to sit down and sink some ships. It's solid, entertaining but still has enough to keep you on your toes. This so easily could have been another run of the mill real time stratagy with lots of micromanagement and nickpickyness but instead we got a masterpiece a Fun, fluid, exiting, casural but that sill provides even seasoned stratgy action gamers with occasional real challange to keep you from getting too big headed. Game just came out and already wanting a sequil!",

            "review_text": "Let me be clear in stating that the 'navy combat' genre today is severely lacking in products. I've yet to come across a title that lets me command my little fleet and feel the satisfaction of a well-placed cannonade or the yells of helm officers, stating that we have hull damage.  While Victory at Sea doesn't quite cover those requirements - it certainly does come close! And here's why:  Victory at Sea is a neat little game, reminiscent of Mount and Blade and Sid Meier's Pirates! in terms of gameplay. The prospect is very simple. You are a Captain and you're given charge of a certain navy's dinghies. Sorry, i meant 'destroyers'. With said rustbucket, you must take it upon yourself to sail the seas (under orders or not) and violently introduce the opponent navy's ships to the bottom of the ocean.   The overmap gameplay is simple. You navigate the open seas in 'Sid Meier's Pirates!' style, running across friendly fleets, enemy fleets and ports of varying allegiances. Now, unless 'swabbing the deck' is too complicated a task for you, you can guess the way to interact with each. Friendly ports repair and replace crew and planes automatically, enemy ports and ships are commonly known as 'targets', and your own ships can be helped or escorted.   Simple? Yes. Too simple? Sadly, also yes. While the game has a nice, straightforward concept, I was left dearly wishing it had more to offer. It has the skeleton gameplay down, but not much meat on the bones. For example - your ship's systems can get damaged in combat, but said damage has very little effect (except for guns or engine being disabled). Your guns seem to also be ridiculously accurate, making low-level fights a breeze, even in your first rustbucket.  Happily, though, what it lacks in gameplay 'muscle', it more than makes up for in content. The maps are huge, players can buy ships from a petty torpedo boat to late-war Battleships and every battle feels different. There's always a subtle change in objectives, enemies and tactics that always lets you feel satisfied when downing an enemy fleet while sustaining minimal damage.  Graphically, the game does indeed look rather terrible. This is especially bad in ports, where you get a close-up of your low-def textured ships. Most of the time, the camera's sufficiently far up that you don't see it, but maybe some better textures would have been in order. Ship models are also heavily simplified, with only the largest batttleships showing some decent level of detail. While it doesn't distract too much from the experience, it would be a welcome update to get a higher-def texture pack for it!  Conclusion? Yes, i do heartily recommend it. If you've been missing a proper fleet command game as I have, then this will help you alleviate that urge.  What would one hope for in the future? More complexity. An accuracy system for guns, based on level. Higher detail in ships, ship damage and feeling.",

The game is quite addictive and definitely scratches that naval warfare ich!   Plenty of room to improve/expand/increase the depth of a solid running game so far!!  I hardly came across any game crashing bugs too which is a real bonus for a newly released game!! The one that did crash the game for me between 17 hours of solid play got fixed today! The Devs are on the ball and pop into the forums for a chat too which is nice to see!  The graphics are a bit dated, though most likely not yet optimised I'm guessing? Definitely a great time waster with its roots deep into table top naval warfare games.  Has that 'just one more turn feel' for a RTS that will keep you up into the wee hours growing a beard and shouting 'Damn the torpedoes full speed ahead!'  So a good sea worthy 7.5/10 from me with potential to grow into a 9/10 or 10/10 game as more development is placed into it for the future!",

Although most of the reviews are good there are a few ones that make you think, meh, should I get this?  Has it been a waste of money?  No.  I mean there are not many naval strategy games to choose from as it is and this is one of the few that has both flush graphics and a 2d table top style format. It is great to get use to, and the tutorials would be befitting of any good game; considering the straight to it explanation and logical progression-however it is not that complicated that you want to drown yourself.  I would say there are many postives to this game with fewer cons-plus the fact that it looks like it has been getting a monthly update cycle with CSGO style nerfs/buffs on weapons.  The only actual cons I can think of is it would possibly be a bit too expensive to the casual player, but at £17.99 it is a bargain to a RTS/NavalStrategy enthusiast. My second problem would be that a multiplayer game mode would be really really nice (but I bought this as a single player game anyway, but its appeal could be amplified if you could co-op with friends!).  tl;dr: Great game for strategy players at £17.99, excellent game for everyone else in the sales :)",

Easy to control and can be fun when in massive battles with 8 or more on each side. If you don't want to do the campaign, there is a sandbox which you can choose anyside and anyship in the game.  My Fleet: if you want to win, get like two or three Ark Royals and two Essex class carriers with BBs, DDs, and ETC. Every ship has it's role, Destroyers murder subs and can cause havoc to large and slow ships. Cruisers, Using it's respectable guns, kill other cruisers and destroyers. Battleships, BIG guns kill everything in it's sight, great for taking out cruisers and other battleships, not great for destroyers. Carriers, When you get these bundle of joys, send out fighters to kill planes, Bombers for ships, and torpedos for everything. Oh, Ark Royal! 6 Torp. planes, 3 each, watch out! Submarines, slow but sneaky, kill every thing, watch out for destroyers!  It's a good game but it's a little too simple and more campaigns, (if they can) .  I think the devs should add WWI campaigns, only using WWI ships, I would love to see a dreadnought in this game. Please add WWI devs,PLease???  Recomended? For Causal gamers? Yes. Action gamers?
