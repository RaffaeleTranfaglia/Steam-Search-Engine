            "review_text": "Warning alert! This game is fun and addicting! If a puzzle married farming simulator, the baby would be Farm frenzy collection. I am sorry to have played a pirated versions, until I found the whole series for more than modest price on one of Steam sales, compared to how much fun it gave me.  Pros: * Kids firendly! * 12 games for the price of one! * Doesn't require very powrfull PC or a lot of disk space. * Engaging gameplay! * Puzzles to solve! * Zero violence. * Lovely cartony graphics. * Different from one of those annoying Facebook farming games. * High Fun factor. * Addictive. * Onboarding in this game is one of the best in the genre. Cons * It's an older game so it doesn't scale up to big high resolution screens, windowed mode works like a charm tough. * Not a real simulator obviously. * It's more a puzzle, less tomagochi, so if you want to grow pets look elsewhere! * Music sounds go on repeat all the time, it might annoy some people. * Cartoony graphics might not be to some peoples taste.
