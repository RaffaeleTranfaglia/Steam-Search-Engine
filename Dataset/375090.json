            "review_text": "The Eigengrau Menagerie is a fantastic little artsy puzzle game. It's a little short, perhaps, for the money, but it's certainly one of the more unique experiences on Steam. You play as a pilgrim, wandering to find the great Thoughforms of the world. The gameplay is pretty simple: you start each challenge with time frozen, and you can take as much time as you need to read the descriptions of all of the highlighted objects and people around you. Each challenge is a pretty simple puzzle, but must be solved within a couple of seconds, before the challenger kills or captures you. Luckily, you do get infinite tries, but therein lies one of the problems - because of this mechanic, you can pretty much just brute force all of the puzzles if you choose to.   I found the best part of the game to be the backgrounds art - you can clearly tell that it was drawn as a labor of love. The background music complements the art style quite nicely, and the story, although quite esoteric at times, is acceptable. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the game.   Pros: Fantastic art style Nice BGM Good atmosphere, and a good experience overall Potato Erotica   Cons: Writing is perhaps a bit pretentious Length - game is far too short No save option - you have to finish in one sitting (although It only took me around 30 minutes to finish, so it shouldn't be a problem) BGM and voice acting are recorded at different volumes   Other thoughts: The writer really likes the color 'bronze-gold' for some reason. Does it mean something?",

            "review_text": "Cute little project, but not in much sense a full game. Fails the dollar per hour of entertainment scale by quite a bit. There's something very endearing to how much effort has clearly been put into this though, like art made by a child: not good but fills you with a kind of hope for future development.",
