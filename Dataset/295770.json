            "review_text": "Let's get this out of the way first: this game isn't for everyone. If you don't like old school (and I mean, Doom/Quake era) gameplay and hardcore randomization, then you shouldn't buy this game. That being said, if you enjoy either/both or are open minded, this could be right up your alley.  Rogue Shooter blends rogue-like elements (permadeath, random levels/items) with gunplay from the shooters of yore. It does have a couple of technical limitations (the lack of a volume slider, locked resolution, and oddball fullscreen modes), but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Weapons feel satisfying and varied, enemies are diverse, and levels (while basic) are never quite the same. Furthermore, the higher difficulties are challenging and give you a good space to grow into as you graduate from noob to veteran.  If you're a fan of modern roguelike hybrids, classic shooters, or just plain old innovative games, then Rogue Shooter is worth a shot. Don't take my word for it-check out the demo and see for yourself.",

If the screenshots on this page invoke any sort of nostalgia, I can pretty much guarantee this game will be up your alley.  The weapon design, balance, and difficulty all feel like they are in a good place at the moment. I get a good sense of satisfaction from taking a look at a scenario, checking my inventory, and coming up with an optimal plan of attack and pulling it off.  It's hard not to recommend this game, if you have even a fleeting interest in this sort of genre, I doubt you'd be disapointed.",

Takes place in corridors that make Doom maps seem architecturally rich and spacious. I expected this game to be amusing, I didn't expect it to be good.  Very much like a Marathon total conversion, and is as solid as the Aleph One ports. Makes me miss some commercial Marathon total conversions that were Mac only. Go figure.  4/5",

            "review_text": "Edited: Now it's more of a proper review.  Initial impressions after 2 hours:  So far Rogue Shooter has actually been very fun. It's silly, colourful and fun. Anyone who remembers PC gaming in the early Nineties will likely approve. It's a Roguelike/Roguelite/I'm-not-going-to-be-drawn-into-an-internet-squabble-over-semantics FPS, Doom meets Rogue Legacy is the most common comparison I've been hearing, and with good reason. So far the only issue I can place on this game is the Steam Overlay is absolutely unusable, but this is patchable. I'll definitely be playing more of this when I don't need to be sociable.  Side note to the devs; Having a playthrough trailer was a very smart idea; it gave me a good idea of what I was getting into and it was that which earned a sale from me. Doubly important in this day and age when any old pap is coming onto Steam. I am glad my money went to a properly good game and not the next Earth: Year 2066  Now that I've played more:  Some more time later I can say the initial impressions held up but there are some things that I do need to address. Firstly, at this time is is seriously buggy. The music doesn't loop and I've had mooks appear outside of the map (though thankfully close enough for me to boot to death through the wall). I've not had a game breaker so far though a good mate of mine has come across a splintered map with unattached sections. Of course if this game's been patched then ignore this paragraph.  Another is the graphics and presentation. Personally I am fine with the cheesy cartoon style as not only does it invoke a Blake Stone esque vibe but it is a welcome change from the overly pixelled sprites of similar low-resource games. Still, it's not to everyone's style and if the screenshots bug you, seeing it in action won't win you over.  Once all is said and done, I can see myself returning to this game fairly regularily and giving it a bash. The numerous classes and the randomisation definitely have lasting appeal, like other such games.",

Apparently windowed mode is bugged in that if you even try to move the window, it will affect the mouse look in the game. That's just plain stupid. Fullscreen is bugged in that if you Alt+Tab, black screen. The controls are okish but the mouselook feels awkward. The graphics are cartoony but not bad. The difficulty doesn't seem that bad really and I prefer my Roguelikes to be very tough.  Honestly, if you want a FPS Roguelike, I would recommend Doom + DoomRL + DoomRPG.",

If Doom was turned into a quirky roguelike, this is the result. I've played 2 hours at the time I wrote this review, and I'd wager there may be many more by the time you read this review!   My only complaint: Intel isn't tallied up til the end of the run, and my very first run was good enough that I ran out of perks to spend points on because the rest weren't unlocked! Very minimal though, and nobody should expect to survive their first run anyhow.",

This game is fast paced, fun, and at moments rather exciting. Each level is well crafted and though the graphics don't look anywhere near realistic, its nice to look at. Adding onto the scenic view, you have awesome audio that makes you feel as though you are playing a game, not real life, a game. The whole roguelike setup is great and since it just came out today, I really do hope the developers keep updating this game and adding on things to it!  Just know, this game is one of those games that are in the same vein as FTL and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. You can keep playing games and wind up spending a ton of hours on them! I'd suggest this to anyone who likes a little randomness in their games and to the deveopers, keep up the good work!",

You must fight your way through a hundred floors of a randomly generated spacestation full of colorful enemies whose only goal in life is to make sure you don't succede in whatever it is that you're trying to do. Rogue Shooter is not without it's flaws, the graphics are pretty basic, sound effects are nothing special, and a hundred floors doesn't seem so bad until it takes you an hour to get to floor twenty, but it's fast paced gameplay, off-beat humor, and variety in weapons makes up for it. You choose a class and some perks that you get more of as you level up and start blasting your way through each floor. Weapons degrade with use, but can be repaired and even upgraded in the safe rooms every fourth floor to maximize their damage. Rogue Shooter is a fun, slightly flawed, and humorous roguelike that will satisfy your need to shoot puppies at robots.",
