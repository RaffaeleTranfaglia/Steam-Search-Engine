            "review_text": " Note: this is a review of the port, not the game itself. The game itself is amazing and you should definitely play a different version of it.   First of all, I really don't care about what they did to the sprites. As a matter of fact, I find some of them pretty cute. Most of the other graphical changes (except the character portraits, of course) are generally positive. I also like the fact that they brought back the original 16-bit music. However, this port is broken on a technical level. It's a clear example of a terrible conversion from mobile devices and touchscreen controls. You have to come to a complete halt to do anything, from getting off vehicles to opening treasure chests. It's no longer a smooth transition from moving, like it was in the pre-mobile versions. While the new diagonal movement is good, the way the grid works makes interacting with objects and people incredibly clunky at times. Another bizarre change is the fact that the thief's Sprint ability now affects the world map as well - and that includes vehicles. Because of this, ships, airships, and chocobos are slowed down by default, and require a character with the Sprint ability to move at the same speed as they used to. But the worst part about it are the menus. For some bizarre reason, there is a massive input delay between action buttons and directional buttons. This will lead you to, for example, waste elixirs while you intended to heal your party with hi-potions (which happened to me a number of times). Even during battles, the game sometimes decides to default your cursor on a random command when you get a turn, resulting in you switching rows when you intended to attack, for example - this wastes two full turns and is likely to get you killed. And to top it all off, you have to edit the game files for the Steam overlay to work properly, and the fullscreen feature doesn't work at all on some graphics cards.  TL;DR version: -The original music being back is great. -The graphical overhaul is hit or miss. -The gameplay is broken on a fundemental level.  Don't play this version unless it's your only option. It's sad that it's the only version (I'm counting this and the mobile versions as the same because they basically are the same) released outside of Japan that features both the best translation and the original music. Square Enix, I won't ask you to give me back my money. But give me back the elixirs I wasted because of your broken port.",

I'm seeing in the reviews that lots of people are having issues without slowdowns and bugs, but I didn't experience any in the almsot 40 hours I logged onto it. The game ran very well and overall was a very enjoyable game. My FPS never dipped down and the game ran smoothly the entire time. While it wasn't my first time playing FF5, it's without a doubt one of the more underrated FF games out there. The battle system is enjoyable and overall I liked how the game looked compared to the other verisons I have played with it. I wouldn't take those negative reviews you see on the front page too seriously, it's a great game and for the price without a doubt worth picking up.",

            "review_text": "In short, one of the best JRPGs I've ever had the pleasure of playing. A port is a port, and I'm sad that there's no mouse support still, but on the other hand, mechanically this is probably the best Final Fantasy in the main series. Some of the models look awkward, but if you're like me and gameplay is better than graphics, then pick this game up and treat yourself to a really fun, flexible, and intuitive job system that lets you mix and match different abilities to your heart's content. As someone who played through the game multiple times earlier in life, I can guarantee that someone looking for a JRPG experience will not be disappointed.  However, one bug I will mention that is somewhat irritating is that sometimes the game doesn't correctly remember what your last action was. For example, one round you might attack, and the next the default action will inexplicably be to guard or use an item. It's minor in the grand scheme of things since it doesn't happen consistently, but nonetheless it is an issue. I haven't run into the screen tearing and other issues that others apparently are running into, either.  I am also not the biggest fan of the music 'remaster,' but the in-battle models have been reworked and are exceptional- each character has unique animations for each action for each different job. One character casting a spell as a mystic knight will look different casting that spell as a ranger, for example. It feels like a loving recreation of an underrated game.",

            "review_text": "Flawed. Few small, annoying changes and glitches:  Diagonal movement and the removal of a grid based world. You can turn off the diagonal movement but the game is not grid based anymore, so the player character sort of slides around corners. Movement feels slippery and the lack of the grid makes landing the boat/airship/wyvern a chore.  A strange bug where the cursor does not always start on attack.  I do not care for the adjusted in battle interface. It's nice that you can see all of the information all the time, but I do not care for the location of the action menu.  While I will say the in game sprites are far better in game than they look in pictures they still appear awkward and out of place on the world map. I enjoy their fluid movement and combat animations, and even some of the non-standing models, but the standing still versions mostly appear awful, especially when facing the down (looking towards the top down camera). Overall the game looks better and the battle backgrounds are good looking.  Worth noting is that this version does contain the additional content added to the GBA remake.  This game is 20 years old and a port of it shouldn't have any flaws. It's fine and the worst feature is the movement but I really don't think there should have been any problems with the game at all. I'm putting 'No' down for my recommendation because the GBA version is better in my opinion. The only time I would recommend this copy is if you wanted it linked to your steam account.",

I only have a couple gripes about the game, the first being the character portraits. They look great, but if you have any issues with consistency, it will bug the hell out of you that Lenna and Faris' portraits have them with whiteand blonde hair, when their in-game sprites have pink and purple. A simple to fix oversight, but it doesn't take anything away from the game itself.  The bigger issue I have is that the cursor will occasionally move to random selections on its own. It's quite frustrating when you're in a simple battle that only requires some mashing of the A button to win, and instead of attacking (the top selection of your actions) you randomly waste an elixir on a character with full health because the cursor moved to items for no reason whatsoever. This issue is more relevant to gameplay, but nothing worth saying you shouldn't buy the game.  Overall, the game is fun just as it was when it originally released, just make sure you pay attention to what your cursor is doing so you don't waste powerful items. And if you have OCD, just try not to pay attention to the portraits when Lenna and Faris talk.  Happy adventuring!",

            "review_text": "In it's current form, this game is hardly playable. Technically and graphically, the game functions poorly and I would recommend investing into an older not-PC remake of the game instead of this (until it gets updated).  I've had many issues with controls: not only can I only use the menu function in one safe spot in the second dungeon, but I cannot exit that menu unless I save the game as pressing the back button only switches between the 'inventory' and 'save' screens'. The game also has problems registering 2 different input keys at the same time (excluding directional keys); button mashing to figure out the controls will do nothing for you, give each key a second or two to fully register. You should also be aware that this game is fairly unstable: multiple crashes within the first 10 minutes of play, mostly around naming your character (caution: keyboard keys still function while typing the characters name and you may unexpectedly accept a half-finished name, like I did with the name 'The' before the game crashed). Graphically, you can take a look at other reviews: the graphics are updated and improved, but there are plenty of tiling issues, the portraits (as great art pieces as they are) do not look like the game sprites and become very off-putting, and the game looks like it's 480p stretched to larger resolutions (don't hold me to that, but the main menu is very much low resolution).  The plus side is that there is controller support for the game, and it worked just as well as my keyboard (that is to say I still couldn't access the inventory/save menus); the 8-directional movement, though weird, is nice to have when traveling lengthy diagonal distances; and the gameplay is very much unchanged aside from the improvements of latter FFV iterations (that's more of a neutral point).  In summary, hold off until an update arrives or you may find out you can't save.",

I do not have any graphical or slowdown issues reported by anyone else here. I've run it at 800x600 too, no problem. I actually enjoy the updated art and graphics. The controller support is not great, but passable. I've pushed all the buttons on my Xbone controller trying to find a world map, but no luck. The configuration also gives you nonsense like 'button 13, button 14' instead of actual buttons. I guess that's what 'Partial Controller Support' means.  If you're looking to run the game at a big resolution and hate the tile seam mismatch, or if you hate the new art, the modding community is actively addressing it. Yes, this doesn't really reflect well on Square-Enix, and if you don't want to give them money because of that, that's completely understandable.  I like this port a lot and recommend it.",

For example if you want to always keep using Fire with your Black Mage, there's a 'Remember' Option which automatically sets in the last action you used. However, this is messed up sometimes in a way that your Black Mage maybe use an Item instead of the Spell fire. Really anoying in fast paced battles in which every little bit is important.

This version is not for you.  Now on to the meat. FF V is a phenomenal game. Beyond amazing in every form, and what I consider to be the pinnacle of the Job system within the FF universe. While this game does still have that, the flaws that are front and center are far too numerous to overlook.  See the short playtime? Yeah, that's because it crashed once and the hiccups began afterwards before I gave up on it. And within those minutes I experienced a number of issues. To begin, it is clear that the game has only been marginally formatted for usage with keyboard input. While most PC gamers today may prefer a controller for their gaming, rebinding keys within FF V to standard WASD movement resulted in a hiccup within a few mere moments: naming input has been bound to the keyboard, ending in a hero named BartzS before I realized that utilizing the Cancel key fixed it or that the Restore Default option was present.  Following that, my eyes locked on the poorest excuse for tiling ever. It's easy to see why the screenshots and preview video show what they do: aspects such as trees or the initial meteorite are so poorly put together that you would expect the quality to come from the very SNES game this originated from. And associated with the poor tiling are the sprites for the characters. While I adore the Amano artwork for the character images, the same love cannot be tied to the characters themselves. Bartz alone consistently looks like a Looney Tunes character trying to intimidate a villain thanks to the 'chest thrust out and fists at sides' sprite presented here.  I wanted to love this game. I really really did. It's why I shelled out full price instead of waiting for a sale. Final Fantasy V is a glorious game, and that is why, above all else, I strongly suggest finding your experience of it elsewhere.",
