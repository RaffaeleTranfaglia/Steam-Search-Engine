I do like the music and the concept but the struggle with two tools that only cut mass chunks of hair.  The feeling of succeeding was not fulfilled over the dread of losing more money every minute it got to a point where I was making $200 a cut but started losing over $700+ cash made this game pointless to even try.  I feel like going out and making real money would be less stressful than a growing greedy rent manager this game has provided, this is more of a simulator of rent scandal than anything else.",

However; I have played this game for 1 hour thus far and I have: 1. Gotten to my 2nd level barber shop (Level 3 is a little harder at $5000) 2. Hired my first worker. 3. Bought up to 6-7 items in one game. 4. gotten 10/22 of the acheivements in this game.  Now, a few things: ~ Yes this is a timed game ~ Yes the fact that you have a very short amount of time to be able to make a set amount of money that keeps going up does make it difficult. ~ Yes the reason above is the only reason I've lost thus far. ~ No there is not a real grading system on how well you've done on any one beard (unless you, you know, actually pay attention to how much you make off any single cut?! Seriously, you do better it pays you more. Worse you get less or even negitive money) ~ No this game is not easy.  Alright, so long story short, if you want a mind numbingly easy game to play get off this page and go play something like Grass Simulator. If you'd like a challenge that you actually have to work for like in the 80's and early 90's stick around. Cause this game is about as difficult as you can get (with something as simple as cutting beards) without making a true rage game. (Also with all these negitive reveiws I'm willing to bet that the achivements that are actually harder to get are pretty rare)",

Another thing to mention the game is hard, you have a minute to pay 100+ in rent if you dont pay well game over. If sandbox mode can't be made can we get a feature were you choose to pay rent.I request this feature since some players like me suck at trimming beards. I would pesonally love to see this great game thrive.",
