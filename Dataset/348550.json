I guess my only complaint is the lack of an excellent tutorial section like BlazBlue, but when was the last time a GG game had one of those? Brilliant fighting mechanics, AMAZING soundtrack, all you need! Settle petty arguments in a manner most satisfactory.  I never could own any other version of this game, so I'm more than stoked that it's on Steam. Grab this game and you'll never feel more heartbroken when you have to drop the controller and go to work. Best fighting game possibly on all of Steam.",

A must have for any fighting game lovers! lots of different modes, Arcade, mission, story etc.  Easy to play but really hard to master.  While the Netpatch is not bad, there is not enough player from my region, Malaysia (SE Asia).. hence I cant play online matches as much as I would like. playing with people from other region is unbearable due to lag.. I just hope the player pool will grow bigger.",

Steam Achievements, Nesica Live Arcade Experience...........Runs on a laptop phenom II X2 at 2.8 ghz with ati radeon hd 4200 (a pretty outdated graphic chip), meaning that the minimum requirements could be lower that the ones in steam.

Odds are, if you're even on this store page outside of a recommendation, you've already played this ages-old game, and are looking to play it again. Do it.   Guilty Gear is a well established fighting game series which comes to us from Arc System Works, veterans of the genre. Both their other franchise BlazBlue as well as Guilty Gear have much to offer. Characters are extremely well designed, with each one boasting their own select set of skills and moves. The best part of Guilty Gear, and the feature that sets it well apart from other fighting games, is the balance of the fighters. Nearly every game I play with friends ends up with one of us on a pixel left of health by the end of the match. This makes the fights feel EXTREMELY intense, and any game that can actually get my heart going is a game I'm interested in. Button mashing isn't enough, and you'll come to learn all sorts of new techniques and mechanics as you play.   HIGHLY recommended for ANY fan of fighting games.",

It can be a little hard to pick up since there isn't a tutorial but fighting game vets would have a great time im sure. The biggest issue is that there isn't any people who play online really at all so you'll need a friend to play with, other than that its wonderfull and i highly reccomend.",

It works OK if you live close to the person you're playing, but everyone I've ever matched with on-line lagged really bad and the game was unplayable. I much prefer the #Reload port of this game, the On-line is way more populated and the lag is very playable with anyone above 140Ping.",
