            "review_text": "Loot Hero DX is yet another entry in the new onslaught of 'clicker' games, although this particular title has a controller scheme. There are a total of nine 'levels', which you can ascend an infinite (as far as I know) amount of times. You ascend to the next 'difficulty' by slaying the dragon on level nine.  I'm currently on Difficulty 198, which means that I have slain the dragon 21 times. I found the first 37 Difficulties semi challenging, and after Difficulty 37 the developer got lazy. You have stats to upgrade; attack, crit, defense and speed. You start off with tiers for each stat (the little triangles above the stat on the upgrade screen), but once you hit the fourth tier of each stat, it no longer tiers but instead shows the stats in numbers on the right side of the upgrade screen only. It also appears that your stats are maxed out after purchasing 9 upgrades after the fourth tier, but really you can and MUST keep purchasing stats beyond this point. There's also a bestiary, but it's pretty redundant seeing as there aren't many enemies or bosses.  The stats aren't the only area that the developer got lazy in. There's actually a coin cap. The developers boast that you get 'miners' to farm coins for you when you're not playing the game. This is true, I currently have a crapton of them because you get one each time you slay the dragon. But what good are they? Your gold caps at 99,999, and it's not one of those 'soft caps' like in Tap Heroes where it just shows the maximum digits but still gives you the full amount of coins you've earned. Nope, it's 99,999 and if you earn anything over that it just disappears. I was gone to work for roughly 12 hours and when I got home, at the time I had 3 miners, my coins were capped.  Overall, it gets boring quick. If you want a game like this, just get Tap Heroes. It's way better in every way. I wouldn't even really recommend this title on sale unless you're in it for easy achievements, or if you have a huge fetish for clicker games.   Rating:  2.0/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",

The game itself is pretty much about loot and that's what you get, lots of it; you will in fact get so much  loot that any pleasure deriving from getting it is lost in the sheer numbers of trinkets you get from mobs. The game knows all this, and it will collect and sell all those drops for you, redirecting any earnings to your  in-game account. You will see that loot only briefly, but  then you will be able to invest your cash in improving  your character's stats.  So, summing it up… click left, increase stats, next level. But hey, it's different, and I firmly believe we should encourage new ideas, even when they don't bring us a  proper game, hence the Up vote.  Lastly, in spite of the “retro look” and the fact that you  won't probably notice, mobs and heroes are pretty well  designed. Another star, but goodness, if I am controlling the game with a mouse, other controllers oughtn't be  vibrating every time I impact a mob… one star off.",

It consists of 9 levels which repeat while increasing in difficulty each loop. The gameplay itself is simple, run through your enemies, buy upgrades, and don't take too much damage. That's it. As for graphics, the character sprites and backgrounds are well done. The soundtrack is catchy, but ultimately repetitive.  I'd really liked to have seen a few more levels to reduce the amount of repetition in the content, and each level's music could have been a little longer to reduce how often it loops.",

On the surface, the game has a decent art-style, variety of level themes each containing unique enemies and nice sound design, however, there's absolutely no actual content or challenge worth mentioning. The levels and controls are designed in a way where the player is either idling for regenerative health, traversing back and forth to grind for points or exiting the level by heading all the way to the right. After the first cycle of all the levels, it's a matter of grinding through the remaining achievements or trading cards.  In conclusion, the game is an absolutely mindless joke not providing enough mechanics to justify its price tag. It does serve as a distraction though.",

Game legnth is about 10minutes (or less), and each time you beat the game the difficulty increases but that's about the only change.  Graphically speaking it looks great, and music goes along nicely. The bosses and monsters are all unique and creative.  IMO, it's a fun parody game, and you will likely get a good laugh at how insanely fast paced it is and how quickly you speedrun through each level without breaking a sweat.   Is it worth the price? Ehhhh...... No.... but if you can get it for less than a $1 you won't be dissapointed.",

            "review_text": "*Full Playthrough -- 100% Achievments*   It's a shame how some people are treating this poor little game -- because in actuality and for what it is, it's really quite good!  Now I have already beaten the iPad version several times and overall I have played it a metric butt-tonne in total. But the graphics, music and overall feeling of power had me excited to come back to it again on PC.  This is indeed the difinitive version of the game. The iPad version had less levels and features (At least when I played it last.) and eventually with a fully powered up character it also suffered some bad framerate issues. However, there is none of that in this STEAM version and it runs perfectly well and smooth.  What you see in the trailer is literally what you get. You traverse maps unendingly slaying monsters and endlessly leveling up. That feeling alone is intense and satisfying and of course watching the stats going up and the feeling of forever getting stronger is quite fun.  Yes the game is very basic. It is esentially one large leveling treadmill, but, depending on who you are, you might really enjoy it. I can tell you for sure that 100%-ing it will take you around 2.5 hours and after that the game does indeed go on for all intents and purposes -- infinitely. So you can revisit it again and again and eventually you will become so strong that you cannot even see what is happening on the screen any longer. Your little dude is basically his own Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at that point, and it is hilarious to watch.  So if you like leveling up for leveling up's sake, buy it. If not, don't. Simple math really.  It definitely is a shame that people are reviewing this mini-gem negatively and talking about refunds, because really, it's just a great little game that will take you no more than 2.5 hours to finish and that you may come back to and play again one day. IT'S 2 DOLLARS PEOPLE! Many shames-on-you if you're even THINKING about refunding it. We are essentially talking about a bottle of pop here. And really you're cheating the poor developer because their game costs next to nothing and can be beaten within the time limit that STEAM still allows for refunds. Which is a pretty disturbing loophole as far as this game is concerned and if you end up abusing it -- that's pretty sick and rather low in perfect honesty.  Oh well. I'll be KEEPING my copy because I actually LOVE THIS GAME!",

I've already basically beat the whole thing, it was just more like your princess is in another castle, do this again with harder settings and faster rewards, 4 times over.  I think it was due to the game always having progress. If you die you're just respawned and you continue, you just grind and grind away to save the kingdom. It's basic yes but its also quick if you dont like it, and the price tag of 3 dollars normally is alright I guess.   The only issues I really noticed for is a glitch where it showed controller controls on startup and the streched out graphics looking blurry on a 1080p Monitor.  P.S.

            "review_text": "Hold LMB: The Game  I haven't even played this game for 2 hours, and I'm only missing 1 achievement. As the title implies, the single mechanic for this game is holding the left mouse button to run forward or backward depending on whether or mouse is on the left side or the right side of the screen.  About 15 minutes into the game, I beat the 'final' boss, an uninspired red dragon. After this, I apparently rescued a minor and was treated to some text telling me that I had to now do everything I just did, but on a slightly harder difficulty. The game is literally 9 levels repeated ad infinitum.  Let's talk about the bosses. The bosses, in order, are: an orc, a rat man, a frog man, a bird man, some kind of undead giant bug, a snow troll, a werewolf, a minotaur, and the dragon. These are some of the most uninspired bosses I've seen, and even their designs are uninsteresting. I honestly think the designs for these bosses were created in less than an hour, because there is no imagination in ANY of them.  Graphics. This is gonna be the part of the review where I actually praise this game. The menus and title/logo graphics look terribly upscaled on my 1080p monitor, and they're shown constantly. That bit aside, the actual game looks absolutely beautiful. It has 'retro' pixelated graphics, but they have a lot of modern effects, like blurring, transparency, and some really awesome parallax scrolling. If the developer released a set of 1080p wallpapers based on this game's graphics, I'd actually pay $3 for it, and I'd be happier than I am with this game.  Gameplay. As I mentioned earlier, you hold the left mouse button, that's it. You run into enemies, and hope you don't die first. Along the way, there are shops you can buy upgrades at. You can upgrade your attack, crit. chance, defense, and speed. Speed is the most important one, because you can use it to grind faster. That's right, speed is more important than attack and defense because it lets you get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t faster. Upgrading crit. chance to max level makes you get a critical hit every single time, which makes you incredibly OP, until a few levels later when enemies are so strong you get your butt handed to you. Even after upgrading the other stats as much as I could, I still found myself grinding like crazy. The biggest godsend is a yellow potion that increases your speed and almost makes you invincible.  Music. It's terrible. It's uninspired garbage that I would expect to hear on some crappy flash game on some shady website. The fact that the dev is selling the OST as DLC is just bullcrap.  Bugs and glitches. Speed is the biggest game breaker I've ever seen. I've increased my speed to the point where the screen outruns my character, and I somehow die because the enemies respawn on my character and murder me. I've also had multiple instances where I somehow   outran the boss at the end of the level[/b] .  Here's an Imgur album of about half of the times this happened to me  [imgur.com]   Don't buy this game. Please, don't do it. I got this in a bundle from Bundle Stars for $1.99, and I only kept it for the trading cards to sell. This isn't a good game. It's so boring, and literally the only thing you do is  hold a mouse button , and the main gameplay mechanic is ripped straight from Hydelide. ",
