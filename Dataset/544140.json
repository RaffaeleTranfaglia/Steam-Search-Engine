            "review_text": "I like a good murder mystery as the next person, but this game is very bad. The movement is horrible, the puzzles are just as bad, and the characters are too unrealistic to be in the setting. The only good thing about this game is the trading cards and the mysterious, omnious voices you hear throughout. Not worth the money, heck I don't even want to AFK it for the cards.",
