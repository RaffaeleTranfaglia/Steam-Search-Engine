Press Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be.   The more you know.    Duck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being 'stay alive longer than your friends'. It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar).   If you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",

Probably best to pick this game up while it's on sale.  Pros:  - You can quack - You can change the pitch of the quack - Good amount of weapons and hats - The game controls really well - Graphics and animations are colorful and goofy - Gameplay is quick, easy, and fun  Cons:  - There isn't anything to do other than the arcade, so no bot battles - Download region locked, meaning that there will be very few players in certain regions - Can't choose the color of your duck - It can fall flat after a while, especially if you don't have any friends to play with",

            "review_text": "Duck Game is great.  How great? That really depends on several factors. If I was comparing this with anything else, it would be asking if you like Super Smash Brothers. Super Smash Brothers, in my opinion is only 5/10 if you’re by yourself, but a solid 10/10 when you get a couple guys to play with. Duck Game fares similarly, being a competitive, 2D, PVP focused game with skill based platforming and reaction time. The difference is that Duck Game has the one hit kill intensity found in Samurai Gunn. The kicker is that you can’t attack if you don’t have a weapon, so the start of the match is just a rapid scrambling for firearms and panicked firing. It’s an intense, skill based shootout that I hope to be playing for the next 10 years at least.  Duck Game’s true greatness is its subtleties present in its design. At first it may seem constraining to not be able to aim in all directions like you would expect, but you eventually find that if you’re pressed up against an object your duck aims upward, still allowing you to fire. A particular gun that looks like a giant magnum recoils with each shot, letting you aim slightly higher to hit enemies, essentially you exploit a handling characteristic of the weapon into a game mechanic. The ducks can even float around on stubby wings and slide on their knees if you duck while running (ha ha), allowing you to do Matrix-like dodges against your enemies. Really great stuff, with a high skill ceiling but still easy enough to allow new players to get the drop on more experienced ones, which is the “sweet spot” I adore in competitive games. There’s a button completed dedicated to quacking (SERIOUSLY) which adds a layer of absurdity and humor to the already ridiculous setting that Duck Game takes place in.   One fear I have is the staying power of the online community. Too many indie games, have I bought on a super-sale only to see that the fan base has since moved on to other games. Duck Game is still relatively new as of 6/22/2015, so finding a game isn’t too difficult, but I really, really REALLY hope this game has longevity in the future. Like I said, 10 years please. One of the upsides this game has over Samurai Gunn is its near perfect online gameplay, which I hope keeps the game alive. I only had a couple of disconnects but the lag never really messed with me too bad. Even if the online dies out, with the local play, all it requires really is a couple of controllers and a few brewskies to have a great time. I love this game.  Quack Quack, Mother ♥♥♥♥er",

This isn't Super Smash Bros, actually.  This is  Duck Game .   Great game, I'd advise getting it on sale but worth all 13 bucks of its full price.   Why should this game win an award? ( assuming ducks are farm animals )  - Who would have thought of ducks making an interesting game?  - Sure, Duck Game is just another one of those Super Smash Bros games, but the way it's presented, the throwback graphics, and the amazing developer team ( yet again with the updates), make this game great.  - There's a button dedicated for quacking  - Hats, hats, hats. I would confuse this game for TF2 if it had more hats.  - The clever ways and weapons are unique to this game - who would make the diversity of weapons in the game?  - The levels - you can pick random levels, the classics, or workshop based customs. All of this while keeping the ducks a central point of the game. 1984!",

There are so many ways to achieve victory, and every single round feels exciting and exhilarating as you try to react to every other player's actions at the same time and then, as you accidentally jump into a spike pit as part of your victory celebration, you realize that one of the other ducks was just PRETENDING to be dead...

It runs well, and framerate issues are minimal and non-intrusive under standard play. It also supports the easy-to-use, reliable Steam interface for online multiplayer.  On the standandpoint of content, there is plenty of fun things to do with your friends, or alone. However, I do admit that this game is only a fraction as entertaining when it is played alone, and should therefore be considered to be essentially, a multiplayer-only game. The base game has plenty of interesting weapons, levels and customization, that integrates well with the enjoyment of playing with friends. However, after a while, one can learn all the default content, and enjoyment can begin to stagnate. This is where the Steam workshop comes in handy, allowing a plethora of changes and additions to be added to the game, allowing the experience to stay fresh.  Finally, the game fits perfectly into a context of a medium to large friend gathering. As long as everyone has a controller or other input device, games can quickly be cycled, with no player staying out for long periods of time. This game definitely posses the 'just one more turn' drive, and time can dissapear before you know it while playing. It's play style also means that the game heavily emphasizes skill, and victory relies far less on pure chance. All these factors combined, render this a fantastic choice to play at your next friend gathering. Just don't forget your gamepad.",

Net gun is a personal favourite because you can pick the other up and throw them off the map while they're stuck.  Plenty of fun maps and fun level mechanics like teleports (that you can shoot bullets into) and doors (that you can shoot through) and barrels that you can shoot to make them leak oil and then put it all on fire with a flamethrower.  There is like 1 or 2 maps I'm not big fan of. But the majority are great and have their own puzzles/themes. You figure them out as you play rather quickly.  Quick matches (normally) and smooth process when changing map. The usual rules are first to 10 points win (winning 1 match equals 1 point. Unless you have converted another duck but that's a special rule to that weapon).  Very fun game with friends, decent with strangers (terrible if there's a large gap between one of players).  A fun and easy game to pick up for some arcade pvp game in true pixelly duck fashion.",

Duck Game is an indie, pixelated action fighting game where you play as a duck and battle against other players or CPUs who are also ducks. The game has 8-bit, 2D graphics and retro 80s and 90s video game music to instill that classic arcard vibe. The controls are simple and easy to learn and the game also has full controller support for those who want to play on something other than their keyboard. The gameplay is fast-paced and very addictive, sending you into a quick clash against enemy ducks using a large variety of weapons; including guns, explosives, melee weapons, wearable armor, and powerups. You can customize your duck too with unlockable hats. The singleplayer has a storymode and multiplayer can be co-op with a player close to home and/or sends you online to brawl against up to 4 other players on over 50 different premade levels. Not only is their the large amount of already premade levels, there's also a level editor so yuo can enjoy making your own complex arenas. And most importantly, there's a button on your keyboard or controller you can press to make your duck 'quack.'  The only criticisms I have is that you can't really change your color of duck in multiplayer, it just sets a color for you and there is no simple unarmed hit function (you can only attack with weapons).  This is a game worth buying and I'll give it a 4/5. Highly addictive and totally thrilling. Quack quack.",

The hats are a nice little addition to the game and a little extra motivation to keep you going if for some reason the game itself isn't enough motivation to make you to continue playing!

After 1 duck wins a round you get thrown into a random map and do it until one duck wins. +: I can't really think of much else to say...this game is a hilarious blast and I'm looking forward to seeing if the developer does anything more with it. Having custom maps playable online (which he said he was working on) would be mad cool in the future. There isn't any real problems with the game, it runs great, works great, is responsive, and is just funny. -: 10/15$ is a bit steep for an indie multiplayer game though - but it is actually worth it if you got a few friends you can reliably play with ever so often.",

If it a yes, you're weird but my point is: The game is about some ducks who are getting angry at each others by shooting at each others with guns and saying quacks all the times.  To be honest, I was a little sceptical about this product. But I got 2 hours to test it before refund so yeah lets just buy it and see.  Well This game is definitely Awesome !  You got alot of weapons, maps, mods, the community is funny and kind, the gameplay is like smash bros, the graphic don't really matter, actually I found it funny (weird guy intensify), you can spam a key to make your duck say 'quack' for eternity and infinite levels because of workshop support !  You have also a 'campain' but it is more like some solo missions where you can win some ticket to buy hats and gamemodes like infinity ammo or every crates explode for example. The missions are pretty funny but I have a preference for the multiplayers, where 4 ducks fighting :D  I exploded so many times of laughting at ridiculous moments I had in this game, really, it is like a humouristic game !^^ It reminds me of Magicka with jokes and bugs.  The only negative point I could point out here is the chat.  In the chat you can't write some characters like '?', '/', ':', etc... so no questions or smiley there and it's really feel like i can't say anything i want to say.   For now I just played this with kind and funny random players, but it can sure be more funny with friends :)   Definitely worth the money.",

It's the Smash for PC that's even faster and better for people that actually like to have a good time, and forget the competitive nature of video games we often find ourselves lost in these days.  A real treat that will be played for ages, very polished online and local, definitely recommend it.",

The game has an option to make your own maps but its UI is very difficult even to make very basic maps which mean unless you're willing to spend alot of time strugeling with the UI your stuck with the standar maps. personly I find the maps fine now but I only play it once a month for an hour or two.",

Having 93 hours logged and hundreds more offline, I think it's pretty safe to say this game is a keep. So basically you're a duck. With guns. Trying to kill other ducks with guns. Pretty easy, right? No. Think again.  This is very fast-paced, action-packed, and full of funny moments. Play to amtches of 10 wins, 15 wins, 20 wins, and so on to see who's the best. Wear one of the many available hats to spruce up your ducks look and make him look like a boss. You're not wasting time playing this game. You're making memories.  I would absolutelyt recommend this game to anyone who likes shooter games that constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. Me being one of those people, I honestly can barely find a way to put my controller down.  Buy this game, even if you're just think about it. All of this fun and amazing features for a mere $12.00. You honestly can't make out much better.  I hoped my review helped to influence anyone who was on the fence for buying this game. If you make the purchase, I promise you it will not be a mistake.

No matter if with friends or online, you'll have a ton of fun playing this, I guarantee!  There are a few technical problems, though... Nothing major, and it certainly doesn't ruin the fun if you don't play the game competitively (honestly, it is a lot of fun to glitch around ragdolling everywhere)!
