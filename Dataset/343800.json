Really fun to go back and play this again after enjoying the 2014 version. If you are a modern gamer who expects fancy things like music, be warned. There are only sound effects. So please don't trash a great old game for no reason. I would recommend buying the package with all the Macventure games if you want some great retro point and clicks.",
