    "description": "The Graveyard is a very short computer game. You play an old lady who visits a graveyard. You walk around, sit on a bench and listen to a song. It's more like an explorable painting than an actual game. An experiment with poetry and storytelling but without words.",

Games can be so life-changing.",

I've never been irritated by a gift before, but this one left me wishing I could have the time I wasted back. The only difference between the full version and the free one is... she dies on the bench. No sense of reflection. No walking back to the fence. No exploration of the graveyard (in either version). The entire game is shown in the trailer above. The instructions also detail the entire game (I wanted INSTRUCTIONS, not a plot spoiler with no alert... if you call that a plot... ?)   The reviews are complete jokes. Most are mocking the game... yet giving it a thumbs up? Thanks, guys. Way to encourage everyone to waste money on this, rather than on other artistic games - ones that have real time and effort put into them.  Yes, I love art. Yes, I own and love quite a few games that are artistic and most are rather short. Yet they tell a simple story. Some have had me in tears. I'll never forget the impact those indie games had on me. Their styles can be very unique, which is why some people do not even call them games. But this? This is incomplete and pathetic. I waited for 15 minutes for something... ANYTHING... to happen before I finally had to 'force quit' in order to exit the game.  Why should we support these indie developers? If they want your money, they should at least have the sense to put a 'quit' or 'exit' button at the end. Regardless, this takes less than two minutes to complete. It's not interactive. You don't even control when she sits down. You can't look at any of the gravestone. Come on, seriously? I don't understand why Steam even allowed this to be posted here.",

Just horrid concept and lyrics and the tune was crap. I don't have this fantasy at all. I don't want hemmoroids or cancer or any of the crap the song was about. I like art but this doen't qualify in my book as art. If you ogle at a crinkled candy wrapper nailed to a piece of cardboard at the art expo and ponder how deep it all is then you might really enjoy this. I have no idea why anyone would make something like this and charge money for it. I got it in a bundle. When you die there is no way to end the game other than CTRL-ALT-DEL.",

After that ate up about 3 minutes of time, I got her sad sagging wheezy ♥♥♥ to the bench. The song started, I tried my dammedest to follow along, and the lady started nodding off. When the song was over, I tried getting the old bag up, but she was either sound asleep or dead. Either way, there was no way to get her to move her ♥♥♥ out of the dang graveyard, forcing me to shut down the program by a way unintended by the game design.  I'll play it again when they add a forklift and ambulance DLC to move the dang fatass around.",

The Graveyard is another one of these creative ideas that features a story (in the form of a song) and two different endings, so to speak. However, I wouldn't so much recommend this game by itself (I got it in a bundle from a dear friend of mine). At five dollars, the experience is too short to really grip me into the story it's trying to tell. As well as this, there's no way to exit the game while in fullscreen when the old woman dies. I had to alt+tab out and close it manually. While the old lady's walking animation is quite smooth, the graphics are still not as pleasing as you would expect such a short game to be. The birds even pass through the building, not to mention her eyes are kinda creepy and lifeless, but not in a really good way. Don't get me wrong, I still appreciate The Graveyard for its creativity and attempting to bring about emotion in the players, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you can get it for a better deal.",

            "review_text": "Here's the entire experience you will have if you play The Graveyard: You hold 'W' until the old lady limps her way to the bench in the middle of the graveyard, you'll see trees that are one giant flat picture of leaves, absolutely no 3-D quality to them, then you turn around and sit down, you listen to the ENTIRETY of some depressing German song about dying, and the old lady will probably die during this song, and then you have to minimize and right-click close the game, or use task manager. If you're lucky enough and she doesn't die, you walk back up the path you walked down, leave the graveyard and you're done.   Either way the game ends up going, it's extremely dull and I honestly feel sorry for anyone that has PAID for this. I can't believe it's actually $4.99, when I saw it in my library and even until recently I thought it was a free artsy indie game (like that's been becoming so popular nowadays), and honestly I love artsy indie games, but this one has literally nothing to show for. The graphics aren't even that good, which are the only stimulation you receive throughout your 10 minutes playing The Graveyard. So without good graphics, basically no gameplay, and a song that most people won't even like (which takes up half of the playtime), The Graveyard is just as boring as a graveyard. In fact, I'd rather actually go sit on a bench in a graveyard than play this game, because that way I'd at least get some fresh air.  3.1/10",
