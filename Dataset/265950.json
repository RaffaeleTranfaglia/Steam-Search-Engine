            "review_text": "I just finished Ether One. It's a brilliant game with an exceptional story. It reminds me of the Adventure games of yore where it is best to take notes, make maps, draw diagrams and exam everything. I took my time and I worked on a section at a time trying to complete it before moving on. The puzzles can be challenging, but your note taking efforts will greatly help. This also comes in mighty helpful when it is necessary to go back into an area. These efforts will help to complete the game as it should be completed and the rewards for doing so are three-fold. The story is in-depth with a lot of substance. It's also a teaching experience. I finished with tears in my eyes, a filled heart and a mind enveloped in wonderment. This is, by far, one of the best games i have ever played. Outstanding !!",

            "review_text": "This game, has to be one of my all-time favorites, amazing world, amazing story, and one of the few times I've really cried during a video game and to that I say, just play it for yourself. But before you do play it, just some words of advice for you to get the most out of this game. You can complete this game just by finding these ribbons throughout the game, which kind of trivializes the entire experiences. There are optional puzzles in this game and they provide a lot of the story along with notes that you find throughout the world and both make the world feel as though it’s living and breathing. I encourage you if you want to truly fully experience this game, complete the side puzzles and read the little bits of exposition, and if you get stuck do not hesitate to look up a guide, I repeat DO NOT HESITATE TO LOOK UP A GUIDE to 100% this game. You get so much more out of the story, and trust me the story is amazing, it may seem nebulous at the beginning, but once you have all the info you can scrap from the world it all comes together in a beautiful narrative, that is really, really worth the time and effort. Also if you do 100% this game there is a second ending, and it adds to story just that much more and really makes you understand everything. Sometimes the puzzles while they are really interesting are just really obtuse, and don’t feel bad if you don’t get it, just try it out for yourself, and if you aren’t figuring it out, use a guide.   Also one big flaw with this game, there are some bugs in it, not like game crashes or graphical bugs, but things that won’t let you progress and you can’t seem to figure out why, like you just needed to re flip a lever to progress. For this, again, LOOK UP A GUIDE, a video guide may help a bit more here, but most of the time, you won’t be able to realize the bug, but once you see how things were really supposed to go you’ll be able to see what went wrong and how to fix it in game no problem.   All that said, if you like, say, old point and clicks, or games with really deep stories, than this game is a must, but even if you don’t like those kind of games but are still interested, than still try out this game, it may be an awesome experience for you. Really this game is amazing narratively, it's just a matter getting past the sometimes annoying quirks/bugs and getting past the sometimes fairly obtuse puzzles to enjoy the narrative fully.  TL;DR: This game is awesome, but take the time to 100% it, and DON’T BE AFRIAD TO LOOK UP A GUIDE, can’t stress this enough, but if you put in the time and effort the game will give back like no other.  EDIT: The Ether One Redux is included if you buy this game, which may fix some bugs and definitely will make the game run much better, as it now runs on a newer version of Unity than previously in the game. Now I can't confirm if this will fix the bugs in it since I have not played through the redux version.",

Its not all bad, the concept and ideas behind it are really interesting; the physical exploration of a troubbled mind, aided by a Stanley Parable-style voice over. Though when it comes to exploration and interface it all kinda goes down hill. It seems you spend the majority of your time hoarding useless items such as bottles and spanners in an attempt to 'trigger the subjects memory' - and I find it mind numbingly repetative.   After a while the story seems to become quite dry, the characters aren't developed amazingly and I begun to find it hard to care what happens next. Its a shame because the plot has enourmous potential. Maybe I havent given it enough time to develop in the coupple of hours that ive been playing, but I can't bare to carry on.   An interesting game, but in my opinion not worth the $14.99.",

            "review_text": "This game is something else let me tell you. Firstly, it is a very good game and worth the buy. I like to call it an extreme puzzle game. You can solve the main story / smaller puzzles very quickly. However, there are 20 extra puzzles you can try and fail and fail and fail and somehow magically succeed to put together. The puzzles don't really have hints. You just try a bunch of different things and throw it together. But it's new and frustrating and makes me want to rip my hair out while saying 'of course you write on the sheet of paper based on some other paper who may have read, of course.'   The difficulty of the puzzles adds so much to the game. You'll learn more about all the characters and even the town. There is notes you can read and collectibles you can find. The voice acting is great, the story is heartwarming at the same time heartbreaking. The graphics are superb, audio is wonderful and the different places are really cool to explore.  There are some downsides. For one, the game doesn't have enough music for me. Some will come on a play but that happens mostly when you're playing for the main part and not the side puzzles. Since I spent most of my 12 hrs on those puzzles, I needed to play music myself because I got bored. Another is the fact that the puzzles aren't thoroughly explained. It does give you a small tutorial but you really have to simply play for long periods of time to even get the gist of the side puzzles.   One part of the game I thought I would hate actually turned out a plus for me which is the inventory. You can only carry one object at a time but you can teleport back to a home base and store a ton of items. It became a sort of game. Filling each shelf with the same object I found through out the game. And it was really cool to see how those random objects came into the main story.   Yes, I fully recommend it for those who like a challenge and a very pretty game.",

The main storyline itself takes about 3-5 hours, depending on your pace, but if you do all the little extra things it takes quite a bit more. I do not think this game was boring at all. Sometimes frustrating, as all the puzzles aren't completely obvious, but I think that is what makes this game a truly great game. You actually have to think and recall things. They don't lead you around by your hand and make everything obvious. Throughout the game, I got both endings and all 20 projectors. I sincerely recommend everyone do the same. You get so much more of the story and a great feeling by the end of it. The only issue with this game I've seen is if you are trying to listen to the voice recordings for the projectors again, sometimes they don't play and you have to restart the game. I also heard of someone glitching through a gate they weren't supposed to be in and missing a part of the game so they had to go back. Otherwise, it is a fantastic game.",

The game simply sets you down in the world and lets you discover what you want to at your own pace. Each puzzle gives you small tidbits about the town and its inhabitants, allowing you to become as invested in the game as you want to be.

What's odd about Ether One is that it's obvious that a lot of love and devotion went into its craft. But while the love is clearly there, the execution (at least for me) is not.   Criticisms:",

I've not played a game this involving in a long time, and there are a lot of rightful favourable comparisons to Myst. Last night my brain actually tried to solve the mysteries and puzzles of Ether One in my dreams. I can't get it out of my head.

As someone with a loved one who had dementia, this was something that I could really empathise with. It gets pretty emotional at times, and there's a The Sixth Sense-esque twist in the middle that makes it even more endearing. Also the puzzles are really contrived and can get frustrating, which I like, but it's something you either will love or hate.  But this game has too many @*&amp;# bugs. I ran into at least three so far, and I had to either repeat things I already did to reset some programming, or load an old save and redo a half-hours worth of content. It's a shame really, because it breaks immersion in an otherwise immersive game. Also there's so much walking, and there's no run button. This would be fine if the levels weren't huge mazes with puzzles that involve you walking accross them MULTIPLE TIMES. Seriously most of this game was spent travelling accross the map in a slow walk, which just got boring after a while.",

My Top 5 all time includes Talos Principle, Mind: Path to Thalamus, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Portal 2, and, say, Naissancee. But this game is not up there, imho.    For me, it started out very well. I managed to solve riddles one by one using no walkthroughs. It felt natural and empowering. However, it got tougher. Much, much tougher. And I didn't want to go through without solving puzzles - which is an option in this game - because when you do, the game starts resembling Dear Esther, which I didn't like at all... But the main problem was the lack of motivation to press forward (i.e. to look for walkthroughs) to see what happens next. Maybe that's because I have no relatives with dementia, or maybe because I myself have it, I don't know ;)  Anyways, there were also graphics. Not impressive, imho. And incredibly slow. In the age of Ethan Carter, technical implementation like that does not deserve more than 5/10. And now it's redux (I played the original), so probably even slower (did not try).  That's more or less it. I agree with one of the reviewers that a somewhat simmilar Master Reboot is more engaging, even though the graphics there are actually even worse than in this game. Sure, if the price suits you, try it. Many people loved it, so maybe you will too.  p.s. I've played this game at least a few times longer than my Steam record suggests.

Now the puzzles are pretty difficult so if you like turning a lot of gears in your head, this game is perfect. Now if the puzzles turn you off that's okay because they're completely optional and the storyline alone (in my opinion) is worth the money if you get a good deal on it. Long review short: If you love the puzzle aspect with the story buy it full price if there's no deal. If you only want the story, buy it anyways when you see a good deal on it.

However, what I wasn't expecting was a thought-provoking and genuinely touching exploration on the issue of degenerative brain disorders. Sure the puzzles are sometimes a little too obscure for their own good, which leads to a bizarre sort of kleptomania where you end up picking up every single item you see in the hope that somehow that one shoe you found in that house might be able to open that door you've been struggling to get through in that factory. But, once the methods of puzzle progression becomes clear, the pace picks up and I found myself utterly immersed in the fiction before me.   A wonderful mixture of Science Fiction and psychological thriller/horror creates a game world where you're always second guessing everything you see and do. You are freely able to move between every zone of the game world and can return to do any of the puzzles that you possibly struggled with before. If you're not really 'feeling' the puzzles offered, you can actually ignore a large quantity and blast through the story. Completion of the puzzles does affect the story somewhat in ways I would prefer not to spoil, so I honestly think it's worth taking some time to do them.   The puzzles themselves vary in complexity, from simple fetch and place puzzles, to some really rather obscure ones that might have you reaching for the aid of a walkthrough. The game actually offers multiple routes to completion of some of the larger puzzles so using a walkthrough can be very handy to make sure you are at least thinking about the puzzle correctly. Sometimes the obscurity of the puzzles can seem a little....too much, but I recommend just going with it and treating it as a part of the narrative itself. The human mind is a complex thing, seems only apt for it to construct such complex puzzles ;-)  The story and game world for me are the main selling points for this game. Wonderfully atmospheric locales that are as creepy as they are strangely beautiful and serene - based just enough in reality to make the games many anomalies create a sense of unease. The story itself is wonderfully told and involving, with the many puzzles having a consequence on how and when details are revealed to the player. Thematically I was really rather moved by what White Paper games did with the story and the main revelations revealed throughout are as disturbing as they are beautiful.   Well worth the price of admission I'd say :-)",
