            "review_text": "Edge of Twilight- Return to glory, in many ways, reminds me of myself, because it is so full of potential. And the execution, while not terrible was a bit- just a bit, rushed.  You take the role of a 'hybrid'..an outcaste, who has some special abilities, is a bit of an witty ansewhole with a goldden heart etc etc, your usual video game plot.  The game world itself is imagined and designed well.  Having said that, I cannnot say that it isn't enjoyable. It is an enjoyable experience in some ways and the game needs improvement and polish in some other criterias.   It is a third person action game with hack and slash combat, minor puzzle and very minor platforming.     The gameplay",

            "review_text": "This game has a nice story, and the world is beautiful.  Other than that it's deeply broken. Almost nothing is interactive, theres only very basic controls and the camera angle is sickening and always rotating uncomfortably around (which means if you're running forward suddenly you're running backwards or sideways). It feels extremely unfinished.  On top of that, the audio of non-central characters is inconsistent and frankly appalling. The game itself freezes frequently and the code is right there on the screen almost the whole way through the section I played.  Pretty idea. Waste of time.",
