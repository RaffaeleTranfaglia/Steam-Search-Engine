Multiplayer adds a surprising amount of depth, although really it's just multiple people independently doing their thing. Mind games are a thing, even. Matchmaking is kinda busted. Even though there is ranking, you just get random people. But that's fun in its own way (unless you're just bad without any chance of improvement), because everyone can mess up.  ★★★★★★★☆☆☆",

Yes it has multiplayer, the goal is simple, you need to wait for someone getting pwnd by his/her own tree.  Don't give this game to kids.  8/10 Tree is destroying my A|D.",
