If you already own the original go ahead and download it if you want but expect many issues like crashing. Make sure you save often and i mean often. Because you don't want to crash and lose all of your progress. Some users have reported losing saves entirely, so be wary. If you don't own the original then don't bother until they fix the current issues. I can't recommend this game currently even if its free. Its a half ♥♥♥ port with issues galore.",

As far as this being a 'remastered' and definitive version of the game, this release is a complete joke. My main gripe is the mouse accelleration/decelleration which, for a pc release is very hamfisted, along with the poorer quality audio. I am aware that people are finding ways to resolve some of the issues of the game however I am going to wait until these 'updates' that the 2k people have mentioned are released.  It is my opinion that the sole purpose of all these remasters lately is to resell older games on the xbox one/playstation 4 and that these releases on the pc are just an afterthought.  A great game, but in this state, I do not recomend.",

            "review_text": "  While this 'Remastered' release of the original Bioshock offers features such as developer commentary and a small 'museum' that offers a quick peek at some of the concepts thrown around during development, the game itself is poorly optimized for PC. Somes issues already noted include surround sound being unavailable (and the sound overall being very poor with audio files being played at improper levels or areas relative to where the player is), mouse acceleration being janky and unreliable, and graphical issues abound. Worse yet is a large number of crashes which may result in settings being reset to default, prematurely ending any difficulty run one may be having, and potentially erasing any number of save files one had made. While one may avoid a certain number of these issues by playing on a gamepad as I myself do, you will still face the possibility of ingame crashes, save file deletion and a host of issues that, while may not prevent you from completing the game, are disappointing to see in what is considered a 'remastered' version of the first game.  While somes issues persist from the original release of Bioshock, the reliance most PC'ers have on tinkering with the ini file of ports is theorized to only further increase the possibility of the game crashing.   Keep in mind that this is a 'Remastering' of an already released game, it is hard to judge this product based on features already present in the original and harder not to judge the game based on what was or was not improved over the original. This game does very little to alter the experience of the original Bioshock, and on top of featuring several issues that were in the version released several years ago, this new edition brings several more issues of its own.  Because of this, I feel people should at least be aware of these issues before making a purchase, if this is your first time playing Bioshock, I would recommend at least considering simply sticking with the original until this game is patched. Because this is a 'remastering' of an already released game and not a new game itself, I will have to give it a thumbs down as I see little reason to play this over the older version available on the store. You will miss out on no gameplay content by avoiding this version.  I have no issue with Bioshock or the developers of this 'remastering'. I will be playing the game regardless of its flaws and am grateful that I did not have to purchase this for owning the original version of the game. However, price does not erase flaws, and those who might feel it 'petty' to criticize a game that one obtained for free should understand that developers are not children that need to be coddled. Anyone that truly puts time, effort and care into a product, would not want it to be anything but the best that it could potentially be. That is not to say, that this, or any other review are gods gift to earth, but feedback, helpful or not, is always worthwhile and should not be shied away from.",

            "review_text": "  I tend to write in-depth reviews where I firstly discuss briefly what the game is about, followed by my thoughts on all of its aspects. However, with this one in particular, it is going to be a different approach as I have this strong urge to express myself entirely from a technical standpoint instead, since I deem it more appropriate. As a result, I am going to avoid going through the story and explaining the mechanics of the game as that is not my intention here.  To get it out of the way, Bioshock 1 remains a timeless classic, even with some of its rough edges and streamlined gameplay compared to System Shock 2. However, this remaster for PC, mind you, left me with a sour taste in my mouth to say the least. Initially, I did not want to trust the 'Mixed' reviews on Steam at first, although having played for a few hours now, I have got to agree with the majority for the time being. Here is why.  Firstly, my first surprise was noticing the lack of extensive graphical settings compared to the original version, which for starters, boggles my mind without a doubt. The only critical things you could change are your screen resolution (which is fairly limited), anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing and toggling an 'Expanded FOV' which I do not even know by how much it exactly improves the FOV (a slider would have been far more useful if you bother to implement a FOV option in the first place). Consequently, I decided to modify the configuration file stored in one the folders and tried to manually force the graphical settings I desired. However, by doing so, it caused the game to have insane pop-ins which nullified all my previous efforts, so I abandoned that tactic. Nevertheless, I eventually accepted that I had to live with these limited settings given and moved on.   From then on, things went smoothly the first two hours or so, and revisiting Rapture for the nth time still felt somehow invigorating, until the game experienced its first crash. This incident was triggered by wanting to play one of the discovered Golden Reels (unlockable documentary videos) straightaway, rather than afterward by accessing it through the main menu. For the record, Bioshock 1 is not a game which I would recall requiring you to manually save constantly considering it is not extremely challenging at normal difficulty, and thanks to Vita Chamber devices (sort of like checkpoints), you do not have to travel back for long distances to where you died. Thus, as a consequence of not manually saving at the right time and place before the crash, I lost about an hour of gameplay. Again, I accepted this misfortune and did a speedrun of the already visited section. Now, you know that saying “lightning never strikes the same place twice”? Well, that is almost a lie. In my case, I experienced two more crashes later on in the game; one during a loading screen which was loading the next segment of the game, Neptune's Bounty, and one when I opened up the main menu to fiddle about with some settings. Whilst throughout these two crashes I did not lose as much progress as I did the first time around, it made me paranoid and annoyed. For a remastered game, crashes like these should not be present in a version which pretends to be a superior than its original counterpart, especially when I personally never experienced a single crash in any of my playthroughs of the original game.  Furthermore, I would like to point out that, based on my own observations and deductions, I ultimately realised nothing was done to improve the 'clunkiness' of the combat nor fix much of the technical issues which were present in the original version. I think the only big change which I did observe is that the ragdoll and object physics are not capped at 30FPS any longer, so I guess that is something after all. Simply put, at its core, it plays exactly like the original version, which, at the time of writing this, is 9-years old. Things like mouse acceleration/smoothing still being present with no way to simply disable it aside from accessing the configuration file is a shame. Hence, if you are one of those who felt the gameplay mechanics of the original felt somewhat sluggish or clunky at times, the remastered version will not attempt to change your opinion. On the other hand, if you are one of those who had no issues with them in the first place, then you will definitely feel at home here.   In the end, the point I am really trying to make here is that I could not care less for the extra algae and fishes they might have added here and there to show how much more stuff this version can render now, or any other small tweaks and enhancements done to in-game models, but the new version we received here is not a remaster in the proper sense. You see, at least for me, a remaster should be considered as one which fixes and/or polishes both the gameplay and visual experiences. Instead, this version has done half the job, especially for a PC port. This is no more than a retexture mod with some improved lighting effects. But even these graphical enhancements are pretty marginal when compared to the original version. Practically, those who are going to benefit and get out the most from this “remastered” version are the current console users rather than the PC users.  In conclusion, aside from Steam achievements and cloud-saving, you will not be missing out much by not playing this “remastered” version and booting up the original version instead. In case the brand new commentaries, found only in this version, might have been one of your incentives to try out this one, do no fret; they will be up on YouTube soon, anyway. Now, at the end of the day, you will still be experiencing pretty much Bioshock 1 in its entirety, but I personally cannot recommend this “remaster” over the original on the PC. Even though, like the majority, I got this version for free for already owning the original in my Steam library, it is a shoddy port, through and through, and I do not want to beat around the bush. So please understand that I am thumbing it down more due to the fact that this port deserved a whole lot better than what we got in the end, considering the status of the franchise. If things get fixed in time (most likely) and new options get implemented (hopefully) that make the original version obsolete, I will change this to a positive review.  Here is one last thing. By buying the game now, you will also receive a free copy of the original version, which is a nice gesture by the publisher. So, now consider the aforesaid issues with the current “remastered” version for a second. This begs the question:  What was the point of a remaster in the first place then? Especially if you are still going to own the original too.",

I hate to give it a bad review, because it's one of my favorite games of all time, and as a previous owner I got it free. However, the game is unplayable for me. Textures and objects flash in and out of existance. Entire walls are gone until you angle your camera just right, stairs, railings, etc making it hard to navigate around the world. There is extreme screen tearing, lights are flashing(ones that shouldn't be) all over the place.  There is still a problem with mouse acceleration. This can be disabled in the game .ini files, but this has been remastered, why wasn't the option just added into the menu? The game is borderline unplayable on PC because the acceleration is so heavy and many people don't realize there is a way to disable it. I was really hoping a lot of the previous issues had been fixed, but they haven't and there are new ones introduced on top of them. For the time being I can't recommend that anyone pay for this game. It's an amazing game, but it's not enjoyable in this state. Hopefully it will be patched soon, because I'm looking extremely forward to playing through it again.",

It's noticeable that they did quite a bit of retexturing, but that's pretty much the full extent of their work. Same low-quality sound. Same old somewhat awkward animations. Same old weird non-reflective, plasma-looking water aesthetic. Same old excessive use of bloom to compensate for the lack of other visual effects. Same old bugs, and a few new ones. Hell, some parts of the game aren't even retextured. And even if you could possibly be satisfied with an incomplete retexture, you'll later realize that an enthused fan could have made a better retexture mod for Skyrim than a 2K-funded studio.  In conclusion: The only new things about this remaster are the bugs.  Edit: After looking at screenshot comparisons, there is a possibility that there are some instances in which the originals look better than their respective remasters.  Some might think I have no reason to complain, since I technically got this for free. But to be honest, you'd probably have a better experience playing the original than the remaster. So for those who did not get this for free: Don't buy the game; You'd be better off with the original even if it cost you $5 more. To those who got this for free: Just play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ original.",

So naturally I was heaps excited for this remaster when it was announced and even more excited when I heard I was getting it for free.  I started this game up with hopes of greatness and an awesome experience, the same I had from 9 years ago on this games release. So this writting this review is very saddening as I REALLY wanted and hoped this remaster would be great.. but unfortunally it is not.  I started playing, I went through the inital start of the game (the crash, the swim and getting the wrench) and it really impressed me, the graphics were somewhat better and the game ran heaps more smoother on Win10. I continued through the game and the flaws started popping up left, right and center. The lighting in the game would look spectacular if there wasn't screen tears everytime you gazed upon it. I experienced missing textures and squares of nothing but black.  I continued playing but I was stopped by a game bug that I cannot pass, Cobb sends splicers after you but after you slaughter them.. the game just sits there, you cannot continue on the quest as the game just stops and you're left walking around a hall. This has stopped me in my tracks and I cannot possibly finish the game until it is patched out.   I have no idea what the hell happened but 2K mananged to release this game broken and somewhat worse than they did 9 years ago, as this remaster stands today.. it's a mess and I highly recommend buying the original over this remaster. Save yourself the $20 they're asking for it.   I will edit this when they patch the game, and I hope they can pursade me to change this negative review into a possitive one.   - Jack.  Edit: Just finished the main campaign and I have to say, I forgot that I was playing a remaster around three hours in. The graphics just weren't that much of an approvement. Disappointing. And I did run into a couple annoying glitches, such as one where when you're protecting a little sister she didn't move and you had to restart your save... kinda annoying. I still stand by my statement, you might as well buy the original and not this remaster.   Running on GTX970, i76400k and Windows 10.",

Which is fine, because once game/achievement breaking bugs are done away with, this game is a damn fine remaster.   While it took a little time to give the PC version of this game some much-needed polish and bug-fixing, Bioshock is back, and it's better than ever before. For the unitiated, Bioshock is an FPS with some RPG elements set in the utopia-turned-dystopia world of Rapture. Your job as a new crash-landed arrival is to work your way to the depths of the city, fighting off the insane denizens with everything between gunplay with a variety of weapons ranging from pistols to flamethrowers, exotic powers like chucking lightning bolts or mind-controlling your enemies, and even turning the city's security systems such as turrets and mini-gun drones against itself.  Such a variety of ways of tackling each problem is perhaps what makes this game so much fun, since these abilities can be mixed and matched to come up with your playstyles. Sure, you simply shoot a Big Daddy until he goes down, but where's the fun in that? Lure him in front of your hacked turrents, landmines or even flammable oil piles; set him up with a lightning bolt and then chuck a rocket in his face while he's stunned for massively increased damage; summon decoys and mind-control other enemies into distracting him while you snipe him from afar: the possibilities are almost endless.  The story and setting of this game are also done very well, though you're not neccesarily obligated to care, since most of the story is laid out in dairy recordings that can either be collected or ignored. Still, every area has a story to tell if you can to notice the detail. Without spoiling anything, there's also a nasty shock near the end of the game which I consider to be one of the finest deconstructions of a typical video game trope I've ever seen.  One criticism for the game, however, is that the hacking puzzles become tedious after a while. This CAN be circumvented in certain ways (namely using items or even just opting to not hack every single turret), though it's still brings the pacing to a halt every now and then. Still, in the times where you have to backtrack somewhat, it's quick satisfying to see the machines you've already hacked taking out freshly spawning enemies for you.  If you've already played the original Bioshock, well, it's still worth a look since you'll have this game for free. If not, this game is definately worth a look if you care at all for the FPS genre. ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Original Review:    When you remaster a game, you are supposed to do more than give it a graphical facelift, add a challenge mode and call it a day. The number of bugs and instability glitches on this is unbelieveable, and they get worse over time. Seriously, how in almost a whole decade did you guys not have time to iron out basic problems like 'don't reset all the settings to default randomly'?  Even though I got this game for 'free' due to owning a copy of the original, the problems are unacceptable. I will happily change this review when the problems are fixed, but for now? Fix yo' ♥♥♥♥, 2K.",

Now let me start by praising the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of Bioshock as a game... it's godly, sure, it has its issues, but it was a 'game changer' in the medium itself, it refreshed peoples minds and brought inspiration to tons of developers.  This version however... lets get started.  It has almost all of the original issues as the original PC port of Bioshock had, as a remaster, it fails almost completely in the technical department. It now has an FOV option... sort of, (It's a toggle on/off) and it once again fails to remove mouse acceleration! But other than that, I didn't notice anything else, however, I'm not aware of all the bugs the original had, so I could be slightly wrong. (But you get the point)  Thing is... that'd be somewhat okay, if it didn't add it's own bugs to top them off! Texture pop-in, multiple crashes and it even managed to resize my desktop icons! I honestly have no clue how that happened, it boggles the mind.  In trade, we get beautiful redesigned visuals. Textures are improved, although you're not likely to notice them through your nostalgia tinted goggles, what you will notice though are the extra touches! Flora, lighting and even a ♥♥♥♥ing whale! It comes a lot closer to their orignal design, which is amazing!  We also get age old DLC that was already available for consoles, because of course, ♥♥♥♥ PC.  All in all... play the original! The added bugs and general performance does not equally trade for the good looks. Unless you're really into developer commentary and general knowledge of game development, stick with the original.

It plays totally fine with a keyboard &amp; mouse and ran smooth throughout my playtime. I'm not sure how much better this looks than the original 2007 release as I haven't played that version in a long time, but while it's visiuals do show some age, the game does look good and still retains the strong art direction and atmopshere it always had.  In my experience with the remaster, I encountered a handful of audio bugs where dialouge would skip and stutter, which I don't recall happening in the original whatsoever, but each instance would correct itself after a few seconds. I also had the game crash twice, one of which resulted in an hour of lost progress I was forced to replay.  My biggest issue with Bioshock Remastered is that some aspects of it are not optimzied as well as they should be. The game does not auto-detect your montior's resolution, defaulting instead to the highest possible setting it offers regardless of your setup, which for me resulted in all the icons and windows open on my desktop to be wildly shifted around so I was forced to repostion them every time I quit the game. And both times the game crashed, all my chosen graphical settings were reset, causing the problem to worsen. In 2016, and with a game that's almost a decade old, the remaster simply shouldn't have these problems.  I'm giving this game a recommendation because it's Bioshock and overall the game ran and worked fine for me. But the issues stated above were annoyances that should have been ironed out before release. This is a game you should play, but depending on how you feel about the above issues I stated, you may want to wait for a patch first.",

The only improvement seems to be in the physics engine department, since this now runs as fast as your framerate instead of being locked to 30fps. On the other hand there's a mod that fixes this already in the original BioShock. So why play the remaster instead of the original? The texture and model upgrades aren't bad in many cases, but some questionable choices have been made there as well. Not fixing the crashing issues as well as the wonky mouse controls is rather disappointing. It's nice that it's free for people who already owned BioShock, but what use is it if the game doesn't even run properly.",

I really hoped that this remaster would bring more life to an already masterpiece of work, but it doesn't as I'm currently unable to play and enjoy it due to the blackscreen bug.  So I suggest the OG version instead, until this 'remaster' is fixed.  Until then I'll have to give this a 0/10.  I notice people are saying 'You should be thankful it's free or it's free what does it matter'  Just because it's free shouldn't excuse it from being a broken mess along with it's original bugs and glitches that should've been fixed 9 years ago.  And it's not even close to being called a 'remaster', it's slight at best.  Halo:CE:A is a real remaster and it still uses it's original game engine with a whole fresh coat of paint on it with added bonuses like the ability to switch to OG version and back to remaster at the press of a button while playing ingame.  Bioshock:R uses it's original game engine with slight mods to it's textures and somehow has less options for graphics, after 9 years this is the best they could do?   How come Bioshock:R isn't like Halo:CE:A?  It's a cheap money grab for consoles that's a bad PC port at best.  I'm sorry but there just isn't any excuse for this, free or not.",

Resolution selections above 1920x1080 is rather sad, where you can get around that by editing the game setting files, but for a novice that's not an option.

Even then the game still suffers from most the bugs it had in 2007.   Whilst the new textures are nice, I am having terrible issues with some of them taking forever to pop in, with only blurred messes being viewable. Bear in mind that my computer is no potato (4690k, 24gb ram, 780ti). An example of this is when the plane's tail crashes into the tunnel. The plane's tail looked like it had passed through Half-Life on the way down, as it was a blurry mess, the texture for it eventually popped in, but only after about 10 seconds. Also bear in mind that I have the game on a 128GB SSD, so loading times for the textures should not be an issue.  Also some of the splicer's shadows appear to be missing or bugged as when I got the the pram with the revolver in it, the splicer had no shadow on the wall to the left, which was in the original. When she moved, a massive black square appeared on the wall for a moment, which leads me to believe the shadows are bugged for me in some way. When the splicers were breaking though the glass at the end of the level, only 2 of the splicers had shadows, the other splicer only had a rectangular shadow.  I have also had issues with sounds. The menu music and introductory cutscene's audio sounded awful, and some sounds in game cut out. This may be attributed to my ancient audio card (Audigy 2 ZS), but I have noticed that others are also having this problem. I can recommend a program called Creative ALchemy, which fixed sounds on the original, so if you are having issues with this game and your Creative soundcard, give it a try, as it fixed the sounds cutting out for me.  I can't really recommend this at the moment, it is less stable than the original and in some cases looks and sounds worse.",

Bioshock is a very good game, but the 'Remastered' ruined the whole experience. If they gonna create a remake, might as well make a good job out of it. This is not. It destroyed the franchise instead.  Broken graphic when suddenly the graphic turns to hell. Game stuttered throughout the experience. Movement is broken (it feels like suddenly you are walking very slow and then everything speed up again). A lot of bug in game, some of them is so severe a bug.  I found two major bug in the game that prevented me from proceeding with the game. The first bug appeared during the map where you need to get the camera for the dude. After showing the camera, the dude suppose to open the door for me to proceed to the next stage. Guess what, nothing happens! The door won't open, and I was stuck. I was able to fix that bug by just suicide myself and respawn at V-Chamber. I tried suicide 10 times, and it was successful at the 10th time.   Second bug is the one I am currently experiencing, and I can't proceed with the story because of it. It happens at Arcadia after finishing the Lazarus Vector mission. The enemy supposed to appear at the Lab and I need to fight them to proceed. Guess what, after the enemy force-open the door, there is not a single enemy there! And what am I suppose to do? I tried doing everything, including suicide a thrillions time, and even invoke Big Daddy and let him rampage and kill me. Still stuck. I reinstall the game, still stuck. Can't get on with the game. Couple of people experienced the same proble as me, and still cannot find the solution.  This is the worst Remastered ever. Is this like Early Access? More like Alpha stage of the game.  Lucky for me, I got this game for free so it saves me from the pain of buying.  For those who planned on getting the game, I'm telling you now. Spare yourself a money and get other games better. This is like a perfectly broken game, unfit to play. If you still really want to play BioShock, go with the original version and not the remastered. At least you won't get annoyed by broken graphics and bug that not allow you to proceed with the game.  I'm annoyed, and stuck with the game, and don't know what to do anymore.

Everything else works flawlessly except that the aimming with mouse feels a bit weird. Nothing too bad just an odd feeling to it that you just need to get used to. Runs at 4k 60fps max settings using SLI GTX 980.  Graphics: I played BioShock twice back on PS3 and never really played it on PC except for now with the Remastered Version. The games look so much better. Textures are great and character models are amazing. They are not 2016 standerds but they are a great remastered graphics of an old game.  The Game: I'm sure you've heard that BioShock 1 is an amazing game and it is. Even though I played the games many times before, I had so much fun playing it and can still say this is an amazing and fun game with great story and atmosphere and it's way better than the latest BioShock.  If you haven't played BioShock 1 before, you should get this. Just be warned that many people are experiencing technical issues and you might become on of them. Yes, this port is Console sided but it worked perfectly for me and enjoyed every moment of it (Except when I die without saving and cant use Vita-Chambers cuz of achievements &gt;.&lt;)  Hope this little review helps you \\(^o^)/  Now would you kindly go to Ryan's office and kill that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥?",

I ended up uninstalling the remasters and just breaking down and buying Bioshock: The Collection on Xbox One. I have already spent over 7 hours in the truly remastered Bioshock without no problems. The Xbox One makes it a truly wonderful experience. Oddly, the splicers still die in the same weird ways (and twitching like Max Headroom) as in the original.  The one good thing about Xbox One and PS4 is that EVERYONE is running the same graphic processors so the game is optimized perfectly for the hardware.  No keyboard support BUT no problems either.

Overall I can understand why this has so many negative reviews, 2k gave the finger to PC users and made a lame port. I don't care what you read, it ABSOLUTELY looks better. Mainly in three ways. The first being all animations are now rendered at 60fps. Meaning when a splicer's lifeless corpse hits the ground after you smack him with your wrench, he doesnt look like he's stuttering. The second, and most underwhelming, is the lighting. Honestly, the lighting is hardly different from the original. BUT, the volumetric rays have been vastly improved. and no, this is not something to get really excited about, but I am noting it because it is an upgrade. Lastly and most impressively, is the textures. I am still drooling over the shotgun and admiring the wrench, with the (EXTREMELY LIMITED) settings maxed out, it is hard to see any textures that are displeasing to me. You can find them, but you have to look for it. Playing the game normally, I dont think you will notice. To be honest, I would buy the original BioShock for twenty dollars, and this game is an improvement. Please dont dislike this because you are salty about 2k giving us a s**tty port. Because I am too. But you guys put up with all of this for the original game, which is no different now except this one looks better. So if you got a free upgrade, it can't be worse.

I understand he was so awful that he decided he would rather end his pitiful existence. I probably would have done the same.  Do yourself a favor and play the original one. Better sound, more advanced functionalities, and less bugs.",

I was able to play this game without any crashes – but that’s not to say without issues. There were issues: the lighting effects would flicker and roll on occasion, there were issues with some of the audio logs, where upon listening to them, the track would repeat the first second of the track about 5 or 6 times before it would straighten out on its own, and there were some intermittent texturing issues where items floating in the water would turn into red, pixelated blocks, and some consumable items would blink when approaching them.   Because of this, my feelings towards the remaster are mixed. I wouldn’t actually call this a remaster either as much as I would call it a reskinning of key things: the woodgrain on tables, curvature on rounded surfaces, etc. all look better than the original, but the lighting/shadowing and textures have all seemingly remained the same. Fixtures and weapons that lacked texture in the original could have looked amazing if texture was added – but it wasn’t. Because of this, some things look smoothed out, but still generic. Characters like splicers, little sisters, etc. look as though they have been unchanged. I’m not sure if this was deliberate or not (as not to upset fans of the original). I did like the addition of the director’s commentary film reels that could be found in the game, but other than that, there isn’t much for returning players to look forward to. I can’t complain though, because this was a free game which worked well for me. On the other hand, if I had paid for it, I would be disappointed in both the lack of changes and the technical problems.   At the end of the day, the remaster is the equivalent to a new set of wheels on an old car: it can’t hide the age, and the new addition isn’t going to mean anything to you if it can’t run. I was lucky enough that I was able to play without crashing using Windows 10, 64bit – and I play on a modest, AMD processor/Asus motherboard combo with an Asus GeForce 660 video card from a few years ago. But with hundreds of negative reviews based upon playability problems, I would say that if you don’t currently own the title, you may want to wait until the majority of problems have been addressed.",

Some people can't even start the game and for some absurd reason you need to edit the .ini file to get 5.1 sound.   They had the perfect apportunity to release the perfect game on Pc by just adjusting some minor bugs and they failed and added some more. I hope they'll fix those little problems but I'm afraid that, as always, Pc will get the inferior version.   To all people arguing that the game is free, not everyone had the original games on STEAM and new players, as old ones, deserve to get a game with updated standards.  edit: they are working to fix the main problems with this release.

I have just comleted the game without to many problems; only one crash and only a few times where i had to go back to the config files (user.ini) to edit and fix the settings to how i wanted it.

And nine years on, the opportunity to explore under the sea has arisen again.  Bioshock Remastered is a free re-release of the original Bioshock for PC players who own the original game on steam. It was overseen by the studio Blind Squirrel Games and involves a revamp of the original game’s graphics and performance, as well as a new series of documentaries titled ‘Imagining Bioshock’ that explore the creation of the game with original key developers.  Considering the original game is now edging on ten years old, its a testament to how incredibly revolutionary was that it still holds up. The story follows protagonist Jack when his plane crashes into the ocean in 1960, only for him to discover a mysterious and derelict underwater city run by the enigmatic Andrew Ryan. This city, Rapture, is the soul of what makes Bioshock so incredible. Not only is it an amazing setting for a game, its created through world design that was unparalleled at the time of release. The cracking hull of Rapture is an intensely creepy and atmospheric setting. Mysterious shadows creep up the walls, water leeks across the floor, and its horrific citizens fill the air with blood-curling screeches of pain and madness. Its a place that is clearly descending into hell, and manages to convey so much with saying very little. Environmental storytelling is the main device that original developer Irrational Games utilised to tell its compelling narrative, and its astonishing how much story they can create from something as little as a tape, a teddy bear and a body in a drain. To put it simply, Rapture quite literally drips with story and is at the crux of what makes Bioshock so special.  The other pillar of the Bioshock experience, the gameplay, obviously cannot live up to the storytelling side but still manages to be compelling enough to happily see you through the 12 hour campaign. Jack uses many different methods to get through the treacherous corridors of Rapture, including basic gunplay with standard first-person shooter weapons, as well an assortment of different genetic abilities known as Plasmids. The gunplay, particularly after the progress videogames have made forward in the last 10 years, doesn’t hold up incredibly well. Its still enjoyable enough, but lacks the weight and punch expected from a modern FPS. This shortcoming is luckily covered by the Plasmids however, as they not only allow you to mix up combat in interesting ways, such as with lightning, telekinesis and hypnosis, but also add some much needed dynamism to the gameplay outside of filling enemies with lead. Outside of basic combat, there’s also the need to hack machines and explore the environment that must be contended with. The mini-game used to hack is simple, but effective and never gets old enough to the point that it becomes frustrating. The exploration of the environment on the contrary is a complete delight, as Bioshock‘s level design is comfortably on par with its setting. Each section of Rapture is distinct and offers many branching paths and hidden corners to explore.  So while its been established that the ‘Bioshock‘ part of the titled is incredible, its unfortunately the ‘Remastered‘ aspect that drags the overall product down. To get the good things out of the way, Blind Squirrel Games did a decent job improving the graphics to a solid level, and the additional documentary is likely to be fascinating for new and old fans alike. However, its the technical support on that is legitimately disappointing. At launch, the game missed a number of significant graphic’s features, several key resolutions and suffered from a whole swarm of frustrating bugs. Granted, many of those issues were fixed in a patch released almost a month later, but even after that I still continued to suffer from frustratingly frequent crashes to desktop. I estimate that I lost almost two hours of gameplay to lax saving and a subsequent crash. Its genuinely disappointing considering the quality of the game itself, and makes this remaster feel more like a cash-grab than a loving re-release of a modern classic.  That being said, this is still the best way to experience this masterpiece of game design. Certainly the technical side is a let down, but the sheer quality and richness of the experience on hand almost makes trudging through the bugs and crashes worthwhile. If you haven’t dived into Bioshock before, would you kindly purchase this remaster, because everyone deserves to go on this incredible journey under the sea.

            "review_text": "  Edit: I am still hopeful that this game will be patched to a playable state, but right now I would suggest that you wait until it is patched or someone finds a fix for the crashing issue this game has.  I was excited for this game because I wanted to be able to replay it on the PC with achievements,   something which I can now do and so I am a very happy camper  . I was willing to buy this game when it was announced, so the fact that I got it for free due to owning the previous version was a very nice surprise.  I did need to find a work around for it's glaring crashing issue though before I got the happy place that I am in now.  Like I said: this game did crash, a lot. I couldn't even get halfway through Welcome to Rapture. The crashes were especially frustrating because when trying to resume from my previous save I found that my difficulty setting was reset to default along with the Vitachambers Disabled option would be switched to off, that would make beating the game on Survival difficulty without dying incredibly difficult. I came across a post by Brad in steam discussions which suggested this as a fix: 'Go to properties in the bioshock.exe and [select the] 'run as administrator' and 'run in 640 X 480 screen resolution'[options], don't worry this will only effect your desktop resolution and not in-game [resolution].' He suggests launching the game only from the .exe, however I have been gutsy and risked my save by launching through steam a few times afterwards with no ill effects.  I understand everyone's disappointment for the lack of adjustment options from the menu, however it is my understanding you can still go to the .ini and change the options which you would like to change- should that be necessary in 2016? No, definitely not. But that isn't going to stop me from recommending this game to someone because they have to go and manually change an option this way.  There are a couple other bugs which the community seems to be reporting such as missing textures and audio issues, I can't say that I have experienced these and I can only hope that a patch is released which fixes these problems.  Overall my experience in game has been a good one, and I recommend anyone wishing to (re)visit Rapture give this version a try; the extra polish is a nice touch and mostly understated so it still feels like the Bioshock I love and remember.

Clearly botched the menu, removing the good from the old menu . And the display section is a cruel joke, compared to the prior one, not to mention it fails to save all settings properly.

I say wait until this gets addressed and fixed. Irrational Games, Ken Levine or whoever was behind the release of the 'Remastered Collection', would you kindly release some patches to fix these errors? We need patches for this and we need them as soon as possible.",

And the game play is really good because of the plasmids they are a cool addition and my favourite one is the one where you shoot BEES!! but it really changes up stuff like you can synergies some plasmids with weapons. But I have some problems with this game like it's crashes frequently and the game only auto saves at every area so one time I played for an hour and the game crashes I have to do all that again but luckily you can manually save the game so just save offen. My second problem with this games is the hacking so in the games you can hack objects then they will help you because normally they will attack you so you have to do this mini game where water is going through the pipes and you have to lead it to the end but it gets so tedious later on in the game and you have to do for each one.

I really felt like this plot was almost a complete afterthought once I started the actual gameplay, which feels like it has no weight, it just feels floaty. Most other FPS games you feel like you are doing more than pushing buttons when your character is firing a gun or casting a spell or whatever. I also feel like the use of the vita chambers, as the game calls them, they're just spawn points if you die, take away any insentive to NOT die. If you want to conserve items and you're near a vita chamber just whip out the wrench and run at whatever you want to kill screaming until you die, rinse repeat. You'll be brought right back to the vita chamber in the area where any enemy you didn't kill is right there with whatever health they have left.  I am going to finish this game and depending on that I may change my review, delete this one, or write a new one all together.  tl;dr feels forced, fart/love/games if you have to force it, it's probably ♥♥♥♥",

This review is accounting for the first and second patch that was released on October 7 2016 and December 20th 2016. This current December 20th 2016 patch has fixed many of the previous bad changes introduced in the Remastered version.  I am incredibly happy that 2K responded to my emails about the FOV scale, and HUD font size problems, and managed to fix both of those problems with this December 20th 2016 patch.  Although many people are still experiencing crashes, and various other problems. I hope 2K and the developers keep releasing patches to fix many of the fans problems with the Remastered versions.  I also know this is a free upgrade, but this does not make it impervious to criticism, nor does it make the remastered any better. I would've paid for a proper Remaster of the original Bioshock and Bioshock 2.  I would love to recommend this game, but due to many players still experiecing crashes, I can't recommend this game until it's stable and fully reliable.",

Unfortunately, it might as well be a rerelease of the same game, as some strange things have been left untouched. The hacking is still worthless and boring, the sound quality is all over the place (the guns sound low-quality but the filters on story dialogue have been reworked???), and the gunplay still feels very squishy. I also had a weird glitch where with a controller plugged in, the game worked with WASD but camera only worked with R-stick.  But the story, gameplay, and aesthetic of this game are worth it alone. Don't go in expecting a totally reworked visual experience, and you'll find yourself enjoying BioShock Remastered. It's also awesome that B1 owners got the Remaster for free, as I'd feel a bit ripped off if the game I rebought was THIS similar.  Also, enable V-Sync, as a change they made to the visuals with flashing lights causes some visual effects to flicker in awkward patterns if you run this game at a higher framerate than your monitor.
