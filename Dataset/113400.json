Then there will be days were nothing is going right, and you’re wondering why you ever tried the game out in the first place. I can’t tell you if it’s a good game or not, that’s your decision as a person. What I can tell you is this. If you go into the game expecting to win a lot and go super saiyan you’re in for a load of hurt. But if you go in to the game just to have some fun or blow off some time, who knows you might be in for a surprise. Yes winning is a lot more fun than loosing but winning isn’t everything.

Character customization reaches a whole new level with their persona, outfit, vehicle, and symbol editors and the maps themselves are created with great detail.  Though the game can be difficult to learn at first, as the mechanics are quite different from most other open-world shooters, and the Armas Marketplace suffers from the same tragically over-inflated prices that most Free to Play games tend to this is a very solid game with a lot to offer. Action is always guaranteed and with plenty of unlocks and mission types you're sure to find yourself unable to walk away easily.",

            "review_text": "Figure its time for an update, I started playing apb about 2 years ago and in that time have put in around 4000 hours of gameplay. I really do enjoy this game and I feel people deserve an unbiased opinion before trying it out. So I present both positive and negative points here.   First lets talk about hackers, everybody says hackers this hackerst that. No. period. Yes like any online game there is hackers, lets take any given day though, I do around 25-40 missions on any given day, maybe one or two of those missions will have a hacker in them. In fight club its a bit different, there is no missions its just the same stuff over and over kinda an easy place to farm kills close quarters and stuff so hackers go in there and use an aimbot but again thats not an all the time thing its just something that happens because hey its an online game.   Next lets talk about 'Pay 2 Win' some don't know the actual meaning of that phrase so im going to explain, P2W means that you can pay cash money for an instant advantage over others in game. Now to some extent I guess you could say its pay to win in that manner, the actual cash shop 'Armas Marketplace' has various things, cars, guns, etc. The difference is you can buy them account bound, say you buy a 3 slot gun (slots being open for modifications that change guns ie: mag pull allows you to reload faster at the cost of a set ammount of ammo being short from the clip, where as extended mags has more ammo to a clip but takes longer to reload. They are unlocked in game and cant be used until you hit rank 40 which takes about a day or two) and you got it account bound, well you could have this gun with 3 slots on it on a new character, but that doesnt change much, all guns that you can get from armas marketplace are either reskins (same mechanics as the normal gun just different look and sound ultimately feeling different but having no advantage over the original gun) of the guns in game or they are available to buy with joker tickets which can be earned by doing daily activities and playing in fight club. Or you could buy a car, say you play as a criminal but you want a car from the enforcer faction such as the Jericho, you can buy that on armas with 4 slots and drive it on your criminal. There is also clothing packs/items and weapon skins/camos available but none of this changes the base of the game, however the game does have premium on armas marketplace as well which all that does is give a substantial increase to money and exp gain as well as allow you to have up to i think 100 symbols per item (not sure i dont customize often) set your clan name as a title so people can see it easier, and lowers the cool down on your active character mod by one minute. I personally have around 2,000$ (two thousand) in my account because its what i enjoy so I support them and will continue to. I have i think 35-40 account bound guns, most of the clothing packs, key to the world, key to the city, and almost every car as a 4 slot through armas on my main character.   Moving on, next topic, the game engine is currently unreal engine 2 but they have been working on a new engine for a few years and it is almost ready for release, read into it more on the forums and blog posts.   Customization, its a big deal in apb and I have honestly never seen another game with such an in depth character customization.   Im honestly too lazy to continue this review and would rather just go play the game instead of talking about it, however if you have any questions feel free to add me and ask, or even watch my steam broadcast im playing 70% of the time.",

So stop complaining about the hackers because any game can be easily hacked.  Oh, so you just spawned in and you died by a grenade? Big deal! Someone buys CS:GO and gets sniped by an AWP they automatically refund the game? No! They just get better at the game. And if you really need it just click on the 'Advanced' option while picking a district and click on one with a green orb next to it.  So just get the game and if you don't like it delete it.",

Upgrades onto your weapons, character and car. Such as 'Increased car explosion radius' Or 'Mobile ammo box' Or for your charcter 'Kelvar implants' .... It's insane.  The gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour. Other then all that, it's no P2W (You can buy weapons, but everything is normally achievable without having to pay), and you can really ♥♥♥♥ around with people, it's funny as hell!.

You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades.

            "review_text": "(Note: I have not played this game in many years).  So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it.   You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice. So:   Lag: There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.  Hackers: Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.  Pay to win: This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while. (Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)  Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.  Creativity/customization: There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.  Matchmaking: From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.  Frustration: Expect it.  What else.. what else.. hmmm....  Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.  Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.    Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!   So, now to what I really wanted to say:  So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.",

The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition.   A wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of 'kill all the cops before they kill you.' Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!  Customization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.  I have one complaint. This game is most definitely 'pay-to-win.' $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become.   The cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.",

Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing APB reloaded on and off steam for a while. I will state the following:   PROS:   If you enjoy enhanced character customization and opposing enemy players in non-stop PVP this game is for you. The detail of character customization, Vehicle customization, Clothing retexture is abundant, Moreso than most MMO's I've ever played. atleast one server seems to be densely populated at all hours of the day, There are always players online. You get a fully customizable soundtrack to play from your vehicle. The open world crimes and witness events give the game play immersion.  CONS: There are hackers who use aimbot sometimes, Allthough most get banned with the new anti-cheat system some bypass it or return on a fresh account. When you're a low level in the bronze district as bronze threat level, Gold threat level players equipped with preimum gear will camp you and kill the crap out of you, you'll be lucky to last five seconds without being picked off after respawn in some matches. As far as the community is concerned, Like most MMOs or FPS's Such as Call of duty or WoW, Players can be really disrespectful via district chat or mic, predictably Some can be very cancerous and toxic with thier insults and PM's, These players are usually team killers and generally will try to bring down the whole team, Not that I care but people who aren't like me who aren't desensitized to it will. Not that i'm sure it matters in this type of game, But there is no RPG element to the game, You'd have to think, There are NPC interactions in this game verbal and physical, Mugging, Diolouge, Contacts, Mail from contacts. Why is there no NPC missions or PVE? I'd probably play this game A lot more if it did have an RPG element to it and Solo missions. Sometimes I don't want to PVP, the same routine kind of gets boring after a short wile.  Conclusion: Despite the cons, I'd still reccomend APB reloaded. After all it is ranked #1 in most top 10 character generation videos, I have a lot of fun doing open world crime or when on my enforcer arresting players who commit crimes. The game itself is more adult oriented and more to my level of prefrence, Something you rarely see at all in today's games.",

The reason I have stopped playing is because of CS:GO (Nothing to do with APB: Reloaded itself). There are so many interesting things you can do on this game, for example spamming WASD to run in a circle and evade bullets like Neo from the Matrix! Or using LTL (Less than Lethal) Grenade launchers to stun everyone for days! There are quite a few cars, and in all honesty, there is no point in playing this game whatsoever without a premium sub. If you're not an Artist like me, than don't fret, you can still find music and cars designed by others for a fee. It may be difficult for you to place yourself in this game, or to have fun if you do not have friends who PC game, but don't worry! There are many clans and groups that play that aren't hacking, and some of them are really friendly. :D  Anyways, this games Guns (and many other items) are timed, which isn't really a problem TBH (I did eventually buy permanent weapons over a span of 3 years), and you definitely feel the prestige of getting higher and higher level. My brother plays this as well, all he does is create music to sell. It's worked out very well for him, he can buy anything on the game he wants aside from Joker content.  All in all, I recommend playing this game at least long enough to get to R100, hopefully you'll have a good time and enjoy the game to it's fullest by then. :)",

            "review_text": "APB:R is a mechanically solid game with amazing customization options -including an option to upload your own music and play it with an in-game radio, but it's seriously marred by punishing hardware demands and one of the worst communities not actually directly affiliated with an organized Hate Group.  APB:R's got a mean learning curve, too, and not just in terms of gun fighting. High skill players also know the city and it's many alleys, highways, ramps, and neighborhoods quite well, and being travel time efficient is one of the greatest advantages for completing missions. You'll need to know the weapons as well and that's also not a trivial task.  The setting's quite detailed as well and fairly intriguing. There's a lot going on in this tale of a city committing suicide to save it's life and it's told from many different perspectives by a few dozen well composed NPC's. Shame it's also not an ongoing story.  A word on microtransactions: there are quite a few of them, and more coming all the time. Much of it is exclusive, but usually cosmetically. If you don't care what your OCA or NTEC looks like, you can unlock -permanently- weapons that'll perform just about as well as anything that costs real money. In terms of what's 'necessary' Premium time nearly doubles your income and contact progression rate, and that'll really start to tell once you get deep into the game and start seeing max level 15 contacts.  And much as APB:R's servers look like a dumping ground for unwanted (and tragically unaborted) children get this straight: it's a business, not a public park. Servers cost money, money means selling stuff. Get over it, or uninstall.  APB:R has a real and an active hacker problem. The worst offenders are the Americans, so keep off the game during American holidays and afternoon hours. Fair Fight helps, but it's bad to the point of hacker cadres bragging about how they stay in APB:R just to ♥♥♥♥ with the devs, and who can point you at all their favorite forums and programs.   In Global Chat -just ask.  (Here's a good unofficial metric: read through the comments for this game that accompany any dev announcement or piece of news. Assume half the people denying hacking are doing it themselves. Say that's about %10, 1 in 5x2.  Now go play, and remember that number when you realize that these folks are the most active players when you see a newly minted rank 80 burn through your entire team with an unmodded Joker rifle. Sure his K/A/D is 17-3-0, but he's 'just that good.' Especially with one of the worst weapons in the game*. So _pro_. That he's also driving a completely stock version of the basic free car also means nothing -he just decided to reroll.  So what's suspicious about an unbelievably expert player with a Gold skill ranking in a game built on long-term progression and customization who likes to use a completely basic gun and restart at random? And who apparently can track you through walls? Can make jumping max-range hits on targets behind 90% cover with a sniper rifle?  I sound salty; I am.  I've seen this scenario play itself out _dozens_ of times.  If APB:R finally succumbs I'll miss it because truly there isn't much like it anywhere.  But I won't wonder why.  I'm recommending APB:R because there is a lot to love, but it's drowning in a sewage sump of the worst people you can find online. And no mistake, 'drowning' is no exaggeration. The devs keep patching and updating slowly and regularly, but the handicap of it's unbelievably vile community must cripple the growth it needs to stay online. F2P is a great model that only works if new people show up to buy, and given few actual new players stick around and that there's an upcoming global server merge doesn't say to me that it'll survive if it doesn't find some effective solution to it's many gloating and vocal cancers.   There's a play engine upgrade coming (eventually) and that'll probably be the make-or-break point when the stresses of the (realistically) many implementation bugs makes players who didn't log in to ♥♥♥♥ with someone else wonder if they've got the patience to deal with everything they don't like about APB:R showing up while everything they play it for is in a limbo of bugs and disconnections.  Bottom line: bring your A game and your thickest skin, and stay off the servers during weekends unless you bought better aimbots than the other guys.  *The Joker SR-15 is inferior to just about every other rifle in every way except these: RoF and magazine size. Critically rifles, not SMG's or AR's, don't have iron sights.  They're meant to be light marksman's weapons with above average per-round damage that do poorly at close range. Our friend being described above will be running and leaping as he hip-fires his weapon. That has no crosshairs and a deviation box the size of a baseball diamond. At max RoF. ... GG.",

The game iteself however was plagued with hackers and bugs. It died on its ♥♥♥♥ rather soon after release, taking Realtime Worlds with it (no more crackdown :c ). What has this got to do with reloaded? Oh quite a bit. The game is now quite pay to win, with some guns only really available to people who pay the rough equivalent to a small island nation's GDP. The company who took ownership of APB, 'gamersfirst' have only started to get rid of some bugs that plagued the game since it was brought back and instead only really seemed to care about creating new 'premium' content instead of optimisation and stuff. The performance now is quite acceptable and as long as your pc isn't 32bit/very old/a laptop you should be able to run it. What really kills this game in terms of performance though is the servers. I don't know what potato they use to run their servers and internet, but it needs to be changed.  There are some bits that make it enjoyable though. One bit is the customisation, which is fantasic. The other bit is that if you play as a group you can have some fun annoying angry premium players, who will report you for hacking if you get more than three kills with the standard gun.   To conclude, I find this game incredibly easy to hate and wish for it to be put to death but at the same time I have many hours on it and its a laugh with friends to the point where I can almost overlook the half arsed job by gamersfirst.  IF THERE WAS A 'meh.' reccomendation I'd choose it :^)",

            "review_text": "In this review I will go over the basic gameplay and explain the Pro and Cons to this game. For a shorter review scroll to the bottom and read the summery.  APB is a MMO third person shooter based on the idea of Cops vs Criminals. Players queue for matches in district servers to do mini pvp matches against each other which take place in various parts of the map. There are 2 'PVE' maps and 2'PVP maps currently. The two PVE maps are the Finacial and Waterfront, each hold their own factions alliances in the district. Players either pledge to a specific contact to level up their standing with them or just play at random leveling up whoever is available.   Both Criminals and Enforcers (Cops) get their own specific gameplay that they can do while in the game. Criminals can operate burgleries by ramming into stores and storage units to steal the items inside,or robbing civilians on the street, then fence the items at their closest contact. Once the items are turned in the criminals are then required to go to the 'Money Launder' to collect the cash. Enforcers can participate in this as well, it is called 'Wittness Mode'. While a Enforcer is driving about he can patrol for Criminals commiting crimes and when he finds them he presses the Wittness Key, default Alt, and him and the criminal are now put into a mission where the Enforcer needs to get the evidence to the lock up while the Criminal needs to get it to the fence. This is a very unique system that is very entertaining and always present in the game. Enforcers also get a unique gameplay choice which is Less Than Lethal weapons. LTL weapons are the games way of making it more interesting and putting a twist on the game. When using LTL weapons, the Enforcer stuns the enemy and then arrests the Criminal. Criminals are able to free their team mates from handcuffs but only if they can make it there in time. The advantage to LTL is it makes the spawn timer longer, with the disadvantage that the LTL have a shorter range and require time to arrest Criminals putting the Enforcer in danger of enemy fire.  Being that the game is a third person shooter, the game is less about skill and more about placement. Covering corners and knowing the range of your weapons as well as how they fire can give you a large advantage over players who are simply pointing and shooting. The starting rifle both Crims and Enforcers start with is incredibly good, both in accuracy and power but it must be fired with control burst instead of full auto otherwise it loses it's strengths. That being said the game is incredibly unfriendly to new players, it has such a large learning curve that it causes most people to give up and stop playing. Because of that the playerbase is reletively smaller and all the players tend to merge into the 'Silver' districts which can cause unfair match making. New players should be recomended to play on the 'Bronze' servers until they learn the ropes better and are ready for the big servers.  One of the biggest gripes about the game is the cash shop, yes the cash shop sells weapons. Before you drop the game though you should know the weapons in the cash shop have very little difference compared to the 'free' weapons. Most CS weapons are infact reskins of the free ones, with the exception of the few that are special/unique weapons. One of the most powerful weapons in the game is also one of the first ones you unlock for free. Most of what comes out of the cash shop is cosmetic items that are for cars and clothes.  So now that we went over the basics and you have a little bit of an understanding of what you are getting into, lets get into the good things about this game. Number one of all time is, the customization. Free players are limited on how much customization they can do in the game, but even then I've seen amazing things come from free people. You can style everything from the clothes you wear to the logos on them, from the tattoos on your body to how fat you want to be. Customize your car, it's color, the model, the decals, the lisence plate, body kits, even interior design on some of them. Your weapons can be modifide depending if you unlocked guns with open mod slots. Do you like your gun shooting faster, more accurate, longer range, better zoom, better hipfire, bigger magazine, or maybe you like to carry more ammo. You can use mods to change that. Even with your car too, Nitro, Steel plating, mobile spawn, mobile ammo supply, or even have a brick that can be used when you jump out of your car to launch it at enemy players. Players can add mods to their character as well to carry ammo, be able to survive hits from vehicles, reduce fall damage, or even ride ontop of cars without falling off. The game has endless combinations and possiblities that you can take advantage of and have fun with.  The conclusion, if you can get around the very steep learning curve, get over the cash shop selling weapons and just have fun with the game, you will enjoy it. This game is one of the few games where customization is literally at your command. Dress as a business man, or run around half naked, it's your choice. Alter your weapons to your play style and make your dream car, it's all in your hands. The game is definately worth a try for people who like shooters, but remember that the game can put you in unfair match making at times. This is because of the size of the playerbase, the more people play the better match making gets. Those of you who just read the bottom and are thinking of trying the game, I suggest you give the whole review a once over to understand what I'm talking about completely and half some understanding of what you are going to be doing ingame.",

APB’s new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010’s deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first game’s devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloaded’s missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APB’s problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation – APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.",

You can short cut the system by buying the guns/vehicles with mods with actual money. Buying premium will double the exp and in game money you get.  Overall friendly community.

It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..

If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game.

If you had Windows XP SP3, everything was -relatively- fine ; if you had Windows Vista... well, you were already ♥♥♥♥ed.  One year later, the game becomes Free-To-Play and is even available on Steam in some so-called 'Reloaded' version. After sixteen attempts at keeping the damn software running for more than ten minutes, I gave up : it still full of random memory troubles, especially if you run it with Windows Seven, two Nvidia Quadro 4000, a processor Intel i7 Extreme Edition and 10Gb of Crucial Ballistix RAM.

Buying stuff for real money off their marketplace is HIGHLY optional and I've never found the need for the guns, which by far are just better looking and sounding reskins of the existing in-game guns. There are also a significant number of community-wide contests held by Reloaded Productions giving away small items that almost convince you to go back every time. There are always OMFG moments though, as sometimes you could be facing highly co-ordinated teams that everyone accuses of hacking and are really not but you learn to roll with it. I have additional 1200 hours on this game besides the Steam count and have completed the progression thrice with different characters. The GMs have, in the past, promised a lot of things to be given a long time ago (read: a year). They have not delivered yet. This includes more content that isn't just a simple reskin, an engine upgrade and a new anti-hacking system. The last was implemented in Q4 2014. Simply put, this game can be very enjoyable and very annoying as well. As a new player in this game, it works to your advantage if you haven't played MMOs before allowing you to keep the tolerence to learn the game instead of rage quitting. You will die a lot and you will be abused a little by other players, but if you learn, you'll love this game...",

            "review_text": "I do recommend this game, but under certain conditions.   For starters, you can not play this if you take gaming seriously. There is no matchmaking in this game at all. They claim that matchmaking is done by your ranking in the game, however their ranking system is complete and total crap. I made a new character earlier, to test this. With my BRAND NEW character, I did ONE mission. On this mission, I got one kill, and died around 7 times. (Behold, pay to win aspects, will detail later). After the mission was over, I was rocketed from bronze one, to silver 3. I skipped ALL the bronze ranks because of ONE kill.   Now maybe, you'd think, they would at least make the game fair to free players. Not everyone has money they can spend, right? How about, instead, they market their microtransactions to give you game breaking advantages that allow you to dominate every player who doesnt have them. If you get matched up against a pay-to-win player, as a free player, you can reserve your cemetary plot now, because you wont stand a chance.   'But Akalron, they have to make money right?' Yes, of course a company needs a way of generating revenue, but ruining a free players experience is not a proper way to do that. I have played FTP games where the company did just fine by selling cosmetics, not advantages. APB COULD have easily done this, but they took a less retroactive approach to it. Granted they probably generate more revenue this way because of all the players who desire a win that bad.  Heres my favorite part however. I can deal with the pay-to-win, I can deal with the bad matchmaking, but what I can't begin to fathom is their lack of optimization. This game has been out for years, and yet it still runs like its in pre-alpha development. Textures load slower than a snail, the game constantly freezes up (usually in the middle of driving or a fire-fight. Hope you didnt want to avoid hitting a wall or dying.) The loading times are atrocious. The only thing slower than how slow the textures load is how long the game takes to actually open.   My computer is no potato, I have no problems running any of the other 150+ games I have, but when this game sits there loading the district select screen for over 5 minutes? What on earth is this? Are they so focused on adding more over-powered guns for their revenue that they dont care about optimizing performance? Or are they just banking on computer hardware advancing faster than their games requirements?   I do have some positive things to say about the game however.   I have a blast playing this game. It is fun after it finally loads. Its a fantastic blend of GTA and Saints Row. It has a lot of (unlockable) customization, but also takes its gameplay moderately seriously. If you go in expecting to have fun, not expecting to win, you will enjoy yourself.   I recommend playing with friends, because if you do decide to do missions, being able to communicate will assist in winning even against pay-to-win players.  Steal a van, hop in with all your friends, vibe out to the ingame radio and gun down pedestrians like a boss. Enjoy yourself.  And for you developers who may or may not read this review: For the love of god, please fix your game, its too much fun to watch it slowly die off. I've worked for a game with a similar market strategy, and lets just say, they didnt do well. Take that as you will.",

Matchmaking is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah.

Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing this game ever since early 2011, and still to this day the events are epic and the updates are frequent. The game used to be owned by RealTime Worlds but then was bought by Gamersfirst, ever since then the games performance was dropped significantly. The servers are more unstable, they crash a half a dozen times weekly, and recently while I was online the servers completely froze for a good half a minute. The chat was flooding with complaints from players but it was pretty funny if you ask me. Hackers are uncommon on this game which is good.  A few of the reasons why I still continue to put up with this game is because of the player freedom and community. The character customization is very complex. For example, there are like 4 different customization sliders just for your characters nose. The clothing and character customization is so vast that I have seen players in-game dressed as Ronald Mc'Donald, The Joker, Harly Quinn, celebreties such as Justin Bieber, Tupac, Will Smith, Bill O'Reilly, Obama, Chuck Testa, Youtubers, and many more.  The vehicle customization is also huge and with certain vehicle modifications, such as Nitro 3, you can do stunts and jumps in a district and impress some people.   The game is very unique as far as the character customization and free roam aspect. I'd give it a 7.5/10 due to the servers preformance and the fact that many people get falsely banned quite frequently due to 3rd party programs when they never even did anything wrong. I'v lost friends that have just one day disapeared from this happening to them, it's depressing that the G1 staff don't help at all when it comes to unbanning. If you get banned on this game permanently for any reason at all, don't expect on getting it unbanned.",

The game consists of two very large (1000+ meters) city maps where many teams of either faction are engaged in missions simultaneously.

Pros - Full customization of vehicle and character with large multitudes of clothing and the ability to make completely custom designs. Every character and vehicle looks completely unique. - Large array of guns with custom skins, though most of the skins have to be bought through the in game store. - Progression system. If you like these, it's there. You get quick access to the base versions of guns, so it's not too bad. Though, things such as the OPGL and OSMAW come much later, as well as a couple of the cars. - Frequently matched against new people, so you're not playing against the same team over and over again like in other multiplayer shooters.  Cons - The open world can lead to griefing and 'ghosting' on occasion, or just some frustration as you're trying to drive to the next objective as quickly as you can while getting rammed by cars driven by other players. - Some of the guns in the in game store which cost real money to buy can be considered across the board better than some of the guns available as free to play.",

All of the guns in the game has some weaknesses, find the weakness and USE IT!  You go out and do missions and after a while you get up to 100k-200k money, you can get a great car form the marketplace, the money takes some time to farm up, but it you don't spend it all on clothes or whatever it goes pretty fast.  this is a truly great game, for what it is.",

Eventually G1 picked it up and relaunched it with some minor tweaks and all was good except no compensation for players who previously bought the game. History aside now lets get into it, this will be fairly short.  Gameplay is alright, G1 surprisingly continued to develope the game and not just let it be a cash grab completely. The rework to the economy where you rent guns rather than buy sucks, a lot. the poor hacker prevention is terrible but hackers dont run to terribly rampant and low skill players wont run into them hardly at all. All in all its interesting, with a fairly par shooting mechanic, and a nice amount of customisation for the free player and a lot for the subscriber. I never feel like I have to subscribe even though I have on a few special occasion when I play for more than a month at a time. Something about it keeps pulling me back time and time again, sometimes just a few days, or a month. but just like EVE online for me I just cant quit it for long. (although in APB I'm not blacklisted by multiple corps for abandoment and possible spy ect ect.)  overall. 6/10 a good fun time but come expecting that you are gonna spend possibly 20 minutes at a time just being bent over and taking it from all sides while you can do nothing but throw your body on an objective praying that you dont get turned to tiny gibs of goo and being reminded that you got pwnd by all sorts of catchy or horribly annoying theme songs.",

There is nothing more fun than driving a car with 3 of your mates hanging out the windows shooting everything that moves.  With an incredibly detailed world, fully customizable outfits and cars, a dynamic mission system, and a huge variety of weapons, this game is a PVP'ers dream come true. It's got a level of polish and attention to detail that other free to play mmo's lack.   NOTE: If you want the best latency, join the Han Server in Hong Kong.

There are Hackers and Macro users just like any other game. There aren't as many as there used to be but when they do appear now, they're just blatant.

That's a gamble though, with premium and effective play Missions are an amazing source of money. But like I said, as a newbie Ram Raiding would be the way to go.   Asylum and Baylan Shipping are NOT the place for a newbie to be, Hang out in Financial or Waterfront until you get used to the game and unlock some more guns. Play around with your mouse sensitivity until you hit the sweet spot. Guns like the OCA (SMG's) are great starter guns along with the Ntec and the Star 556 (Assault Rifles).   Some people will say Pay 2 Win exists, I don't agree because the Oca, Ntec, and Star are some of the BEST guns in the game that you can get at a very low rank, you will unlock slotted guns for mods to greatly increase the performance or unlock guns that already have mods installed that you cannot change.

Well, as all free things come with, this game will have its downsides.  'Good' Things: - Awesome customization - Physics=non-existent - Be half naked and you still have the same amount of health as a kickass SWAT team member - Did I mention walking through the social district is essentially the same as watching porn? - Car customization too.  Bad things. Really, really bad things: - Pay to win. People will deny that it's true, but it is. Some guns can take you down in a simple two hits. Some guns can take out a car in one hit. - The presets for their character creation are TERRIBLE. It looks like you just rose from the grave to kill someone if you choose the female model (like me). - So I heard you liked cars? Well, be prepared to grind endlessly through missions to get the money and 'Joker tickets' to buy them. -Matchmaking is terrible. You may be a bronze rank (ranking being from bronze, to silver, to gold with gold being the highest) and be paired up with a full squad of golds.  - You CAN'T LEAVE A MATCH WITHOUT QUITTING THE ENTIRE GAME. - If you randomly get rocketed to gold rank like I did, when you can't kill people for ♥♥♥♥ and are just playing to customize, guess what?

Cons  Ive had some bad experience with the comunity so I just mute everybody. it saves me from having to listen to the pure duchbaggery that people on this game can be It's not just me its quite a large group of people having a disconecting problem it happens randomly you could be afk or in a mission or looking for a mission the game will dc you and you will have to sit throught the long as ♥♥♥♥ loading screens.  My final thoughts on the game is that its a clunky F2P open world 3rd person shooter with a good idea but poor exacution. The comunity is bad and allot of them are whinny and imature but this is just my experience. the game is addicting and can be fun its worth about 20 dollars well worth a try    also people say gta clone I say true crime and saints row jumped off a building and this is the spatter they scrapped off the pavement.",

            "review_text": "Alright, this is definitely going to be one of the more...odd reviews I'll have written, but APB is an odd game in the end. Here's how it goes: in the beginning, right when you start out, you'll be a trainee who knows nothing about the game except for what the tutorials show you how to do. And, more than likely, on your first mission, you'll be run over (both figuratively and probably literally) quite heavily. And, if you only get to play this game a little, with no connection to the forums or people to show you the ropes, you'll have a hard time actually getting good at the game.   The skill gradient in this game is intense and impossibly cruel, as you'll have to figure out things on your own all the while being trashed by your enemies, not to mention the learning curve. As with any game, there are some mechanics that you have to learn by doing, but in a game so diverse and deep as this (yes, it does have a definite deepness to it), there will be some mechanics that aren't overtly intuited by your gameplay, which makes the gameplay even more frustrating.   And, to speak of frustration, there will definitely be a lot of it. From the people using better guns, better strategies, better teamwork, and all around better gameplay, to your lack of knowledge of the game, there will be an intense amount of frustration on your end, mostly due to how -unfair- it all seems. Indeed, I know how it is. It took me up to rank 200 (out of a possible 255 ranks currently) to generally get good with about 75% of the game in total. And, on top of all that, you'll get the odd hacker here and there which will be upsetting for the people who're trying to play fairly, if only to add to the mess.  And yet, do I reccommend this game? I'm certainly wavering hesitantly over those two buttons down there, trying to decide if I -do- want more people to experience the game or if they should simply stay the hell away. It's really a tough choice, let me tell you.  After all, there are some redeeming parts to this game. The social aspect, if you get into it, can be enjoyable. The idiots in district chat are always there to be taunted if they get pissy about a game they lost, or if they're generally being stupid, and there are the charismatic teammates in the game that really make you enjoy a particular mission you're on. You could end up in a large clan where you get to play with a great amount of people with varied playstyles, or even make some good friends in the game and join their clan of a small, yet tightly knit, group.  To add to that, there's a large amount of variance in this game, meaning there's a huge number of guns and subsequent variations of from which to choose, along with cars and clothing, all of which can be customised to some extent. And, if you add to that the possibility of Premium accounts, then you add more slots for customisation. On top of even all that is ARMAS, which houses a plethora of guns that can only be attained fully by purchasing them, along with custom parts for some cars, and purchase-only clothing parts and gear. (That's the Pay2Win part of the game.) In reality, most of the ARMAS guns are there for the people who don't want to wait to unlock weapons in the game, or people who don't want to shell out in-game money every ten days for the guns they regularly use. Almost every weapon in the game is good enough and viable to play, as long as you match the gun to the situation it's prime in. Protip: don't be good or favour any one gun; try and be skillful with all of them.  In the end...I think I would reccommend this game to you. Yes, it lags. Yes, there are some hackers. Yes, it's difficult, and yes, the client crashes 10 percent of the time, but...I think it's something I want you to experience. It's something you can get addicted to easily, whether or not you enjoy it. All in all, I think it's a decent enough game.   So, give it a try. Put in about 500 hours worth of time, and then see if you want to quit it.   ~Kuro  -------------------------------- Tips: -Learn to tap-fire. Most guns are useless if you spray full-auto. -Starting gun 'Star556' is strong already if you know how to tap-fire. NTEC is also beastly; It's not called 'wintec' for nothing. -Make a max-height character to see the whole hitbox. All characters share the same hitbox size, so even if your body is fully behind cover as a small person, your hitbox might not be. -Play on bronze servers; Silver is full of highly-skilled players and hackers. -If you want Premium from ARMAS, don't buy only premium. Get a Joker box bundle. Chances are you'll get some nifty guns as well as premium codes in there. -Look up weapon guides, car guides, and code lists in the Steam 'help guides' that are available. They'll help to show you what's decent for which situation. -Gold servers are empty. No one goes there. You won't get opposition. Don't waste your time entering them.",

Firing weapons on full auto just makes the spread continuously grow and does not slow/stop between shots unless you lay off the trigger. Every car that is customized by the player lacks responsive steering severely but will improve when giving gas through corners, kind of like a reverse GTA4 handling (Cars in GTA4 are responsive but handle like garbage).

Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no ♥♥♥♥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.",

It's a freemium game that under-delivered on the promises made by the original APB. While it is not a perfect game by any stretch, the interactions and gunfight scenarios available to you in the given setting are fantastic. This was GTA Online before there was a GTA Online.

However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot.

There's also some bad things: The match making system. Sometimes you are a newcomer and then you have to face P2Ws. There is a small amount of hackers.  You don't get to change and buy cars right in a mission district. You have to go to the social district in order to do that. I know there are some poopy PCs and it takes 10 minutes to go from a district to another.   The vehicles have too big limits. There aren't boats, helis and jets and tanks. I want it to be in there.  We all want to set our own bounties. I don't like how I have to get killz until I get to notoriety 5 (and that's nearly impossible xD).

What is realy surprising is that so much planning and detail went into it but the lag and the people running it our terrible. They gave up on the game but it's still fun to play if you deal with all the problems, its a load of fun especialy with friends and since its free, its a must have!  What stands out:  Fun with friends: 9/10 Lag level: 5/10 (thats bad btw) Design and Polishing: 8/10 OVERALL: a 7/10 but still worth playing! ",

Customization options are still awesome, though you're limited if you've got a free account. Not to say that you can't create something awesome with that though ;)  Of the free to play games I've played, the gun play in this game is great. It feels responsive enough to pull off pop-shots and quick swipes across your mousepad.  As for the guns themselves keep in mind that different weapons fill different roles. The game might not do a great job of teaching you what to do off the bat but it's fairly simple once you get used to it. i.e.: A SMG or shotgun will generally lose at range to an assault rifle; Assault rifles are good all-around. The starting rifle (STAR 556) is not to be underestimated, you can definitely outplay other 'paid'/'armas' guns with the right strategy.  Speaking of strategy, it plays a HUGE role in the game. A bit too much to explain in a little box here, but just remember to use the camera/third-person-view to your advantage, remember to check your flanks, and remember to stay in cover. As with any shooter, you'll have to learn the maps for the advantages each area holds, and how to counter them, how to flank them.   Once again, gaming is always fun with a friend, and for free? Sure, why not.",

Pros: Challenging Customization is great Upload your music too Make music for themes or songs Fairfight banning hackers(woohoo)  Cons: Not enjoyable on older computers(laggy)  This is an awesome game to get into but if you love winning every time then maybe it is not for you. You still level up, earn money, and unlock items even when you lose. So, give it try. If you don't like it you can always uninstall.  Update due to other reviews I have seen: You can always play while events are going on and get prizes (like premium) and use them to create whatever you want (tattoos, car decals, and such). It will still be there when the premuim expires. :)",

            "review_text": "Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APB's new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010's deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results.  The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first game's devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one.  Reloaded's missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars.  These do happen more regularly than before – little adrenaline shocks to punctuate hours spent bumbling around between jobs. More often, playing Reloaded's missions is like beating your head against one of San Paro's flat, grey concrete walls.  Mission locations are invariably overlooked by high ground. The first team to occupy that ground is the de facto winner, possessing sufficient cover to pop anyone who comes close. Grenades can't flush them out. Well-versed players will simply set up camp in an unassailable location and sit out ten minutes of screaming frustration. San Paro is so full of hiding spots and high ground that it's far easier to put someone else's mission under lockdown than it is to complete your own.  Urban renewal doesn't seem to have been high on GamersFirst's list of priorities: APB had the same spatial problems, and the same tiresome missions. The new devs have instead focused on the economy. Reloaded is free to play, supported by item, modification and vehicle sales, as well as a premium semi-subscription option. Steer clear of the latter and you get obnoxious little reminders telling you what you could've won in XP and in-game currency if you'd stumped up the cash.",

The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play!

Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake.

(Might take a few days for someone to get banned) It's mostly experienced players, who've been playing the game for a long time and for that reason alone they're being accused of hacking by a majority of players.  ------ Cons:  ------  - Nowhere near as many admins/GM's in-game as there should be, there's lots of things going on in chat that shouldn't. So don't take it to heart if anyone is trying to offend you.   - Some OP Weapons in Armas, as I said they'll probably be fixed in the future ''  - Poor optimization, you'll need a pretty good rig to be able to play this game with decent framerate unless you're willing to alter some text files or download Adv.APB Launcher that'll do just that.  - Takes a few days for hackers to actually get banned, FairFight doesn't work that fast, and sometimes it can ban an innocent player.

            "review_text": "First of all I'd like to clear up that G1 as developers are somewhat incompetent only seemingly wanting cash and money from players. So I will put a disclaimer that this review is leaning more into the aspects of the game or the game overall rather than the developers of the game and the decisions made by the company itself.  Now that I've invested quite the time with the game and as the time Im revising this review I have played for about 300+ hours of this game. I feel as if I was a bit too harsh and judgemental about my previous review of this game as I was critisizing the game way too harshly and was a bit biased due to my first experiences with the game.  Having invested a great amount of time into this game I have found that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was. The community is active in forums and are fun to socialize and interact with on most cases. Im not gonna lie that there are times when a player or two engages in the activity I like to call 'Who can be the best assh*le' in the game but they're only occasionally seen.  My best tip at this point would be to learn about the game in order to progress as APB Reloaded is a game that not only rewards you if you learn about secret routes or special hiding places for cover but also helps you progress through the game due to the help of the community itself.  I will admit though that before sinking 300+ hours into this game I painted a very biased opinion about the community making remarks that its cancer and toxic. Having personally interacted with the community in order to learn from veterans of the game and learning about tips and receiving advice from fellow players I then came to learn that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was.  Yes, the players online are very different from the ones in the forums and I can assure new players that it is not a turn off. The blend is quite well and sometimes even a good pair up. I will say though that if you dont have the patience to get better and invest some time into learning how things work with this game you'll end up having a very frustrating time blaming everyone else or everything else in the game rather than your lack of knowledge of it.  I whole heartedly feel that APB Reloaded is a game that I can recommend now, The graphics may be a little bit dated but that doesnt mean the game isnt enjoyable or playable. The community is helpful and fun to interact with and even though you get the occasional trolls you shouldnt get turned off by them since they are rare encounters. I would also like to state that there are barely any hackers in-game and I think people are mislead about the topic.  APB Reloaded is a moderately unforgiving game. Yes, I will say that it can seem unfair due to other players having upper hand due to the pay 2 win aspect but that has NEVER stopped me before. I have a character in Jericho server which had never seen any money invested to it and is now a Rank 100 Silver threat character with no premium and no overpowered guns at my disposal. The renting system is quite helpful since renting out guns that suit your playstyle can help you compete with various other players that does have premium guns and have invested money.   I also want to say that people think players are hacking but in all honesty those are the results of body modification implemented in the game. Just like in a MMO RPG, APB Reloaded has a system to benefit those who work on unlocking buffs for their characters. For instance there is a series of mods called Kevlar Implants and Clotting Agent. Both are health based modification used by many experienced players that give them an advantage over people. This isnt even part of the premium pay 2 win aspect as the body modifications I just mentioned are available to EVERYONE. Working up the ladder of whichever faction you chose to go with does reward you by unlocking these body modifications. Not only that but you can even get modification to give your guns more edge. BUT WAIT! it doesnt stop there! you can even put modification on your vehicles to suit how you drive and play! Of course you can customize your character but you can also implement skins on guns and even customize your vehicles!  Not only that but you never have to invest anything in the game as there is a system that lets you buy premium guns in exchange for in game currency earned through events such as Fight Club. This system is called the Joker Ticket system which lets players who dont have cash to invest in the game or just dont want to invest money to have an alternative way to get permanent items such as weapons, clothing, and even special vehicles and kits in a FREE way. Completeing objectives to save up Joker Tickets is a great alternative for those who want to play the game but not invest any money into it.  Take it from me who literally has a character that was built without the help of premium or OP guns. Just pure work put into the character and getting good in the game overall. As I said multiple times in this review, the key to APB Reloaded is to master the maps and to learn more about how things work in order to get better in the game.  Anwyays Ive been typing long enough so I will say this before I end this review. APB Reloaded is not a bad game at all. The learning curve is somewhat difficult and may take time to get used to. However, with the help of the community and fellow players you can get better at the game and advance. Try the game out and sink some time into learning how to play better and trust me it will be a great pass time if not a great game to enjoy overall.

The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.",

The best thing in All Point Bulletin is the possibility of custimazation. You can change your car painting, your kill music that your victims will hear after death, your character (almost like in the sims)  Right now it seems that APB is dying a little cause of only 2k people playing at the same time. I hope somedays they will renew that old masterpice for the new players :)  Otherwise I'm recommending this game to people who don't mind that there are just few servers.",

            "review_text": "APB is a classic case of great concept done very poorly. After watching it 'evolve' over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading. - Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players) - Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves. - Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws. - They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill. - The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols. - Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game. - Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons. - Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort. - Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making 'improvements' slow to never fix issues and glitches.  Overall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10  **update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement..   I WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!",

            "review_text": " Mission objective: Pick-up briefcase and hold it for as long as you can   Three other players and I jump into a car and race for the pick-up location. We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  One team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.  At that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.  We respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.  My passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.  The two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.  Just as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.  People came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.  An RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: '♥♥♥♥♥ n00b fa*gots'.  Needless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.",

If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums. There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program. The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place. OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process. I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was 'Gaming grade' unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R. Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of 'be what you cannot be' too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.  People don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.  The game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker. The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection. The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control. So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back. The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as 'Spray n pray' or 'all out balls to the wall firefights' now, well now it's just depressing.  The game itself is the hacker... This has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high. I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get. Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game. Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!  The silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker... This can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways. However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is 'take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.' I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen. Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails. I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)  The company that handles APB:R aka 'Reloaded Productions' or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking. They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.  The base game though... The game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect. And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot! Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on... Now if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to 'fix' something. I cannot stress this enough... The devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.  This game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system. Are you interested in playing the game? Wait, just wait. Do i recomment you play the game? Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine. Is this game worth it? So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.",

            "review_text": "So first off I actually started playing this game 6 years ago, but only connected it to Steam recently so that's why my play time is only said to be 100 odd hours. Now honestly I didn't play for all of those 6 years and for the reasons I am about to cover... The game has some heavy pay to win issues, now some people (usually those who pay actually...) defend the game and say that if you earn enough 'joker tickets' you can buy these OP premium weapons for 7 days. The problem I'd argue is that it takes about a week for doing specific missions known as 'fight club' missions to actually achieve the joker tickets necessary in the meanwhile you are facing off against opponents whom oay for premium weapons and I have always played without paying any money so I can most defintley confirm that premium weapons absolutley out class their standard counter-parts and only after heavy modification after loads of playing time can one even stand on the same level as a premium weapon. Of course natrually a premium assault rifle will still lose out to a standard shotgun at point-blank range assuming the shotgun is being used well as it is not unheard of for a shotgun to lose in this scenario. I have played with the regular weapons then one-day trialed their premium counter-parts and it is very easy to notice the difference.   Another issue is that the community are generenally ♥♥♥♥♥, like if you've ever thought a community in a game like LoL is bad then wait till you see APB. But yeah people won't be kind to you. Also this has been massively improved upon (as once this was literally no exaggeration a problem every other match in a standard district) but there is still the occassional hacker that ruins the game. But I am thankful as this is way less common than before.  On the flip-side the customisation is better than any game I have ever seen ever and I do love it. It is incredibly in-depth and you can truly create your own identity, both in your character and vehicle. However once more customisation is better with premium allowing you to obtain a few more pieces of gear that are usually impossible to get due to pricing and also more decals are allowed on you and your gear and vehicles if you are a premium member.  Also I generenally find the combat fun, hit detection can be quite bad. But if you aren't playing against a load peeps using premium weapons, which makes up a large amount of the community, then it is quite fun and skill based. But as I said no matter how skilled you are your assualt rifle will lose out to a premium assualt rifle at almost any range. Except there does exist the odd bad premium weapon.  Overall I wouldn't recommend. Unless like me you love customisation and the game can be very fun, it has a few interesting gameplay features/ the game just feels unique in it's gameplay despite just being a third person shooter. But if you play for free you'll find yourself heavily disadvantaged and will recieve slightly limited customisation options. Having said that the customisation is still truly amazing and it's weird to think that a not so good game can nail one mechanic so much better than any other I've ever seen.",

This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.  THE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.  THE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!  VERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.",

So, in a world where GTA V/GTA Online had not yet existed, Realtime Worlds (the creator of, among other things, Crackdown) decided to break the bank on an MMOFPS called All Points Bulletin, or APB.  It was a highly ambitious but deeply flawed experiment in open-world GTA-esque sandbox gamplay in multiplayer. There were a number of serious flaws to the game's design, implementation and operation that gave it pretty lousy reviews, and in the end it was one of the reasons why Realtime Worlds went into bankruptcy.  After this escapade, a holding company bought out the rights to IP ownership and services administration of APB, which would eventually become known as GamersFirst (a highly ironic title for a game company that seemingly throws everything they can get their hands on into a pay-to-win woodchipper as soon as possible).  These guys seemingly haven't done a whole lot else with the game besides random bugfixes that in the end might have made it impossible to play on my computer, either through the retail launcher or via Steam.  But when I WAS able to play it, there was a nugget of intrique buried in a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ issues that prevented me from enjoying the game as a new player. The anti-cheat system was terrible, allowing for way too many impossible snipe-shots from other players in free-roaming or in missions, the community was pretty awful except for those who often hung out in the social servers (thus giving me an opportunity to entertain them by dancing like an idiot a few times, what MMOFPS fun) and player advancement was really meager as a result of how stratified the playerbase's levels of experience were.  To be fair though, there are some positives. The character/vehicle customization engine was mind-blowing at the time and is still pretty impressive today. If you can get together with people you know, you might enjoy causing havoc knowing that police dispatching is wholly reliant on the number of Enforcer players on the server and vice versa -- in other words, the world swings from one extreme to the other, chaos or dystopian order. It's pretty entertaining in that regard, I guess, although it's just a side effect of how unbalanced the game is.   Lastly, the missions I could get into were pretty entertaining in the world provided -- one of my favorite things about Realtime Worlds' open world games was the environment they designed for them. I don't exactly know why I enjoyed them, as they could be rather generic at times, but they always felt alive to me for some reason.   Maybe if a whole lot was changed about the game I'd consider going back to it (once I could ACTUALLY go back to it, as well) but in the meantime I'd not recommend this mediocre excuse for a massively multiplayer GTA. Now that GTA Online's out for PC, I'd suggest you check that out instead, its flaws are much more forgivable. It's weird that I can actually say that and mean it.",

            "review_text": "A failed uptopia, from its citizens to its infrastructure.  I love this game, and I may sometimes hop on, but I cannot in good conscience honestly recommend it.  +++PROS+++ The basic idea is wonderful. It's an open world city with customized characters pitting cops vs robbers for strategic operations and car chases.   This game is known for its vast customization. The Player Characters' bodies are customizable, tattoo-able, clothing customizable, cars customizable, theme songs, equipment, weapons.   The style of the non-player content is very attractive, a motion graphic setting a metropolis plagued by stylish punks; even the corporate executives are stylish.   If you're bored of killing, you can spend hours customizing or you can scrape some money up robbing places, catching robbers, stealing and returning cars. There are other things to do than missions.  It is not a pay to win game. Paying players will have some advantage, but it's really not a problem.  I'm going to go ahead and put the game's city in the Pros section. The cities do feel half alive. When I'm in the game, I feel like I'm in a city, not a backdrop of buildings, as I felt in Borderlands. There are plenty of stores, shops, apartments, places cities would need, and civilians walking around. The civilians are walking talking dolls that interact minimally, but it is just barely enough to make the city feel alive as I'm cruising in my car, looking at these 'civilians.' I do, however, wish the player contacts would interact with players more; they truly are cardboard cutouts, even with some of their dialogue.  ---CONS--- The game runs horribly. I'm no tech wizard, and I do have an old laptop, but for a game of this age with this level of texture and model quality, it's odd that I'm lucky if I can get any steady 10-15 frame rate at all.   This game is not especially well designed for the strategic action that was intended.  The levels are not perfectly balanced. There are only two city districts to play missions in, the main content of the game. The mission objectives are often in siege points of cqc mazes, surrounded by vast open areas; the enemy can see you coming from any direction, especially if they know the game's spawn points and routes well, and even if you manage to close the distance, they'll be waiting for you with cqc weapons ready. There aren't a lot of ways to flush enemies out of a siege position, other than being high leveled and affording grenade launchers.  The game's action is fast; characters are pretty zippy, compared to real life anyway. So, like Counter-Strike, this game gives strong favor to physical skills, reflexes and aim. Strategy and brainpower can help greatly, but a player can more easily brute force their way and kill enemies from disadvantaged terrain than they could in Ghost Recon Phantoms or even TF2.   Cover is used in this game minimally, you're obviously better off behind cover than in the open, the game does not really encourage strong use of cover. Cover is generally only provided in those cluttered maze like cqc areas. On the street, there is no cover except for exploding cars that do not protect your feet. In cqc areas, cover is less used because the fights are dances between two players with fully exposed hitboxes. There are short time limits on the missions, so players cannot wait around too long, especially if a fast moving enemy is patrolling the area. Once you get into cover to face an enemy at range, there's not a lot you can do to leave cover, as there is not a web of cover to leapfrog to and you don't have a lot of grenades and you don't have time for the coordination required for suppressive fire.  Teamwork is needed, but not really emphasized. Because of the low team sizes, teams are better off splitting up to attack from multiple angles. Being so far away from each other, players tend to act on their own; the only way to coordinate a team adequately is with a microphone; there is nothing to rally players together. Players do not need each other as all players have just about the same abilities; this is not TF2, where classes have strengths and weaknesses and are rallied by a medic.  The matchmaking is horrid. The game sets up some pretty unfair matches. Part of this is due to the low population, which is no doubt thanks to the game's problems and lack of aid to new players. And as you climb the ladder in skill, you will eventually find yourself constantly losing against the players at the top of the ladder, who never lose; they are lethal at all distances with an assault rifle and have the money to spam missiles and grenade launchers if they want to.   You win some you lose some, but all these things add up for too many moments where you'll have to learn the humility to surrender, knowing there was nothing you could do. Or if you do finally kill the guy who has been killing you over and over again, it was because of the luck of the aim rather than you being smarter. You just keep throwing yourself like water at a stone.   The community is horrid.   There are a lot of cheaters.  The game is an MMO. MMO's must constantly release new content until they eventually die out. This game is in its old age and it's handled by a small team that cannot release new content as often as needed. Even if they did, it wouldn't fix the base problems of the game.",

            "review_text": "Okay. This is pretty hard for me. I've been playing All Points Bulletin ALOT. I played it back when Realtime Worlds released it. I played it the time where you could leave your character in the 'Car Creator' over night and gain multiple thousand of dollars for doing nothing. Good times!  Back then, it was a fun new idea. Massive Multiplayer Third Person Shooter! It was GTA, but online with friends! Shoot with or against your friends through various locations, get new cars and edit your own music. The character creation and customization is beyond great! Very deep and there are so many different clothing options that all are design-able. Back then the game cost about 50 dollars, and you paid for the time you played. And when you had bought your X number of hours, it only counted the minutes you were in the game. There were plenty of ways to get even more hours, just by playing the game! And you wanted to. Damn, I played the sh*it out of it.  But alas, Realtime Worlds went down in 2010. Along with the game itself. Plenty of gamers from all countries were upset about this. I even logged in on the last day it was online, playing with the admins. Teleporting around and up on tall buildings. It was upsetting, really.  But then in the first half of 2011 All Points Bulletin: Reloaded was launched. And now it was Free-to-Play. It was great! Back was the customization, back was the open city and the cars. And for a time everything was great.  But sooner than later you started feeling the 'Free-to-Play' restrictions. And it pains me, because I enjoyed the game very much in its young years. Now you have to pay to be a 'premium' member. Which basically is what the game was for everyone back in the day. Your design slots are restricted unless you pay, which was on of the big reasons this game was so great. The game is infected with hackers and Pay-to-Win people who empty their credit cards on Armas Marketplace (Which basically is a 'Pay five dollars for the greatest weapon in the game' kind of shop) just to dominate every game. The ranking system, which was created to separate the newbies from the hardcore, is broken and unbalanced. If you go from Bronze to Gold in the same map, you will not be removed until you leave yourself. Most experienced players will just lose on purpose and kill themselves until they rank down to bronze, so they can join the newbies and kick their asses.  And the worst part? I can understand that. Because the Gold ranked servers are so infected with Hackers and 'Pay-to-Winners' that, unless you're willing to use hundreds of dollars, you wont stand a chance against.  Back then, when Realtime ran the show, I would probably have given the game an 8/10. I enjoyed it so much, and it was so different from everything else on the PC at the time.  But now? As I said earlier, the game was GTA with friends. Now we have GTA 5 Online (On PS3/4 and Xbox 360/One. Pc from mid-April), which does everything APB did, but better. I can't look away from the game's HUGE problems. The hackers got to go, and the Armas Marketplace has to be balanced with the weapons you can buy from vendors in-game. How the f*ck are anyone else going to stand a chance? And in general the free-to-play rules don't fit the All Points Bulletin I knew. Though I understand the practice, seen from a company's eyes. ($$$)  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it should be to play around with the games amazing in-depth editor. It's on cars, characters, clothes, tattoos and more. But not much else. Today, it earns a 4/10 from me. Don't play it, unless it is to fool around for a bit.  I play it primarily for nostalgia. Nothing else.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of 'Oh why not, it is free' only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said 'After all of this the game better not suck' and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game. Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, 'How did he not die?!' or 'How the hell did I die!?' There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this 'ghost shotting' and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all. Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These ♥♥♥♥ers think that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an ♥♥♥ or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.    Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a 'dumbass' for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.",

I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.  Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.   Pros",

Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)",

In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable.

Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower.

The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.",

            "review_text": "Welp I guess i should explain a little of my history with this game, I was a beta tester for apb reloaded (not the original) the game at the time looked great and had the potential to be better then or equal to GTA. I played this game for a very long time with a friend, until for some reason we both quit the game. I didn't remember why we left, It was vague but I felt sick just thinking about the game. 3 years later I felt like going down memory lane to see if the game is still kicking. I got my friend back into trying it again. And once I press the play button, it all started to comeback to me like a fever dream. With a slap to the face the game reminded me why this game was terrible. After 3 years its still the most unbalanced, exploitive, laggy, and grief filled game I remember. Seeing that the loading screens with the dial-up sound effects are still in the game makes me vomit.   Maybe I should go over what I loved about this game before kicking it in the balls with fury of a thousand suns.   Pros: Customization- This is probably the best level of customization I've ever seen in games, even AAA games fail to bring this level of control to how I want my character to look. Its a pretty simple system and I'm surpised not many games do it. Theres custom cloths, cars, themes, and etc. It really is where I use to waste alot of my time in the game.  Match Making- This is gray area for me because I both hate and like the match making. In apb you choose to have a death match(fight club), or go into the districts to have some random match making as you drive around when your ready. I spent most of my time in districts because that much more familiar to me then fight club. Drive around with a friend then randomly a call goes out to steal some stuff or defend some stuff or keep some stuff ( Mainly a crim by the way). Its exciting to be thrown into a match, but its bad when its far away or when its already being taken.   Now that I'm done taking about what I like about the game, lets go over why I left this game.  Cons:   LAGGY- Even during launch this game wasn't this laggy, I tried looking into why this is. Apparently they've been getting ddos attacked for a while. How many times? I don't know but enough to keep lag constant in this game.  Punkbuster- I've been gone a very long time, but I'm sure that punkbuster security still sucks right.   Cars- Car are still feel like crap on the road, I maybe able to tolerate the cars in this game. That does not mean I like them in anyway.  Guns- Some people tried to convince me that this game isn't p2w, but when I saw my friend go from 2 or 4 kills to 8 or 11 a game with just using a code for a weapon from the market place. I gonna say thats bs, the premium weapons have less recoil, some have more damage, mods, etc. And if you get to rockets ro gernade launchers say goodbye to balance because they are crazy.  Character modifications- Clotting agent is the only one you need, kevlar is worthless and makes you slow.   Districts: After all this time still only 2 districts waterfront and financial, all with no real changes or improvements. nothing about these areas are interesting and I feel like I know these place backward and forward.   This game could of been good, but its still what I remember a piece of crap I played before. ( And yes I know about the engine upgrade, I'll try it again when It drops, then be mad at myself later).       ",

APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change.

Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.

This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers ♥♥♥♥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should ♥♥♥♥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied '♥♥♥♥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.",

People take the game way to serious , a lot of bad words are getting used in the District chat, really mean people who just search for conflicts and fights. For me the community in online games matters a lot so here i can give APB between 1-10 a fair 3 and only because i met a few nice people otherwise it would be unfair.  Well from the community i can mention the 'cheaters' in this game. If you have really bad nerves then i wouldn't suggest you to play APB simply because there are really a lot of cheaters and yes im not in a position to claim half of the high rank people are using cheats but from a website called fairfight you can make your own image about the amount of hackers in this game .  So now we have a bad Community and lots of cheaters (everyday just imagine it lulz ) and we need help from the owners of this game ...Gamersfirst . So you want another reason why i don't suggest you the game? Here we go ;D  This game belongs to a company that a lot of ' normal ' people in APB hate simply because Gamersfirst doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the players. If you have problems or a request you send them a email and get as usual a auto-message . It often takes way to long to get a response and you kinda have to spam(?) them till they answer even tho if they do, its just lame answers such as ' we work on it' ,or 'please be patient ' . Mentionable is their promises which they don't keep such as an engine update which was planned to be done long time ago but instead they do now interviews with their staff members , kewl huh?.  The only thing which i would say is nice in the game is the cuztomisation.. thats all to be honest . You have lots of ways to make clothings , cars and again thats it :D   At all i don't play it much but when i do its only because of my Character , i guess thats just my girlish side .  Try it out and see if you like it or not but be aware of the meanies out there !   Thanks for reading and Bye Bye &lt;3 ",

Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.

If you like playing a game with 12 year olds ramming you with their car, trolling, no good teamwork then this game is for you. If you like playing on a outdated laggy engine this game is for you. If you like playing with crap guns that are totally unrealistic then play this game. People will say this game has skill, but what is the skill is the question?. Their isnt any. If you know how to tap fire, duck, move left to right, camp, spray, sneak up and steal your teammate's kill then you will be pro. In mission districts all the gold threat players play in the silver district. The gold district is 0 in population. You have players that will dethreat to silver to just go to the bronze district to troll with osmaws. The game is very unpopulated also.    Gamersfirst support sucks. I got scammed awhile back I was trying to trade a N-HVR Reaper for another lengend, I contacted gamersfirst support, and reported the incident and they took care of that and I got my gun back. Got scammed again and contacted support. I was trading a condor for another legend. And I showed them proof of that incident. And they told me that they would be glad to help me. They banned the person yeah. But I did not get back my gun. They told me that they were sorry that the restoration of my item wasn't available at the moment. So I messaged them back and told them about how I got my lengendary back before when I was scammed. They replied saying they only do it one time. If they only do it just one time. They should just ban ingame trading or make a trade system. Because people spend alot of money on joker boxes for legendarys, and you have people that has spent alot of time getting legendarys.      The good things about this game are. 1. Great Charactercustomization 2. Only game I know with a music studio 3. Good symbol designer, if you have premium 4. Car constumization, but very few cars. 5. Good clothing designer if you have premium. If you don't have premium you are limted on what you can do.  BUT STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. This game is not that bad its just Gamersfirst that makes it bad. It's an actual really good game. Just owned by the wrong people. It's very unique game. No game is like it. I'm not going to say don't play. Play it because if this game gets more populated it may get better one day. I feel like if it died. It would stay dead forever. I don't want that to happen. I know the weapons aren't very realistic but that may change one day. Who knows. Maybe if the engine update really happens; maybe it will fix alot of things and make it better. I can only hope so. BUT PLAY IT. IGNORE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS. ITS NOT THAT BAD. THIS GAME WILL JUST MAKE YOU SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT IT. AND YOU WILL COME BACK PLAYING IT. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU WILL.   Thinking about it again though ♥♥♥♥ This game!!! Old piece of crap that they aren't ever going to fix and update.

The issue is Realtime Worlds nor GamersFirst even bothered to adapt their own servers or the netcode to handle that many people. While you won't experience unplayable lag, there will occassionally be spikes.  APB Reloaded's community is nothing but pure toxicity, consisting of adults and teenagers alike with the mentality of a child. Yelling/swearing in chat or voice is not uncommon, and their fuses are like that of a munitions warehouse. The worst part is this community thinks the game qualifies as an e-sport, if you can read that through all the vulgarity.  Old recylced humor, internet celebrity wanna be's, and sex jokes are all too common and this is one of the reasons I left. It annoyed me to no end.  Probably the most sinister of activities is the company running it.

Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.

Because it still means that I will not be challenged by anyone on the other team unless they also have this weapon. It is just not any fun killing/getting killed by two bullets. Trust me it is just not cool. The other massive flaw is the location of missions. They are put in a way that whichever team gets there first can win by simply camping the area because there are just not any ways in that will not see you getting mowed down no matter what.

            "review_text": "APB~  + Decent graphics   Customization  Open world  Impound   ~ Guns and vehicles (the cheaper set) are rented for a few days    - Matchmaking is unbalanced most of the time  Missions are repeatitive and some are unfair  Buying powerful guns with real money  Hvt when doing great (I forgot what this is called. Wanted/Heat level?)  Too much shooting   *Note: I never used real money to purchase anything.*  This was a fun game when I fisrt started playing it. Being able to customize my character to whatever I wanted and having almost the same for the car was nice also. The graphics were OK, and the amount of guns, clothing, and veheicles to choose from was moderate.   Gameplay itself was decent. It was fun exploring the area and going after the criminals and getting paid for it. Most missions were fun to do and most of the time I did have a good team. After awhile however, the missions dd tend get repetative. Especially if the player is solo and searching for a mission/group. Many times I had gone with a team of 4 against a team of 2. Other times it was an equal match but the player levels were unbalanced. Whether or not I failed, the same mission would usually pop up after the next or right after that. Also, it's awesome when a player is doing great on a mission then all of a sudden becomes a High Value Target and everyone is alerted to that HVT. Now, that player that was doing great has around 20 players hunting their ♥♥♥ for a bounty. Usually they were killed within 15 seconds.  I'm honestly a bit mixed on the gun/car lasting only a few days. Guns I can understand, even the paid ones to *try* and balance the game. But I hated paying a lot for a car that would be gone in a few days. It would take awhile to get enough money to ..I guess one could say to 'rent' a vehicle since payment was little and I started to be matched against higher levels. The money I was saving then had to be used for a better weapon if I wanted even a chance at killing some. Even the default gun players receive at the start is fairly balanced. I've killed many with it. But it doesn't compare to a sniper rifle that is a one hit kill.   Most players kept to their self. Others were chatting on the global chat which was mostly friendly. The rest were of course people trolling. I only had trouble with a few and the rare person that laged like hell. (or hacked)  What I played was fun...  ...Till I was killed 22 times trying to get to a mission objective and being blown up by someone on the opposing team with a RPG. No matter where my team and I went, there was always somebody waiting in a corner, or at the objective. I did get to run over the person once though! Why stay for 22 deaths? I don't like to rage quit.   Since then I would drive around waiting to see some action pass by. Then when a group went by I would follow them to the objective then take the cars they stole from the civies and impound them for cash. Which was pretty good if they stole a high performance veheicle. Especially armored trucks. Oh, and the vehicle wasn't damaged too bad.  - I can't say I fully enjoyed the game since I died *alot* from people who used real currency to purchase their guns. However, because of that, I can't fully recommend the game. I could over look the matchmaking (since CoD did that alot to me) and the missions. But it doesn't work in the end. Think this qualifies as a 'Great concept, poor execution' kind of game for me.  ",

Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money.

Despite being the first to fire, being accurate with the rifle, hitting them 50 times (no joke) they can snipe you with a pistol or rush right up to you and kill you in 10 shots sometimes less.

The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.",

Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...",

Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken.

Don't get me wrong, this game does have a few good things that can be said about it. They actually put some work into a base storyline, that I feel could have done well if it's gameplay counterpart wasn't a pile of sh*t. 1. There really are nearly infinte amounts of customization options. If you're the kind of gamer who gets hot and bothered when you can change the shade of colours you never actually see, you'll be here a while.... 2. Aesthetics. The graphics in APB are pretty good, even above par in a few ways. The voice acting is also better than most I've heard. 3. Options. You can play the way you want. Maybe grab a rifle and sit on a rooftop, or climb in a van with your buds, grab some SMG's and have a good ol' fashioned drive-by.  But, the negatives are there as well, and I feel they seriously outdo the pros. 1. Free to Play.......Pay to Win. No matter how much In-game Cash you grind by doing missions and getting epic multi-kills, you can never actually buy a weapon. You rent them for a week......a week! One would think that this time limit would at least make the weapon worth your hard work right? Wrong. Shell out $20 real world and you can get a gun that takes the entire in game shop and blows it's face off.......forever. 2. Vehicles. Remember the drive-by I mentioned earlier? You might wanna forget that....because you can't call what you do in an APB vehicle driving. Every vehicle is slow and unresponsive, on average it takes a second before the vehicle will start turning the direction you told it to. And when it does turn, it's like being on a Canadian highway in December! 3. AI. I know handicapped people with better mechanics than this. Park your car in the middle of the road and the whole city is like a Sim avatar stuck behind a chair in the kitchen. 4. Matchmaking. This could be put in both pros and cons actually.... The matchmaking system is very intuitive. It matches players based on in game 'Threat-Level' The higher this level, the better. However, this only accounts for personal achievements. Say you win 30 matches back to back, rockin' your starter rifle. You'll get an impressive Threat-Level. But some chotch who wins some and loses some might get put in a lobby with you, and he paid for his loadout. You stand little chance and the sysytem has no clue.  There are probably more things I could say about APB Reloaded, but at this point....I'm ranting. And you probably didn't even read this far anyway.",

Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin.

Four times out of five, you're matched up against opponents that are -way- higher rank than you, and often have weapons that far outclass yours, simply because they've paid a few bucks.

I've heard about cheaters and hackers, but I don't recall ever encountering one, though it's hard to tell when many weapons are essentially 2-4 shot kills. The weapons are good and do their job right. The assault rifles are neither good nor bad at anything in particular, the shotguns are guarunteed kills at close range, snipers are excellent at long range. But the machine guns, those things are over powered. As stated before, the machine guns can destroy vehicles in about 2 or 3 seconds of sustained fire. Most people cruise around in their stock cop/criminal cars which can't withstand too much fire and end up dead. They also have insane range and accuracy. The only weakness I've heard about them is that they suffer an absolutely terrible drop in accuracy when moving, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as it claims since I've been bum rushed by several people who just spray-n-pray. The only thing good about the game is the game modes and progression system, but with the problems I mentioned before one would have to take this with a mountain of salt. Like I said at the begginning of my review, it's a good concept that suffers from bad design and maintenance.",

Evidently, you aren't supposed to go for objectives until the enemy is right there. Never heard of such a thing. And if you do, your own teammates kill you. Which I can get over. No biggie. But they are RUDE. From their mouths, to how they treat one another. Disgusting behavior. And after I saw the garbage that was in the game, and was treated like crap, I became the garbage which I regret, and went to their level. So although the game itself is fun, the community certainly isn't. And since you have no choice but to play with the community, as it's not a 1 player game, you are stuck, and this makes this game not recommendable.",

While still an addicting game that i feel has mastered the art of virtual 'cops and robbers' gameplay, it is sadly neglected all too often by the very company that is failing to keep it under their control.  The game is very poorly optimized, leaving it laggy at times to the point of complete unplayability, reguardless of how powerful your computer is. The amount of cheaters/hackers that roam is more than alarming and quite possibly the most i have ever seen in any game i have ever played.  The fact it is free to play also means that any cheater that is caught and banned can just make a new account, rejoin, and be back to cheating again in less than 5 minutes. The fact players know this leads to an ever growing population of cheaters. There needs to be a better form of anti cheat which not only bans a cheater/hacker but also prevents them from returning.   The gameplay within itself, however, is a lot of fun, mastering each gun is a unique challenge in its own.  Playing with friends can lead to tears of laughter, as long as you dont take it all too seriously anyways.  The character customization possibilities are endless and probably my favorite part about this game, theres just an infinite number of ways you can customize your character.  Servers are constantly getting ddosed by hackers anymore and G1 appears to care very little about anything at all except for farming money of their, more often than not, armas products. Gamersfirst? more like Moneyfirst. They feed the community lies and broken promises so often its a wonder how the company is even still running at all.  This game is AIDS, plain and simple.

            "review_text": "Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.",

I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money...

I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.",

The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.",

I haven't played it for 6 months, but I can tell you everything about it.  What I really loved about the game itself was:  - The customization features - The cars, weapons, and clothing  - Cooperative players (If you have friends)  But here, are reasons why this game came into a disappointment:  - Bad shooting mechanics - Bad gaming optimization - Laggy servers - Noxious community among players (Hackers, idiots, aimbots, cheaters, etc.) - Unbalanced matchmaking - Misleading tutorials - Too much microtransactions - Greedy developers  What I overall think about the game itself is that it's cool in its own way, but it's not a game that you'll like to play very often. I would recommend this game, but not at the same time. You're free to try it for yourself if you like, but be cautious of what you're gonna face in the game.   In the end, I'll give this game a rating of 5/10.",

And i'm always a sucker for games with the level of customization that APB has. However: The hacking is absolutely ridiculous. It takes two shots to kill someone with a sniper rifle, but people will kill you with two bullets from a side arm. Then there's the ability to shoot through walls (not as bad as CS used to be). Many times i will hit the wall I'm hiding behind, with half my body exposed. But other people will have barely a head showing, and waste you.   I try to play bad, so I can go back down in threat, where the hackers are not prominent. But it's tedious. If you can tolerate the hacks, it's a great game. I will unlikely spend money on this until they fix that. I'd uninstal entirely, but my character looks badass.",

            "review_text": "I'll be honest as I possibly can be with this review in particular.  The game is tough when you start out (ofcourse, because ALL games do), and when you progress on, it becomes easier. I'll say it again, tough when starting out... easier when you keep playing. The only thing that most people dont realize and should. There are also, positive and nevative things to the game (again, all games do), but to be basic, i'll narrow it down to the exact things that are good and bad about this game.  So, whats good is, theres huge customization on just characters alone, as well as symbols and audio, with its own feel for car physics and mechanics that are actually quite interresting and unique.  What is bad, is nothing of the actual game its self, but the people who play it. I wont lie, the majority of guns are quite difficult to handle, which its not that bad if you think about it, just means you need to try... since you cant win anything by doing nothing. But, the majority of people that tend to play this game on a daily basis, end up ruining it for everyone, including themselves. Stupid, is it not? Sadly, these are all of the ones who end up cheating just because they dont bother to play the game, or just do it because they feel powerful and have no actual lives to do anything but ruin things for everyone.  If you can do just one thing, maybe... just maybe, I can truely recommend this game to anyone. That one thing is: Try, without ruining everything, even for other fellow players who desperately attempt to make a good clean day of APB:Reloaded.",

Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.",
