            "review_text": "PROS: *Great variety of skills across unlockable classes *Balanced combat, with perhaps some minor exceptions *Persistent upgrades for health, experience, etc. across playthroughs *Dungeon sizes are just right *Amusing, somewhat dark story and dialogue *Three difficulty settings that can be changed at any time, the last of which changes enemy behavior instead of merely increasing health or damage *Good art and music *Changing weapons and armor affects character appearance *Monetary incentives for finishing each level with each class  NEUTRAL: *Optional town-building elements have no practical value  CONS: *Enemy variety is a little disappointing; many are re-used across the game *Some classes feel weaker or less versatile than others *One boss is used three times *A couple of enemies are not well-designed *Balance issues on later levels on savage difficulty *Perhaps too long *Only a handful of environments *A few harmless bugs  GAME LENGTH: With the new savage difficulty update, achievement hunters could easily need over 20 hours to finish. Those who simply want to finish the game with a single class could need as little as 4 hours.  SCORE: 7.8 out of 10  At the beginning of the game, the player has only a single class (farmer) and no special equipment. By finishing levels, the player unlocks new classes (warrior, archer, rogue, vampire, and wizard), each with 4 unique and appropriate skills that genuinely make them feel different. By opening chests, he unlocks mostly class-specific equipment in the shop that, once purchased, is permanently available for future runs.  Items don't boost damage or defense directly, but affect gameplay. Weapons might recover a small amount of the player's health upon enemy kills or cast chains of fire, armor might simply offer more health or recover health upon breaking pots, accessories might boost fire damage or give a 20% chance to revive with full health upon death, and consumables might heal health or stamina or turn all nearby enemies into pots. The variety of consumables here is excellent and, while I would not say the same about the weapons, armor, or accessories, they still provide players with strategic options: maximize damage and area of effect, prolong survival, or stop enemy movement. Finally, if the player finds any of these items during a run, he has the option to discard or equip it immediately. If it's a consumable item, he can use it, keep it (only one at a time), or sell it on the spot.  Combat is turn-based, with the player always moving or attacking first and all enemies moving second simultaneously. The player can use a normal attack that costs no stamina or one of his four skills, which cost anywhere from 1 to 3 stamina out of a pool of 5. Since killing any enemy recovers 1-2 stamina, almost all non-boss enemies die in one or two hits, and skills have no cooldown, combat consists largely of skill usage, unlike in games where the player is forced to use normal attacks most of the time or drink mana potions just to be able to use skills. This does wonders for the feel of combat and lets the uniqueness of each class shine.  The player obtains skills upon leveling up, which grants a single point. The first three skills are immediately available and max out at the third upgrade while the fourth skill unlocks at level 5 and maxes out at the second upgrade. Most skills feel useful and each upgrade definitely is. For example, the archer's first skill allows him to shoot any visible enemy at level 1, but the next level grants him a 5% bonus (and at level 3, a 10% bonus) to critical hit chance for every empty square around him. However, the developer kept balance in mind, so the player cannot simply upgrade the same skill with each level. The archer must wait another level or two before he can get his second upgrade and then another level before he can get the third. Of course, the player's level is reset after death or killing that area's boss.  The game is split into 10 areas, each with a quest connected to the story, though that quest always comes down to defeating a boss. Dungeon sizes are fairly small, consisting of 5 or fewer floors of varying sizes, including a floor devoted to that level's boss. All of this means that, while there is a lot of game here, the player is only forced to sit through a few levels at a time, allowing him to return to town to spend money at the shop for persistent upgrades or to stop playing if he has other things to do. This feature and the constant use of skills in combat make the game perhaps a bit more casual, but that is not unwelcome.  Unfortunately, despite being broken up into 10 levels, the game drags on a bit, especially if one is interested in completing every level with every class, which is a requirement for some of the achievements. This is largely attributable to a lack of enemy variety. From the first to the last level, slimes make up the majority of enemies, and while different slimes have different properties on death (exploding or leaving residue behind that might cause damage), it becomes tedious to deal with them constantly. In fact, they even come in larger varieties that spawn three smaller ones on death, some of which leave behind residue that spawns  more  of them if the player does not walk over that residue. (On savage difficulty, they create three times more residue, which  even further  compounds the problem!) It does help that every enemy has its own unique property, like a goatman that charges or a frog that can pull the player or other monsters to it, but most enemies are used from the early game all the way to the end. For story-related reasons, one boss is even used three times in a row. Little variety is bad enough, but it's worse when one feels like he has been fighting the same monsters for the entire game.  Additionally, I have to question the design of some of the enemies. First, there is a fish that spawns with a connected, identical companion. The two must be killed at the same time, otherwise they immediately respawn. The trouble here is that the player may lack equipment or skills that do damage over an area, either because he hasn't unlocked them yet or because he made a strategic choice to focus on equipment or skills that are better suited to single encounters. Second, there is a mushroom in the later levels who can summon portals that release 3 more monsters each. The trouble is that this mushroom runs on sight and continues to summon portals every few turns. If there is a group of enemies or another such mushroom in the area, a crowd can quickly form, preventing some classes from being able to kill the mushroom. And this is just on normal difficulty. An easy fix to both cases and to the respawning slimes on savage difficulty is to limit the number of times that an enemy can summon a portal or respawn. These enemies would remain obnoxious, but they would no longer create impossible scenarios or force the player to flee, underleveled, to the next level of the dungeon.  Right now, some classes do have an advantage against such enemies without any real weakness against others. The wizard, for example, can teleport to any tile on the screen, summon 3 minions, and use a powerful area attack. Once I unlocked him, I equipped him with a staff that does additional area damage and breezed through the entire game. I could pull it off with the archer, too, but I would have much more trouble with classes like the farmer and vampire, particularly on savage difficulty.  Finally, there are some minor bugs (e.g. spawned wisps sometimes do nothing) and annoyances (e.g. being unable to drop items to use them later), but they have no real impact on my score.  For its combat, classes, persistent elements, art, and manageable dungeon sizes, but also for some questionable enemy design and a lack of enemy variety, I give Sproggiwood a 7.8 out of 10.",

It is also a rogue-like in the same vein as Shiren the Wanderer, or Chun Soft's other Mystery Dungeon games, so it is essentially a sweet little kitten that will kick you in the fork, steal your car, and then set fire to your house all the while you wonder how something so adorable could be so evil.",

            "review_text": "Alright, here is the deal -  Sproggiwood  is a well-made game that is definately enjoyable, but overall feels very 'light' and shallow in places as I will explain below. The usual crowd that is interested in hearing what I have to say, and shares my tastes, would do themselves a favor to just buy this developer's other game:  Caves of Qud .    Sproggiwood  checks all the appropriate boxes on the list of what makes up a solid roguelike game, but ultimately falls short of being 'excellent' by literally taking no design risks.  There is nothing new or fresh here, at all. The artwork is quite polished, but I can't ever shake the feeling that it looks mobile (and it is available for mobile). The best/funnest part of the game is learning the enemy behavior and patterns, which is completely necessary if you want to make any progress. That part is nicely done.    Essentially, there is a series of linear levels (each one is randomly generated, I believe), and you choose what character class you want to tackle the dungeon with.  Each character definately feels different, and requires substantially different strategy to be successful with. There are persistant upgrades, such as different weapons, armor and consumables that you can start with. You also level up stats, such as item cost and how fast you gain experience.   Because you unlock characters as you go, you are then able to revisit old levels and complete them with the new characters. This is basically mandatory so you can get more money for persistant upgrades, which I think must be leveled up a bit to even be able to finish the game. This part starts to feel grindy, but hey, roguelikes/lites have been using this strategy for years and it works to a certain extent.   The music is truly outstanding in  Sproggiwood .  Like it should win an award or something. It fits really well, and is just perfectly done.    Pros:  +A technically well crafted roguelike that is simple to learn compared to traditional roguelikes. This title feels 'light' and perhaps even edges on a mobile-vibe at times. Not necessarily the worst thing - I think it is very accessible. Of course I prefer the richness of  Caves of Qud , but thats me. +Controller support is nice. +Music is outstanding. +Learning the enemy behavior is fun and rewarding.   Cons:  -The pastel color choice for selecting 'yes' or 'no' buttons in a menu is really bad. We made mistake choices a couple of times that really gets the blood boiling. Insult to injury, sometimes the colors are inverted in different menus. Just needs to highlight the choice better. -The whole village-building thing feels like an afterthought. In fact, I heard from a friend that it was supposed to end up being beefier, but this is what we got. It's fine, but that part screams mobile, too (in the sense of pointless cosmetic building).   Once again, not a bad game at all, but most fans of roguelikes will leave wanting more.  Get it on sale.  ---   Very strange disclosure: I did get this title for free from the developer, but it was not in exchange for a review or any feedback. I sent him a gift key for a game (he didn't ask for it or anything), and he sent me a key for this title. I am grateful for the exchange. So, I did get this for free, but it was just a friendly trade - no review was ever requested. ",

It blends a variety of game features such as stages with star ratings, RPG elements like equipment upgrades and purchases, and in-stage leveling. It is not the type of game where you follow a character that you develop over the course of the game.   The 'village' building element, so far, feels like little more than decoration and has little value other than the fun of organizing and clicking on residence - not my jam, but some people like that. The story also feels a bit lacking. But hey, it is meant to be a casual game, not an deep drama.   It is not overly easy - as you do 'die' and fail to pass stages until you save enough coin to upgrade your heros' equipment and such. The stages generate with enough variability so that it is not repetitive. All in all, it is a good time killer and worth the $10 or so.",

It has a slightly puzzly feel to it, to make it out of some tough situations when your surronded by enemies often requires you to think your way out and use your characters abilities to their fullest.  It gets repetitive after a while, when that happens switch characters or take a break.  Overall I would definitely recomend this game.",

            "review_text": "Sproggiwood, developed by FreeHold Games, puts you in the role of a Cloghead individual who has been pulled from another dimension to give this world another shot. Apparently someone has enough pull for a redo. This is a rouge-like adventure game in which you will have to take on many dungeons to see if you can make this world thrive instead of waste away. The problem is that you are not the only being running around, it turns out that a race of Mushrooms is also taking up residence in this world, and it would appear no matter how many times you interact with them you are always going to cause more damage than good.  Graphically this game is a 3/4 view 3Dish game in which you will thrive, or die, in a square grid world. The thing about this game is that since it is rogue-like, you are going to deal with randomized dungeons. That's not to say that the game length with change dramatically between playthroughs, but the levels will always look different, and might contain different enemies that you will have to deal with. Speaking of enemies, I have to say that I like the simple, yet strong design. Yes there are a lot of gelatinous cubes moving around, but the subtle differences in color (yellow, pink, black, blue, etc) can mean a ton of different effects that might make your adventure a bit more perilous. The color scheme is definitely light-hearted, you are not going to get nightmares from playing through the game. Well at least not the look of the game, you might end up having nightmares of being surrounded by enemies that tear you to shreds because you were not careful enough.  To stop you from being torn to shreds you will have the ability of collecting items in your journey. Now the one thing that you have to watch out for is that since this is a rogue-like game, when you enter a new dungeon it is essentially a new you, you are going to start back at level 1. The thing is that the items (potions, armor, weapons, scrolls, etc) they can be purchased so that you can start at a slight advantage in the next dungeon you find yourself in. Since we are talking about items and weapons, and whatnot one of the BIGGEST things for me when I think of changing equipment, is I want to see an actual change in the character, and this game delivers. Are you wearing different armor, well then you are going to look different. Are you using a new weapon, well your weapon will look different. The little things, like this, usually make the game that much more solid.  Now lets get into the one thing that was a bit of a letdown for me, and fortunately or unfortunately it is not a bug. I'm talking about the music in the game. I liked it, in every level, I thought it was subtle, blended well with the game, and wasn't abrasive to hear in a loop. The thing is that design-wise the music is set to drop out and come back after a certain amount of time, which will leave you playing your game, in which all the rest of the sounds work, in silence.  The controls of the game are REALLY easy to pick up, you are going to move left, right, up, and down. You are going to use the 1-5 button for skills, and any choices that require other button presses will be clearly labeled for you so that there is no confusion. Oh and the space bar is your friend if you want to wait a turn and have the enemy move that one extra spot so you don't have to take damage first.  So I don't know what I was expecting out of this game, but what I got was something that I couldn't put down. I decided to test this game out as one of the games I would play during my Extra-Life, 24 hour game-a-thon. The thing is that I kept coming back to this game. It wasn't that it was too easy, in fact there are still many levels that I'm not able to defeat with specific characters, but it was the fact that I knew what I was getting into, I saw the challenge, and it was an easy one to accept over and over again. You see the ease in the ability to pick up the game, understand the game, and play it, made it so that I just had to keep coming back to see if the little bit of time I took off would be enough for the gaming gods to look down upon me and guide me through another level so that I could unlock more of the game.  Now it is possible to play the game all the way through with just one character, but where's the fun in that. You start of as the farmer class, and although it does have some fun special attacks, it is not my favorite class to play as. You also have the warrior, archer, thief, vampire, and wizard. Personally I'm all about the warrior with his attack that will attack every square around him, this has saved my bacon more times than I can count. It also helps to have the shield ability which can absorb a couple of rounds of damage when your life is on the line. I do want to point out, however, that all the other classes are excellent, and well balanced. I do enjoy playing as the thief, and the rest of the gang. If you play this game, you should too, especially since for each class you get through a level you get a bonus of gold, which in turn can greatly help you.  So lets talk about the gold, the gold is the magical substance that will allow you to level up your buildings which in turn will help your character level up faster, have more hit points, interact with more unique items, etc. You also can use the gold towards unlocking items, weapons, armor, and more so that you can choose to start off with it at the beginning of a level.  Look here's the deal, if you don't really like turn-based, RPG, randomized dungeons, which I can't for the life of me figure out how you couldn't like those things, then this is not the game for you, but if you like those things, as I believe most should, then you need to get this game pronto. It is solid, challenging, fun, and I personally can't wait to dive right back in to see if I can't get another class through a level that I have sadly not conquered with yet. This game gets a 9.5 out of 10.",
