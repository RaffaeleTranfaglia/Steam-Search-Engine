Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.  There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps &amp; physics require mastery.  If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by &amp; fail. ;)  I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.  It's worth the price &amp; if on sale it's a no-brainer.",

No steering involved, just throttle, brake (yes - you do need it occaisionally!) and balance. Simple bike changes (4 versions of 3 components) help you to go faster, jump higher or rotate faster - but never all three, so optimising for each track will help those scores. Lots of tracks, often with several routes, and cash to collect in easy / difficult / hidden places. Cash is used to unlock the bike changes - so best to collect what you can early.  Often on sale and well worth whatever you end up paying for it... What more praise can I give?  P.S. Win 7 (64 bit) friendly in my experience - No Crashes",

The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. The addition of on-track items to pick up (cash bags) was great, rider customization options are good, the tracks and physics are excellent, and the soundtrack is great.
