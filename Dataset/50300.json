            "review_text": "Spec Ops: The Line might be dismissed at first glance for being just another modern military shooter. That assumption couldn’t be more wrong though.  Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Spec Ops provides one of the strongest and mature narratives in recent memory.  The story revolves around Captain Walker and his two wingmen, Lugo and Adams. Their latest mission sends them to a post-catastrophic Dubai to find Colonel Konrad who was in charge of evacuating the civilian population. Captain Walker is often forced to make difficult decisions and any pretense of him being some badass hero is quickly removed as it's clear that sometimes there's no correct decision to make. The character progression is strong and the voice acting is phenomenal.  The art direction is spectacular as Dubai provides almost a surreal experience. When you’re not avoiding sandstorms, you'll travel through luxury hotels and buildings that have all been submerged in sand. The game also gives you a taste of PTSD as you’re sometimes left wondering whether or not certain things are real.  The combat plays out similarly to other third person shooters. It will have you taking cover, blind firing and issuing commands to your squad mates. The AI is well done, making Lugo and Adams feel very capable while the enemy AI on the other hand could use a bit of work. The combat is solid but it makes no attempt to do anything new or innovative.  The soundtrack is fantastic, including a lot of real songs along with ambient guitar pieces that match the mood perfectly. The inclusion of Jimi Hendrix and other classics really give the game an ‘Apocalypse Now’ type of feel which was another Heart of Darkness adaptation.  Unfortunately, Spec Ops is fairly short (around 5 hours) but the different endings offer some incentive to replay the game. There’s a multiplayer mode that offers a few different game types, weapons, and stages but it feels a bit tacked on. It’s fairly clear that Spec Ops was designed to be experienced as a single player game primarily and it’s one I strongly recommend.  For a more detailed review, here’s a video by my friend and fellow reviewer, Trent:          YouTube™ Video:  Analog Reviews: Spec Ops: The Line&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "It's been a year since I picked up the game, and I still cannot bear to play it again when I think of what overcame me when I finished the game.  As my playtime indicates, I finished this in a massive rush. I played from 11pm to 4am, expecting that the game was some sort of quick-play game that I could put down easily at any time, like, say, call of duty (oh good grief, even the comparison makes me cringe). I was so driven to finish the game   (the mission, as it were) much like Walker was  . This revelation made me hate myself beyond belief, as I realized the very same determination, the self-same urge to commit to a goal made me ignore warning signs all over the place. This game makes you truly explore yourself, the deepest darkest recesses of your psyche where the hidden threads of psychopathy lie.   When I finally finished the game at 4am, I was unable to sleep. I stayed awake, tormented by what I had done   and the face of the white phosphorus burnt mother and child  . I kept telling myself: 'This is a game. Get over it and get to sleep.', but I just couldn't get over the fact that at the heart of every human is the capability to take things to an extreme in order to pursue a perceived greater good. It is the very thing that drives the best of humanity and the worst of humanity. Medical scientists pursuing a cure, versus the extremists ♥♥♥♥ing up Syria as I type this. This game revealed an inner heart of darkness that needs to be understood, addressed and controlled. If only every one of us could think about it with the due weight and clarity that is needed in such a discussion.  Play the game, and finish it, please. Do yourself a favour and finish it. Understand how dangerous it is to be unaware of your own actions, and bloody well learn from it.",

I've had many of those kids play this game, and *No spoilers* when they reach a certain point in the game they actually get really quite and stop making jokes. This is a wonderful trip into the dark side of war; the side of war we never see, or hear about. They say there are always two sides to every story; well this is the story you never hear about.   It's a beautiful mind trip into the (getting deep here yo) personal working's of the human mind, and the effects that war has on it. Very few games have actually made me feel for the consequences of my actions before. That is the sign of a game truly immersing you within itself.   A wonderful buy, perhaps a bit generic with the gameplay at times, but the story makes up for it in all ways. You owe it to yourself to play this game.",

I received this game through a Humble Bundle, and man, I am not disappointed whatsoever. The gameplay is on point, the story is on point, the characters are on point. You feel like you ARE the main character, Walker. And Walker is voice acted by Nolan North? Hell to the yes. The choices you have to make are brain teasing, rage inducing, and wowza! However, there is only one con, the game is extremely short, I beat it in exactly six hours. For me, that was only two sittings, but I still got very involved into the story. I felt as if I was actually there, suffering from PTSD. I picked all the choices based on what I would do in real life, and I'm not regretting anything. Amazing story! Amazing everything!

It kicks you in the balls and doesn't let you get up.  The game reminds me Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Man. Both games are typical third person shooters, with self regenerating health, cover systems and dynamic camera. But their story makes them unique. What is this game about? Basicly it's a adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'.  It starts as a story about 3 commando soldiers on a rescue mission in Dubai. Because of misunderstanding and coincidence it turns to something much worse.  In my opinion it's a game about war crime, about sacrificing morality or humanity for accomplishing your goals. It shows how easy war can change into total massacre because of small factors. You should play SO:TL and interpret it for yourself. Graphically the game is really OK, mostly because of original location and beautiful map design.  What's really important - the game is very detailed. As our characters get deeper and deeper into Dubai conflict they are changing both physically and mentally. They're getting wounds, their equipment is getting damaged, they speak and act differently. They are even executing the enemies with more aggression and hate. Even the tips showing during the loading screens are becoming cynical. The game itself is criticising your actions, it oftens breaks the 4th wall. The shooting mechanics are good, same as the camera. I didn't have any problems with the technical aspects of the game. What makes the game even better is the soundtrack. It suits every single scene in the game, and makes me want to listen it even after the game. If you've watched 'Apocalypse Now' - you'll feel familliar.  Try it. You will get suprised, how this seemingly generic shooter is going to shock you. It's brilliant. It will definetely put your morality on a test. Like no other shooter previously.",

If you were to ask me about this game purely based on genre, I would tell you it's a third person shooter where a yankee comes in a foreign land and shoots people. Sounds boring and overplayed, right? That is the impression I had when I bought this game. What I found, as stated beforehand, is the best game ever made.  Sure, Grand Theft Auto V, San Andreas and the Witcher III all have large worlds to explore in and much to do. However, this game is the only one I have played up til now that is   perfect  . It is absolutely infalible.  I've just finished my first playthrough of the game, and let me tell you that this game exposes me and humiliates me simply by giving me a situation where lives hang on the line and the choice on how to act. I have been kept awake by the decisions I have made in this game and what they tell me about myself.  The blurb of this game says it's 'designed to question players' morality'.   You're damn ♥♥♥♥ing right it questioned my morality.      This   is what videogames can do that no other kind of entertainment can do:  challenge the player.  Give him responsibility and tell him to own it. I wasn't able to tell Upham to save Mellish    when he watched on in cowardice as he got stabbed,    so I felt free to trash him in frustration. I wasn't able to be mad at the dealer who shot the litle girl in Pac's 'Dopefiend's Diner', so I felt absolved from guilt. Spec Ops: The Line put up a ♥♥♥♥ing mirror to my face and said to me  you're no better than the rest of us  and it was 100% right.

Not as the glorified, heroic, romanticized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that we get stuffed with from games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but as horror, pure, unfiltered horror. If you felt like the moral choices in games like Fallout punched you in the gut, what you'll have to do in Spec Ops will leave you feel like the game punched you in the face, wrenched open your jaw, reached down your throat and ripped out your guts.  Spec Ops makes the player feel what the main character is going through, but not simply via making you identify with the character you play. Its gameplay, world design and everything makes you feel uncomfortable, nauseous and morally torn apart. It really is brilliantly crafted.  I'll stop here to avoid possible spoilers or how you perceive the game while playing, but if you feel like dropping the game after playing for an hour because the combat feels generic and/or bad, please, please don't do that and press on, it's well worth it.

Now, this introduction perfectly fits (more or less) into the message of the game. Are violent games really just games, you play and get an achievement for your 50th headshot? Is it okay to sit back and enjoy war, while you are the hero, kicking the ♥♥♥ of all the terrorist scum that threatens to destroy the world? I can't really compare Spec Ops: The Line to Battlefield, Call of Duty setting-wise or Gears of War and Mass Effect gameplay-wise, as I've never played them. But what I can say is, that, in my humble opinion, Spec Ops: The Line is a masterpiece. Not without its flaws, but a masterpiece nonetheless.  Gameplaywise, you get the typical brown modern war 3rd person shooter thingy. What do you expect? You play a badass dude to murder tons of evil dudes. Simple as that. But storywise, you are encountered by some moral questions, you might not have asked you yet. And suddenly, all the dull gameplay makes sense in a more complex way.  I don't want to spoil too much here, so I'll keep it short: If you are expecting a breakthrough in modern warfare gameplay and gunfights, this game is nothing for you. If you are interested in a good and gripping story, with one ore the other twist and an underlying message, you must play this game, even if you don't care about war shooters, like me.

Additionally there are choices that you make throughout the game, and it's not just 'go right or go left' as the saying goes 'indecision is a choice'. In the words of William T. Sherman we hear the well known quote 'War is Hell' To be quite honest not very many shooter games run with that concept, in Spec Ops: The Line, you will see far more gritty details of consequences of warfare... and the people effected.  As a final note regarding the story length, I after playing through the game my first time I put in 5.5 hours. I generally play slower trying to find extra items and do restarts for achievements, so that should be longer then a standard player will take to get through the game.    Game Play:  Spec Ops: the line is a cover-based third person shooter, meaning while you're being shot at you will move from cover to cover, most of the mechanics are quite straight forward, but do take some getting used too, you can jump over cover, change cover quickly by looking or pressing a movement key in that direction THEN pressing Space, there is a fair bit of learning to be had. It should be noted that the controls will take some getting used too, I had already played a few third person shooters so those old controls were messing me up while I was trying to learn the new ones. Once you learn the controls the rest of the game is quite enjoyable to play through. Even if you're unfamiliar with cover-based-shooters the starting difficulty is friendly enough that you can get the hang of it while gunning down your foes. (I would still recommend getting used to hiding behind cover)   Achievements:  There are 50 Achievements in Spec Ops: The Line, after my first play through I had 33 of those achievements, there are four achievement category types: Find the lintel (collection), Get kills or special kills with weapons, Make this choice in the story, and standard story quests.   Price  Spec Ops: The Line is priced at $29.99, by this point most people should be used to games (especially shooters) being priced there, as I always say 'I recommend waiting for a sale'.    Conclusion:  Spec Ops: The line will appeal most to people who enjoy the two qualities of 'Third person shooter', and 'story telling'. If you just want a shooter where you run in and pew pew pew, this isn't the right game for you. If you like playing games with meaningful stories, making hard ethical decisions while gaming or just looking for a change of pace this game will provide it. To quickly recap: Story - Outstanding story telling methods. Game Play - Controls might be a bit tricky at first, but the cover based combat is very good. Achievements - Pretty Standard, there are a few tricky looking achievements though. Price - Standard, wait for a sale. ",

            "review_text": "Spec Ops: The Line is a towering Skyscraper among average buildings. It doesn't stray far from the typical MMS formula: lots of killing, fun but plain combat, and handholding from the AI. Where it does set its self apart, is the campaign. While not the most finely crafted narritive I have experienced, it does lend its self with a serious attitude that leaves the player pondering on the morality of their choices. As a fan of games where the story is big, evident and emotional, it hit the spot for a few hous (It only took 7 hours to complete the campaign). Although the campaign quite linear, the game often offers you choices in both the story, and in gameplay, but these choices are black and white, very little middle ground is to be had.  It is a beautiful looking game; there are many times when I was on a tall building and I looked out into the horizon, and just stayed, admiring the view. It runs well too, I was able to play it on almost all the max settings, 1080p at 60FPS with only a GTX460m.  I recomend this game to anyone who likes a good story, or is a massive fan of the MMS genre.",

No, this is not sir, this is an engaging tale of survival amidst the 'Heart of Brightness in Dubai', exlporing themes commonly overlooked in other games of the genre. Here 'The Line' is definetely getting crossed and in the end there was never any other choice than the way we advanced to the climax.  While some players may be complaining about certain events in the game that might make you feel bad, it should make you think about war and what's going on - or better what is/may/might happen in a warzone. Thus Spec Ops The Line becomes one of those rare to find 'anti-war' titles. An arousing story that shouldn't upset us but make us think.  ",

Without spoiling anything, the story and plot are completely beautiful and heartwrenching, on the edge of your seat surprising, and will completely question your morales and those of the characters you interact and meet. I jumped in expecting another mindless shooter with loose story, but found myself in love with this game and its story.  On the technical aspect, the gameplay is relatively simple and easy. Suicide difficulty is not incredibly challenging, but a large factor of combat is to utilise your Delta squad and hide behind cover. The game can be completed in under 7 hours, probably less, which seems perfect as the story isn't drawn on and combat seems fast enough behind cover that you aren't getting entirely bored.   Graphically, I am also surprised at how beautiful this game can look. Your Delta squad continues to degrade and gain battle scars, blood, and torn clothing as the game progresses and otherwise looks like days of fighting in Dubai. The scenery and city looks amazing as well! I play with a GIGABYTE P35K-1 with nVidia GTX 765m and ran everything to the max and had no flops.

It plays on your psyche, messes with your head, and makes you question why you even play games like this. It's a critique of the entire genre, one that desperately needed to be made. Why do we, as gamers, typically like to shoot things for fun? Is killing people in a video game truly harmless? If so, should we still enjoy it as much as we do?  The story draws from some classics for inspiration (most notably Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad), but it takes what it needs and expands on the rest. It takes some classic conventions, and finds a way to use that to tell its own story, and tell a completely new and fresh message.  'To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless.'",

And looking at the metacritic score and the name itself I rather expected it to be another generic, mediocre shooter. Oh boy, I couldn't have been more wrong!!  Gameplaywise it totally fits that description. It is a Gears of War-esque Shooter with slightly harsher damage model. Graphics are typical PS3/Xbox360 stuff. On the other hand the Leveldesign, though linear, is well made and creates a atmospheric and breathtaking environment I often found myself starring at in appreciation.  AI is decent. Squadmates are actually useful, taking cover and supporting you. Enemy AI will use suppressive and cover fire and try to flank you and also use grenades to flush you out of cover. Not gonna talk about MP. Yager studio themself said in an interview they didn't want it and they didn't do it. But Publisher 2K still made a different studio do it and shoe-horned it in... So what is the BIG selling point of this game? It's narrative!  If 'Apocalypse Now' (and for that matter 'Heart of Darkness') was a game, this is what it would be like. You will see plenty of references and parallels but rest assured, the game isn't just a copy. It has a story in its own right and goes its own ways.  As the story unfolds the lines between good and evil will start to dissolve until there is nothing left. You are being dragged into a conflict you have no concept off and always left one step behind. It keeps spiraling out of control fast as things turn sour and ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan - mainly because of your own ignorance - while you also have to bear the dire consequences of your actions.  On the metalevel the game is toying with alot of our preconceptions about Shooters, how violence and morality is represented and going into some other really deep stuff if you start thinking about it. SpecOps deliberately keeps giving the players red herrings, false targets and vague objectives and watches us kill again and again regardlessly. It says we need to blow up some people and we do it.  Because it is what needs to be done to accomplish the mission, right? 'We have no choice' like Cpt. Walker says. After all we are the good guys, fighting for a just cause with only the best intentions. Violence is a mere necessity.  Who would have thought those people might be unarmed civilians with children? And at the next loading screen you will be asked “Do you feel like a hero yet?” That effectively is what SpecOps is all about: to ♥♥♥♥ with your head and expectations. This game is a mind ♥♥♥♥ through and through.  Bottom line: don't let yourself be put off by it's looks, because there is more to it than it first seems. You should really give it a try!

Specs Ops: The Line has received much praise in weaving a horrific tale of an op gone wrong and the horrors of war. The game expertly puts you in the shoes of the main character as he teeters on the edge of sanity as his PTSD nightmare slowly consumes him. But in the end, the game's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.  The game not only encourages, but actively pushes you towards making crazy 'gamer' decisions that leads to the story spiraling out of control. Executing a downed enemy is a common video game mechanic that players have come to expect. Executing a downed enemy also gives you ammo for both weapons. However, should you choose to simply double-tap them with your gun, you will not spiral into madness at the same rate as a normal playthrough. Although there are many hidden third options to most of your choices, the game doesn't let you make any key decisions that sidestep everything.  Spec Ops: The Line does a great job of telling one story but fails to give you the other option of not succumbing to monstrosity. The gameplay is very tiresome and rather boring. Some would say that this is in part of the game trying to parody the meaninglessness of your generic modern First-Person-Shooters, but was this honestly the best way of going about this? Couldn't we have some fun going down this hellish slide?  I only wish that there were more choices that we could make that would better simulate PTSD/anxiety/paranoia. Why was there no choice to interact with the civillian NPCs in a way that would test our distrust of the local populace? Why was there no option to deal with groups that were obviously armed and cutious, yet not overtly hostile?  Overall, Spec Ops: The Line is a good game to experience but not necessarily to play. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy storytelling experiences.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of a great game that I will strongly recommend - but not to everyone. Indeed, it is both very similar to the basic TPS and very different from the other 'common' games.   For a start, the game mechanics don't really stand out from other shooters. The cover system is quite classic, the various weapons are nothing but well-made, enemies will most likely be coming by everywhere while shooting and yelling, the different AIs are correct, although your teammates will most of the time die while running, and there are shining red barrels that will explode when shot, as well as turrets and miniguns. Multiplayer is not worth the single player, and coop consists of alternative 2-players missions. Still, there are quite some original things, such as the contextual sand that will often allow you to get rid of a bunch of angry people or some eye-candies like the trees, walls or towers that fall when shot at.  That brings us to the fact that the game also looks like a movie. Indeed, it's very linear, as the main storyline can be summed up with a map. But it's also pretty scripted, and every single detail seems to have been done with care : the crashing helos, the falling towers, the blowing glass roofs, the collapsing quicksands... and even though sometimes, the action is spoiled by the too obvious script, it still succeeds in stressing the player, who'll eventually have to choose between four pretty different endings.  But the biggest part of the game revolves around the story. It may be a little hard to get why you get shot at so much in the beginning, but except a few odd things, the struggle between morality and immorality, allies and enemies, life and death is surprisingly thorough for a videogame. Indeed, there is nothing silly, as it's not a simple confrontation between good and evil, but rather a showdown of cruelty, selfishness, and deceived ideals meant to ensure the survival of a few people - or to wipe out guilt -, even if it leads to the death of dozens of - more or less - innocent people. There is no one truly good, not even civilians, and no one truly evil, not even soldiers, and there is thus no right choice to do : whatever you do, people will die, and you only can determine who - to some extent. Indeed, you'll end up doing things totally against common sense, only because it's the only way to face the others, who are already doing crazy things : it's a shocking experience that to burn people with white phosphorus and watch them burn while speaking to a dying burnt man. The dialogues are, by the way, pretty interesting, and the characters' psychologies are really profound, as both of your two teammates will have a different position on what happened, what you've done and what to do next. The interesting part is that it's hard to tell who to follow, as no one seems to be wrong, and in the end, you'll be the main problem down there - but you won't realize it before the last few minutes.  In the end, the story can be summed up as a descent into hell of a mad soldier caught in the spiral of violence and guilt, and the whole game leads the player through sceneries of despair and desolation, all along a depressing story tainted with blood. But if that game is a masterpiece, it's also thanks to the fact that the story is complex and  insanely  hard to get, as the main character is sliding into madness - which is also hard to get to which degree until the very last moments. Thus, this game isn't suitable for everyone, as it requires to be able to use their brain while playing, so as to make choices as well as to try to understand the story so far: you simply can't play just to shoot. That game is a proof that videogame is art.  P.S. : Somehow, the game made me remember of Prayer of the Refugee, by Rise Against. Just check the lyrics :p",

        {
            "review_text": "(semi)-SPOILERS   I get what the game was trying to do here, but for me, at least, it just doesn't work.  The game REQUIRES you to treat it like a CoD or Battlefield game, otherwise it doesn't make any sense. The plot railroads you into situations where you might logically just sit down and say 'Hey, guys, why are you shooting us? We literally haven't done anything to you.' But, hoping that the audience is used to shooters where you just shoot people for poorly explained reasons, the game just hopes you don't think for more than two seconds about what's happening.   Likewise, the fact that the character (and game)-defining moments railroad you into a 'choice' removes all feelings of personal responsibility and empathy that they spend so long building up. Call me cynical, but if you give me a game and force me to do something to progress, that has the same impact as follows: 'Hey, you literally -have- to kick that puppy to continue the story' 'Okay, I guess.' 'OH MY GOD HOW COULD YOU, YOU MONSTER' Of course, these forced 'choices' are required, because barely anyone would actually chose to do it this way if they were given the choice. Most people aren't ♥♥♥♥ing psychopaths.  BUT the story requires you to act like a psychopath in order to make sense. This lead to me, trodding along acting fairly sensibly, then the game forcing me to do something horrid, then scolding me for doing that thing that it forced me to do. There were one or two moments that actually let you choose what to do at some points, and when one of them went wrong, that was when I actually felt terrible, because it was MY choice that lead to this, and not the the plot railroading me.  I came out of this experience a bit unfufilled, really. I had acted sensibly, trying to make logical choices where I could; not killing civillians, trying to stop people from shooting me on sight, even going as far to flashbang soldiers to see if I could just get their attention for a moment. Of course, this doesn't work, because the plot demands that you kill people. Frankly, this gave me some cognitive dissonance, because, to me, it was abundantly clear that we were fighting the 'bad guys' for no reason, and yet there was no way of acting on this understanding. Then, later, the game shouts at you 'WHY DID YOU KILL ALL THESE PEOPLE?' Gee, I don't know, because you didn't give me a choice?  I almost feel as though Spec Ops plays it's hand too soon, immediately trying to make you feel guilty for the people that you were forced to kill not ten seconds ago. This results in that cognitive dissonance I mentioned earlier. I know I'm fighting these guys for no reason, and that I just killed them in a super-not-okay way, but I had to, because the plot demands it. I think the story would have made so much more sense had they acted more like a modern shooter, romanticising things like WP, or drones, biological weapons or something, and giving you the choice to use them, but tricking the players into doing so because why wouldn't you? It's way more fun, cooler and easier than having to shoot everyone yourself, right? Instead, the game actively dissuades the player from using WP, which detracts from what it's trying to do, which is trick players into becoming a psychopathic war criminal.  Compared to something like CoD or Battlefield, this game is definitely leagues ahead in terms of story. Maybe people who are really into the shooter genre might get more involved in this story, but me, coming from more RPG-esque games, where choice is commonplace, this just felt linear and annoying, because I knew what I wanted to do, but I just wasn't given the option. Still, points for trying to reverse some genre tropes and using your shooter knowledge against you.",

IMO  -Gameplay : i personally think you can't speed run this game bcz its really need tactic and really depends on your patience. even on normal difficulty this game is really something. just stay at cover. try standing for like 3 seconds, youre dead.  -Sounds &amp; Graphics : good enough for me. but the scenery on this game looks really awesome can't deny that. even dead bodies are looks great to me :v  (-) Cons : is kinda hard to control when youre trying to run from cover to cover. so i think the control is kinda messed up somehow.

When you watch a movie and you're still thinking about it days later, you know you've seen something special. I am having that same feeling with this game.  I am not a big shooter player so I won't comment in detail on the gameplay mechanics or the difficulty, I found them both great, but the story and the artwork was incredible. I found myself rationalising the protagonist's choices as if they were my own. Even as events started to spiral out of control, I found myself trying to think about what I would do if it were my boots in the sand. I couldn't ever question Walker's decisions because they were always based on a truth he had compiled from an incomplete understanding of the situation, which was something I shared with him.   It's a three dimensional look at war, imaged in breathtaking scenes and with commendable voice-acting. Oftentimes, war is not as we traditionally define it. Decisions are not always based on what is good or bad, heroic or cowardly. They are often driven by interpretation of orders and gut-feel. And when dreadful things happen, do we really fully appreciate the toll on those that felt they had to pull the trigger, squinting though the fog of war?   This is a visceral and engaging experience which I highly recommend to gamers looking for something a bit different.",

It's kind of like 'Apocalypse Now!' with Dubai as the setting but that comparison is giving it a little too much credit. It's more like an ultraviolent summer blockbuster war movie. The story and dialogue come off hamfisted and silly at times. The voice acting is decent for the most part and the sound design is good.   I would've liked the guns to be louder and bullet snaps would be great for immersion. The shooting mechanics are satisfying and the intensity of the combat is what kept me coming back to 100% this game. It's no 'Red Orchestra' immersion wise, but I think it illustrates the horrors of war well in some ways. Enemies collapse and some suffer while clutching wounds or crawl away. They cough and whimper as blood pools around them. One thing they never do is surrender, which is an annoying trope of modern shooters. At least there are unarmed civilians on some levels, which goes against convention. The game also forces you into some bad situations with civilians which is a great way to show the ugliness of war.  The game looks fantastic, even years later and it's surreal to see Dubai turned into a wartorn blood soaked ruin. Every firefight is fun and challenging if played on the harder difficulty levels. It would've been nice to have stealth be more viable. It's also a little funny that a 3 man squad kills off thousands of enemies. I know it's supposed to be somewhat of a satire on the modern military shooter but I would've rather had 'Rainbow Six' style squad selection/commands and losses than 2 invulnerable baby sitters. I hope more games try to execute a 'military shooter gone horror' vibe. I really like that the game is a train wreck of bad events and it tries to make you feel responsible and bad for it, kind of like the Kane &amp; Lynch series. It was just a little too hamfisted, on rails and 'gamey' for that feeling to hit me, but I enjoyed the horrific descent into madness nonetheless. If you are looking for a solid 3rd person shooter with an intense atmosphere, definitely grab this game.   7/10",

I love it more than Portal, more than Half Life and more than CS GO. This game is underrated and didn't get the attention that it deserved.  Graphics and Audio- This game looks really good for 2012. The environments are rich and have so much detail. You can even use your surroundings to your advantage. The models look great for both characters and weapons. The only thing that I don't like about the graphics is that some cutscenes look worse than the actual game and they seem poorly rendered. The audio is also great and has a lot of depth to it, but the audio design seems simple. What I mean is that the stronger guns sound more powerful than the weaker guns, but this doesn't bother me. 93/100  Gameplay-This game plays kinda like Gears-of-War and shares some similar mechanics. For example, when you sprint your camera gets lower and your character is slouching. Also, you can vault over cover while behind it and you can switch cover if you are looking at it. But, the gunplay is different. Each gun is designed for a different situation. For example: most shotguns are ment for close range, the ARs are ment for medium range, the SMGs are ment for close-medium range and shooting while on the move and so on. The gameplay can get annoying at time since sometimes, while your character slides into cover, he can get riddled with bullets and even get killed. This gets really annoying and even frustrating at times. 84/100  Story- I'm not going to spoil you the story because it is just amazing. Once you play through it, you might leave with some unanswered questions. This is good becuase that means that this is a game that makes you think about what happened, what you did and if you really are the Walker you think you are. Also, there is a lot of character development. First you start off with three cocky Delta operatives and through out the story, they change and by the end, they are completely different characters. The story is the best I have ever seen in a video game. 100/100  Multiplayer- The multiplayer doesn't use the story so you don't really care if you loose or not and the game modes aren't even that great. It's just gunplay here. 65/100  Final Verdict-I highly recommend this game to anyone that is tired of CoD campaigns going over the top and making you think about what you are doing. Right now this game is $30 and I think that is a fair price. The Final score is an 85.5/100, but that is with the multiplayer. If you take it out than this game becomes a 92.33./100. The second score is more accurate and if multiplayer wasn't in the game, I think $30 is still a good price. If you don't want to pay $30, you can wait a bit since I see this game on sale a lot or you can get for a great price online. The story will blow you away and make you want to play more, so give this game a try.",

Not a masterpiece, some narrative twists are done for better drama effect even in Max Payne from 2001 by action game standards. Nothing more and nothing less than a good war drama set up in juxtaposition against 'conventional' patriotic action ones. An allure towards the nihilistic unfortunately, as it only questions and doubts without introducing anything new. It's a recycling of previous notable works as 'Apocalypse Now'.     The problem of the game is that the gameplay messes with the 'no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t' approach to traumatized human feelings.  The attempt to sarcasm Saving Private Ryan and other action war products of American culture is in conflict with the serious message on the topic of war. Breaking the 4'th wall is far too often used with questionable end result or in any cohesive message delivered. It's awesome to have Spec Ops attempt a new approach. I'm optimistically looking to the future of this message progress further. As a media, video games need more of this. However without trying to use inappropriate tools to convey those messages through achievements, hero puns.  I wasn't searching for action in the first place. Did not think it was amusing or well placed. It would also be interesting to hear arguments pro war too. Or how consistent the message was in general, without deconstructions in post modernist style. Again, a lot of weak points in the general anti war message with wide generalisation.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Recommended for familiarisation.

The combat is average and there is not much enjoyment to be had in it, this also applies to the multiplayer which is mediocre at best. What you really are paying for is the campaign which can be beat in about five hours on regular difficulty. However, those five hours are enganging and will make you ponder the horrors of war. This should come as no surprise as the story parallels that of Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. One considering buying this should also be made aware that the ending(s), of which there are five, could dissapoint or invoke anger in some.

Upon the finding, Walker declares that the team's mission has changed, and that they will search Dubai for survivors  Spec Ops: does so many good things right, but falls short from a masterpiece. While the game is a brilliant set-piece of PTSD and the true horrors of war, it falls short as a game in whole. While the story, soundtrack, voice acting, visuals and overall quality is amazing, it's gameplay is just so generic and boring. Nothing new will be seen here, unfourtunately. The game is a third-person cover shooter game, with no originality. The cover system and gunplay are mediocre at best, and this is a real drawback from it being an amazing experience in all sectors. But, I really don't want to get too much into such details, it's just something you've played in a hundred other games, let's focus on what's so amazing about this underrated game.  The story. It may sounds like something trivial, because people have high standards these days, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, amazing this amazing that, you get my point. This game is narative driven game, and that's it. Multiplayer is shallow and unstatisfying, but this isn't the point of Spec Ops. It's a game that sets one goal, and one goal only. To trully showcase the  Horror  of war. War is a gruesome experience that really scars the human mind, and while me and you won't probably fight in one, this game has a trully shocking way of showing us just how brutal things can get between the gunfire. It will surely have a last impact on you, it did on me at least. The game starts pretty standard, a turret section that's pretty  bland  and  boring , nothing too over the top here. But once the game kick off, things start to get heated. We start in the shoes of Cpt. Martin Walker, voiced by Nolan North. The game starts off with you and your squad mates being sent to the new destroyed Dubai, to investigate and search for survivor, call for reinforcements and get back home. Those are your only orders, nothing more. But things get out of hand once Walker gives to order to   open fire on the enemy . This thing will become more relevant down the line, since this game has set out to question one simple thing,  Who is the enemy? . And it will teach you that thing, once you complete it.  Being developed on the Unreal 3 Engine, the games shines mostly. Dubai is a super showcase of glowing sand, vibrant interiors and a feel of depth and complexity. But it's all just a shell to hide all of the horros that lay ahead of your journey to destruction. The game will soon present to you the brutal, and extremely graphic violence of when  things get ouf of hand  when people mentally breakdown and can't tell the difference between good or evil. It's amazing, especially since this game breaks once and for all the trope that all enemy's in video games must be shot down immediatly without question, and because they are  different  or russian/middle eastern. It's superb, to be honest.   In the end, since I could talk about this game for hours and hours, even though it's a short, but it's an intense ride, and filled with guilt. Never, ever I have felt such guild after playing a videogame. Like, really. Videogames that make you feel guilty?  How is that?  One might ask. Well, it's quite easy. This game does not reward you for shooting everyone in a 100km radius at the speed of Clint Eastwood, it will break you down as fast as the protagonists. It's amazing how well the story is crafter, considering at the end of the day, it makes you feel human, it makes you question so many things. Superb. Honestly, superb.   In case you don't want to hear all of my rumbling, I will list the things that I enjoyed and disliked about this game and give it a rating.   The good    Amazing story   Superb story   Breathtaking visuals   Retroactive enviroment   Unique setting   Incredible soundtrack/voice acting   Moral and emotionally heavy    The bad    Generic gameplay   Mediocre gunplay   Short lenght   Cookie cutter multiplayer   No replay value   The cover mechanics are a bit awkward  I give this game a 8/10 rating, thanks to so many good elements in it, falling short, unfortunately to such a generic gameplay. Amazing overall nonetheless, I highly recommend this game to everyone.  ",

The main reason why I tried it was because I kept hearing great things about the way the narrative was handled and I was not let down. It does not glorify war or the military and it actually felt like the developers put a lot of time into developing the story. In this game, story came first, and the multiplayer aspect came second, and that is something that is a bit rare in shooters nowadays. So without further ado, here's my review.    Gameplay",

The controls are spot on ( i use x-360 gamepad) and the gameplay is a blend of shooting with some tactics and uses cover a lot.  You get to order your other two squad members two basic commands, either focus fire (useful for heavly armorded targets) or stun grenade targetes. You can also order them to move to different locations to flank enemies which is important if you are pinned down by a machine gun. Overall their AI is pretty smart and they usually do fine on their own, providing you backup while you are the star.  The best part of the game is the story and environment though. The ruined city of Dubai has a life of its own, and even effects strategies to a certain extent. The story shines and will really have you thinking and wanting to replay it to see just how your decisions during the game effect how things shape up.  Graphics are really nice and ran flawlessly on my computer (nothig special here). The sounds are realistic and high quality.

WARNING: THIS IS NOT A CALL OF DUTY CLONE LIKE THE TRAILERS AND BOX ART WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE, IT IS BASICALLY THE MOST ANTI-CALL OF DUTY TRIPLE A SHOOTER GAME EVER MADE. THIS GAME ISN'T 'FUN' IT'S ENGAGING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE A TRADITIONAL GOOD TIME PLAYING IT!  The best way to explain what this game is to start at it's creation. Spec Ops was a shooter series that nobody cared about in the late 90s/early 2000s. 2K (the publisher) wanted Yager (the developers) to make a new Spec Ops game. It could be about ANYTHING so long as it was about the US military. What they made was a decent into madness that will make you rethink everything you knew about the Modern Military genre. Many games are 'adult' because they have violence and sexual themes, though children still play and enjoy them. This game is adult because it's got mature themes and will make you think.  I can't spoil ANYTHING because it's best to go in completely fresh but it's amazingly dark and you will feel awful after beating it, but in a good way.  Gameplay's standard MMS fare but played from a third person perspective, similarly to Gears of War. The shooting feels good and they keep adding new, varied weapons to keep things at least somewhat varied. The cover mechanics are pretty clunky and awkward and It all gets kinda boring. But it's not about that, it's about the story.  Play this if you want something that questions the MMS genre. Play this if you want to play something that makes you feel awful and think. DON'T play this if you want a pro-USA shooter where you kill the terrorists and stop World War 3.  I wholeheartedly reccomend this.",

I'm not personally a fan of games on rails but this one is a decent roller coaster ride that makes the rails a bit more acceptable for me.  Enemies react to being shot in limbs appropriately and shotguns feel great, which is honestly a rarity in games.   The game gives a lot of forced prompts for commands and actions you have to or are only capable of doing at those moments which is strange and irritating. The giant flashing prompts on the screen forcing your hand really take you out of the immersion of the story, which could be pretty good if the prompts didn't reinforce an arcade shooter feel. The cover system is done fairly well, although i found myself fighting with the controls in many instances because it's just a few slight changes from what standard shooters bring you to expect.  I have run into some instances where invisible barriers would block my shots and they threw in the generic heavily armored (Commonly known as bulldozer) type unit who can be frustrating to an extreme when most enemies react appropriately, a sticky grenade or an RPG on his facemask will do little more than break the mask off and stun him. The bare face of his still requires significant amounts of shots to kill him with any weapon despite being unarmored which means damage is based on body parts and not types of armored cover. In a shooter, this can be pretty irritating but expected from the lazier ones, so it might not bother other people as much.  Ammo can be quite scarce for you and you alone as your team mates have unlimited ammo, dreadful aim, and unlimited grenades but can only be used in designated situations or of their own personal choosing. They also pick their own cover in your general area which can occasionally put them on the wrong side of it, forcing your hand to go save them in the open during a bad enough situation to get them downed.   I haven't tried the Multiplayer or Co-Op yet so I can't comment on those.  Combat 7/10 Story 7/10 Controls 6/10 Visuals 7/10  Docking score for the excessive HUD prompts and the heavily armored Bulldozer unit because those are just lazy, especially considering the environment.  I'd have to give the game a 6/10 overall  The game is good for a few bucks, I would recommend it if you can catch it on a decent sale.",

In an instance, your character points out a building in the distance where the man supposedly behind everything is, and in that moment, I was sure that this was going to be the height of the game's plot. We were going to go there, shoot the guy, stop what was going on, and get out.   Little did I know that, this game isn't about reaching the final destination, it's about what you do to get there.

This hype was met with hours of killings hundreds of enemies in a hide behind cover shootign gallery and on-screen text, that can't be removed, telling you what to do and what objective was recently met. These kept me squarely in the context of a cartoonishly violent video game that made it seem laughable in the cut-scenes when matters of life and death were pondered. Despite the misgivings of this somewhat thought provoking game being mired down with the requirements of a modern video game, I recommmend it. Sure, the game isn't as gripping as Conrad's novel or Apocalypse Now, but it's a pretty damng good display of 'the horror'.",

Pros: -Really good, balanced and haunting story -Immersive environments -Choices matter  Cons: -Gameplay is slightly mundane -The multiplayer mode is just a filler   Conclusion: The game ends up being a great anti-war game that focuses on the atrocities that man is able to commit when pushed beyond limit, it's being held back a bit by the gameplay, which feels poorly ported. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend getting this game.   Rating: 9/10  Also, if you're looking for other war related quality material check out the following: 1) Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness' 2) Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' 3) Terrence Malick's 'The thin red line' 4) Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' (this one's the harshest to watch) “The horror... the horror.” - Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness', also spoken by Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979)",

I almost passed this one by due to its superficial premise and appearance, but I am very glad I did not.  Following in the footsteps and perfecting the ugly tenor of games like Kane &amp; Lynch and Far Cry 2, this brutal exploration of PTSD, gaming's indulgence in violence, and the cost of war pulls no punches in challenging the player to confront what--if any--redemptive or meaningful value there is in parading through a foreign landscape as a hero of war. Forced to make ugly decisions that will demand you square with the game on an emotional level and shouted down for every mistake you will inevitably make, this is the slap in the face an industry drenched in blood and rewarded violence needs. Marking a new era in mature gaming, Spec Ops: The Line is a challenge to us to return from our thoughtless murder and enter into a new era of self-aware, meaningful interactive experiences.",

The controls are solid and intuitive once you learn them, though occasionally you'll find yourself sprinting past cover you meant to enter, or running into a low wall. This is a rare occurrence however and overall, I can find no other faults. Visually, Spec Ops is gorgeous, filled with brilliant camera work and great level design. I found myself stopping to gawp at the scenery numerous times. Later in the game, there are a few moments that really stand out visually and add to the narrative perfectly. Death never felt like a chore in this game, either. In some games death can put you off playing but with Spec Ops, this isn't the case. Instead I felt myself compelled to learn from my mistakes and try again and again to storm that machine gun nest or fight down another bloodsoaked patch of sand in search of the mysterious Colonel Konrad. This game is well worth the money, the action is intense, the gameplay is well balanced and the difficulty curve is just steep enough to keep you feeling engaged all the way through.",

I'm not personally a fan of games on rails but this one is a decent roller coaster ride that makes the rails a bit more acceptable for me.  Enemies react to being shot in limbs appropriately and shotguns feel great, which is honestly a rarity in games.   The game gives a lot of forced prompts for commands and actions you have to or are only capable of doing at those moments which is strange and irritating. The giant flashing prompts on the screen forcing your hand really take you out of the immersion of the story, which could be pretty good if the prompts didn't reinforce an arcade shooter feel. The cover system is done fairly well, although i found myself fighting with the controls in many instances because it's just a few slight changes from what standard shooters bring you to expect.  I have run into some instances where invisible barriers would block my shots and they threw in the generic heavily armored (Commonly known as bulldozer) type unit who can be frustrating to an extreme when most enemies react appropriately, a sticky grenade or an RPG on his facemask will do little more than break the mask off and stun him. The bare face of his still requires significant amounts of shots to kill him with any weapon despite being unarmored which means damage is based on body parts and not types of armored cover. In a shooter, this can be pretty irritating but expected from the lazier ones, so it might not bother other people as much.  Ammo can be quite scarce for you and you alone as your team mates have unlimited ammo, dreadful aim, and unlimited grenades but can only be used in designated situations or of their own personal choosing. They also pick their own cover in your general area which can occasionally put them on the wrong side of it, forcing your hand to go save them in the open during a bad enough situation to get them downed.   I haven't tried the Multiplayer or Co-Op yet so I can't comment on those.  Combat 7/10 Story 7/10 Controls 6/10 Visuals 7/10  Docking score for the excessive HUD prompts and the heavily armored Bulldozer unit because those are just lazy, especially considering the environment.

You might think you know what's up, and for all I know you actually know what's happening. I finnished the game in about 4 hours, but I could probably have done it faster. That's the only con I have for this. It's not often that I finnish a game and sit back thinking through my choices, and my views of life while the credits roll over the screen (yeah, I actually saw through the credits. That kind of never happens). I'd easily recommend this game to anyone, perhaps not if you're up for a mindless killing spree though. It's a fast paced title, there's really never any 'downtime', and if you start playing it late night. You should continue until you've finnished the game, due to it's duration you might find yourself doing the last 20 minutes if you split it up into two sittings. I strongly recommend not doing that, the plot and the story is way to intricate so you can't really afford not remembering something when you boot it up the next day.  Prepare to fight for what you believe in, or atleast what you think you believe in. Prepare to question yourself, and every single action you make. Prepare to wonder whether or not you're actually a 'good guy' or if you're infact part of the problem. Prepare... To cross the line",

            "review_text": "Well, I finished this game almost at once, so we can kinda say it sucked me in. Let's start with a little summary of the game.  Spec Ops: The Line is a rather linear TPS with a couple of places you can make your own decision between ♥♥♥♥, and even bigger ♥♥♥♥. And you'll feel ♥♥♥♥ in the end.   The story: Delta Force sent to Dubai for a recon mission that quickly turns into a rescue mission, then into a 'shoot everything that moves' mission. It gets confusing at times, but the end (which I won't spoil you) helps. It's...not what you'd expect. You start out as your standard US Soldier shooter with the grizzled veterans shouting commands, shooting baddies, being badass, but that quickly turns around. You are just a piece of the chess game of the forces behind the scenes. To give credit to the game, the story of Dubai getting hit by sandstorms, and getting Fallout'd is rather cool. And the visuals match, but bit later about that. Through the game I felt I was playing a TV series. Heck, it'd make a bloody good mini-series - about 6 episodes or so. The characters are good, and while not overdetailed, they do their job. And when I finished it, I felt like after a good TV show or movie. It left satisfied, but somehow empty.  The conversions are awesome. I had a few laughs, but the interactions between the characters never went over the top, and kept me interested throughout the story. Nobody felt flat or uninteresting, so that's a pretty good thing too. Overall, 8/10. I had little to no expectations, but left with something I won't forget soon.  Gameplay: It's a rather standard TPS with a decent selection of firearms. You get Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, and so forth. Most of them has a secondary mode, which is to say switch the sniper rifle's zoom (from 8x to 16x), or put a sound suppressor to the M4A1. It's fun, and while the diversity forces you to either be a really accurate shooter, or switch your weapons frequently. Ammo boxes scattered around the maps help you. The cover system while sometimes tad awkward, is good. Made me think of Mass Effect.  In every section you can find pieces of intels - a great way for knowing the backstory a bit better, and adds to the overall feel to the game. You'll be more disturbed after you find them fo' sure. Sometimes they are at obvious places, but you gotta look for the to find all. The game is rather linear, but with a game like this, it's not much of a problem. I wouldn't list this as a pro, but neither as a con. It's just linear and that's it.  7/10 - you'll remember the game for the story, as the gameplay is, while rather flowing, brings nothing new.  The visuals: Like in my Sleeping Dogs review (which you probably haven't read, but I like to mention my other written stuffs), I have to state I don't have the full specifics to play the game on High graphics. I went with medium, and it ran with about 30 fps. For me, it's solid, and the game, while not gorgeous, it looked good. The Sandstorm'd Dubai (which is almost Darude, but let's stay away from memes for a second) looks good. It's pretty detailed, and I never got bored of the environment. It wasn't exactly the same as far as I recall, and fighting on the top of a skyscraper is a nice change after eating sand on ground level. It matched the game, so I'm fine with it as is. Overall a 8/10.  Sounds: Okay, this is awesome. The mad DJ with the hits of the 80s that he plays seemingly random, the ambient music, and the OST for the game is AWESOME. Fitting, believable, and you'll feel that it gives a lot to the game. You'll eventually search for the OST on Youtube, and save it to listen later. It's really good. Kudos to the composer. 10/10  Overall I'd give this game a 8.5 out of 10, totally worth playing, and totally worth your money. Be aware of the graphic images of gore, death, and the feeling of emptiness and guilt after you've finished the game, regardless of your choices.",

            "review_text": "Well, I finished this game almost at once, so we can kinda say it sucked me in. Let's start with a little summary of the game.  Spec Ops: The Line is a rather linear TPS with a couple of places you can make your own decision between ♥♥♥♥, and even bigger ♥♥♥♥. And you'll feel ♥♥♥♥ in the end.   The story: Delta Force sent to Dubai for a recon mission that quickly turns into a rescue mission, then into a 'shoot everything that moves' mission. It gets confusing at times, but the end (which I won't spoil you) helps. It's...not what you'd expect. You start out as your standard US Soldier shooter with the grizzled veterans shouting commands, shooting baddies, being badass, but that quickly turns around. You are just a piece of the chess game of the forces behind the scenes. To give credit to the game, the story of Dubai getting hit by sandstorms, and getting Fallout'd is rather cool. And the visuals match, but bit later about that. Through the game I felt I was playing a TV series. Heck, it'd make a bloody good mini-series - about 6 episodes or so. The characters are good, and while not overdetailed, they do their job. And when I finished it, I felt like after a good TV show or movie. It left satisfied, but somehow empty.  The conversions are awesome. I had a few laughs, but the interactions between the characters never went over the top, and kept me interested throughout the story. Nobody felt flat or uninteresting, so that's a pretty good thing too. Overall, 8/10. I had little to no expectations, but left with something I won't forget soon.  Gameplay: It's a rather standard TPS with a decent selection of firearms. You get Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Pistols, SMGs, LMGs, and so forth. Most of them has a secondary mode, which is to say switch the sniper rifle's zoom (from 8x to 16x), or put a sound suppressor to the M4A1. It's fun, and while the diversity forces you to either be a really accurate shooter, or switch your weapons frequently. Ammo boxes scattered around the maps help you. The cover system while sometimes tad awkward, is good. Made me think of Mass Effect.  In every section you can find pieces of intels - a great way for knowing the backstory a bit better, and adds to the overall feel to the game. You'll be more disturbed after you find them fo' sure. Sometimes they are at obvious places, but you gotta look for the to find all. The game is rather linear, but with a game like this, it's not much of a problem. I wouldn't list this as a pro, but neither as a con. It's just linear and that's it.  7/10 - you'll remember the game for the story, as the gameplay is, while rather flowing, brings nothing new.  The visuals: Like in my Sleeping Dogs review (which you probably haven't read, but I like to mention my other written stuffs), I have to state I don't have the full specifics to play the game on High graphics. I went with medium, and it ran with about 30 fps. For me, it's solid, and the game, while not gorgeous, it looked good. The Sandstorm'd Dubai (which is almost Darude, but let's stay away from memes for a second) looks good. It's pretty detailed, and I never got bored of the environment. It wasn't exactly the same as far as I recall, and fighting on the top of a skyscraper is a nice change after eating sand on ground level. It matched the game, so I'm fine with it as is. Overall a 8/10.  Sounds: Okay, this is awesome. The mad DJ with the hits of the 80s that he plays seemingly random, the ambient music, and the OST for the game is AWESOME. Fitting, believable, and you'll feel that it gives a lot to the game. You'll eventually search for the OST on Youtube, and save it to listen later. It's really good. Kudos to the composer. 10/10  Overall I'd give this game a 8.5 out of 10, totally worth playing, and totally worth your money. Be aware of the graphic images of gore, death, and the feeling of emptiness and guilt after you've finished the game, regardless of your choices.",

Now, completing the game gives it more meaning, but it just seems too generic. The early parts of the game offer little to no story and is overall not that great. The controls are REALLY hard to get used to at first as well. The combat overall isn't anything to brag about either. However, if you can make it past that, you are in for a treat.  This game offers stunning environments, incredible characters, and an amazing story. It depresses you, makes you feel like a badass, and also makes you think all at the same time. The setting in Dubai and all the buildings really make this place feel lively, while the people and story contrast it with a dark and depressing tone.

As you journey, the game shows you many of the terrible things that is happening, even showing you what you have done in a scene so full of emotion, that it should go down as one of the greatest scenes in gaming. The further you go, the more your character becomes more violent, showing what war does to soldiers. Soon you feel conflicted, as you don't want to kill the enemy, but you must... because you are the hero. Than it wraps up with an ending that you will never see coming. In the end, you are left with your thoughts, with the credits rolling, and asking yourself this 'Am I doing this in every FPS and TPS I play?'

The reason I say this is because of the story. One of the best video game stories I have ever played. It dives into the aspect the human heart at its darkest. Going trough the reality of war and what happens in it. The story was based upon the book, 'Heart of Dakness'. A Quick summary is that you are a delta force opretive needing to go help in Dubai. You confront the darkness of war and you actions along the way. By the end you feel the true impact that you had and how truely bad war is. So in summary, you have to get this game for the story and the gameplay works fine. I will say the following to leave you with a tought.

The good:  Buy it now if you like a narrative driven game that challenges your preconceptions of a war shooter and the war shooter genre in general, and in one swift stroke will help you meditate on the pursuit and immediacy of gaming in one that chides you for following the core mechanic behind the choices you make but may not entirely be responsible for. It is also about how the consequences of your actions may not accurately reflect your decision-making process. Yes, this game is a brutal mind♥♥♥♥ of war, gaming, and free will in a manner that only this genre and this medium can deliver. I fully recommend Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review as well as it is far more contemplative than the usual satire but just as pithy.  Still 10/10 but The Not-so-good:  OTOH, it's not without its faults. You'll find yourself in a beautifully designed world with, at times, clunky gameplay that drives a wedge between the player and the experience. For example, I had to restart far too many checkpoints due to the absurd amount of enemies (while on medium difficulty, mind you) that spawn at times where I found myself overwhelmed by the 'enemy' and a lack of ammo. At these junctures, the game has a bad habit of recommending you downgrade to Baby's 1st FPS mode since you're dying so much, but even worse is the fact that I had to so I could move on once or twice. Not the perfect cover-based shooting system, or shooting system if we're honest, but nothing that will break the deal. Also, it relies far too much on hordes of baddies including Heavies and snipers and turret gun setpieces. I found these a bit tedious, to be honest.  On the whole, it's a shame this is the game that pretty much bankrupted the studio because it's a good bet that it will be fondly remembered in gaming history as a shining example of lovingly crafted storytelling and hailed as one of the best. It will also give you nightmares.",

Gameplay: Cover based and more or less generic but, that doesn't mean to say it's bad because the set pieces and interectable environment kinda makes up for it. Anything I forgot? I don't know if you don't like cover based shooters then don't but, maybe the story is enough to convince you otherwise.. also it's hard guys..

You take up the role of Captain Martin Walker, leader of a Delta team alongside Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo. Together, you've been sent to Dubai after a strange radio transmission was reported and your objective is to search for any remaining survivors. Dubai, (meant to be completely uninhabited after the sandstorm) is discovered to home many civillians and the group known as the 33rd. As the story progresses, you discover that the 33rd are not who they were thought to be and with that, you're forced to go through many different moral choices to help decide the fate of Dubai and your squad. By the end of the game though, everything isn't what it seems and you discover who the true enemy really is and it will leave you wanting more.  TL;DR Edition:  Pros: +Shooting mechanics are fun and simple to use +Squad members actually help out in fights, when compared to other games +Amazing Story +Had to Google what the ending meant  Cons: -Most decisions decided in the game doesn't really affect the ending -Once you die, you cannot be revived, unlike your squad members  5/5 - One of greatest story's I've witnessed in a game.",

I thought I would enter the world of post-apocalyptic Dubai ready for anything. But I didn't.  I thought that I would feel satisfied every time I landed a well-aimed headshot, like in CSGO. But I didn't.  I thouht I would save the civilians and kill only those who stood in the way of what was truly right. But I didn't.  I dropped white phosphorus on the civilians I was trying to save. Those men I killed with a well-aimed headshot were the true heroes. I was the villian. Anyone who wants to know what the world of war which video games have created is really like: play this game. Next to Portal 2, this is the second game to ever make me shed a tear. But this time it was for the complete opposite reason. The story was incredible.  Issues with the gameplay only lie in the fact that they were unorthodox and strange, but after an hour or two I had mastered them. Still a bit fiddly at times, though.   The graphics and visuals were great. I truly believed I was in a ruined Dubai. Even when it's destroyed and uninhabitable, the place still blew my mind. Occasionally some of the player textures would sporatically change resolution; they would look life-like one second and then potato the next, all having to do with the angle at which they were viewed. The anisotropic filtering became a noticable annoyance in some cutscenes. But even then, it was a beyond passable overall experience. Someone poured a lot of time in making it as good as possible; this much is evident, even with a few minor hiccups.   8.5/10 I hereby declare this game to be a 'must-play.'

Engaging characters and story, excellent gun-fighting and gameplay, and a twist that made me sick with disgust at myself and Captain Walker. I loved it! After the half-way point, things go to $#!t. A spiral of madness and death opens up that you walk to the end. Even the loading screens after Chapter 10 or so start to take the ♥♥♥♥ out of you by passive-agressively insulting all you've done in the game when you're reloading after being killed. Plus, unlike most shooters, it has multiple endings depending on the choices you make!  This game is a must for fans of shooters, horror, and war games. At only $20, this game is a better deal than any CoD or Modern Warfare game out on the market. It has replay value, fun gameplay such as zip-lining, commanding your troops to snipe or bomb enemies, and interesting enviroment kills such as the standard 'shooting fuel tanks to make them explode' but also a new 'shoot out glass to drop sand and stun enemies.' It has numerous weapons, and while ammo is sometimes hard to come across, the enemies drop weapons with each one you kill, so you can their bodies. You can only carry 2 guns at a time, but this doesn't take much away from the game, giving you incentive to try out the various firearms and find the ones you like best. My only real complaint gameplay wise is that the Sticky Grenade can be more trouble than it's worth, as it has a smaller explosion range and distance to be thrown than a Flash Bang or Frag, and no bounce. It is fun to stick them onto a foe and watch them flail around, though. As for the characters, Spec Ops makes you sympathise with all of them. Even the villains have understandable motivations, and you wonder if you'd act any differently in this situation. Captain Walker, Lieutenant Adams, and Sergeant Lugo are people, with feelings and emotions that they display through both cutscenes and in-game banter. They are far superior to the burly, no-name, buzz-cut scrubs of the current FPS.  This game gripped me like no other. I got it (from a friend) on March 1st. It is now March 4th, and I have been playing almost non-stop to finish it. I had to see the ending. I had to experience what was the culmination of Captain Walker's actions and struggles. I had to. This game is the most engaging thing I've played all year, and I'd argue it is going to be an all-time favorite, right up there with the other games of my childhood I remember fondly. With FPS's pedalling boring stories, gameplay and characters that are little more than cardboard cutouts, Spec Ops: The Line makes me hopeful for the future of gaming, and sick to my stomach for the in-game atrocities I witnessed and committed.

The story is outstanding. The way it's presented is pretty unique and very well done. It ♥♥♥♥s with you. And it does it well. There will be unexpected turns and you will be forced to make choices you might not want to make. I won't say more because I really don't want to spoil anything but let me just say this: I don't feel good having beaten this game. And I like that.  The Characters are standard military characters. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. In fact the story and presentation wouldn't work without Sgt. Lugo and Adams being the way they are.  As far as gameplay goes I consider it decent. I have played better third person shooters, I have played worse. It's fun as well as fairly well executed and that's enough for me. Some problems with the controls as mentioned above but it works. I kept getting into cover when I didn't mean to but I got used to it. You can give your two companions simple orders (Shoot that guy, throw a stun grenade or heal the other guy). They will act pretty smart on their own though. I rarely had them die on me and they took out enemies without me ordering it. The shooting is fine although I did find picking up weapons, ammo or grenades a bit clunky at times (Once again due to the them being mapped to the same button which is also used for reloading).  All things considered I would definitely recommend this game. Mostly for the experience it provides. Do you want a shooter that takes a different approach as far as storytelling goes? Then go ahead and play Spec Ops: The Line.",

That combined with questionable marketing and tacked on multiplayer doomed this gem to be a commercial flop.  But what a gem it is underneath that fatal flaw. You'll be hard pressed to find a better story in the video game genre, particularly among shooters. At numerous points throughout the game I found myself stopping to simply admire the scenery. The voice acting, motion capture and script were all impressive. The audio, too, caught my attention in a positive way with some engrossing sound effects (I could practically feel the buffeting winds of the game's sandstorms) and a killer soundtrack that is creatively woven into the narrative with the Radioman character.  I don't want to give any plot points away but let me caution that this is a dark, twisted journey that is not for the faint of heart. And you won't be just a spectator throughout. You'll be forced to make decisions that stain your conscience and leave you wondering where the line between good and evil is.  There are some interesting articles out there commenting on how the gameplay was purposely made to be a distasteful slog through a seemly endless supply of faceless enemies. This is meant to impress upon the player that war isn't fun and that a killer's rationalizing mindset ('I had to do it') may be easier to arrive at than we realize. As much as I respect the effort to add depth with this kind of game design, I think that good gameplay is too important to compromise for the sake of making a point that many people won't even notice.  Before closing I'd like to note that this is a fairly short game. My total playtime for 2 playthroughs and unlocking 48/50 achievements was 12 hours. Roughly 6-7 hours first time on normal difficulty, 2 hours on achievements and 3-4 hours playing it again on easy just for the story. I didn't touch the multiplayer.  While the average score for Spec Ops: The Line is not very impressive I strongly recommend looking passed that. It is a game worth experiencing, one that I won't soon forget and one of the better games I've played in recent years.",

Pros:   - Excellent story - Realistic character development - The power of choice is very strong in each decision you make - Graphics are pretty, although I WAS running on high, so take that as you will - Enviroments are amazing; fits the setting like a glove  Cons:  - Sort of clunky controls, specially on PC - If you're into that sort of thing, a run through the game's normal mode will take no more than 7 hours - If you're looking for a shooter to have fun in, this is not the game you should be playing. Go play TF2 or even CoD. - Extremely graphic content; this is truly a game that lives up to its 17+ rating  --------------------------------------  This is a story about war. Not CoD war, not Battlefield war - not romaticised war at all. This is war and suffering at its most brutal and disturbing.What I said about graphic content isn't putting it lightly at all - you WILL see things that will take you right out of your comfort zone and just smash your assumptions. This game makes fun of generic war shooters and gets away with it. It makes fun of itself sometimes. What it doesn't make fun of is war.   This is not a game you're going to leave with a smile on your face.  This is a game that will educate you.  --------------------------------------  TL;DR: If you want a game about war that doesn't make fun out of war - if you want a totally different game - this game is for you. Those who don't like heavy stories in their shooters and just want fun shooting should stay away.",

I heard that the story was great, but all I thought of it was just another time-killer while I waited for TF2 to un-screw itself.   Man oh man.  -This is in my top ten game list in terms of storyline, and has (imho) BY FAR the best plot twists in all of entertainment, right up there with The Sixth Sense and Se7en.   -The voice acting is immersive as hell. You start out the game as just a squad of soldiers, with comm chatter like 'Enemy neutralized.' As the game progresses and the toll starts to wear on both you and the characters, the interactions become more and more desperate. Walker screams, 'KILL....IS F***ING CONFIRMED.'  -The game plays more like a movie, with an unbelievable immersion factor. I would recommend playing it on Easy mode and just experiencing it.  You'll notice that I only have 5.3 hours on this game. That is the time it took me to beat the campaign, and I never want to play this game again. You know the game is working when you get a feeling of dread, a knot in your stomach that makes you realize the gravity of your decisions. For that reason, I will never play through the campaign again. One playthrough is enough to make me rethink war and its consequences. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this, sit back, and prepare to lose your sanity.",

Bad guys do not coordinate in any way, they move to cover in seemingly random ways and they run toward you at stupid times.   With that being said, this is a good game - don't get me wrong. It's just not a 'great' one. If you enjoy shooting a lot of bad guys but want a story that isn't really cliche (as most military shooters are) then this is a game for you. I'm enjoying it thus far and the story is what's keeping me engaged. I'm five chapters and have yet to encounter any other forms of combat. Maybe they'll be some key moments as I continue on.

While on the surface it may seem like just another cover based shooter, with a modern combat focus, the story quickly shows it to be much more than that. It's hard to say too much without giving away the plot line, but along the way you will be faced with moral choices, ones that may stay with you as you play through the game and reach the (I think) excellent conclusion.   Visually the game is very nice, good character models, very nice atmospheric &amp; particle effects ensure that firefights get very intense. The levels are very detailed, although as typical in these games, it is not an open field, you are basically guided through a fixed path. That said, in some arena based areas you do have a choice of which way to tackle a situation.  Lots of weapons to choose from, meaning you can always look around for your favourites and alter your play style based on what you are using. Your team mates have reasonable AI, which doesn't hinder you as you play. I did not try playing MP, so my opinion is purely based on the SP campaign.  So all in all, a very good game, and worthy of your time. Please don't disregard this game based purely on the fact that it seems like 'another military cover based shooter'. The story draws you in, and gets progressively stranger as time goes on, and is definitely not just a 'by the numbers, kill the bad guy' scenario. Again, without giving away any part of the story, the game also has replay value, I will be going back to this one.",

The story was interesting, the voice acting superb, do I need to mention Nolan North as our protagonist 'Martin Walker'.  The guns where just right, the sound very good and the graphics amazing.  In the review deck I wrote 'not so distant cousin to the Uncharted-series', and I mean every word of it.  The astonishingly detailed environments and the characters and their animations where so close to Naughty Dogs winning concept, I sometimes wondered if this was a prequel to 'Uncharted 2', it is not in fact, it is the 3rd game from German game studio: 'Yager Development' (www.yager.de).  + Story line + Graphics + Characters + Immersive + Fun achievements  - Short (approx. 10 - 12 hours to finish the SP-campaign) - No dedicated servers for the MP - Linear  I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys 3PS.",

Even if you are turned off by the game's tone, dodgy combat and linearity, bear with it all the way to the end. While it does indulge in vagueness for vagueness' sake and many scenes may be fairly preachy, it's still much, much smarter than it first appears.

Some people describe this game as depressing which almost put me off but after completing it i didnt find it depressing but leaves you a lot to think about and shows you the ugly side of war that games like CoD just dont capture. You are not a one man army and you do not enjoy killing the men in this game, you truely feel as though its kill or be killed, you are surviving. Much like with real life the Soldiers question why they are even doing this which really makes you feel for them and can really make you brain think. The game will throw tough decisions at you which will leave you wondering, did i make the right choice? did they deserve that? Am i the bad guy? It will keep you guessing what is going on right up until the end of the game. The story is beautifully horrifying with a script that can really make you feel for the characters and the art/graphics are phenominal. If a sequal came out to this game i would preorder it, fantastic game and truely one of a kind, you wont want to stop playing. A must have game whether on sale or not!",

You won’t see me praising a game like Heavy Rain because of its dull gameplay mechanics, neither over-crediting it for its TV movie-quality plot, what you would read from me about Telltale’s The Walking Dead series is that they are good interactive movies, perhaps calling them good “games” would be hard for me. But this one, this one it’s a bold act of rebellion, even when the game itself is nothing impressive, it is one of those few cases where I'm inclined to recommend a game I didn't enjoyed a lot playing to.  Spec Ops: The Line should be played, it deserves to be played, at least to experience what it does well and how it was a failed but respectable attempt to make a AAA game with an actually adult narrative and distancing itself from the cheap “play this to feel more mature” trend on gaming narrative that started more or less a couple of years after the 7th generation of consoles.   The GAME  In Spec Ops: The Line you won’t find a hidden gem with terrific mechanics, in fact, the game feels like a tasteless Gears of War clone, it feels like the genre of the game was chosen just to appeal to a bigger audience, if they had developed a top-down shooter or a strategy game a la “XCOM: Enemy Unknown” they would had saved a considerable amount of money, and even been able to invest more on its gameplay and get more or less the same sales they got (roughly 1.13M according to VGChartz).  This doesn’t mean the game is horrible, in fact, It’s decent, and even good at times, it isn’t boring and it’s A.I. isn’t bad, for example, in the hardest difficulty (which is the only one I played), it also has a fresh level design which helps to bring variety to the experience, using verticality pretty more often than third and first person shooters regularly do. So, in short, the game is not painful to play, but it isn’t also memorable gameplay-wise and you will feel no need to replay it.   The Portrait  One of the three things this game does right, and the first of them you will notice, is its environment, the ashes of Dubai are real, and not because the game is ridiculously photorealistic (which is not), but because it’s meant to communicate something, not a feeling, not a direct message, but a story, you know something more than a sandstorm happened there. The devastation and helplessness, the man-made disaster over the implacable overtaking of nature against a metropolis turning it into a no man’s land are tangible.   The designers did a good job (most of the time) trying to immerse the player by mixing the “COVER HERE PLOX” structures among the rest of the environment and they try to constantly draw the players towards what is left of the civilization to give us a break from the sand. The people designing its environment probable spent most of the time guessing: What would people do if “this” happened? The environment results believable and satisfying to watch too.  The Chant  The sound effects are decent and the voice acting accomplishes what it’s meant for. What the game does well is the music, instead of using an over the top generic film soundtrack, the game uses a soundtrack of rock music and its specter of derived genres, constantly portraying what is happening in front of you, sometimes even with some bit of irony, most of it has heavy feelings and a couple of tracks which could be considered as portraying an 'angry' or 'desperate' feeling, it counts with names as Nine Inch Nails, Deep Purple and Jimmy Hendrix.  The music also lets the sound effects of the sandstorms, broken glasses and guns take the main role when it’s needed. The radio signals also play an important role in the immersion and are a nice way of telling us what’s happening instead of leaving such task in its entirety to the cut-scenes.  Another interesting part related to the story is what I would consider as a 'cliche' being used many, many times in games to tell us the 'background' of the story, is the way of letting us get into the story by finding some intel recordings through the map, which may I say there is nothing bad with it, mostly because it's related to an already interesting story, but it's just another 'checklist' type of feature, similar to its completely unnecessary multiplayer.  The Book  The story of Spec Ops: The Line is based in a classic war novel called “Hearth of Darkness” written by the Polish Author Joseph Conrad (something the writers of this game don't try to hide) and they let you know that in the first moments of the game (I highly recommend the book, ONCE you have played the game).  The story revolves around the 33rd Battalion, a combat unit sent to help Dubai’s citizens to evacuate after a series of sandstorms downplayed or ignored by the high class and politicians of the city turned it into remnants of what it was. The 33rd was thought lost, but suddenly the US Government gets a looped message from the Colonel John Konrad about the situation of the city and the failure of its mission.   The game starts with the three-man operative from the Special Forces Delta conformed Martin Walker, John Lugo and Alphanso Adams entering to Dubai and trying to find what happened to the 33rd. The game has some twists, moral decisions, and many hard moments, it portrays war as what it is: murder, and a side trying to conquer the other, while its portrayal of the “occupation” is way lighter than how the book is based on portrays colonization, it’s very admirable to have people getting out of the safe-zone of bro-patriotic-BS found in most AAA war games, with silly “good vs. bad” plots. While it doesn’t goes deep about the political causes of a conflict, it’s a reminder of how distorted a leader’s mind can be and/or how harmful can people be by justifying their narcissistic needs by making up “the enemy” as “the evil” as an excuse for the urge to fight that “evil” which isn’t more than a result of our a need to rationalize the actions we commit or condone, probably our only scapegoat as simple mortals in one of the sides; a way of finding inner peace, perhaps full of emptiness, but enough to let us believe our own lie. First let’s take action; justification can come later as corpses can’t reply anyway. We are all heroes.  Score: 60/100.",

The game tackles war in a very different way to other modern day first person shooters, and instead of glorifying it, the game instead focuses on the horrors of war, and the affect it has on a person.   Unfortunately my major gripe with this game is the cover system and controls, firstly the button to take cover is also bound to the same key as sprint, I died countless times as I was trying to sprint and ended up taking cover in a completely inconvenient place, in full view of the enemy. Secondly the controls feel like they were made to fit a game-pad, there are buttons like the spacebar which do 3 different things, even though there are a plethora of keys on a keyboard, and the worst part is whatever key you bind these actions to, it will always have three actions associated with it.

It's all worth it in the end, but it really can try your patience getting through the game.  Now for the good part, and honestly it's just one thing for me... The story. The story in this game is amazing. It's something that actually makes you think. It's not your typical, 'OH NOES THE RUSSIANS ARE ATTACKING! We're the good guys and we must protect everything!' All of this while you are mowing down countless people without second thought and blowing everything up in your wake. This makes you think about what the soldiers are actually doing, the decisions they have to make, the repercussions of those choices, how they have to deal with it. It's honestly amazing.

Most 'choices determine outcome' based games allow you to choose between a clearly good option and a clearly bad option. That's mostly designed to provide replay value by way of multiple possible endings. This game puts you in the harsh, and almost nightmarish reality that sometimes there are no good outcomes. In a way I feel that this games is much needed dose of reality in a time popular partiotism, and the glossy marketing veneer that has been placed on war. Over the last 12-13 years we've been conditioned to believe that if you're anti-war then you're simultaneously anti-veteran and anti-american. This games showcases the true cost of war. It reminds us that every soldier who has seen combat comes home wounded, and that not all wounds are visible.  The moment that truly got to me was the white-phosporus scene. One part in particular, which I won't describe so as not to spoil the game, made me put the controller down and walk away from the game for at least 10 minutes to compose myself. The graphic nature of the scene wasn't any more gory than Resident Evil or simular games, but the loss it depicted was horrific to say the least.

The Gameplay is nothing special. It is a normal shooter with a huge focus on the cover system. It is more tactical than the average shooter but beside of this it is what you expect from a third person tactical cover shooter. Sometimes there were problems with the controls but this didn't lead to big issues.  The graphics are exactly what you expect from the unreal engine 3. Not the huge improved Unreal Engine a few very nice looking games decide to make, but a normal Unreal Engine 3 Game. Well, the setting (in a desert) is a bit new and sometime there is an above average usage of post processing filters.  Anyway, what you want the game to play for is the story. And this is the best presentation of a story I had in any shooter since ages. In fact I do not remember to be touched this much of a shooter ever. This experience is only something for very strong people. This is in fact the first 'Rated M' game I would say, it has this with a reason. This game has a strong and moving story. It is very enjoyable but in a very different way. I do not want to spoil anything, so I will not tell anything more, but if you can decide to play this game and think you do not want the normal quick action experience, play this game. It is the 'Schindlers Liste' or the 'Green Mile' of video games.  TL;DR Everybody who plays games and is an adult should play this game. It is a experience which will make your collection of gaming experiences richer than the most games you might consider to buy. So plz, buy this game and 'enjoy' the story.",

All the scenes in this game were probably meant to show the disgusting truth of war, such as (might carry spoilers) abuse of civilian hostages, liberal use of inhumane weapons (White Phosporus mortar), progressive mental deterioration (in the first missions one of the characters took the matter lightly by slipping humor, as the story progresses he starts to feel weary and scarred), and general feelings of distrust, hate, guilt, and anger.  While the story and narrative of the game carries a strong message to the audience, the game fell short on its controls. Controls in this game might feel odd (spacebar for sprinting, what?) which may confuse gamers who are accustomed to WASD for movement and SHIFT for sprint. Multiplayer might also not the game's shining star.  In the end, Spec Ops: The Line is a third person shooter game that excels on dark narrative and storytelling, despite falling short to odd controls and multiplayer.

On the other hand, if you're looking for a good singleplayer story, then everything bad i just said about this game gets thrown out the window.

Like most FPS games, this one pretty much runs on rails. The actions you take are pretty much forced on you. However, this game has a way of projecting your actions onto you in a way I've never seen before. Without giving away major spoilers, I will say that there were a few times I had to pause the game, and think about what just happened. Also, even after you've turned it off for the day, it sticks with you.

While other games do get you immersed in the story, you will sit at certain points in game and just think about what you should do, or worse, what you already HAVE done.  War is ugly and you can see it in this game. It is quite complex and even after multiple playthroughs, you can still see and experience something new.

However, I don't recommend this game because of the gameplay. The real reason to play this game is the story - an unfortunately rare case for military shooters. I don't want to spoil it, if you've somehow come across this game without knowing about the story, but it has much more depth and consideration than you might expect, that is much more befitting of the violence it contains.  Overall, this is a really incredible game - but it won't really make you feel good. If you want a mindless shooter - which can be a good release - there are better choices.

If the main character, the hero, of the game thinks it's what is necesarry and good then it must be! Then you hit the half-way point of the game.

You were to radio in for evac if you discovered any sign of survivors but if your mission is completed why were you still fighting your way to the heart of the city? This game will make you feel like a horrible person. It will make you question why you even enjoy shooters it will throw atrocities of war into your face and point blank ask you if you are having fun yet. If you are enjoying what you have done. It will ask if you don't enjoy this then why are you still playing and it will carry this. It will call you a horrible person who loves to see suffering and throw it on until the very end. Now enough with the story and lets talk about the gameplay which is not nearly as great as the story. It is very standard third person shooter controls you can spring and take cover the aiming works well gunplay feels tight and the action is all there nothing much to write home about. There is some 'strategy' and by that I mean there is a single button dedicated to giving your two A.I. companions orders.

As gameplay is concerned, this game is mediocre. The cover system isn't as tight and fluid as other games are, and the lack of tactics for your squad leaves much to be desired. When playing this game on the hardest of difficulties, you will cry because this game doesn't want you to win. The mechanics actually work against you at times, and it's frustrating as hell. With that said, this is still one of my favorite games ever.  The storyline is one of the best stories any game has ever told. It's well written, and has a really good flow to it. Parts of this game will bring you to your knees with its power. You will be disturbed, breathless, and sick. But once the credits role, you will walk away with a higher standard for games. A standard that will not be met again. I still play through it once in awhile just to remind myself how great it was. So I say again, buy this game.",

Things felt kind of all over the place, and even at the end of the game when everything is supposedly explained to me, I still felt confused. But, despite the confusion, I do appreciate the story that they were trying to tell. I don't like it, per se, but it does let the true realities of war through, whereas most modern shooters pawn it off as a fun filled experience.

Like awfully, inexcusably, monstrously bad for what you do in the game. It's a game that will make you hate, if not yourself, then at least the protagonist Capt. Walker.

The action really starts packing in towards the middle of the Campaign which makes the end one to die for.You are faced with dramatic and story changing choices at the end of Campaign. My heart was racing with adrenaline the whole last half hour of the game. Spec Ops: The Line really changed my opinion and outlook on war, which games like COD fail to do. OVERVIEW: Spec Ops: The Line really changes your insight on what really happens in war; the bad and even more bad. This game depicts an accurate, but gruesome picture of a US Battallion gone rogue in Dubai, who end up killing thousands of innocent civilians just for their own survival. You are a 3-man Delta team that is supposed to go in and save all the civilians, but quickly find out, you are the only ones here focused on saving the civilians. You then fight the US 33rd Battallion and forget that you ever knew them as they whiz bullets by your face. I'm not a big review guy, so I won't spoil all the good stuff for you.

This game then thrusts you into situations where hard decisions must be made. The character you play will also gradually change his tone from neutral to violent, adding to your feeling of frustration, anxiety, and, perhaps, madness. At the end when truth is revealed, I was dumbfounded and began questioning all my actions before. Replaying the campaign will make them all the clearer.  While the plot does lack certain explanations, the journey itself is a remarkable (or should I say horrifying?) experience. I highly recommend this game to anyone who plays shooters. Gives you something to think about next time you pull a trigger somewhere else.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR version: The game is fantastic, and slightly depressing. Great story, good enough gameplay. And now for the particulars.  Spec Ops: The Line is a big question mark for the military shooter genre, disguised as a 3rd Person Shooter. The major point of the game is the story, the journey of three Delta Force operatives within the doomed city of Dubai. The focus is on the progression and the change of the characters and the world that turns more and more surreal and a mirror of the madness you descend into.  You start the game as you would a lot others, shooting mostly arab-looking opponents, running and gunning into the outskirts of Dubai... but you will certainly not finish the game as you would most others. The twists and turns of who is the actual opponent is a very nice thing, morality gets murky very quickly and some of the intel you find will make you think a lot about your enemy (very nice format to introduce collectibles into a serious game). The only fixed point in the swirling madness you walk into is the main character's certainty that he is doing the right thing. You be the judge if that is the case....  Some of the most striking bits about this game are the visuals and the sound. It isn't the most technically impressive title, even considering its age, but the way the sand-filled city of Dubai is presented to you is simply stunning. A very important thing is that the visuals will evolve together with the story and the characters: in the beginning the world is what you would think it is, bleak desert, with some remnants of civilization hanging around, but as you advance into the Heart of Darkness, the landscape will change accordingly. Inside the crumbling towers you will find the luxury mixing with brutality, surreal scenes painted with lots of colors, contrasting very sharply against the state of mind of the characters.  The visual transformation of your character and your squadmates is equally impressive and important in driving home the messages of the story. You start out as proper looking soldiers coming to the rescue, but by the end of the game you will look like demons murdering dozens upon dozens of soldiers... and then the game will ask you: 'How many Americans have you killed today.' And you might feel an urge to put down the controller/mouse and walk away from the game at that point... it is one of the possible endings, refusing to finish the game.  The sound and voice acting evolves similarly. In the beginning of the team your small team of Delta operatives behaves and talks like you would expect from elite soldiers. Your opponents and the world around you also sound proper. But there is a very subtle change happening to all these things along the game. Your orders go from the likes of the calm 'focus fire on my target' command to bellowing furiously toward you comrade: 'I want him dead', and your squadmates will respond in the same way, from professional acknowledgment to a disturbingly savage war-cry.   The genius in all this evolution is that it happens almost unseen, and the atmosphere of the game is so powerful that you won't always notice the changes as they happen. You will just be surprised at some point of the game that... wait.... when did we start shouting obscenities at out enemies and each other? Why the hell did I just execute a wounded US soldier with utmost brutality? Why did I just gun down that civilian?  The 'tooltip' messages that pop up on loading screens will also change... at first they will be actual tooltips, but as the madness progresses those messages will turn increasingly more intimidating ('Do you feel like a hero yet?' 'If you were a better person, you wouldn't be here.'), rubbing the salt even deeper. That fact that the changes are subtle but powerful is the whole point of the game, as is the fact that it is very good at sucking you into its world and making you miss all these little details when it would still matter.  Gameplay-wise, Spec Ops: The Line is good enough to carry the story. The TPS shooting mechanics are a bit stiff, aiming isn't as smooth as it could be... but combat is gritty and action-packed enough to be entertaining on most difficulty levels. For the best experience I would recommend Combat Op or Suicide Mission difficulty depending on your skill. These can make the combat challenging enough that the whole 'war is brutal' message isn't lost, but not as unforgiving that the combat would blur out the message of the experience. The tactical part of the game is very shallow, you can command you squadmates to attack a target you choose, heal each other, and occasionally to do a specific action (stun, flush). It is very barebones, and the AI isn't particularly bright either, but it is good enough. 'Good enough' is the staple of Spec Ops: The Line's actual gameplay mechanics. It isn't really good, not very memorable in itself, but not bad either.  I do have one major problem with this game however: what the bloody hell are 'Kill x amount of people with y gun' kind of achievements doing in this game? Who's genius idea was that load of steaming something? Actually why are there even achievements for this game? That seems to be completely against the spirit of the game...",

The controls are pretty wonky and tend to not work so well all the time. (I'm looking at you, vaulting and shooting over cover detection. And cover detection. And moving in cover without standing back up for no reason.) Also controls: All popups show what buttons to hit for a controller, which really isn't helpful while playing with a mouse and keyboard. Still controls: Sometimes the keyboard key for is isn't the same as the controller bound key. (B skips cutscenes. B is melee/vault. E is bound to melee/vault. Enter skips cutscenes. Wut?) Controls again: Very different things are bound to the same key. (One key for sprint, take cover, jump off a ledge, and use a turret. Makes it easy to confuse the game with what you're trying to do.)  This game was very fun to play through, but it felt that the better I got at it, the more the clunky controls got in my way, leading to a number of deaths by standing up while trying to move in cover, melee attacking a wall I want to vault over, or clicking away to try to blindfire over cover when the game decides I can't blindfire from that spot. But I got through it. I didn't come for airtight controls, I came for the story. And boy did it deliver. Though, the blow was softened considerably since I had been spoiled about just what the game was really trying to get at before I started.

The mp part of the game, while it holds a lot of potential due to the tactical nature of the combat, fails to deliver 'cause of some technical issues/omissions (bad matchmaking, no host migration, etc). A game that is certainly worth playing at least once.",

It is a really dark game; this is porbably the closest videogame comprehension of PTSD I've ever witnessed. It incorperates so many different aspect on how you view your morality, this is an expirence well worth, in my book, a 60 dollar game. Not everybody would agree, but it is worth a buy, and much more. It does have it short-comings though. Gameplay gets stale after so much burality that Walker can do, and some enemies like the Heavies, a staple in many games now a days, felt forced. There's an overall sense of forcing some enemy types. Overall, this is a great game I'd pay time and time again.

The Veteran difficulty wasn't too hard, just a few spots that drove me nuts which was mostly due to the cover system not working well for me. Again, the controls can be clunky at times.

Yet, its hard not to get the gameplay right with a hundred examples to pick from. Enough of the combat is tense and challenging that the game recieves passing grades for fire fights, but nothing really elevates it.  However, the story is absolutely phenomenal, albeit unoriginal as it is inspired by the Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Still, if you are going to copy, might as well copy from one of the best. In a fictional near future, a massive sand storm hits the city of Dubai destroying much of its infrastructure. However, a batalion of US soldiers, the 'damned' 33rd, attempted to evacuate and save civilians before and during the storm. However, all contact is lost with the city and the batalion. They are officially left for dead in a no man's land.  Until the game's protagonist (your character) Mark Walker, a member of Delta Force, is sent to make contact with any survivors. What begins as a recon mission quickly escaltes as the city is divided into factions at war with each other. Along the way, Walker tries to aggressively to play hero, and, well, mistakes are made. This is not a heroic fantasy where a world in peril can be saved from a villain by a good hero. So, you don't know how it will end, or what the price will be for simply to continue playing.

            "review_text": "This game is a Trojan horse, a game made and hyped to look like your typical second-rate Call of Duty knock-off. It asks you to understand that mindset and be ready to be the absurd, invincible action hero. It creates the smoke and mirrors of a world of brutal warfare where manly men pose atop the carcasses of their enemies and give nary a thought to the dozens of friends they have lost in just the last five minutes.   Then, when you have lost yourself in that fantasy of false machismo, Spec Ops: the Line brutally pulls the wool off your eyes.  This game is more of a horror game than a military shooter. This game by design brings all of your posturing over your virtual heroism up to the fore just to take it away. The narrative is downright brilliant with a crisp and clean delivery, without delays or lengthy exposition. Spec Ops respects your intelligence - it expects you to see the horror of what happens and understand what it means beyond the game.  The level of attention to detail is striking. A full discussion of just how much thought the dev team put into making the player experience what has happened would take far too long, but I have to bring up one of my favorite touches. First, the comments made by the protagonist change as does his mindset. In the beginning of the game, he is composed and professional, sounding like a typical military shooter character. 'Tango down.' 'Agh, I'm hit.' 'Target the grenedier on top of the billboard.' As the events unravel, the voice stabs change - 'TANGO ♥♥♥♥ING DOWN!' 'HE'S DONE!' 'I WANT HIM ♥♥♥♥ING DEAD!' The enemy voice stabs do the reverse, at first disorderly and pained, but later robotic, flat, and full of jargon. Dehumanized. It's a chilling effect for those who open their ears.  The gameplay is a fairly standard third person shooter with decent artificial intelligence on the part of both the NPCs and the enemy. Movement is slowed to a realistic speed, enemies do occasionally seem to come out of semi-obvious spawn points, and your command over the NPC squad is limited to calling targets. As the game takes place in Dubai after an apocalyptic sandstorm, sand is sometimes used creatively for environmental kills and often used for harrowing firefights in the middle of a storm. There are the obligatory turret sections expected from this kind of game and they are the same turret sections you have blazed through since the early 2000's. Don't expect any of the big set-pieces you've seen before. Mechanically, they aren't there, and narratively, they do not make sense. Graphically, the setting is beautiful, mixing the evocative luxury of wasted Dubai with the stunning, more human, more personal suffering of a city on the brink. This is not the cartoony wasteland of Fallout, or the over-dark of a STALKER, but rather a level of anguish torn straight from images of real refugee camps.  But do not play Spec Ops for its average gun combat. Play it because it's a game that confronts the player like no other. This is not a heroic war fantasy to make you feel powerful. This is gaming's Heart of Darkness or Apocalypse now, trying to make you think about your wish to be a virtual hero.",

This game had everything that doesn't appeal to me in games; it's not an FPS, you need to occasionally command two other squad members (although this is minimal) and the controls were a little clunky and first off, I assumed I wouldn't like it.  However with all that said this game goes on sale quite often (sometimes for under £5 which is well worth it imo) and in the end you'll realize isn't one of those sterotypical videogames where 'you're the hero and good on you for murdering everyone'.   After playing this (and without giving away any of the story) I'd really reccomend buying this game - especially if you're on Linux and are looking for a 'non indie' game, something with a bit more bulk.  As I said I can't really reccomend this better than anyone else has but if you enjoy storyrich games, action and a reasonable challenge then be sure to pick this up!  Minor complains;  -- As I said I'm on Linux so I'm unsure if it's an issue with the Linux version of the game or the game itself but when using an Xbox360 controller and it didn't work, it would constantly 'spin' left, or make me walk around in a circle left - the controller works okay with other games so I'm not sure.  -- Also, sometimes the game would lag up, or chop up although this was very rare and hardly ever often in a moment of combat, it was often either in a cutscene or switching from one area to aother, which is forgivable.

THE GOOD:   1) Story I really liked the story and how they make you feel when trying to do the right thing. I have to see the result for the other options, but i felt like an bad bad man when i was done with my first run.  2) Environment: This city is so huge, awesome and nice to look at with the team. We have been in the desert, city streets, water plants, radio stations, exhibitions and all the good stuff, you can see trip pictures in my profile. Nice atmosphere overall (And I am a sucker for atmosphere)  3) Music: You give me some old skool music like deep purple en some new neo-psychedelic rock and i am in! Nothing to complain here.  4) Gameplay and other: The way the movement feels in your hand is just solid and familiar. Also liked the survival aspect of getting enough bullets, I tried to kill my opponent in one go. This did not always work. If you get out of ammo, the feeling of pressure to get new ammo quick or die is just a good mix in this game.   THE BAD:   1) Cover mechanics: I died so much because i needed to vault, run to next cover. When running to cover he will snap into cover on the wrong side... Then i needed to vault again en get my ♥♥♥ down in cover again. You can imagine how many times you get shot doing this.  2) Game length: The title tells it all, but a game of 6 hours? As someone who likes single player games this is too short for my taste.   OVERALL:  It's a good game, nothing special but what 's new right? If you can get it cheap just do it. I would like to see more of this. It's a game of 6 hours, sadly to short for my taste.

The encounters are fun and generally well-designed with some original elements, but there's nothing gamechanging being brought to the table.  Narratively, this is one of the best games I've ever played. There are some issues with it no doubt, and there is definitely some railroading afoot, but the setting, the characters, and everything else about the game is so well done I can easily forgive that. It's rare for a shooter to have any reasonable sort of plotline at all, but this...this is just overkill. The story is too good. Buy it. Play it. Understand it.   A word of warning, though. This game is definitely not for everyone, even if you enjoy shooters, but it is REALLY, REALLY good.",

The gameplay sucks, the AI is ridiculously accurate, grenades can be thrown at places by the enemy that is hard to avoid and gives free rain for the enemies to repeatedly kill you with grenade spam (its even worse on the hard difficulty). The aiming is decent but feels a bit cluncky and unpolished, and the enemy knows where you are at all times and even behind cover. Also not a fan of the games that forces you take cover very frequenty which diminishes my enjoyment of it very much, and the long regeneration time of your health is another thing that breaks the enjoyment for me. This health system could have been improved by increasing the health pool and increasing regenaration time so I can be blasting the baddies on the field longer than taking my sweet time taking a nap to regenerate that health while under cover (it doesn't have to be realistic to be fun. What am I saying? Regenating health is not realistic).   BUT! (yes, a huge but). The different take on telling the story is incredible, not perfect but it is really well executed overall. I won't spoil it but all I can say is the build up of the plot takes unexpected turn and that turn does not feel out of place and goes really well with the game's mood and setting. It could have added the choices and actions in the game that affect you later in the game, and might question your choises which would have added more depth into the game. The story kind of reminds me of the movie fight club, you will know what I mean if you have watched the movie and finished the game.  where it lacks in gameplay, makes it up with a great plot and a depressing climactic story that will surely change you as a person upon discovering the dark side of man kind in war recommend it on a huge sale only since the asking price is too much for the length of the game.",

Soldiers can make really stupid decisions that can cost innocent lives and the repercussions could damage them mentally, something that Spec Ops is able to capture spectacularly well. That's the beauty of this game, you are not here to play just another military shooter, you're here for an experience that can only be understood once you played it.

Of course theres some instances of dumb AI and you can feel limited as to how youre squad can perform (simple stun/attack commands only, theres no movement issuing orders) but it doesnt retract from the gameplay at all as it helps youre character feel more human as opposed to an all seeing all powerful supersoldier. The way the game progresses and how you feel as you get further into the horrors start to genuinely make you think about the morality of your actions and any game that can make you seriously think about what you are doing is an achievement in my book.

Switching firing modes or a grenade attachment adds a bit of tactical depth to the gunplay.   If you are looking to play mutilplayer online matches, look elsewhere. Invite only co-op can possibly add another 2 to 3 hours of gameplay on top of the 6 to 8 hours required to complete the campaign. Spec Ops: The Line is an underrated gem that deserves more attention. Buy it on sale and enjoy the ride.",

I really can't say much about this game. It's a third-person hallway shooter. The combat is monotonous, the gameplay is pretty average. It doesn't do anything wrong, but it also doesn't do anything interesting or new.   However, the story is really where the game shines. Do yourself a favor and if you don't know anything about this game--don't look it up and just dive in headfirst. Although I must confess, this game would have made a better movie than it would a game--or maybe it wouldn't. Maybe all the mindless killing is a part of the experience.   Average gameplay.

Well, what it does excellently is provide a story that at least has had effort put into it, which can't really be said for most shooters at the time, and it provides a very brutal but real picture of the phrase 'War is hell', but with a much, much deeper meaning. What it does VERY poorly is controls on PC, while using a mouse is easier to aim with, almost all of the controls are garbage on a keyboard unless you take time to map them, which I, and quite a few people, hate doing, and they will sometimes leave you ready to break your keyboard. Leaving spoilers out, this game really, and I mean REALLY will ♥♥♥♥ with your head towards the end. It's hard to say what hasn't already been said about SO:TL, but if I can say one thing, it is that this is like Saving Private Ryan: The Game. It actually has, at least from my perspective, a very engaging story that will keep you playing. It did only take a few hours to beat, but you WILL have a good old fasion 'souls-like' experience while playing on higher difficulties, which I would recommend, as higher difficulties require you to stop and think a bit before running around like Master Chief spraying down countless dudes, cause your not m8, and bullets will ruin ur day. Overall, I don't regret spending the time or money I did on this game. War IS hell, and you sure as hell will get yours when you play this. If you wanna know, here are some brief details about the game \\/  Story playtime:    ~6-8 hrs depending on what diff. setting. 16 if you replay on FUBAR    Missions:    15 including the epilogue    # Of Time You'll Get Triggered:    To ♥♥♥♥in' many   ",

The gameplay mechanics can be a little bit of the same after you get into it but the mechanics are very well done. This game had six different endings and makes it replayable to some. I actually find the multiplayer very fun if you can manage to get other players online as well. The massive amount of combat seems a little odd with the storyline but it is a video game and is drawn in for 'entertainment'. But I played this game for something more than entertainment. Because it draws you in as a shooter but then holds you as a story. Overall the game has great mechanics an unforgettable story that will be more than any other game you have played.",

Walker as he carries out a rescue mission that has gone horribly south in Dubai after sandstorms have destroyed the city. You are accompanied by two NPCs who will assist you in combat and add to the story. The combat is pretty straight forward and uses a cover system to help you navigate through firefights. Ammo is limited due to the circumstances you find yourself in and the game encourages you to pick up the weapons of fallen enemies.   Since I don't want to spoil the plot of the game I won't go into too many details, but I will say the choices you make in the game do affect the outcome. As the situation becomes more chaotic you will be asked to make choices that may seem pretty straight forward, but the game will surprise you if you stick with it until the end. As I have said earlier, the story is truly what makes this game shine and forces you to think about what is right and wrong during war.",

My only problem with this game is that with all the animation for all the special moves that the characters preform is that sometimes they always don't do what you want them to do. The porting for this game isn't too bad just because you can customize just about everything which was great for any pc game. The story I felt was reveting just becuase you wanted to feel like you are the hero in the game, but there are many moments where I just didn't want to choose anything. Most enemies in other games you don't feel bad at all, but this game took that to another level with shooting them they can either end up dead or on the ground coughing and choking, and half way through the game I honestly didn't want to kill anyone just becuase I felt bad for shooting them.

Spec Ops makes you cross The Line to drive home a single point: as fun as military shooters might be, their morals are terrible, their implications are even worse, and their characters, the ones you are supposed to root for, are war criminals. The game is carefully constructed to make you feel guilty for having fun. Is it manipulative? Yes, sure. It is hypocritical? Probably. It is worth going through? Absolutely.",

The 'Do you recommend this game, Yes : No' is very limiting here because it depends. If you are looking for a good game this isn't it. If you are looking for one with a great story that is a military game no less than you found it. In this 'I'm offended' generation where someone always has to be offended by something and demand its removal the devs went all out and didn't care who they offended. They had a message to send and pulled no punches.  Game wise Spec Ops The Line suffers. I was constantly fighting with the controls and couldn't help but be bored to death whenever the shooting started thanks to the mediocre mechanics and bad AI. It came to the point where I was trying to rush through the game just so I could be done with it and that's a shame because it somewhat took away from the impact of the story.   The visuals are average and the aliasing hurt my eyes but it runs worse than Crysis 3. On a rig equipped with a 3770K, 16 Gigs of RAM, and a GTX 780ti I was getting frequent stutters, shaky mouse movements, and framerate drops.   With that said the creators of Spec Ops The Line clearly had a vision and they must have fought tooth and nail to make it happen. What starts off as a cliché military shooter ends up as something far more. The story is grim, depressing, bold, and a big middle finger to military games which rely on unquestioning patriotism and make war seem like it's fun and cool. It is not afraid to tackle the horrors of war and PTSD. It's designed to make you feel uncomfortable and it's about time a military game goes this route.  It's a shame then that there isn't a good game here to compliment the work put in by the writers. I am glad to have experienced Spec Ops The Line but it is not something I can easily recommend.",

It tries to make you a monster and to give you a bad conscience. But if you play the game a second time and look at the way things develop, it is clear that you have no choice but to follow the development as the game unfolds. In the end, the game becomes surreal and leaves more questions than answers. In my opinion the story is unrealistic and does not make any sense.  Although most players on steam recommend this game, mainly because of the story, I can not agree. The game-play is not perfect but that's OK. Fighting isn't too bad and fun most of the time. What really sucks is the story. This game is all about the story and I really do not like it. I wonder what a U.S. soldier would say about this game.",

            "review_text": "I do NOT recommend this game. It's painfully clear that the makers were trying to make a point with the game, story and gameplay. But it's extremely heavy handed, in your face and sometimes makes absolutely no sense.  So let's start from the beginning. The game is a Modern Military Shooter and it's got every single trope from these games, including regenerating health, bland cover mechanics, billions of soldiers, rambo-style firing from the hip, unskippable cutscenes and more testosterone than a juvenile detention camp.  It tries to be dark, realistic and gritty, but then throws you in a situation where you mow down 50-60 enemies all on your own (or with your two teammates). There are even situations where AG (Air-to-ground) missiles strike the ground not five feet from you and all that results in is a bit of an action scene in slow-mo, a building falling apart but you escaping unscathed. It's got a serious problem with keeping it's setting and tone. Is it dark and realistic? Trying to make a moral point? Is it a dumb covershooter? It can't seem to make up its mind about what it's trying to be.  The gameplay is bland, bordering on downright dull. It's just moving to a battle arena area, mow down 30-50 enemies, move to the next cutscene, new arena. Rince and repeat. It's incredibly dull and if it wasn't for the story, I would've quit after less than half an hour. It's that dull.  It's very obvious the point of this game was to make a moral point in killing and what you're actually doing in a game like this. Killing hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers. Yet the game never gives you an option to stop and ponder these things. Nor does it give you any meaningful choices. Oh, so you want to berate me for using white phosphorous on a bunch of american soldiers, and accidently on a bunch of civilians? Sure, but then give me an alternate route! You can't berate me for making a choice where I had no other choice.   Then there's situations which are obvious 'shooter traps'. At one point, someone you care about is killed by an angry mob of civilians, and you're put in a situation where unless you wait for a few seconds, it's going to be the airport scene all over again. Try to walk through the civilians, they nearly one-hit kill you with a push. It's blindingly obvious that the game wants you to shoot the civilians so that it can complain about what a horrible human being you are later. Now, there's actually a way out of that situation that does not involve massacre, so I'll give the game that.  The game at one point makes a quip at how killing civilians isn't allowed in war and adds a contemptful 'But you don't even care'. Don't presume to know me, my dear game. It pisses me off.  But on the whole this game is frustrating, extremely heavy handed, DRENCHED in MMS tropes and has bland and dull gameplay. Unless you love these kinds of games, please stay away! It's raising some questions, but it does is so extremely 'in your face' that it just becomes tiresome and preachy. ",

I came away disappointed, trying to talk about the plot without spoiling it is a pain but I will say that it's nothing mind blowing and the game totally failed to leave me with any really lasting impression. Without flat-out spoiling the story I will say that it has the issue of making you do stuff that is clearly a bad idea, this wouldn't be complaining about this were it not for the hype of how subversive this game is and how it makes you feel bad for your action, but it totally fails because you have no way of making progressive if you don't do what it wants and since most of this stuff is carried out against no name civ's it's even harder to care, once the game started accusing me of being a bad bad man in its screens I felt more like laughing than feeling bad. The other issue is 'the twist' yes there's a big plot twist near the end, but it's the same twist that's been seen in a ton of other games and movies, hell even COD did it at one point, I'm not gonna say what it is but it god really popular after being in a movie with a name a bit like Brawl Group, try not to think about that too hard if you don't want to guess it.

            "review_text": "This what it? This was the cult classic shooter every video game hipster this side of the solar system ranted and raved about? Really? Okay, where to begin...    First and foremost, the game was four hours on the normal difficulty. Four. That's about a dollar an hour for what I paid this game for on Steam, so whatever, But definitely not worth the $30 it's worth normally. Beyond that, the game doesn't really successfullly subvert the shooter genre like a lot of people like to say it does. Why? Because you, as the player, never have any real decisions to make. The game tries to make you feel bad for doing things, except you have no choice but to do them. If I could choose not to do bad things but I did them anyway, mistakeningly or otherwise, I might feel bad about the bad things my character does in the game. But I can't, so I don't. Beyond that, the story was pretty convoluted. Some of the crap the characters do is overtly sabotaging their mission and they don't seem to notice until after the fact.    The rest of the narrative is pretty much 'find this guy, so you can find that guy, so you can find THAT guy', and that's pretty much it. It's a quest to find a bunch of different dudes who are in the game for fewer than thirty minutes so you can find the next guy who will be in the game for fewer than thirty minutes and that's pretty much it. On top of that, the suppossed delta operators act like anything but. None of them seem like they've ever held a weapon before in their respective lives. The player character inexplicably has two rear iron sights on his rifle and fires it with the stock under his armpit. The dialogue is also horrible. Additionally, there are military inaccuracies out the wazoo. There are two officers in your 'squad', but delta doesn't recruit officers. A fireteam is at least four guys, but your team has three. The 33rd Battalion has way too many guys to actually be a battalion, and the guy leading them is also a delta officer (again, even though there's no such thing). Why is a spec ops guy leading an infantry unit? Who knows. This game makes zero sense. Moreoever, you carry about half the actual combat load of an actual soldier, so have fun constantly scrounging for ammo after you burn through your whopping 120 rounds in your primary weapon.     Your teammates are also completely useless. They can't do anything unless you tell them to, otherwise they just get in your way. Ocasionally, they'll even get downed and you'll have to revive them, even though there is no such system in place for your character. If you go down, you die. Which is horribly frustrating, considering you'll sprint when you mean to slide into cover and vice versa due to the bad controls. All in all, this game is just bad. It doesn't really succeed in anything it tries to do. The only part of the game that really got to me was one of the endings that you can affect, and even then, the game couldn't fight its compulsion to be lame and cut the awesome pan-out and the music just as the full effect of the scene was setting in.     The game's cutscenes are abrupt with rapid transitions and violent cut-outs of music. There are fewer than ten commonly-encountered weapons in the whole game, and none of them can be customized. Which, is kinda ridiculous, considering delta guys get absolute autonomy over their gear. Your companions are noisey and incompetent tag-alongs who constantly shout at you, giving away your position. Even the gunplay is mediorce at best. Buy the game and give it a go if it's on sale. Otherwise, avoid it like it's the plague. This game was atrociously bad.",

Spec Ops has nothing more than the most basic mechanics present in every single shooting game, and yet it still manages to muck those up tremendously. Movement is horrendously clunky, sprinting is unresponsive, the cover system is buggy, and the control scheme is without a doubt the worst I've ever encountered. Sometimes I would stand up and get myself killed by accident because melee and vault over cover are mapped to the same button for whatever brilliant reason. Also, going into cover, as well as leaving it, requires you to sprint, which often times sent me bolting forward when I really just wanted to stand up. Would it be so hard to create a designated cover button like nearly every other cover based third person shooter? Normally, I would complain that this is a full price game that is only 4 to 5 hours long, but for every second I spent playing this game I just wanted it to end so that I could see this revolutionary plot twist everybody was talking about.

You do have a squad, but there are a grand total of 3 commands you can give, 2 of them situational, so all you really do is mark targets for them to shoot. The weapons are very generic, but frustrating, because ammo is limited and there is just enough weapon variety to run low or out of ammo regularly, because enemies simply won't use gun X for a while. Grenades are common but very under-whelming, best saved to dump on heavies and turrets. Enemy AI isn't bad, but again, nothing special, with the main difficulty coming from enemies spawning at different places and running onto the map with little to no warning, so you can't intelligently use cover until you learn their spawn patterns. Really, the game is mostly just holding back enemies in clear, distinct waves a couple of times at every checkpoint. Over and over. I guess this isn't that unusual or bad compared to similar games, but it's also why everyone gets those other games for MP, because the SP gameplay is so boring! There's no unique enemies or visceral combat or anything this game can call it's own, and ends up being completely unmemorable.  And I honestly don't understand the praise this story gets. Your characters are three dudes you know nothing about, at all. They don't act intelligently, they are not consistent, and the 'big choices' you make don't much matter. And those choices...okay, this is the laziest kind of 'choice' writing; completely unexpected, impossible-to-know things happen, meaning, your CHOICES don't matter, it's just dumb luck. It's like choosing to shoot a guy in the leg to NOT kill him, but you happen to shoot his lighter and he erupts in flame. Umm...okay. You tried to do the right thing, moving on. But no, the game tries to make this kind of random chance into a morality play. The overall plot is riddled with holes and is made VERY DRAMATIC only because PEOPLE keep YELLING and CURSING constantly! Stripped of that, it's actually not intelligent or clever; it may 'make you think', but as soon as you do, you'll see how idiotic everything is. Basic questions are not even asked in game; we are just supposed to not think about the blatant contradictions and not wonder why our heroes are doing what they are doing.  Yeah, this is not fundamentally different from every other brown/grey modern shooter. All they did was take the very basic stock story, and add hamfisted guilt, a few trippy scenes, and the theme of 'your choices matter!' while not allowing your choices to matter and delivered with the subtlety of a 2X4 to the neck. I LIKE good stories, but honestly, I would have preferred a simple but well-written story versus this failed attempt to do better, because instead of being 'out of the way' and forgetable, it's instead a headache that makes me go 'What? Why?!' every 10 minutes. Don't buy this game unless you just need another dime-a-dozen over-the-shoulder shooter, and you don't mind someone desperately trying to Oliver Stone you over the head with plot you don't care about.",

Game tried way to hard to be cold and badass, and did a good job of it but left good writing and decent gameplay at the gate. The storyline makes so many concessions just to try to be grim and hard that its laughable. If you have to try this hard to get a reaction out of your players, you're doing it wrong. Further, the plot device of 'you don't know what's going on' can only take you so far. In the end, the reveal was a joke because you'd been mindlessly running from checkpoint to checkpoint gunning everything in sight down for absolutely no reason.  The writing also gives you absolutely no reason to care about any of the characters. There are numerous circumstances where the lead characters (I can't even remember their names, thats how unimportant and faceless they are) should have been shot down but the game is scripted to just let them through the checkpoint just so you can fight immediately after behind the safety of cover. As an example, there's a point when you are completely surrounded by snipers and enemies. They leave you for literally 5 seconds, and disembark from their high-ground advantage just to fight you in the open where you can easily pick them off. This was all scripted, and its irritating for a game that tries to play itself off as real.",

            "review_text": "Spec Ops: The Line is an excellent example of why I no longer trust video game reviewers. Somewhere along The Line between entertainment and art, curators and plebs alike decided that a game with a point was somehow exempt from basic rules of gaming. It’s like if Mona Lisa spat on everyone who looked at it we’d still consider it genre-breaking. Except, Spec Ops isn’t Mona Lisa, it’s a trite piece of undercooked antiwar masturbation that appears to fear rupturing an aneurism if it avoids a cliché. Admittedly, I am comparing it to my larger recollections of war stories, not the current state of the subject within games. Compare Spec Ops to Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory and the chasm between entertainment and pacifism Spec Ops apparently thinks unavoidable appears more of an artificial border. That is to say, Paths of Glory is every bit as cynical as Spec Ops but with half the tedium. I am not the first to point out that Spec Ops is a horrible game. Its benefactors admit this with the caveat that it somehow lends credence to its message. The Cynical Brit said it “isn’t a good game per se, it’s deliberately mundane 3rd person shooter which makes you think about the horrors of war.” It’s the “deliberately mundane” that irritates me. A deliberately mundane game is often indistinguishable from an incompetently mundane one. Cover-based gunfights that can be best described as soggy could be a statement about the stupidity of war, or a testament to how hard it is to make crisp-feeling third-person firefights. Considering that Gears of War is the only successful such attempt in recent memory, it’s all too convenient to say the gameplay was supposed to be bland. The blurb from its Steam store page describes this allegedly meaningful mediocrity as “tactical squad-based Delta Force gameplay throughout a horizontally and vertically oriented world”. Perhaps I expect too much, but anyone who pens prose such as this should not be trusted to make any adaptation of the Heart of Darkness. The memorable part of the gameplay is being constantly overwhelmed by hugely boring enemies who appear to be completely fungible with the exception of a single heavy type, who by describing as ‘heavy’ I have already imparted more information about their humanity than the game ever bothers to. Which is another issue with the deliberately mundane hypothesis. The storyline meshes with the gameplay precisely not at all. As I stand knee-deep in American soliders I shot to death because they stood between me and the next cutscene I’m expected to find my accidental shelling of a few dozen civilians the moral low point and story high point of the entire affair. Why? Ten minutes ago I intentionally killed men whose principal crime was proximity, and now I’m expected to feel remorse over the ones I offed on accident? Perhaps the convenience of intentionality ran dry by this point in the plot, because apparently designing mundane gameplay does matter yet designing to murder does not. Who’s ever heard of manslaughter anyway? While I’m worrying about intentions, this game does an impressively bad job of concerning itself with mine. Sometimes, I was killed by the nameless faceless ‘baddies’ because I was too bored to be bothered to think about any kind of tactics. The rest of the time, I was killed because the game figures “run headlong into the enemy” and “cower beneath chest-high wall” are basically synonymous. Neither was any quick recovery possible, because unlike in Gears of War, the far superior gameplay progenitor of Spec Ops, I could not reverse my inertia with the tap of the ‘don’t-get-killed’ button. Instead, I stood to my full height, rearing my all-American chest to their all-American steel, slowly reoriented myself to our homeland and attempted to correct the game’s mistake. But allow me to judge this “Story Rich” and “Political” game by its story and politics. Besides the name Conrad, the only feature Spec Ops retains from the Heart of Darkness is inexplicable motivations. And I don’t particularly appreciate that in the original text. Why does the protagonist continue on? That his unwilling companions constantly question him only compounds the issue by making it apparent. The complete lack of confusion on his part lulls the player into a blind acceptance of the plot, as we are presumably supposed to feel about the soldier’s acceptance of their mission drift. If you’re wondering where the plot holes are, just list the plot points. Why does he continue on into the city despite his orders about the retaining wall? To save the soldiers he watched die? What about the rebels who kill those soldiers; why do they vanish? Why does he accept the CIA so readily, while accepting that his fellow soldiers must die? And at no point do his Delta force underlings question him. These are men who are better educated and generally older than the average soldier: Men who are trained to question things normal soldiers aren’t. Even at the end, the last underling can’t bring himself to actually defy the protagonist. He merely won’t go with him any longer. Apparently, Conrad’s existence is enough to throw the protagonist into a fit of vengeance but his murdering of fellow soldiers, disregard of common sense, morality, and orders isn’t enough to inspire anything but words from his compatriots. I suppose they made the mistake of not being player-controlled characters. The Heart of Darkness doesn’t work without xenophobia. Chinua Achebe was right to point out that the text portrays Africans as inhuman, but it’s a necessary literary move for the text to work as a whole. It may be wrong, but you can’t just take the xenophobia out and expect the story to survive. Unless you’re Spec Ops. There are no foils for “good” Europeans to be compared to within the game. No “savages” on the shore to provide a visceral reminder of what the main characters are pretending not to be. All that’s left is people acting strangely. The ideology of imperialism cannot even be mocked if there are no apparent victims to it. And the handful of quivering refugees are as easily regarded the victims of the sandstorms as they are of the American military industrial complex. My principal emotions from playing the entirety of this quagmire of a game were frustration, confusion, and apathy. Frustration with the gameplay which clearly hated itself, confusion as to why any of the characters were doing almost anything they did, and apathy at the results of the decisions I didn’t understand. If this game is political, what political views should I take away from it? That we should be careful before dropping mortars on thermal signatures? That Delta Force commanders should not have total jurisdiction over places at which they just arrived? There is no political message here that is any less tedious or obvious than the game itself. Unless you need an eight-hour reminder that killing is bad (m’kay), stick to Bioshock for literature-inspired gaming.",

The only reason this game has good reviews is because the Spec Ops community suppresses negative ratings by downvoting them into oblivion. If you actually want to see unbiased reviews, look at the 'funny' section where a few have surfaced through. I know people will gripe about me only having 50 minutes played. I had to use a custom launcher because it kept crashing on startup. This review will cover the mechanics first, then the plot.  This game is so linear its basically a 5 hour movie that pauses itself every minute or so for you to unpause it with a quicktime event or pressing a button to climb over something. The guns feel awful, never run out of ammo, and you'll never use anything the enemy isn't carrying at the time. Everything consists of setpieces with less thought put into them than MoH Warfighter. You will shoot enemies in a linear environment from cover for about 3 rooms, have yet another encounter with a turret that lasts all of about 5 seconds, then predict perfectly that you will be ambushed by infinite waves of enemies. In these ambushes you have to simply rely on trial and error and waiting. In every ambush there is a special spot you're supposed to be or you will be killed. For example, in the first ambush you have to run across an open field of sand to a broken building and get behind one of two pieces of cover. Lets say you picked the left, you'll be blown up with a rocket launcher setpiece and killed instantly. You restart, try to fight back and get killed within seconds because you want to have a good time, I guess. Eventually, after a few retrys, you'll find the magic position that won't get you killed, sit there for about 3 minutes until another setpiece is activated and you somehow all get away unscathed. You will look around and suddenly realize that you are now conveniently at the exact location you were heading to in the first place.   This game introduces nothing innovative whatsoever other than the option of shooting a window about every 30 minutes to drop sand on enemies. It seems like more of a gimmick to me than anything else. The movement couldn't even be spared, either. Imagine if Gears of War and Army of Two had a crippled child that was put on the indie games section of XBOX 360. Spec Ops just a step above that. It also doesn't help that the friendly AI is constantly in your way and consistently fails to understand orders outside the context of linear setpieces, which is always a 'press M3 to continue this game' resulting in your teammates actually doing their jobs.  Since everyone regards this game so highly due to its story and 99% of the plot is driven by cutscenes, I'm going to look at as a movie. If this was submitted for a film class, I'd give it an A-. I enjoyed the dramatic shift in tone and the twist endings, but that's all that really stuck out. It feels a bit shoehorned at times but I pushed through the generic cliches of modern shooters that is spec ops to reach the ending and the finale was great. However, it didn't make up for the lack of intuitive gameplay. My only qualm for the plot is the poor character development for everyone other than the main character and his squad. There weren't any memorable enemies and the leaders of the various factions you fight are basically just 'guys.' They don't have anything special to them and I'm bound to forget them within a week or two from now.   Scores with 5/10 being average Gameplay: 2/10 Story: 8/10 Overall for the game itself: 3/10  If you really want to enjoy this game, please do yourself a favor and just watch the cutscenes online and save $30 and 4 hours of your time.

The story of the game is also really bad. I had no idea what was going on and what my characters motivations were. The ending left me even more clueless. I just wanted to shoot some people and kill stuff for fun, but my character didnt, there was a lot of lubonarrative dissonance.  This game's developers attempted to excuse awful game design by making the story have a layer of irony for hipsters. So no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ their game is, they can get off scot free.

I had a problem with enemies which seemed unkillable, until I discovered they were hiding behind a turret which would not show in frame. The controls are finicky and do not work well with mouse and keyboard. I got more comfortable with them towards the end of the game, but it was still frustrating to not be able to vault over certain short obstacles or to only be able to stop sprinting by taking my hand off the keyboard. The storyline was pretty good, but for me was not worth the painful gameplay. If you really want a story that goes more in depth than average then go for it, but overall I do not recommend it.",

The third-person camera is clumsy, lending itself to many unfair deaths and rage moments. The guns all feel pretty similar.  There's an rpg and some sniper rifles, but you're mainly going to be using an AK, M4A1, or MP-45 for the duration of the game. The hit detection with sniper rifles is awful.

The 'hook' of Spec Ops The Line is 'what if the hero owned up to his kill-spree'? But despite these shades of Apocalypse Now, this message is toothless; a tale about the morality of choosing to kill loses its bite when the game railroads you down a narrow path. If there is literally no other way to proceed, the impact of 'choosing' to become a ruthless killer is lost because there is *no choice*; had the game offered multiple ways of bypassing the enemies then perhaps the desired effect would have been achieved, but as it stands the story is pointlessly preachy. It doesn't help that the setting - an endless dust storm that buries a modern city - is so unbelievable, or that none of the characters are in the least bit relatable. Anyway, I am frankly tired of this endless string of antiheroes in modern FPS games; it's become as trite and overdone as all the other standard cliches used in every other modern-warfare shooter.  But even aside from the overbearing plot, the game play is hardly anything to write home about; it's an uninspired cover-based shooter. The map design is thoroughly unimpressive and the low-poly graphics looked extremely dated (especially the pathetic explosions, which seemed fifteen years out of date). The AI was braindead (as usual), with the usual 'run behind cover and poke head up every ten seconds' routines that seem to be the norm for the genre. This was made all the worse since each skirmish long overstayed it welcome, with far too many spawns. And for a game whose main theme was the horror of war, most battles were remarkably bloodless, with enemies falling dead with barely a mark on them (the sole exceptions were scripted events). In the end, despite its worthy attempt to raise the level of discourse, Spec Ops was an unlikable game in every aspect.",

You are accompanied by to AI buddies, which start off well enough, but by the end of the game (which is fairly short, maybe 6 or 7 hours total) just keep making stupid decision after stupid decision with results in you having to rescue them (or more frequently dying while trying to rescue them).  The game also hosts the standard sin of video games: Cut-scene and THEN a super deadly encounter. If you die, you get to watch the cut-scene again. At least you can skip most of them, but still it is quite annoying. This game takes a lot of cheap shots and hosts more than a few total BS encounters.

            "review_text": "To be honest i was disappointed. When i saw Zero punctuation's review i was very hyped for what i would get, but in the end it didn't really got to me.  The game was praised for being a masterpiece of modern shooter due to it's 'self aware' story, where it isn't the call of duty's nor battlefield's usual routine of 'Grrrrrr X nation has turned againts 'MURICA, TERRORISTS, KILL KILL KILL'.  The game is set in Dubai, but it's future Dubai and it's buried unter 500 ******* meters of sand. You are playing as the commander of a special squad, forged out of you and two friends (one is black, cause there's always a black guy [no offense]).  The gameplay consists of running between cover to cover, shooting americans (I'll get to that) and dying quite alot. The thing is it gets really dull quite fast. Your drones squad mates shoot almost everything for you, can heal each other, can throw infinite stun grenades when the game feels like you don't know how to defend yourself, snipe distant enemies and all that with the click of a button. It's the usual problem where the game treats you like a child. Another aspect is sand, which is laid in strategic locations for you to shoot at and then it drops on enemies and enemies die. Whoo hoo. Some aspects are quite nice but at the same time make you over-powered, like when you can crouch when you controlling a stationary machine gun, to make you an offensive beast while still hard to get attacked (yeah you lose some accuricy big deal). The weapon variety isn't that great, one or two weapons for each kind (shotgun, pistol, assult rifle) and that's it. Ammo is quite scarce in the start of the game so you'll pretty much have to rely on the enemy's flavor of the day. HOWEVER, the AI is really really good, even at medium difficulty it will try to flank you, use grenades to smoke you out of cover and will activly seek for you. The cover system and the 'last seen system' is very simillar to Splinter Cell: Conviction, which i really liked, so that's good. I'm disappointed there is almost no sneak option whats so ever, even though there are silencers for quite alot of weapons, feels like a missed oppertunity.  The graphics are pretty good, to be honest. I liked the little detail where if you step on sands in leaves trails of steps. The scenery is beautiful, everything makes you feed like you're really in the deserted (hu hu pun intended) city of Dubai, and that's a big plus.  Story (Spoilers):   The game's story is based on you have to report back to HQ what happened to a whole US division, called 'The dammed 33rd' led by a crazy general called konrad. For the two first missions you kill arabs cause, they are arabs and this is a modern shooting game, and for the rest of the game you kill americans, because in the third quest you get shot by some of them. Now the game starts and try make you feel bad for it because you shoot your fellow americans but    I feel like they deserve it after all of those arab/russian killing games out there.    We are told by the game to shoot them, and there is no other option but shoot them, and the game doesn't do a good job of making me feel bad for it.    They try to kill us so we have to try and kill them cause self defense right? (Sounds familiar America?)  There was also the REALLY annoying mechanic of badly written choices and the inconsistent tone the characters were having. For example there's a part where you have to make a decision whether to save a CIA agent in order for him to help you in the mission, but in the process risk civillian lives. One of your mates tell you to save the guy, and the other tell you to let him die in order for the civillians to live. Then in like 3 scenes after, you have to (HAVE TO) drop white phospherous bombs onto a main camp of american troops. Although you don't have a choice in this one, the squad mate who wanted to save the agent now isn't willing to help you with the operation of the mortar because it will kill tons of people, and the one who wanted you to save the civillians now just goes 'meh what the hell lets burn them all' and I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off bad. Then the game makes a HUGE scene of you and your squad walking in the burning camp, trying to make you feel bad for what you've done, but i just couldn't sympathise because the game didn't let me NOT to use the mortar, and I'm being punished for something I had no real responsibility over. Also, the entire game the game tries to make you feel bad for killing americans, and the it puts you on a helicopter with a mini-gun, flies you around a building full of amecian troops who can't really do anything bad to you, and tells you to mindlessly gun the place down. Almost every choice has no real effect on the story besides what achievement you get, because the story writes itself down in such a way it will always be the same outcome. In the CIA agent example, even if you choose to save him (and by the way no civllian dies because for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason they aren't shown) he dies from the wounds of the following firefight, so it doesn't matter one bit what you choose. The end is playing the psycological mind-♥♥♥♥ route, saying that the general was dead for weeks and you're just crazy who imagined it all, and shows like how everything was really like (you were talking to yourself, things that you saw were alive were actually dead ETC.) For me it was the dumbest part of the game, because     The game fails to explain many holes after this, making it very dull and shallow.    It opens the possibility that all the americans were actually arabs or something, because you're crazy and you imagined it all.    The player is expected to believe that his two squad mates silently followed him as he talked to the air and shot dead bodies.    The ending scene is decided by one click of the mouse. Then some 'deep and sad' things are narrated in you character's voice, depending on you mouse click, the content varies a bit, and it's game over.       I bought the game really late, so the multiplayer is dead, so i can't tell you anthing about it. Also it's dead so I don't need to.  The campaing has a decent lengh i guess, so i wouldn't worry about that.  In the end I think it's a nice piece of change compared to COD/BF usual output, and it's quite good if you don't think on it too much, but i guess it's not for me and it's certinaly not as good as everybody's claiming it is.",

More than often your character stands in your own way of view resulting in you getting shot from an enemy that would be clearly visible in 1st person. - Usability is a mess. Sometimes there are cutscenes which you can't skip. The savepoint is right before that cutscene. So, if you die at higher difficulty levels (i.E. 'FUBAR') it'll get played over and over and over and over and over again. Yeah, I got it, they're rounding up civilians. Again, and again, and again. - The AI is very bad.
