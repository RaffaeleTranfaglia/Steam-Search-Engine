If that were fixed then i'd say it would be a neat little experience, but without teleportation or the ability to recenter your room so that you can have the center of your room in the center of the virtual area it's just not playable unless you have an enormous warehouse of a room to play in.   Currently I give it 2 bad memes out of 10, I wouldn't vote for it in the 2016 election if you paid me :^(",
