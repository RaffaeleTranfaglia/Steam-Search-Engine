            "review_text": "Have you ever dreamed of being a doctor, but were turned off when it involved more cellular biology than throwing flasks of questionable liquids at your patients? Have you ever looked in your mirror and thought, 'Wow, I'm hot stuff,' and wanted to date an exact replica of yourself? Do you frequently like to flaunt that you are a 'Princess' on your attire? Then Princess Remedy: In a Heap of Trouble may be for you!  Princess Remedy: In a Heap of Trouble features  YOU!   The Princess of Saturn.  Everyone in Heal Land gets sick and they need you, a student of the healing arts, to come treat them. Yet school has not only taught you how to heal, but also how to love, and the game features a dating mechanic wherein you can not only mend bodies, but also break hearts. You see, each individual you date gives you a special power, and you can date or dump anybody to give you certain advantages in battle. But, “Wait!” You say, “Isn’t this taking advantage of other people?” Who cares, you're the Princess of Saturn! You're the hottest stuff in the land!  But not only are you charming, but so is the game! It features 8 beautiful bits of glory, complete with mock-NES music. The characters are diverse, and each has unique flavor text whenever you want to use them throughout the game. Furthermore, there are a number of Easter Eggs (during Christmas, no less!), such as the reappearance of a jealous chest and a super-secret mode that you'll have to google to find out. But anyway, I don't want to beat a dead horse because then you'd just have to heal it (and date it too). But this game is a great way to spend an afternoon, and worth every single one of the three dollars which you will spend on it.   Download today!  ",

It's just as much fun and has the same charm and humor, even with the added power up system. Anyone who is a fan of the ZX Spectrum will absolutely love this game. It doesn't just take graphics but has the same spirit and that is exactly how a retro themed game should feel. Music, pace, gameplay, and difficulty is all a solid 10/10.",

Combination of RPG and bullet hell shooter, just-right difficulty, an absurd sense of humor, and way way oldschool graphics and sound. Definitely worth the money although I am slightly partial to the original.   Negatives: None really, except that it's not that much different.",

A lot of characters and charm to the game, interesting visual style too. But you will experience most of what the game has to offer in that one hour, the replayability comes from wanting to challenge yourself and play at higher difficulties.  There is a bonus mode (known as REALLYDAD) that you can learn how to access after beating the game. I found it pretty much unplayable and frustrating.",
