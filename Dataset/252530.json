            "review_text": "Okay, this game is poorly optimized, the graphics aren't great, the textures are bad, but that's not what OMSI 2 is about. This simulator is for people who don't need high frames (you won't get above 60 fps regardless of your specs) or photorealistic graphics, this is for simulator people.   The base game comes with two maps, one large reconstruction of 1980's Berlin and a smaller, fictional, training map. It includes four different busses, one bendy-bus, one single-decker, and two double-deckers. This isn't a lot of content for upwards of £20, but there is a strong modding community which can add a whole new feel and look to the game, so dont worry about this when you first play.   For people who like to pick up a game and play it without much of a learning curve, OMSI 2 is not for you. I personally spent at least an hour, configuring settings for my Logitech G25 Racing Wheel, and learning all the different buttons on the bus dashboard. Once you know what to do, this game is alot of fun, but until then, I found it quite frustrating. Look at the forums for Input Configuration for different racing wheels and controllers, someone has already configured them and you can just paste those into the directory.   Performance, don't expect much. This is one of the cons of this game, it is very badly optimised. I reach anywhere from 20-60 frames, and experience frequent micro-stutters during gameplay, however I purchased this game knowing this would be the case.  Actually driving the bus feels fantastic, the physics (force feedback adds lots of realism) and feel of the busses is very well executed. I've never driven a real bus, but I think this could be considered close. The sound engine for this game is phenominal, and is really engaging. This is one of the most polished features.   For those who really want to drive a realistic feeling bus, while configuring routes and lines on the IBIS stystem, worrying about temperatures, and sticking to a strict schedule, buy this game. The price is quite high, but if you're one of those people, you will definitely get your money's worth.  If you've played ETS 2, or City Bus Driving, and think 'hey I like simulators', be warned, this game is much more complex. You may still enjoy it, however if you're expecting an easy time I wouldn't recommend it.   In Conclusion:  Pros:  &gt; Realistic Physics  &gt; Realistic Sounds &gt; Plenty of mods &gt; Feels like you're driving a bus &gt; Excellent replayability (different lines/routes and maps)  Cons:  &gt; Poor Optimisation &gt; Poor Graphics &gt; Rather Expensive &gt; Complex to configure and learn",

            "review_text": "There’s something oddly wonderful about a game trying to recreate niche, and bizarre parts of history. None more than OMSI, a game which sets out to lovingly recreate buses/routes in Berlin. Not just Berlin, but more specifically the Spandau district from 1980’s – 1990’s, a very peculiar, and to most of us obscure part of history. But does it succeed? Let’s make one thing clear, this is not ETS2. It’s not lavished with game style game play mechanics about levelling up your character, running your company, and customizing your vehicles. Nor is it all that user friendly, or really all that approachable. This is a hardcore simulation, with hardcore simulation style lack of game play. The premise is as simple as coul be, choose a bus. Choose a route. Drive..  Gameplay The buses are very nicely recreated, with a full array of working features on the dashboard, from the usual wipers, lights, adjustable suspension (on the more modern buses) and fully functioning computers, and ticket machines. Although unless you speak German, good luck getting your head around those. Thankfully, you can set your bus up using the rather basic, but functional in game UI.  The game does have a rather steep learning curve, while it does have tutorials these are next to useless, so your pretty much on your own. Getting in to a position where you can pick up your first passengers, is rather more than just selecting a job, and pressing E to start your engine, and putting the bus in to gear and driving. Every button on the dashboard does something some of these things are more useful than others.   If your patience lasts long enough to get your head around the rather steep learning curve, you’ll quickly find the game is actually quite enjoyable in a mundane, driving a city bus kind of way. Driving your assigned route, you’ll of course be stopping at bus stops, picking up rather badly animated but very amusing robotic passengers, selling them tickets, and all the usual things expected from a bus driver. The simulation of this goes quite deep, even down to them complaining, if the bus is cold.  The actual driving of the bus feels very nice, and really the developers have managed to create the feeling of driving a very large, cumbersome heavy vehicle, turns will be taken slowly, and much care has to be taken when weaving in and out of parked cars, and other obstacles scattered around the lovingly created depiction of Berlin. Upon hitting something, the passengers, which by now you have become belligerent towards, will swear, and shout at you in German demanding to get off.  Sound: The sound is absolutely spectacular, and a real master class in how the sound should be in these types of games, it’s incredibly atmospheric, and really transported me back to the 80s/90s as a kid travelling to school on those old double decker buses. From the whine of knackered old diesel engine, to the wind blowing in to the slightly open window, the bus rattling and banging as it chugs down the road. Its absolutely superb, and other developers of simulators should certainly take note.  Physics: As said already, the basic driving physics are excellent, however the other world physics, are more hilarious than anything else. With vehicles catapulting about in an accident, or humping the ground, people being swallowed by the floor. It all makes for some highly amusing, if immersion breaking moments.  Control devices: It’s a given that a game like this is best played with a wheel, rather than state the obvious, I think its best to discuss other control devices, not everyone owns a wheel.   Controller: The mainstay of driving games, for those without a wheel at least. Unfortunately, using a controller is next to impossible. The over sensitivity of the Xbox 360 controller is not accounted for at all, no dead zones are added or able to be added. The stick simply functions as a wheel, which makes controlling the bus immensely sensitive, and next to impossible. Don’t even bother.  Keyboard: While the keyboard is completely indispensable, with the massive array of functions, and systems, all of which you will need to control, driving with it is, really as to be expected. The game uses the numpad by default. 4 Turns left, 6 turns right, and 5 centres the steering. While its more than possible to drive using the keyboard, keyboards don’t feature any analogue devices, everything of course is either on or off, which can make for some pretty heavy accelerating and braking, which is usually met by lots of angry German swearing from the passengers.  Mouse: This is my preferred method for controlling the game. Generally I hate mouse driving, its over sensitive, has very little feedback, or makes very little sense. But the developers of Omsi have definitely cracked it. Move the mouse up to accelerate, down to brake, and of course left and right steer. If you don’t have a wheel this is my recommended method of controlling it. The only drawback, is steering, and accelerating at the same time can be rather difficult, and tends to be a little haphazard.  The bad: While I would like to say “The game is a triumph buy it immediately!”. That really isn’t the case. OMSI 2 is as awful as it is brilliant, an incredibly mixed bag. As already said, its not very approachable, a lot of the options, the controls list, and other things are not put together in a very user friendly or coherent way, at times it feels like it was designed by a madman! Even when trying to work out /change the controls The list seems to almost be randomly thrown together, without much regard for the poor player who has to find his/her way through it. In a game like this, which has an awful lot of controls, this really does make for frustration, and swearing.  In general the game is incredibly unpolished, mostly using simple OS ui windows to control various functions. More often than not, these windows can make little to no sense at first glance, and can take a quite some time to get used to.   Stability: The games stability is atrocious, and really, unacceptable. The game quits to desktop on a regular basis, randomly fails to load, and throws up a lot of errors usually in German, leaving you with little idea as to what actually happened. Sounds will just stop working, and all manner strange things will happen. For a game that’s been out a year (longer if you count the original) these really are issues that should no longer be present.  Navigation: This is done by a simple overlay with arrows pointing you in the direction and icons over the stops you need to stop at. While this sounds just basic but functional, at times, it can be incredibly confusing. You’ll get arrows pointing you off towards other routes, which have nothing to do with yours, at times it offers you absolutely no direction at all, and other times it just sends you off down side streets your not supposed to go down, or tries to send you down 1 way roads (of course the wrong way)   Content: The base lacks a serious amount of content The map really isn’t that big, and you have a very small number of routes to drive. Simply put, I doubt it will have much lasting appeal.  Final thoughts:  This game is actually quite annoying. It’s very solid, and very well made in parts but has far too many glaring issues. While I did enjoy it, It’s certainly not something I can whole heartedly recommend. I actually find it quite annoying, the potential is vast. Should it be given ETS 2’s spit, polish, and level of content, I can’t help but feel it would actually be a superior game, capable of knocking ETS 2 off my favourite simulator spot. But in its current state, its incredibly rough around the edges, and falls very short. If you enjoy simulators, and are looking for something new, you might like this one. But don’t go in to it expecting a complete or approachable, product, it isn’t.",

That said, there is -NO- simulator as realistic and with the huge sortiment of maps and vehicles OMSI has. They have been quite slow in getting OMSI 2 stable and its engine is sort of outdated, but with a modern PC you can get a serious amount of fun even out of huge maps. Plus: the community has always been developing things for the community, that is: out of my 5-6 current standard maps only one is payware, and that one - Rheinhausen - is worth every bit. So don't mind the payware when testing, and if you like OMSI, it's a month's pocket money of a schoolboy compared to other DLC games like Train Simulator to get everything there is.  If you like versatility in maps / bus repaints / buses, and if you like a real simulator, there's no way around OMSI 2. I wish Aerosoft were quicker in fixing bugs and they'd even develop OMSI 3 somewhere with a better vehicle AI and a better engine (you do smell the dust on it in the background). But it runs, and it's the only one that runs THAT content.",

Whilst I do get frustrated by its (frankly) many bugs, I constantly find myself picking up my steering wheel (highly recommended) and doing a route or two.  Whilst the graphics don't look very pleasing, the buses themselves are VERY well modelled, as well as their audio. As Nerd³ said, it's got quite possibly the best sound I've ever heard in a game.   I've said enough, so here's some pros/cons:  Pros: * Great simulation * Bloody amazing audio * Well modelled buses * Rather moddable  Cons: * Crashes a lot * AI leaves a lot to be desired. Pulling to the right, indicating to the right, then turning left, cutting me up and crashing into the side of my bus? Thanks mate. * Graphics engine leaves a lot to be desired. * Performance is mediocre at best.",

Let me break it down for you, the gameplay is amazing, it is very realistic driving (even with the mouse and keyboard), but it had some issues too. The game is not really optimised, so you will not be having the highest frame rates, but since not much is going on, it is not much of a problem. Additionaly, alot of things (errors messages, some tutorials, and other things as of this time) are in German, so you might have some issues there, though it is constantly getting better in English so I do not see this as a problem. My last complaint is that the menus are not very good, and it is confusing to learn how to get around them. Now on to the good stuff. The driving is excelent, and it is just a very good game if you are willing to put in the time to learn how to use it properly. I would definatly recommend this to anyone who likes simulators, and has the money (as it is $35). I would not recommend this game to anyone who already have OMSI 1 (as there are not many changes), or who is not that into this type of simulator, there are many others out there to make sure you like it first.

I've seen a crash in editor - 'program OMSI2.exe has stopped working' out of nowhere. The bad thing is, MOST of errors are written in German language.  I shouldn't just hate this game.So,there are many good things i like. For example,better optimization. The game uses 2 cores of CPU (which is not the best, but for single-player only game it´s good). And the articulated bus.The joint of the bus is very realistic and works almost like in real life. And the main point of simulations - mods. Since OMSI 1, the game is very highly moddable and comes with its own map editor and downloadable development kit. You can make your own busses from your city, make your own city or make fictional city. Or - just download them, choose a map, spawn a bus and go. Default busses works as in real life, most of controls works as they works on real busses. Sounds have very high quality.  Pros: -High quality of default busses and maps -Supports many kinds of mods -Upgraded performance in comparsion with OMSI 1 -Compatibility with lots of mods from OMSI 1 -AI cars has their own engine sound And more that i can´t remember....

I have 980TI G/C i7Skylake CPU 16GB Ripjaw RAM and can not run the game I have tried some off the solutions but none work for me. I have just been trying to play the game for the last hour and nothing,tried the Hamburg map and ended floating in a blue square.I can program the ibis select a route but not able to drive it,going to delete the game and not come back to it If i could play it i would have given a good score but i can not.Maybe its my PC it does not suit the game.I have a Predator 32 inch with high res and the Witcher 3 looks and plays amazingly well as does Skyrim.Be WARNED YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS trying to play this game if you do buy it hope you have more fun than me,and may the Gaming force be with you .Hope Fernbus sim comes out befor Decenber then the OMSI devs may have to do something to give us all a stable game we paid for, to me its been a waste off time and money.",

And it dosnt help that the tutor is porly translated from English and makes little sense in the first place. Along with the tutoral not being in propor english the bus hasnt been translated at all meaning you will be forced to issue tickets in German without the use of subtitles. And to go along with this rubish the base game inculeds only 2 maps - one of these is tiny and only purpose seems to be for the tutoral.",
