            "review_text": "I've had this game for years, with a ton of community mods tracks and cars. This is one of the best ever, it's a race sim not a arcade racer.  The good: Stacks of community based addons Fully customizable race options Build your own seasons with the right third party tools or a text editor 24 hour real time clock with time compression multipliers. Start racing at night and finish in the afternoon Variable levels of difficulty with driving aids, AI settings and damage mulitpliers Great mulitplayer platform (i've only tried LAN with adding AI AI cars are not great but not the worst, the cars aren't affected by damage and tyre wear the same way as a human driver.  The not so good: A bit dated, I can run the graphics at full with 40 AI cars and seems to run fine No Rain and or other weather effects. Not a biggy There's better racing software out there, particularly for multi-player. If you want multiplayer go Iracing it's pricey but constantly being developed and generally not a wreck fest. Season and career play seems a little un-developed  In all a classic, I spent most of my sim-driving time on Iracing but come back to this one just love the rally cross tracks available and some old classic tracks not avialable anywhere else  ",

You should be rather interested in tinkering, testing and setting up things as well. This may be too much for the casual drivers to ask.  People with interest in highly realistic racing simulators should be at home here. If you like modding then this is definitely the one for you. ",

You can personalize basically the whole game, since it's a really well constructed sim, but thanks to the wide range of settings and options most of the mods can be played from keyboard while it's still delivering it's fun factor. If you like car racing even if you are a pro, or just a casual gamer, it's definitely worth a try, highly recommended game!",

            "review_text": "An alright game for what it is, but not for its price. Game is almost 12 years old and the pricetag is too high for a game of that age. Force-feedback is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to set up properly if you play with a wheel. The upsides are the amount of mods on the game, I have about 500 car mods installed worth 50gb and a lot of tracks. Online community is still alive and most of what I've seen are drifting lobbies. Modern simulators, like Assetto Corsa, completely destroy this game in almost every aspect so you're better off buying a newer game if you recently bought a wheel(like I did) and looking for a cheap game to try it out.",

This is really only fun if you already know the game. They say mods are availible, however I cant seem to find any or the ones i do find i have no clue what they do. This isnt really a game, so much so that its a project. Wish i would have know that before buying it.   TLDR: No fun, too much work to make it a game.",
