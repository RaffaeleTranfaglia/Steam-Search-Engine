            "review_text": "I was a big fan of the original Avalanche flash game many many years ago, but as time went on and flash games went out of style, I forgot about the game entirely. Then when browsing steam, I all of a sudden came across its sequel, not knowing anything about it, and decided to try it on a whim.  This game is the definition of a perfect sequel. The core gameplay from the original game which made it fun is still the focal point, just improved, and every gripe I had with the first game has been fixed. The gameplay, which consists of going as high as possible, is addictive with missions and items keeping it fresh and interesting, even after the amount of time I've already spent on the game. You can tell there was a large focus on making the gameplay feel smooth. The controls feel very similar to the way super meatboy feels, which is to say good. The graphics and music compliment the game quite well, both being very well made and a pleasure to see/hear, and overall the presentation is great, with intuitive menus and nothing to bog you down between games.   Some people may argue on the price point, which is a fair point to argue given the amount of breathtaking games on steam available for the same price, but as the guy's first game on steam I could see where he is coming from. I really enjoy it, so if you don't mind the price, or the game is on sale, I'd definitely recommend trying it out.",

The gameplay works well and the controls are precisely working with a keyboard. But the game doesn't have a lot to offer in my opinion. Would give it a thumbs down, but it is not a bad game at all.",

The music has a fun vibe to it, and the art fantstically done in a 16-bit style. Controls are very well done allowing you to perform precise moves. The only downside I've had so far is I'm getting low framerates compared to other similar games in my library. Otherwise it is an excellent game I plan on spending more time with!",

Its cute, friendly, addictive and has a skill ceiling that keeps you competing.  Its a good game but I'm going to respond to some of the negatives people are posting.  Lag: Havn't had any Controls: Your going to want controllers but its Left right up down, jump and special. Difficulty: Its challenging to get good at it. Expensive unlocks: once you get to grips with it you can earn in game coins rather quickly. Chests and loot: Again, there is a skill curve.",

            "review_text": "I'm a bit hesitant to thumbs this up. Yes, it's fun, addicting and keeps you coming back for more. If you've watched 10 seconds of footage of this game, you'll know what the game is about: jumping on top of falling blocks while avoiding enemies and a rising floor of lava.  This may sound tough, and it certainly is: while controls are decent, you're never really safe from being crushed. And with the blocks falling pretty randomly, some runs will be harder than others. The coins, treasures, power-ups, shops and banks really spice up the game. On the aesthetics, all is great as well: cute 16-bit era graphics and a great soundtrack.  The main disadvantage is the fact that this is a roguelike (or roguelite, if you will). You've only got one life and the coins you collect by climbing, achievements and banking serve to buy other items that will make future runs more doable. However, since a block can crush and instantly kill you roughly every moment, the boss battles are in a way the easier part of the game. And okay, the game is never boring and plays fast enough to have that 'one more run!!!' feel, but in the end this game really only has one level. A good one, certainly...but I'm not sure how much I'd pay for it if I didn't got it in a humble bundle.",
