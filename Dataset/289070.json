            "review_text": "This is the first Steam review I have ever written. I am prompted to write this based on how disappointed I am in this game. I have owned every single version of Civilization since Civ 1, including Alpha Centauri, and this is the first version I would not recommend.  Here are my opinions of the “Good”, the “Marginally Bad”, and the “Really Bad”.   GOOD:  Temporary Builders: I did not like this at first, but have come around to appreciating the design choice to have builders expire after 3 uses. It keeps the unit clutter down, and forces the player to make productions choices all throughout the game.  Military Unit Scaling: This seems improved. There are no longer such big jumps in unit power that used to occur at particular times in the tech tree. Unit’s gradually improve as you tech-up in a more sensible way.  Barbarians: The game designers clearly put a lot of work into this, and it shows. Barbarians are challenging and fun. It adds a real threat to the early-game.  City State and Envoys: I like the envoy mechanism of influencing city-states. It seems more realistic and natural than the Civ-5 system.  Civ Selection: I do like the new civ and leader selections.   MARGINALLY BAD (or Needs Improvement):  Districts: I like the design concept of districts… the need to plan ahead for city development. It’s a nice design feature, but I feel that there could be some improvement in how it’s implemented. First, there needs to be more non-district building options. Historically, cities do specialize, but not to the extent pushed in this game. There needs to be more basic city improvements that are not tied to districts. Also, some districts are poorly thought out… the Entertainment Complex comes to mind. Every city needs amenities to be healthy, so forcing the player to use up a district for these improvements runs counter to the city-specializing concept.  Roads: If Builders expire after 3 uses, then there are problems with using them to build roads… you would have to make tons of them to get anywhere. However, auto constructing roads along trade routes is not a sensible fix to that problem. Instead, they should have added a road-builder unit that also expires… after maybe 6 uses or so. As it stands, you end up choosing trade-routes in the early game more for building roads where you need them, rather than for the trade you receive. This is counter to the idea of trade-routes. Apparently, the designers didn’t understand how advanced players use roads as both a military tool and exploration tool. And historically, roads were built for these reasons just as much as for trade.  Graphical Design: I don’t hate the cartoony graphics, but I don’t really like them either. Also, although it does make for a clearly defined map, the additional graphical touches tend to clutter up the map more than in previous games. Also, for some resources, it’s not as easy to see at a glance the difference between improved and not improved as it used to be in Civ-5. I much prefer the Civ-5 graphical aesthetic.  Culture: I see what they were attempting with the separate culture tree… they clearly desired to allow more customization of your Civ. In practice though, culture doesn’t really end up feeling like culture anymore, and just feels like an alternate tech-tree (and that’s exactly what it is). This approach is more flexible, but something has been lost in the translation. Also, I do like the ability to adjust your cultural benefits on the fly, but it seems too easy and fast. There should be more consequence to doing so than just gold-cost. I miss the days when changing government type was a big-deal, and required careful planning.   REALLY BAD:  Diplomacy: This is so bad it gets it’s own subsections…   Denouncing: OMG this is bad. The AI civs will start denouncing you early and often for trivial things, and they never stop. I have been denounced for having a different government than an AI civ, for building more wonders than them (is that bad?), for keeping a city that I conquered about 1000 years in the past, etc. I am forced to wonder if the designers have actually played this game at all. It’s ridiculous.   Trade deals: The AI civs will propose the most insane trade deals. They always expect you to lose out on every trade deal at a rate of about 2 to 1… they expect you to trade 2 resources for their 1. They never offer better deals, no matter what your relationship. It makes the trade-deal feature a complete waste of time. I hit the escape key the second it pops up without even looking at it anymore.   Comments: The AI civs will continually interrupt the game to make senseless comments on everything you do. You get spammed with the diplomacy window almost every turn… and not for anything you have to make a decision about… just random comments. Again, I have to wonder if the designers ever actually played this game.   AI (or lack of AI): This is the big one… this is so incredibly bad. I have played well into the Atomic age on King level. All the AI civs were still running around with primitive units while I was driving along their shores with Battleships and building planes. And, I wasn’t even really trying to tech up fast… I was more into exploring the game’s features. This never happened in Civ-5 at the higher levels. Also, unlike previous Civ games, the AI doesn’t know how to build a Civilization. Again, in the Atomic age, there were still many primitive Wonders that were unbuilt and available… like the Colossus and Coliseum… that’s ridiculous. They should just rename it from “Artificial Intelligence” to “Artificial Idiot”.  Warmongering Penalty: I had hoped this would get fixed from Civ-5. If someone declares war on you, and you kick their butts and take their cities, you are not a war monger… you’re just effective. However, this game will punish you for that. What are we supposed to do, allow other civs to declare war, and then once they start losing let them off the hook just to have them do it again 10 years later? The game should keep track of who started hostilities, and adjust accordingly.   SUMMARY:  Although there have been some improvements in the basic game design from Civ-5 to Civ-6, there are enough misses to make this game a “Do Not Recommend”. The AI is so bad that it makes the game completely unenjoyable. And the Diplomacy is so annoying that even if you like beating up on the “Artificial Idiot”, you will be irritated to the point of just shutting it down. The big design changes… Districts and Culture and interesting but can use some more tweaking… especially Culture.  Maybe after an expansion or two that fixes things, this game might be worth it, but as it stands, it’s not. Currently (and yes even at its’ launch) Civ-5 is a much better game.           ",

            "review_text": "First impression: Christopher Tin delivers again. The menu theme may not be Baba Yetu, but it's pretty damn close. Seems I will now have two games where everytime I start them, I have to hang out in the main menu for a few minutes: Civ IV and Civ VI  + Runs flawlessly. Literally haven't encountered any technical issues so far. Loading and such seems smoother than Civ V. + More Micro-managing (probably a minus for some people) + How disctrics and builders work are a nice addition. Even if they don't actually change much from how workers functioned in previous installments, it makes the game fresh. + I like how policies work  +/- I'm not a fan of the 'cartoon' look of the units. However cities, buildings and the fog of war are spectacular +/- Features. I'm liking ALL the new features that they've added. The ones they've changed, I like too. However, the ones that are missing, I'm missing. Overall this might be a plus though, might move it later  - Some bugs, nothing game breaking so far though - Diplomacy seems... sketchy. As in, needs fixing much like Civ V did with expansions (iirc). I like how the different Civs seem to have more personality though Update: Diplomacy seems to have the same problem that it had at the start of Civ V (vanilla), it feels random. Don't know if I've just been unlucky and triggered several opposing Civ hidden agendas or if this is indeed the case. UPDATE: After som experimenting, seems like the AI likes to declare war against you if they think they can beat you. So if your army is small - war. Of course, to some extent this has ALWAYS happened in Civ, but it happens constantly in this game if you play a certain 'style'. I guess that makes for more 'realistic' AI, as that is how multiplayer matches often play out. But for people like me, who always prefered playing for culture victories, this is a big minus. Not enough for me to give the game a 'not recommended', but enough for me to say 'untill they fix this, I'd recommend Civ V + DLCs more'. And I'd like to add that trying to spice up the diplomacy formula is a good idea, but it needs tweaking.  I'm really liking it so far. It is in not perfect, but it freshens up the Civ formula with some of the new additions and I really like how they didn't take the easy and safe way out with the changes. I remember reading how some things would be 'simplified' and 'streamlined', which usually translates to 'we made stuff easier for casuals who can't bother with complex games'. But of all the things I've encountered so far that they've streamlined or simplified, it's all been legit. Nothing that takes away complexity, only things that make for a smoother experience.  The issues that I've found so far in the game (Diplomacy and bugs) are hopefully things they'll fix with patches and expansions, just like they did with Civ V. Seems like Civ VI has a bright future ahead of it.  Will update review accordingly",

            "review_text": "48 hours and I'm tired of it, even though I've clocked hundreds upon hundreds of hours in Civ 3-5. That is bad for a Civ game.   It simply seems to have little in the way of new discoveries and the system of districts has the nasty side effect that you more often busy yourself with the internal affairs of your empire instead of exploring the world - which gets tedious and uninspiring after you've done it for a few games. Game mechanics like diplomacy, religion and spying feel chorelike. With the lack of map generation options, the crazy AI, the lacklustre rewards for expansion and exploration, the reduced need to find specific strategic resources, it all ends up being pretty samey. I can't put my finger on it but it also feels like the different civs are less unique now.  You'd think that focusing on internal affairs would be fun, especially for someone like me who really loves playing the turtle, but you will rarely find a game where an AI will not force you to war, either by settling ridiculously close to you or suicide attacking you. Want to focus a match on culture and science? Forget it, war it is. Want to be a reclusive island civ that colonizes the new world? Forget it, an AI will always spawn at a set distance from you. Want to be a glorious diplomat? Nope, the AI will hate you relentlessly. There also doesn't seem to be much of a way to get ahead without fighting - which gets boring if you've already played countless wars in Civ5.  I understand that they've tried to streamline the gameplay a bit, by reducing the different types of units you get through the ages, balancing starting map points more etc. but there's not escaping that this also makes every game more repetative. I prefer my Civ matches to be more assymetrical as it keeps the matches interesting and really increases the replay value. The lack of global happiness (Which was a stupid system in itself) and the addition of the generic entertainment complex now makes luxury resources seem to have much less of an impact on the gameplay - and the spawn rate of resources is less chaotic, which makes for finding especially interesting spots on the map for settling (and fighting over) incredibly rare.  There are many good sides to the game as well - but you can find those in the positive reviews. My hopes are that they'll turn this game around with a few wonderful expansions and patches. Until then, look for a sale to pick this one up. There still potential to turns this into a great game and I'll change my review if they do so.",

Constant wars, suicidal AI, wars where the AI can't reach or has no intention of fighting. Wars that the AI agrees to attack you with another AI depsite having good relations with you. The AI flip flopping with regards to agendas.   The flaws are so obvious yet play testing picked up nothing.  EDIT: For those commenting, I've been playing on King difficulty. The AI isn't a challenge per se, I am ususually in top 2 or 3 score wise in a large game by late classical/early medieval, It just completely makes no sense.",

            "review_text": "9/10  After 20 hours of play I can easily say this is the best Civ ON RELEASE.  Easily a 9/10, there is a lot more strategic depth and player options than there were in vanilla Civ 5.  Is Civ 6 perfect? No, there are definitely a few tweaks needed, especially to the AI which does some silly things and gets annoying bonuses (King+ difficulty) which I am really not a fan of. There are few strange UI design choices (overall pretty good though, mostly clear and consice). And diplomacy victory which is something I quite enjoyed has been removed. :/   Saying that, for every small problem I have there are 3 or 4 great changes (great people system, government types and policies, tweaks to combat and movement, housing and amenities in individual cities .etc.etc.). I LOVE the changes to districts and wonders, it makes terrain and planning extremely important. There's a lot of changes which can't be summed up in this small review however.  Unlike CIv 5 and Civ 4 I dont think 2 major expansions are needed before a buy, this is already a great game worth your money and after after some patching and tweaks to the AI and UI (and hopefully an awesome expansion to add diplomactic victory back!) this will easily be the best Civ to date.",

            "review_text": "I have clocked around 30 hours so far and I really wanted to like the game but to be honest I am struggling a little. It's such a shame because I am a huge fan of the series but I have to say this one is a backwards step from 4 and 5.  First of all I shall go over the pros (in my opinion):  1. Love the builders; they are an improvement on workers who just became annoying after a while on Civ 4 and 5.  2. Love the trading! It has more depth to it than 5, which was a bit easy, and I like that they build automatic roads. A good improvement.  3. One of the best improvements for me is the city state interaction. Sending envoys is an interesting and easy way to ally with city states, a big improvement on 5, which, unless you were Greece was pretty hard to maintain relationships with city states.   4. I really like the districts and how they work, it makes for a more deep and meaningful game, where city planning is of the utmost importance. Fantastic addition to the game.   5. The civics are also a good improvement in my opinion. Having such a diverse government system means there are hundreds of different ways to play the game and now you can really tailor a government to suit the needs of your empire.   6. Barbarians are now much more of a challenge and so have more meaning within the game.  7. Absolutely love the fact you can create your own religion!   That's about it for the pros. There is very little change in the battle systems and how scouting works, which is good because they were fine anyway. Right, now onto the cons, and although there are only two big cons they basically make the game much worse than 4 and 5.  1. Map sizes have deteriorated badly! If you do a huge map with 12 civs then you will be on top of each other from the start. I have tested this time and again and I am usually 4-5 squares away from at least two other civs. There is no room for expansion and so wars are rife. It is impossible to play this type of game unless you plan on conquering the civs closest to you, which could easily back fire and means sacrificing religion, science and culture just so you have an army big enough to do the job. The civs will always put a city next to your capital before you have a chance to. Basically if you try and get a settler you'll sacrifice an army and the civ next to you will invade. Gandhi, Roosevelt, doesn't matter. They WILL invade and if you have a small army then you'll be wiped. Therefore the game is pointless being played on a huge map with 12 players, in fact, after much testing and comparing with 5 I believe that the huge map on 6 is roughly that of a medium on 5. If you want to play a similar experience to 5 (e.g. having space to grow your empire) then I'd suggest having six civilizations on a huge map. Any more and it is too congested. It's a great shame because I loved having all of the civilizations involved, not just a few of them. I can only guess that they have done this because of the new graphics engine, which does look good, but I'd have preferred 5 graphics with larger scale maps any day and I think most people would agree.   2. The civilizations are mental. By which I mean they will declare war on you for no reason whatsoever, they denounce you for being poor etc. even though you are richer than them, they will build cities next to yours even though it is hundreds of miles away from their capital. Basically the AI is massively flawed and must be tweaked. I have played three full games now and never had an ally. They always dislike me due to one of their agendas clashing with mine. It doesn't really work and just creates war.   3. You can no longer choose how many city states to start with!   4. After the renaissance era onwards the game slows down so much it becomes hard to play. I have a gaming PC with 32 GB of RAM and yet I am waiting roughly a minute between goes, sometimes longer! Again, this is down to the updated graphics.  5. Still have the same issue as on 5 with iron not spawning in the your borders. However, on 5 you could avoid wars by being clever. On this one war will arrive within the first 100 goes EVERY TIME! Therefore army is key. If you have no iron then you will struggle and in my three goes so far I have had just one iron on my continent!   It is such a shame that the game has these fatal flaws because otherwise it truly would be the best one of the series. I hope that they iron out these flaws but I am not sure whether they will be able to because increasing map sizes will just slow the game down even more. Therefore if you do get this game then take it for what it is: a war game. The flaws mean that wars happen all the time. In all my games so far there has been nonstop war from the ancient era all the way through. Most civs get wiped out by the renaissance era, normally leaving me and two-three other civs to fight it out the rest of the game. It is the same every time and it is for that reason why I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will stick with it for a while longer and see if there is improvement but I can't see me playing this as long as I did 5, and I can even see myself going back to 5 sooner rather than later.",

            "review_text": "It has been tough for me to admit to myself that Civilization 6 is, in its essentials, a fundamentally broken game. I have been playing the Civilization games since Civ II/ Alpha Centauri. I have also, in between releases, played many of the turn-based strategies that clearly owe a lot to Civilization, including the Galactic Civilizations series, Age of Wonders, Total War, etc., all since the early days (I realize that I am betraying both advanced age and a misspent life here). Civilization always felt like the original and for that reason special.  Ironically it has taken a lot of work to break this game so completely. The root of the problem lies in a slow progression of intended improvements to the game that have both totally outstripped the abilities of the AI and have erected impediments in the ability of human players to do things which used to be straightforward. Many of the core problems arise from the decision, in Civ 5, to de-stack units in an effort to make combat feel more tactical, and then impose this tactical combat framework on the strategic map. That decision created loads of obvious and basic problems that many others have already commented on in the context of reviewing Civ 5: e.g., tactical battles that stretch over hundreds of years, a confused crowding of the campaign map with units, etc. Because there was a lot to like about Civ 5, I had hoped that Civ 6 would find a way to improve some of these issues. Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten worse.  The first and most obvious problems with Civ 6 relate to the complete inability of the AI to play the game. Computer players in Civ 5 were dumb, but in Civ 6 now they are beyond dumb- they simply cannot function in a way that is rational at the most basic levels. With respect to discrete tactical battles that involve more than a couple of units, the AI is utterly helpless. It neither exploits advantages or guards against weaknesses- not even to the limited extent the AI could do these things in Civ 5. The AI is even worse when it comes to managing armies at a strategic level. The AI is utterly unable to mount an effective invasion force even between two neighboring cities on the same continent, let alone on a broader scale. Adding water tiles to the mix completely flummoxes the AI, as units without escort repeated kill themselves by hurling themselves at your naval units and well-fortified coastal cities, without support or the slightest possible chance of success. Forget the significant overseas naval invasions that the AI would sometimes surprise you with in Civ 4: that is completely beyond the capabilities of this game. I have played Civ 6 quite a bit already have yet to have an interesting tactical engagement with a computer player (fighting of hordes of uncoordinated horsemen is not interesting). On top of all that, for some reason, the AI in Civ 6 seems much worse than ever before at advancing itself technically, and seems to prefer spawning hordes of older units to mindlessly throw at you. I am not saying that I am some genius and that I am so much smarter than the AI. Rather, I am saying that a lobster is smarter than the AI. In sum, the dynamics of turn-based tactical combat on the hex-based strategic map are just too much for any AI to handle.  But the problem goes beyond just the AI and the Computer players' inability to play. In essence, I can understand why the AI has problems, because I too find it exceedingly difficult to assemble and move even a modest-sized mixed-unit force from one place to another. Because units can no longer be organized into stacks, each step in the process of mustering an army, moving it, transporting it, supporting it, and attacking with it, is a horrid logistical mess. And because of that, each step takes multiple turns, so if you try to do it in an organized way, many years will pass (hundreds of years if you are early on in the game), units will obsolete, etc., all of which is just dumb. And again, Civ 6 exacerbates rather than alleviates these problems by adding layers of additional technologies, structures, and districts needed to recruit and organize a mixed-unit army. For example, I used to enjoy putting together a solid force of land units supported by a navy, and move them over to assault coastal cities. That was fun in Civ 4, a real pain but doable in Civ 5, and torture in Civ 6. At the most basic level, Civ 5's experiment with attempting to overlay mixed-unit-tactical combat on the strategic map has failed on multiple levels, and Civ 6 has amplified that failure. The AI can't handle it, and although it can be fun in very limited circumstances, for the most part it doesn't work and is more of a pain than a benefit.  I'm not sure what to recommend. An improvement in the AI would be a big help, but given the complexity of this game, I am not sure that is possible for any AI to handle it. Another option would be to allow a partial or total stacking of units, which could not only help the AI, but solve a lot of other messes created by the hex system. Regardless, something needs to be done, as the game really does not work as it stands.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: It's so much worse than Civ V  Don't get me wrong, there are good things to this game, but it needs major patches, or an expansion, to be an experience comparable with Civ V.  Eureka moments for tech and civics are great. Districts are a great idea. Bringing back governments, and making it impossible to have cities that are all things to all people are great. However, there's big problems.  My least favorite part is the changes to religion. The idea of religious combat sounds fine and all, but in practice, it's horrific: You are in a religious war EVERY TURN OF THE GAME, healing units requires going back to a city, and you have a whole 3 kinds of units to wage this war with. This makes religion a huge attention drain that you can't ignore, because an enemy AI will be going for a religious victory. Let someone else take over your religion? Great, now they must be your primary target for military war, because otherwise, a military path might just hand the other player the game!  There's also no way to really get anywhere without a large empire: Culture? You won't be able to house enough great works to matter, as the maximum number of great works per city is tiny. To increase that, you also need religion, going back to the paragraph above.  Another mechanic that makes us need huge empires is military: An extremely large majority of units require strategic resources to be built. Nobody is ever going to trade you for them, so you must expand wildly. Lacking an iron mine in your starting area? Congratulations, you have to rush forward in tech, and hope the strategic resource is anywhere near you.  But let's not forget, that science makes things more expensive: Yes folks, moving forward in the science track makes creating districts harder, so you can end up being unable to do very much because you moved forward in science too fast. Nothing like creating a new city, and seeing that it takes 70 turns to build anything.  So my veredict is that it's way too easy to get yourself in very unfun situations for the game to be worth it today. I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually, but right now, I can't recommend the game.",

Had to hunt down barbarians for my first 50 or so turns, and someone declared war on me after the 30th turn (seriously, he only had 2 archers, why tho). As soon as you start winning the 'war' (i.e killing both of his troops) it instatly starts spamming trades in order to negotiate peace, and gives up all it's resources.   Bad interface. I was a really big fan of the Civ V interface, where everything looked more.. Clear, per se. I think the production menu looks horrible, you don't really get a sense of what anything is, unlike in Civ V, where you could actually see what you where developing. That might just be a minor issue for me though.  Last but not least, the graphics. I just can't get over that it looks like a mobile game. It just doesn't feel immersive to me. Some people like it, I hate it.   TL;DR: Bad AI, terrible user interface, graphics looks like it was developed for iPhone back in 2013. Basically Civ 5 with some new graphics and worsend AI, and a couple of new features that you might or might not be a fan of.  4/10.",

The graphics actually make the game very playable by not taking too much processing power. Sometimes 5 and even Beyond Earth became too frustrating to play those larger games with more computer/human players. The Civ team was very smart in not putting too much effort into the graphics by making sure this is playable on most hardware, even making it simple enough to easily put it on a mobile platform.  As for game mechanics, this version introduces a lot and re-introduces what we love about previous versions. New to the franchise, they brought districts to the map, limited actions for builders, policy card decks, envoys, super enhanced diplomacy, and culture 'researching.' Then they made sure to include features that I love about previous versions like religion, choosing government, rebels, trade, and natural wonders. This makes the base game already feel really complete. It's hard to imagine what they might include in the expansions, other than new civs and maps. Or maybe I'm just blindsighted at how awesome the game already is.  For long time Civilization players, this is the game we've always wanted.",

That, and the 'round vs. truncate' movement system change makes moving units seem painfully slow.  I approached the more cartoony-style of design with caution, and it feels like that just takes away from the immersion of the game that you're taking one city from scratch and turning it into the civ that conquers the world. The art of the map is a nice touch, but from a tactical standpoint it's very difficult to look at the world map and tell what's land, water, undiscovered, etc.  I so wanted this to be an improvement over Beyond Earth, but it feel like the series has only taken a baby step since then.  In the end, Civ 6 makes me want to do nothing more than play Civ 5 more. Can I aptly say that this game is worth playing or not for someone new to the series? I really don't know.",

The reason for the negative review is that you can really only build up about 4 cities before it is suddenly 1900. I understand Civ 6 wants the focus to be on specialized cities but in the real world, countries/cities did not each just focus on 1 or 2 things to accomplish by the 1900s. Everything in game should be able to match real world timelines because after all, the roots of this game was about progressing through history which early Civ games accomplished. I always feel rushed or behind. It doesn't matter whether you choose standard, epoch or marathon. All this provides is the benefit of more turns to move your explorers and soldiers around while the pace of research and constructing still falls behind unless you only focus on specific research paths or only a couple of districts. Throw into the mix that you have to waste turns to create builders more frequently along with everything else and you will feel like you are in the stoneage by the time you reach WW I era. Additonally, I have 3 other complaints. The AI is horrible. You meet another Civ, next turn they want open borders. Seriously, is that how it works in the real world? You make a trade agreement and the very next turn the civ you are trading with denounces you because you have more great people then they do. My nextl comlplaint is about the starting positions. Choose continents and you will always get slammed in between 2 other civs right next door. Choose islands and you will always start on a tiny island where you can only build 2 or 3 cities. Choose any option and you will always start in an area where if you move 8 tiles in any direction you will hit snow tiles which are totally useless. Last, when a settler is created the recommed build here option chooses ridiculous locations or if on an island there will sometimes be no recommendation at all because the entire area is crap.

[Wide vs Tall]  General Issues: Why does a game that looks worse than civ 5 take up more of the cpu? - Why can cavalry use siege equipment? -Why does the game constantly hide information from you. Example: The eureka for irrigation is to farm a resource. For a player new to civ this was one of the hardest eurekas for me to get until I looked it up on the internet. What it should be 'Farm a BONUS resource' simple easy fix. -In addition to paying 60 Euros/Dollars for this game you will also need to spend 5 more everytime they release a new leader/Civ or what Firaxes calls 'dlcs' and since it seems like each civ can have 2 leaders, thats a lot of 5$ 'dlcs'  I can go on and on but you get the point.

I really like the airstrip mechanic. (Improvment for invasion purposes or staging aircraft far from cities) - Improved unit upgrade paths - City-states are way more interesting - Solid trade, policy and religion. Feels more complete then Civ 5 did on release.  Things i'd like to be improved: - Larger maps good damn it! Bigger is better. (My first game was fractal, so it may have been more water then it usally is) - Chinese AI building great wall improvment like 5 year olds paint with their feet?!  The game isn't yet perfect and will most likely improve with expansions and DLC as all previous Civ games did. Although, in my opinion it's one of the best vanilla civ games.  EDIT: Got some more hours put into it. The mid/late game feels more refined than civ 5. Trade route now caped by districts, instead of a static global cap. War is fixed and now more fun. The corps and army mechanic is really cool. Siege is also improved by not spawning cities with huge defences. Now you have to consider if it's worth the investment.   This game also pass the very simple 'Do the publisher/developer have integrity test' by acctually implementing multiplayer LAN. Most publishers refuse to do this since this makes it easier for pirates to play with each other. Firaxis and 2K would probably gotten away with not having it, but still kept it.

Save $60 and get Civilization V during a Sale, its a much better game and has the depth for those who intellectually and competitively approach the game and want something appeasing to look at, not Civilization Revolutions and the abomination of a sequel.",

Full disclosure, my favorite Civ game was 'Civilization: call to power'  Every map feels claustrophobic, with lots of other Civs, city states , barbarians and impassable/unusable mountains. I do not understand why they insist on cluttering up the screen with crap, giving the feeling of getting on an urban bus rather than founding a new civilization. Yes, you can modify the maps in settings and have less of all this stuff but then many Civ's special abilities revolve around city states and barbarians. Do I really have to tell the game that I don't want an arcady /zerg experience when I buy a franchise KNOWN as a deep strategy game?   Districts and wonders. They all take up their very own space on the map. I don't like it.  Governments..the 'Cards' seems like an interesting mechanic, too bad all choices aren't equal.  Factions and their 'super' powers'..Some of the special units and powers are just plain dumb and often inconsequential.  Religion ...just dumb  The music sounds great, the visuals are adequete BUT the Game is terrible. Poorly thought out clunky, mechanics eclipse all the good hard work that went into making this game.",

            "review_text": "First Impressions: I was trying not to be so hyped for this game as I thought it may just be a remodel for Civilisation V... I was wrong.  Good/Better Qualities of Civilisation VI:  Districts are a new addition to the game which creates a more interesting and strategic approach to how you manage and develop your city. It feels that you can specialise each city you own to be more of a scientific or production city, for example. However, unlike Civ V you now do not stack buildings up in the city, you actually have to use a tile to create a district and from there you can build your separate buildings within the district. This also makes the game a little more difficult and you have to be careful of city placements to make sure you get the right bonuses, or have enough space for farms as well as the various districts.   All the additions from Civ V main expansions are available in the base game of Civ VI, this makes the game seem more fleshed out and enjoyable from the beginning.  New art style is quite weird to get used to, but it grows on you after a while, do not get fooled by the cartoon-ish look, the actual game, units and buildings look so much better than the previous games.  The separate research for Science and Culture adds a new layer of replayability for the game. In Civ V I noticed how if you wanted to go for a cultural victory you would still have to put some work into science as well to get the right technologies, now with Civics it makes it easier to go straight to Culture from the start.  Linking to the art style and districts, I really like how I can now see the buildings and wonders properly in and around my cities. This is only a small bit but I really enjoy watching my buildings being built in my districts and it actually feels like my civilisation is growing... I was getting rather tired of seeing my Oracle or stadiums being built in the sea...  UI is simplistic. I have seen some reviews that are complaining that they cannolt find anything in the new UI after only playing the game a few hours. Yes it's hard to find to start with because it's so different from Civ V, but after a while I got used to where all the actions were and how to access my city.   Bad/Worse Points:  AI still seems a bit stupid on lower difficulties. The first Civ VI game I played I put it on a lower difficulty just to get used to the new techs and way the happiness is now local. And my God the AI were dumb, the agendas made them all hate me as soon as I found them and then even when I was a few eras ahead in technology they would still try to fight me with their horsemen vs my infantry. Maybe this is just how easy AI are supposed to work, or maybe it's a problem. I do not know.  There are some glitches with the UI, the notifications that pop up on the side can bug out and won't show the message unless you wiggle the mouse around a bit. This should be patched if the developers notice it.  This next point isn't really /bad/ it's just going to take a while to get used to. The local happiness (Amenities) and housing were a nice idea and is more accurate to real life. However I felt like I just jumped into a Sim City game where everyone had their own needs and moaning at me all the time. I guess it's more historically accurate but it makes the game less enjoyable.  OVERALL:  I've been loving this game so far, a new experience for people coming back to the series. Although there may be some balancing issues right now I am sure they will be ironed out soon.  I'll give the game a 9/10 for now, may increase or decrease as updates or expansions release.",

            "review_text": "Having played many 1000's of hours of Civ V, I was extremely happy to pay for the pre-load and even gift a couple of copies to my friends.  I love the Civilization franchise and have been playing for years, and this installment has brought many new and interesting mechanics to play with for which I am impressed.    The Good    I love the new districts feature. In Civ V a new city could start rolling every building possible until you had everything in one city. This is unrealistic and Civ VI makes you think hard about which buildings a new city would benefit from most and makes it possible to have certain cities specialize in different things i.e production, gold or science.  The new city states mechanic is awesome, you are now able to send envoys to them which are gained over time, the more envoys, the bigger the bonus. This is also how you take CS from other Civs saving you the gold to use more usefully elsewhere.  The new Civics tree is cool, your Civ is now a custom built machine thanks to the government options. This is great but could use some improvements. I would like to be able to advance in a certain area similar to Civ V, but at this stage the process is similar to the Tech tree so you will have to research a lot of meaningless diplomatic options to get to your desired government.   Edit 24/20/26  The ability to stack troops into corps(2 sets) and armies (3 sets) is so useful when attacking the enemy, it is no longer necessary to completely surround a city with troops to successfully capture it. This is a throwback to one of my favourite Civ games Civ Rev and is a very welcome addition to the game.  I love that Wonders now take up space outside of your city, preventing a player from mass producing every Wonder in the game is a good thing for me. I especially like the placement requirements, which can cause you a dilemma when the wonder you want, can only be placed on that luxury resource, the ensuing toss up in the mind has made the Wonders aspect of the game a lot more fun. I also love the new Wonder animations when complete, so beautiful.  A good thing about the AI is that they seem to know when defeat is looming, and they will try everything in their power to broker a peace agreement.  More to follow in next edit.................    The Bad    One thing I would like the makers to improve on is the AI. During my last attempt, France (at peace with) mass produced Apostles to invade my lands. Normally I wouldn't mind and would relish the challenge of fending them off to save my own religion.  However in this instance there was so many of them I could not navigate my own units through my own land! This caused me to lose battles elsewhere on the map against another Civ. Which as you can imagine was super annoying.  Furthermore having asked France to refrain from converting my cities, which they agreed to, the promise was broken the very next turn. The diplomacy screen did not give me any means to justice, no Casus belli for the broken promise nor the opportunity to denounce!  The AI are crazy! It seems impossible to keep good relations with them. I had a moment where America offered me a Joint War Declaration against France. I agreed. Two turns later they denounced me as a Warmonger. I could not believe it, my best efforts to keep good relations squandered by the insanity of this AI.  Another improvement should be the UI. It's too hard to acess information such as yeilds and troop lists and in my opinion makes the game much harder than Civ V.   Edit 24/10/16  Having turned off the Religious Victory, the game has much the same feel as Civ V + DLCs with all the new mechanics added, it's my opinion that this is where the game needs improving to make this game perfect.  More on the UI front, the city targeting button is way too small and is especially hard to click when a unit is garrisoned in the city. Also there is no notification as to when a city can target an enemy, you have to be extra vigilant.  I love the new City States mechanics, however they CS themselves seem to have problem conducting warfare. For example if I have one as my ally, and we both go to war with another Civ, all of the troops amassed by the CS do not seem to try to even engage the enemy Civ, unless that Civ unwittingly sends a troop very close to them. There is an option to levy 'rent' the CS army for your own use, but I'd like to see the CS actually help and engage in war by themselves.  More to follow in next edit.................   Conclusion   Aside from the problems mentioned I find Civ VI a very enjoyable game, much better than vanilla Civ V, however there are some problems which need to be fixed, and as with Civ V, I'm sure a patch or two can solve these issues.  As I have said I love this game and I love the Civilization franchise, so a huge thank you to the makers from me, but please, please fix these problems!",

            "review_text": "A game that, if it fixed the one major flaw, would be an easy recommend.   Main issue: A.I. is beyond braindead. Each civilization you meet has an agenda you can see. It tells you that a certain civilization likes it if your science is superior to theirs or if they hate warmongers. The problem is, these agendas don't seem to matter. I've gotten declarations of friendship from civilizations I am directly going against their agenda while civilizations that SHOULD like me more for meeting their 'likes it when...' agenda denounce and declare war on me. Now, this would be acceptable IF the AI understood what 'war' is.   My last game, I had both the Kongo and China declare war on me on the same turn with no actual provocation. Ok, however, 30+ turns later, I finally see China has sent its' army to attack me, still no sign of Kongo's armies. The problem goes even deeper here as China's 'army' consists of two warriors. I easily repel China's pitiful display of force and they negotiate peace with me by giving me lots of money. During the same game, Russia declared friendship with me and one turn later declared war on me.   The A.I. doesn't seem to have the ability to properly pursue goals so it blindly and almost randomly makes decisions. What little the AI actually pursues, it seems to pursue counter to what it pursues. Washington hates warmongers, so it declares war on me and not the guys with a warmonger penalty.   IF Civ6 fixed the AI's issues, I would easily recommend the game, but as is it just isn't fun playing against an AI that is easily the worst AI I've seen in years.  The less bad issues: UI   The UI is alright, it's nothing stellar. I've still not found a good screen that shows detailed info about my Cities and I seem to run into problems as such. Diplomacy is needlessly slow (Leader says something, then slowly another menu appears in the lower left of the screen, then slowly another menu appears). Shortcuts for toggling the different map filters (showing best places to settle, etc) are placed in submenues (was a better system in Civ5 imo). The UI is hardly a deal breaker, it's functional, but it does have room for improvement.   The good:  Relatively few bugs. I've yet to really run into a noticable bug.   Civilization 6: Complete edition! Civ6, unlike Civ5 or Beyond Earth, doesn't feel like a game that needs two expansions to make it a complete game, it's its' own game that will be improved by expansions rather than rely on them.   Sound! I love the music in the game. It's just good music. The voiceacting is good (miss Nemoy though...).   The indifferent:  The art style. I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it. It's nice in some ways, but sometimes the art style makes it hard to differentiate certain terrains imo. I don't think it's bad, I don't think it's good.   TL;DR: Don't recommend solely due to the braindead AI that doesn't know what it wants or how to obtain what it seems to want. Overall, a great game ruined by a single issue.",

Knowing that down the road there will be DLCS most likely, if it's any sid meier's, there will be DLCS....I'll say it again.   Unfortunately I can agree that I had more fun with Sid V than I did with this...and for a few reasons. I'm not as in-depth about the problems I notice in the game, like someone mentioned how 'roads are useless and workers can't build them and the only way to build them is to waste a trade route' yea...I did notice that, and it is a little upsetting because if you're trying to match reality and give the player freedom to make his own decisions...let him build a ♥♥♥♥ing road himself. (just saying) if he builds it through the rainforest of nothingness and nothing gets accomplished with that road as far as military advancements or whatever, then that's their 'loss' in my opinion.   I am also saddened that there are very few options for 'starting a game' I find myself resetting constantly because I feel the game just doesn't 'cling on to me' or the person I picked doesn't really have much to offer. I liked the simplicity of Sid V as far as the 'benefits of a leader' and I think districts are pretty stupid (not going to give a reason, just don't like them) I also feel like the 'luxury resources and bonus resources' are pretty useless....again, not giving a reason, just my opinion.   I also noticed that workers....when you make a farm or give them something to do, I don't know what happens but they ♥♥♥♥in disappear and that just pisses me off that they poof after It took like 10 turns to produce a worker and he disappears after making 1 farm...I've had it happen to me before, I 've had it happen randomly it seems, idk if it's a bug or they go into like a 'production mode' and just...'work the tile' but in my opinion that is very ....very.....very....stupid and annoying. Makes me produce another worker and another, and another, really I find myself not having workers most the game because they ♥♥♥♥in fall off the earth or seep into a tile or whatever...idk, I definately fine the older version better, and am not entirely upset about wasting $80 at the same time...it is an improvement but god ♥♥♥♥ing DAMN they seemed like they were experimenting with TOO MUCH and have Tom, ♥♥♥♥ and Ernie's desk projects implemented in their game when maybe not a lot of people like ♥♥♥♥'s idea or Ernie is a little bit on the dumb side and just likes making things broken. Idk, anyway, this is my honest opinion about the game, I know I don't have a lot of hours but i've honestly never had an $80 game seem 'boring' in a sense....So I feel like I've been ripped in the way that I thought I was buying Civ VI, when really I'm buying something 'like Civ V' but for dummies...seems to be less to actually 'do' in the game.",

As for graphics i can tolerate them but for some leaders they look absurd. speacking of leaders yoll end up wanting to watch every single one of them be killed in the most millicaous ways possible (esspicaly cleopatria) after the crap they give you. they will declare war, spy on you (and only you), make stupid threats, constantly spam you with the worst trades possible, and as always complain about your warmongering (tbh i wish the warmoongering system was never invented) at least in civ 5 your allies dint turn on you after 1 city taken.

The final largest change is policies. Policies and government types are a great way to customize your nation.

(unlike civ 5 where it was start with +5 gpt and build a few buildings to be in debt) or i just sucked early game  Cons: - I personally dont like the map reavealing, it stays as the 'fog' and doesnt just darken the area like in civ 5 - In game UI can be a bit confusing and you can get lost trying to find stuff - the resources blend in the with stuff around it so I loose track of them, even with yields and icons on. - The mini map is a bit hard to see (is hexagon shaped) - I should've probably played the tutorial &amp; maybe wouldn't have gotten lost in the UI. - still bugs but it literally just got released  Overall: So far 8/10 - UI could definitley use some fixing IMO. I really do enjoy it and I think other Civ fanatics like myself will enjoy the game. The cons are really just me being nitpicky mostly but I'm sure ill get use to it eventually since it is a brand new game.  Would definitley recommend picking it up, I see alot of potential in it being on par with Civ 5, if not better.  If you're unsure still then wait for my more in depth review or a sale",

            "review_text": "Civilzation VI is a wonderful addition the Civilzation series. Personally, I believe this is probably my favourite Civ game and has done better than Civilization V (Don't get me wrong Civ 5 was amazing, had tons of fun) But here's my sum up of the game.  Pros : - Movement and Combat looks and feels great, especially the unique animation when a unit deals the killing blow; I thought this was an amazing touch on the game. - The game runs so smoothly, I have had no performance issues as of yet and since writing this I have 8 hours. Not a single frame drop, no random crashes; just an all round smooth experience - City Management/Development, I love the new district addition. It really makes the cities easier to manage and helps give you certain buffs that can get you out of a sticky situation. That said, it also makes a great addition to sieging cities. If you can work out what districts are helping a city or civ out the most, that can be your priority instead of going straight for the actual city. - Great Persons. The new great persons screen makes life so much easier to see how far away you are from grabbing your next great person, you can see exactly what you need, what civ is closer to getting them and they all seem to provide better buffs than last time. - Barbarians, last Civ, barbarians were hardly a challenge. A few units and you could rid them for basically your whole game time. Now thats not the case, straight from the off barbarians are a HUGE threat (In my first game I got demolished by 4-5 barbarian units on the 7th turn) completely wasnt expecting it and it set me back far enough that by the time i'd cleared up the mess, all the other civs were miles ahead and there was no way back (I proceeded to lose the game by getting wiped out by good old England) - AI Improvements (sort of) So the AI is a tricky one but their battling decision are thousands of times better, there are no unguarded settlers or workers, units move around together and they dont send one petty unit at your horde of warriors. They seem to have their heads screwed on a bit and make it more difficult to win.  So thats just some of the pros but there are plenty more!   Cons: - AI Issues (sort of) so again I ended the pros saying the AI in war are very clever; thats not saying they're perfect elsewhere. I got denounced by someone simply because my army wasnt large enough to meet their standards. There was no war, they just didnt like the fact I was playing peaceful, I had enough units to defend myself but clearly not enough to class me as worthy. Also trading is a bit stupid. I got offered one luxury resource for a reasonable price. I tried adjusting it to see if I could get a better deal, but once you've adjusted, theres no going back, the older deal has been withdrawn and you can't get it again.  - Artwork (Weak point) So this point is VERY weak and hasnt really affected gameplay too much. But surprisingly im not going to say I hate the new style, in fact I love the new style! But, I tend to play Pedro (Brazil) and that gives you a start bias of Rainforest, but oh my god, the rainforest design is a mess. Especially when theres loads of it together, its incredibly hard to see everything. I tried turning resource Icons on for a second. Nope that just made the mess worse, instead I just sacrificed part of my bonus and cut down the rainforest as its just a mess. Other than that the art work is fine. Oh, the fog of war is cool too, I dont know why everyone is complaining about that. - Bugs (Again weak point) So I havent actually experienced any of these bugs, but im speaking on behalf of people who have. Yes, this game has bugs. But jesus, its been out for one day. I dont really know a game that has came out completely flawless of bugs. Plus they're hardly game breaking.   Ultimately, this game isn't perfect, but hardly any game is now. But this game is great! If bugs are going to annoy you, hold off. But if you love the Civ Series, I really doubt this game will let you down!",

Just so everyone knows, the harder difficulty settings just result in the AI getting tons of free troops. They are still completely and utterly inept though, noticably dumber than even the earliest Civ games and infinitely more confusing. Why on the standard difficulty would a nation in the modern era build an entire army of spearmen?! WHY?! Come on.  This game is painful to play and I can't bring myself to continue playing. It's depressingly thin. No more maps included, so expect to play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ random maps forever until a third party fills the gaps for a company that screwed you. Try Civ V or tell Firaxis to suck it and try Making History if you want a game that has performance over flashy garbage.

            "review_text": "I really like this game. I like the Artwork and Atmosphere and I think the changes with the districts was a great Idea. Sadly the 'intelligent' AI is as I actually kind of expected not really that smart. I would really like to vote for 'needs some rework', but as that doesn't exist I will vote for recommend, as all in all it's fine. I mean I always like the civ series, but the AI is kind of always bothering me. Also I'm not that happy with some of the fighting mechanics.  So, what bothers me about the AI (I played twice on emporer)? Trading with the AI can be horrible. I mean sometimes you can try to give them 2 luxury ressources for 1 and even then they're not happy. Then again you can get your spies back for 1 gold over 25 turns, despite you just ignored them when they asked you not to spy in their territory.   They're lack of overall strategy. I was at war with an AI, they attacked the city state I was allied with and killed all units there. After that they just continued without even pillaging something (including my trade routes). Other situation, I declared war and tried to attack a city. I saw that he was coming with quite some units and retreated a bit. He just keept attacking me for some time with single units and after that I took the city without problems. Another situation I had a completly defensless city (I got it from a peace treaty earlier) and declared war because I wanted his capitol and did expect to loose my city, but I didn't care. Well he didn't even attack my city -.- It's totally oblivious to the hole Situation and I actually wouldn't even mind if the AI would cheat here a bit more in sense of information.  The agendas of the different AI's have sometimes really weird triggers and I have the feeling that it hinders them sometimes to work together because they have each other as much as me. It really needs some mechanics that they're working together also if they hate themself. I mean in my second game I was warmongering the whole time, but noone really cared. One declared war on me, but never attacked... I mean the only reason I made peace sometimes was because the unhapiness of my towns would skyrocket with warweariness. I personally think a city shouldn't have warweariness if it's not really close to the battles and there is no counter war propaganda (new options for spies?).  Now something about the combat system. I really don't like it how it is now. This adding of stats is absolutely stupid. I had the situation where I didn't want to attack a catapult with my legion, because it would just have been a minor victory or so. His unit had defender of the belief (+10 melee strengh) makes with basic stats 33 melee vs 40 melee + he gets his +2 from the difficulty so it's already on 35, a standard swordsman. Meaning also the catapult does probably more damge when defending against an attack then when doing a ranged attack... This is just ridiculous. Stuff like this happens when you try to make stuff to simple. It makes sense to have stats, but I would strictly divide stats and bonus damage. Stats are used to compute a basic damage and afterwards you get some boni lets say for AT against tanks (in percent of the base damage). The stats would be only the main stats + unit upgrades",

CONS: -Districts take a lot of space and leave less hammers, food, science, etc. to be had on tiles. -Building wonders is a secondary goal with steep requirements and space they take on tiles.  -Cities are constantly unhappy because of lack of entertainment districts, entertainment district almost required in every city.  To sum it all up, there are a lot of new concepts to the game, like, amenitites, religious combat, and districts. All of these things can be a bit confusing at first and frustrate you. Also, CIV V strategies will almost always NOT work in this CIV. The AI are smarter and the gameplay is way different.

The district system, the religious victory and the enhanced city-state diplomacy create whole new layers of gameplay.  Everything needs more thinking and more careful planning now - which by the way might be why this installment is getting so many negative opinions so far: you can't just play it like SimCity, spamming building and wonders with no caution paid to other players. You need to pick the best spots for your cities which will allow you to grab as many adjacency bonuses as you can. You need to pay attention to all the victory conditions constantly. You need to actively fight the barbarian hordes. You need to think.  But all is not well in Civilization VI.

I like that I can actually play different time periods vs the same speed in Civ V. I also noticed that at Prince the difficulty seems much lower than Prince in Civ V.  I still miss the throne room from Civ II (III?) and the ability to zoom all the way out to see the globe.  Recommended? YES!!!  10/30/16: I picked this yesterday. I gave been a fan of Civilization games since Civ II excluding Beyond Earth which I also have. I wanted to see how different this was compared to Civ V and it is quite different. If you read anything about this game you will know the UI has been changed, graphics have been overhauled, game mechanics are updated, and they have tried to make the game 'funner' to play through the entire game. Below are some things that I did not hear or missed that they changed.  Differences: - The camera angle seems to be slightly different which took me a while to get used to. - UI is reversed. The map is not on the bottom left and I swear it was on the right before. - Graphics look nice but are not as high res as I was expecting. When you zoom all the way in.... you start losing detail. Zoomed our or at a normal playable level the graphics are great. - First time playing you are given a choice between new to Civ or Civ VI. When I picked new to Civ VI it bumped the difficulty to Prince. I was surprised that I was playing at that high of a level because it reminded me a lot of Chieftain or Warlord from Civ V. Yes.. I don’t play on extremely hard. I like to enjoy the game... not want to violently and creatively curse at it like when I play Red Orchestra 2. - The standard civilizations you can play as. I was expecting them to change but I feel like I lost some that I loved. I did have all the expansions for Civ V so that may be why I feel it is lacking. I also hate that they will continue to have DLC for new civilizations but also understand. Wish they would give discounts toward the DLC if you purchased previous games. - Default Keyboard hot keys. They are changed. Space bar now does nothing.... - Mouse controls seem to be slightly changed. - Side screen scrolling seems to be disabled when moving a unit. THIS IS REALLY ANOYING!  Issues? I had one major issue. The game decided when I needed to go to bed. It didn’t ask me to save or quite, it just went away. The house was dark and the game allows for deep colors so insta crashing to the desktop which has a very bright background was surprising to say the least. I hope this was a fluke.  Recommended? YES! It is new and different. If you love previous Civ games, then you will like this. Give it a few turns and you will start to get used to everything.",

            "review_text": "After putting some hours into the game i think i can now actually comment on it. And sadly this means that i cannot recommend this game in its current state (12-4-2016).  This doesnt mean that the game has no good points to it, because there are quiet a few. The music is nice except for the menu music - that one is awesome. The graphics are a matter of taste obviously, but i found them to be nice to look at - which is important when a game takes such a long time. And of course its a civilisation game - so a lot of concepts are in the game just as expected. Oh yeah, and it is surprisingly enough fun to play in spite of its shortcomings.  So why not recommend it ? Simply put - with a pricetag such as this product has its flaws are - in my eyes - unforgiveable.  Exiting the game after playing for 'too long' (time would have to be estimated) it will just not terminate and either force you to restart your computer or find a workaround to kill the game process. Bugs like that are major things that had to be known prior to release.  And then we get to the 'design choices' that are seriously impeding the fun for me.  Like denouncing. You will get denounced by 70% of all civs for about 70% of the game (totally not made up numbers). For just about everything. You are a warmonger. Or have a different government. Or you have no spies in the ancient era. Or too little territory. Or to big of one. It actually doent matter - its the favourite past-time of the ai.  Like the warmonger concept itself. Declare war on someone ? Warmonger. Get declared on ? Warmonger. Take a city ? Warmonger. Raze a city ? Guess for yourself. Do something like that (or have it done to you) and you are a warmonger. Forever. I think its like a certifikate of participation. Everyone gets one. No idea what it should accomplish, but as of now its just a reason for getting denounced. Not that the ai needs any reason for that.  Like the religion thing. Doesnt work at all. The ai send myriads of religious units over the map in order to do some sightseeing i guess. Because theres not too much conversion happening while they stroll around your country happily blocking the way for anyone. There even was a war where one ai declared on me and then couldnt get any units through the clump of religios desaster that Pedro had seemingly exiled into my country. I think our armies fought each other via radio using harsh language until in the end Pericles payed for peace. Obviously it was the religious system at work here. Following the ai logik the best use for inquisitors is to round them up, herd them into enemy territory and then sacrifice them by attacking an obviously way superior unit - thereby eradicating any trace of the corresponding religion in the area. I can only guess the design process involved a lot of 'praying that it works'.  Like the missing balance of science/culture points and corresponding techs. where you more or less have to spam future techs from 1950 onward. If you were lazy on techs, that is.  Like diplomacy. Its basically not there. The ai cheats at every opportunity. They get bonuses like no tomorrow. Sadly they also get 'agendas' to determine whether they like you or not. They might like cultured civs. That means not you because of their headstart you are pitiful to them. They might like civs with lots of territory. That means not you because of their headstart you have only a third of their land. If youre lucky. And due to this they basically hate you and it only gets worse from there. Did i mention they will denounce you ?  I could go on and on, but that would not achieve anything here. It seems as if almost any concept in the game is only halfway there. And more or less untested. I guess the playtesters were actually playing another game and noone noticed. This game needs a lot of work to be good, because the framework is actually here. But it is really not ok to sell this mess at a pricetag that high.   And that is why i advise to not get this game now - but maybe keep an eye on it.  Hope this helps at least someone out there.",

Interesting fleshed out mechanics (districts, wonders, adjacency combos)  Cons: (biggest problem to smallest) AI is thoroughly braindead, doesn't matter if you crank the difficulty up, idiotic AI ruins your experience... You can beat any AI army with 3 well placed ranged units and a couple of well placed melee defenders. The AI will play like a 2 year old in every way, it will build wonders it doesn't need and thoroughly annoy you with unnecessary announcements. (denounce, warnings and once they ♥♥♥♥ up thier offensive request peace every turn until you kill them)   Many straight up balance problems,  The units are extremely cheap compared to districts, especially later on  builders clearing resources is ridiculously powerful, you can destroy resources outside your city limits (3x3hex) and considering you can use a builder to rush production of your next builder (builder cost = ~60 production but cheaper in lower difficulty, forest clear = 60 prod.. )   China OP because of above builder issue.  UI is garbage tier nonsense.  The auto-unit switching is infuriating (thank god for the work around)    Overall, if the issues are fixed it might be the best game in the Civ series but for now you might even want to wait for a sale if you care about money...",

Well, at present status the game is just not worth its pricetag. Main problems are the subpar tactical AI and skirmish-like diplomacy system.   Granted, AI and diplomacy are not a big deal if your goal is to play online. However, I only play singleplayer and the lack of development in these fields totally destroys a game for me. Tactically, the AI is unable to attack: it deploys a carpet of doom which doesn't even try to seize a city and then forgets to keep units up to date. Leaders seem to be bipolar and slaves of their agendas and seem unable to evaluate a military/political scenario. This is inexcusable, given that Firaxis was able to deploy a great diplomacy system years ago with SMAC.  Honestly, I was expecting a bit more, for this price. While I'm able to forgive bad AI and diplomacy in a game like endless legend (which costs 1/3 of this), I can't do the same for a game developed from a company who used to set the standard with their products (and whose games are so pricey).

As an experienced Civ player, I believe the AIs in this one are the worst. They get angry over the smallet things and, I kid you not, will go to war with you within 20 turns and wreck you. The smallest things upset them and you can never get them on your side for long. The only 'alliance' I've ever made with a character was Teddy Roosevelt, but when someone declared war on me, he considered me a warmonger and declared war on me no more than 2 turns later. Thats just a couple of examples of diplomatic AIs.  On the research side, the AIs never advance in technology it seems. I've been playing games on Immortal, and I've noticed that I can get to robotics by the 1700s, but the AI is still using catapults and crossbowmen. During the 1900s I had helicopters and tanks, but the AI still had catapults and crossbowmen. They occasionally had musketmen. For some reason the AI doesn't function well at all which is literally 90% of the fun in a Sid Meier game.  The graphcs are 'meh'. When I watched trailers of the game, I was pretty excited. When I got the game, it felt very underwhelming and cluttered. Its like you have to train your eyes to enjoy the environment because theres so much crap everywhere! The leader scene quality is awful as I don't like the 'PIxar' style animation they chose for this one. I turn off leader scene quality and replace it with the 2D cutouts, its better that way. On top of that, the leader scenes don't have anything pizazzy about them like Civ V does (example: Civ V George Washington is in his office standing near lots of books and a globe or Queen Elizabeth sitting on her throne). The Civ V graphics look insanely more reliastic, which makes me enjoy it because I'm a history buff and I like to use my imagination. The childish graphics in Civ VI arent bad, but they just dont feel fitting when Civ V was realistic. I was hoping Vi would be even more realistic.  Like I said, Civ V is worth more for your buck.

Money: I have -700 income from trades with AI but my treasury goes up by 400 every turn?  UI: UI is terrible. Tooltips take forever. Civopedia is a mess, containing lots of fluff, but no actual information.  Gameplay: ICS is back. The optimal strategy is to beeline key techs, avoiding everything else. Cities must/should be build in some weird optimal pattern, revolving around industrial zone bonuses. The ultimate goal is to create overlapping factories and power plants, boosting the production of the capital to insane levels.  Even with insane levels of production, the PRODUCTION part of the science victory will take about 16*3 + 14 + 12 = 74 turns!  Wonders: 90% of the wonders are absolutely useless (I am not kidding. Most wonders are less powerful than a trade route. Several wonders (Ruhr Valley, Colloseum) are insanely OP.  Great People: Great people are tied to the age. Every time somebody advances to the next age, all great people from earlier ages are removed from the game. Much the same problem as with wonders. 90% of the great people are useless. Some are insanely OP, like darwin, giving you about 2000 science, which is 10-15 turns of science of a large and powerful empire. Other great people give you +1 amenity or some housing which is useless.  Combat: Is okay. Same as Civ 5. Enjoy fighting while dodging missionaries from neutral countries blocking your way.  Diplomacy: There is no diplomacy. Accept trades to get cash. Declare war. It does not matter. AI will hate you 95% of the time.  General gameplay: The first 100 turns are fun. Then everything slows to a crawl. Whenever one of your 20 cities finishes some chore, you got to assign a new building, or unit. Lots of popups. No build queue. Micromanagement of cities and even museums is forced. Which is a step forward from Civ5 I guess.  Anyway, the art team did a very good job. The design team needs to be fired asap.     ",

            "review_text": "When I first read about Civilization VI my 'Buyers Beware' senses immediately started tingling. 2K and Firaxis had made some fairly... strange development decisions previous. - Sidmeier's Starships - Civ: Beyond Earth  It felt like the franchise was becoming the same as ANNO, where every game since 1404 is literally a copy&amp;paste with a different tileset and some very minor adjustments.  Switch to late 2016, Civ VI releases and I buy it on day one. I had informed myself from previously available reviews and Twitch streams  and realised that it was not Civ V redux minus the addons.  So what is Civ VI then?  It's a Civilization game alright, but the focus this time is more towards the boardgame nature of turn based strategy games. More cartoony graphics, rules that are less realistic but instead bring more depth on the table, and a generally fairly different approach to the franchise's advanced game mechanics.  Of course you're still building cities, constructing buildings, recruiting armies and researching  nuclear weaponry (Ghandi, I'm watching you...). However the way you do all of this has become slightly different.  Take research for example, now you can (And theoretically have to) fullfill certain requirements to reduce a technologies research time by half.  'Kill 2 barbarians with slingers' -50% research time for archers 'Destroy a barbarian camp' -50% research time for iron  This holds true for both the regular research and the new politics system. The system from Civ V was completely remade and now is generally very similiar to the way research works.  Instead of research points you need culture and the politics you 'research' usually don't give you something directly but instead grant you access to political cards and governments which you can change around in the government tab. Additionally this research tree also has all the diplomatic options in it and  usually there's also a building or two to be gained from this research.  Other changes are the combat system, which is in it's core the same as before with  minor additions like being able to order a civilian and military unit to move together.  The combat itself also seems faster paced, especially once the barbarians start climbing the tech tree.  Trade is working nicely (Although it required a patch first) and the AI finally stopped nagging me about everything via diplomacy.  One of the downsides though is the lack of diplomatic depth that's largely missing due to there not being a united nations congress this time. I assume it's going to be future dlc/addon material, however the lack of one really comes across as missing a major game mechanic.  Diplomacy in itself is interesting in the many methods you can deploy to annoy or befriend the AI. Recent patches have also improved the AI logic in this regard though it still sometimes goes haywire.  Now to end it with one final difference to Civ V. Instead of constructing buildings inside your city you're now forced to build districts which then harbour additional buildings. Sometimes that means you're following a chain of constructable buildings, sometimes that means choosing between available buildings.  In general I love this idea. It's awesome, military districts offer a second spawn point for units and with the first few buildings also grants a military outpost that's capable of doing a second city attack on enemy units. Religious district can serve as healing stations for units with the right perks and oh crap I haven't even touched on the religion part of the game...  Religion in Civ VI is much more in-depth than ever before, literally has it's own units to construct and fight with, but suffers from being very tedious at the endgame.  I could write about all the cool and not so cool stuff for days me thinks. But I want to push this review out before christmas 2035, so....  Is Civ VI worth your money? 60€? No, that's expensive as cake. Find it for less than 60€ on other (legal!) online stores? Grab it, it's a great game, patches have made it even better and it's only at the start of it's life time.  Sure, there's some minor stuff here and there and obvious addon bait waiting to happen, but it's still one of the best gmaes 2016 has to offer.  If you like turn based strategy games then there's literally no way to avoid this one.",

I can see where they need to expand in terms of depth to reach the complete Civ V experience and am looking forward to it.

Like every old guy video game player, I've owned every version of Civilization that has ever been produced, but I just can't bring myself to like a Civ that is so flawed. My biggest complaints:  1. The pacing is glacial. This game is just so sloooooow. Movement is slow. Nerfing scout movement was an incredibly bad idea. AI turns take forever on my brand new computer. The early game is incredibly bogged down by the barbarian hordes (barbarian rage seems to be the default setting).  2. The AI has only one mode, instant hatred and berserker like warfare against you. 3. The UI is awful, especially the unit auto-selection. I know I can edit the game files to turn it off, but I shouldn't have to! You will end up screaming at your screen because the wrong units moves when you think you have a different unit selected. 4. The lack of feedback to the player is unbelievable! I've never played a Civ version where I really didn't know what is happening? The game makes noises that I don't understand and can't recognize what just happened, and the only way to find out what happened is to scroll around the screen and look through all the sub menus. It is so frustrating! 5. The new mechanics just don't trip my trigger. Districts are just time sumps, and the game is glacially slow as it is. Embedding units? Another time sump. Plus you can't embed the units you want to embed. 6. The mechanics are also mercilessly unforgiving as well as the AI cheat level is off scale. If you make one wrong move in the course of the game, forget it, just start over. There is no recovery from even moving one hex in the wrong direction. I can't even get a religion started in any game I've played because all 7 are started by the AI in about 50 turns!  I think the bottom line is that I'm not enjoying this game because it's too much like work to be fun.",

The AI is pretty damn interesting, and even challenging on Prince (a first, especially for someone who regularily beats Immortal in V). It identifies weaknesses in your defense, and will abuse them, it's still not very good in the tactical battles (but better than before), it knows when it can't win (so no useless wars), although I lost an ally on extremely friendly for years and years, who suddenly decided the turn the alliance ran out (and before I could extend it) to declare war because he had a direct path to my undefended capital (I had my ally I thought).  AI Weaknesses I have identified is that they don't seem to bother with a naval presence, and I could easily rule the waves, and steal all the empty islands. And many AIs die in the early game, even to sometimes strategically weaker AI (maybe they were booming?)  I also like that the amount of unit-upgrades are thin enough that even sub-marathon speeds are interesting (and that they're not obsolete by the time you arrive).  Some info is thin on the ground. Looks like culture still extends your border, but you cannot see when (or which ones it prefers). It also will not go beyond the the 2 square radius until they have all been filled in (unlike CiV V which would go for resources). Unit list easier than selecting a different unit, and clicking on its name, should be included (I sometimes had it difficult finding Great persons, or even some of my military). Also you cannot instigate wars without joining them yourself (which will make Immortal very hard).  Pillaged districts is HELL though, it takes so long to repair them (compared to resources), your city will be out for a LONG time (especially if they destroyed or you have no production district).

For instance, it doesn't work sometimes, and I have to shut it down and restart it, and then I instantly understand why it auto-saves by default. It happens when I check “possible route” with its running to the next turn. Besides, I am not satisfied with the information provided, it’s poor. Civ V did it better with many “Overviews”. Some of them kept like economic overview, but others like unit overview deleted. So, when I want to find a unit I didn’t care much previously, I must look over the map to find it. So I wish Civ VI will add it. Diplomatic part is still poor with little changes. I wish it will be in a way like Rising Tide of Civilization Beyond Earth. For sure, it will be much better. I have played Civ V in an old edition and Brave New World, and wish Civ VI will work like this way, too. I like those new ideas in Civ VI, making it much more interesting and challenging. The setting of district makes it harder to decide using of land. Now wonders have some requires. So even if you have unlocked the corresponding part of Tech Tree or Civic Tree, you may find there is no suitable zone to build it. Districts and wonders make the my empire a better view, and I am always fond of doing so. So, Civ VI is more sensible and balanced than Civ V. But because of that, AI have some distinct, which makes the game much easier for single player. For instance, the most possible wonder that AI would build: Stonehenge, Chichen Itza and the Potala Palace. But some wonders AI seldom build as it requires to much. In a word, it is a very good game but still need improvement.",

I am no longer punished for building wide - wow what a feeling! 2. The music is great, and it's dynamic aspects works perfectly almost making me feel like part of an epic movie. 3. I like the new tech boost system, but it's still too early to tell if it's actually good for the game or not. If an optimal strategy can be found the new system might be more limiting than it is rewarding. 4. However, the civets/policy system I feel adds a great deal and is a step forward. 5. I like the attention made to the diplomacy system in general, but it still needs a lot of polish and tweaks. It can get quite annoying that you can never be friends with the AI unless you give them incredible bribes and also toe the line of their diplomatic agendas perfectly. 6. I encountered quite a few bugs with the UI. However, no performance problem on my 2 year old machine (GPU is a GTX760).   Overall I will have a lot of fun with this. Better than CIV5? Sure, why not - but I don't know if it will last as long as CIV5 did in it's present state, but I'm hopeful future updates will make it so. My favourite CIV is still CIV4 though :)",

Cons: Too few civilizations selectable (DLC?) No world congress (DLC?) No or only very limited stats. No city view where you can sort for high/low.  Poor city border extension (not always towards resources or more important i.e. strategic resources). Only a very tiny unit overview that closes once you select one single unit. No option to upgrade units of one type at once Religion not very clear to understand and use (no visible pressure, not sure if that is working at all) AI aggressive but dumb (attacks via see although only 2 field available for embarking so that they can be killed easily. Does not move wounded units out of city defense range but tries to let them heal there . There seem to be several bugs (no war weariness detectable, no peace possible, no benefit from siege tools)  True city view no longer available, but the mix of zooming in and then haven special views is annoying Several messages of a type (i.e. war declaration) cannot be read at once but need to be selected one after another? Very annoying  Neutral: Comic style , I do not like it but that is a matter of taste. Great Person competition with other civs… not yet sure about that. Interesting feature but I have not been using the “skip” option too much because it gives your competitors a boost for that person whereas you do not know if the next person will be better.  So why thumbs up? It is still CIV and already got that “Just one more round feeling”.  And I really like the idea of 2 different research trees, one powered by “science” one by 'culture'. Also the different government systems with selecting exchangeable bonuses as political ideas is very nice idea. Finally, the idea to specialize cities with districts and to have prerequisites to build a district or a wonder is a big milestone to previous CIV games.",

When you get late into the game and most of the buildings you have are finished there is no real way to keep having to give your cities something to do like in Civ 5, In 5 i could just tell them to focus on wealth, culture, or production, and you can in a way in civ 6 but theres a turn limit. However when I started detroying my foes and taking their land my production shot through the roof and the turn limits on those focal points your civilization can focus at finish in one turn meaning you have to micromanage 15+ cities every turn which gets extremely tedious and slows the pace way down, especially if you are focusing on taking players out or just trying to end the turn.",

In Civ 5 you could enter top-down map mode and have instant bombing runs. Not anymore. That really takes a chunk out of the joy of bombing your adversary into submission.

Only a few cons stand out in Civ VI, which are probably the result of the release. There are always issues in a game that has been rushed to release, like this game feels. For example:  1. The settings are a bit limited. Although you can change more graphics settings with NVIDIA, there are few things in-game that you can adjust to you liking, especially those to do with gameplay.  2. The AI. Many people have been complaining about how terrible the AI is and I can partially agree with them. The AI is pretty stupid, but at least it works okay in multiplayer. They listened to us for the modding capabilities, so I am sure they will listen to us on the AI, in the sense that this will be fixed soon.  3. Few minor bugs. There are always a few minor bugs when a new game is put out, but these have yet to be fixed. For example, you can't delete certain religious units (I can't get rid of a missionary of the wrong religion), cities cannot be renamed, and a long loading screen upon resuming your game.  Overall, I think Civilization VI's extreme potential and hype mostly still lives, but if you give it more time, things may get even better. No matter how things are, you will always find yourself playing for hours at a time, enjoying every single minute of it! BUY THIS GAME!!!",

            "review_text": "I have played this game for 5 hours nonstop now, so here's my two cents. The game is really good in comparison to some of the other civilization installments. Beyond Earth, for example, doesn't even compare to this. The new mechanics are really pleasing. Now when you want to build something, you have to build the specific district which will have a list of building options. This is in contrast to the earlier civilization games where you could just build your buildings. Districts also take up space, so you need to manage the land a little bit more. The biggest difference in this game is for me is the technology. Now there are Eurekas in the game that speed up your research. So what do you have to do to get these Eurekas you ask? Well... You have to complete the specific task prior to or during researching the specific technology. For people like me who try to build science buildings to rush a science victory, it really makes them have to allocate resources differently. I was behind in science in my game even when focusing on science only because I didn't do the Eureka boosts. Overall very good game and with a few dlcs and mods, it will be a masterpiece.",

            "review_text": "This game is a classic example of a sequal that got a lot right, but also took a lot of steps backwards. I have played every civ game extensively since Civ 3, I also played the original Sid Meiers Colonization back in the day, and I can say this game needs more work, akin to how Civ5 was not very good until the expansions fixed it. I cannot recommend until they fix it, and to be honest I have a good feeling they leave out features on purpose so they can sell us expansion packs, they literally made some of the same mistakes they had with Civ 5 and then fixed, but then made them again in 6...   1) The UI is pretty dreadful, some information is needlessly hidden behind + buttons, the mini map looks really bad, some of the past information is no longer availible, for example you cannot see an overview of countries excess resources and relations, at least not that I have found.. even scrolling the map with the mouse at the edge of the screen doesn't work well... but the worst has to be the notifications on the right, which only pop up half the time i put my mouse over them. Or how about the 2 second lag time it takes to bring up specifics about a tile you hovering over?? Hot keys are also bad.   2)Graphics are usually a non issue for me, especially in a strat game, but I must say.. it is like it took a step BACKWARDS. It literally looks worse then Civ5, it is much harder to destinguish roads, hills, and other features on the map, and the AI leaders look SO cartoonish that its just silly.. like characatures of leaders, political cartoons... not a fan. The fog of war seems so clunky also.. I don't know how to say it but I have a hard time telling fog of war from unexplored from terrian sometimes.   3)What the hell happened to the sentry feature?!? Am I missing it?? Now you can fortify some units.. but not all... and put all to 'sleep' but you can no longer foritfy until an enemy comes into range?? That feature was nearly crucial for anti-barbarian and anti-submarine picket lines... now I have to like go manually looking around my borders to make sure no enemy units are simply walking past my 'sleeping' defenses... really bad form.   4) Strat. Resources should be put back to the Civ 5 method... needing only 1 or 2 of a resource to build endless legions of a unit is really a step backwards... it also means countries really don't have incentive or nessecity to start wars for resources... when previously it was much more realisitc, if you had only 3 oil and your opponent had 10... he was going to be producing a LOT more tanks and air craft... so you better come up with a solution by either trading for more, or attacking someone to steal theirs before it was too late... As it stands in Civ 6, a small empire with 1 uranium or oil can produce as many resource specific units as a large empire that has many many resources. I just don't understand this move, was it meant to make it easier for smaller countries, in a game that has basically nerfed the tall build by adding districts?? I am confused. Also, some resources like Iron don't seem to be needed at all... you can skip right over it without blinking.   5) Movement needs some serious work... it can literally take 9 or 10 turns to march your own army through your own land between only 2 cities of yours. I mean.. at least try to make it synch up with the year counter... it takes hundreds of years for an army to march from one city to the neighboring city?? Moving through terrian is way too difficult now that they have removed the 'holdover' point.. aka in Civ 5 if you had a single movement point remaining, you could use it to cross into a space that normally took 2 points, like crossing a river or going up a hill. In Civ6, you NEED 2 points no matter what.. so if you are moving from grassland to grassland then to woods... you move 1 tile to grassland, sit there till next turn.. then 1 tile into woods.. and sit there till next turn.. and then another turn to move out of the woods, god FORBID there is a hill or river or more woods, that means it took you 4 turns to move 4 tiles... 4 tiles which is basically the limits of a single cities border, took an entire 4 turns.. that is absurd. Increase base movement points for all units to 3 points, and go from there, that would help the early game movement a LOT. Keep in mind, you cannot manually build roads till mid-game when you get military engineer, and even then its a pain in the ♥♥♥ because they are relatively expensive to build, and can only build 2 tiles of roads before they are gone. Oh, and they follow the same movement restrictions as any normal unit so it takes 25 turns to get them to where you need them to build a road in the first place. Really tedious and absurd, I don't want to spend half my night simply marching a few units 1/10 of the way across the map.   6)What is the deal with the AI?? It is almost nonsensical. I know they tried this agenda and hidden agenda thing.. and it KIND OF works, but also is very broken. There are just too many variables or something, everyone ends up all mixed up in terms of relations. I don't even understand the delegate and embassy thing to be honest, its just kind of annoying... there doesn't seem to be ryhme or reason behind when they accept or don't accept. The AI also seems to spam really weak units and then never upgrade. I have had multiple games where its me with tanks and helos vs 1000 horseman... and city states seem to do the same thing.   7) Why is the tech tree wrecked so badly? You can skip right through to artillery and infantry before you have basically any other techs researched. You can skip entire generations of units it seem..? Also why did they remove whole eras of units, things move way to quick now you go from musketmen to infantry BAM, no real rifleman, no great war infantry, just bam. Same thing with aircraft, they are back to just defaulting to world war 2 era... they fixed this in civ 5 in the expansions, so why regress now?? No great war tanks! BOO   I don't mean to just bash the game, it has a lot of nice addtions, just needs some work. I like many things about this game and the direction it moved it. But please there are some mistakes here that make it seem like the people that made it have no experience even playing Civ...",

            "review_text": "Pros:  The Game looks good, the  musics  are awesome.  Graphic  is beautiful, I would have preferred a less cartoonized ones (about palette and general aspect), more serious and realistic, but I can't say it is not pleasant to the eyes and well done. The gameplay mechanics has been revisited and it appears interesting as always. It correct bad aspect of Civ V, and bring back some good features of previous chapters. There are many different  new and modified futures  and they all seem great, like the simultaneous progress of  scientific and policy research  combined with the governments, that give a lot more choices on how to advance in the game and so, to much more different possible results. Museums and exhibits are a pleasure and they have even more sense now. Promotions functionality are much better now, and also the great characters, the city-state and national wonders that depend also on the effective land plot available. Really Firaxis changed a lot of things, too many to list, most for the better. Leaders inside the international relations panel are characterized but, as I said, graphically speaking, pleasant and well done, Victoria expressions are adorable. Roads auto-generated upon the commerce lines are a nice change too, more historically accurate I guess, then, with the time, you can hire engeeniers to buil them according your needs. You can group 3 soldier now or link them to guard units (after the researches). In my opinion, in the while I'm playing, still a great and enjoyable game. I did play them all and this one has potential to be a step ahead in particular about the core, the progress mechanics and its many possible ways to builds and grow your civilization.  Cons:  On the other side, as every Civ releases, personally I would like to change some things. First of all the  Fog of War  that now appear as an old virgin paper map that draws, shapes and goods, while you discover the lands. To start it look and it is a very beautiful idea and it waste less ram resource, on the other side after you discover lands, the game doesn't divide very well the explored from the visible ones at a glance. The seen lands should be go back to a much more dark version of the visible one, and not 'painted' back as a paper map. Looking at map I feel like a little blind this way, and it looks a bit messy to me.  Another thing that doesn't work smooth it is the  moving cursor to the sides screen to scroll  the map indeed get blocked by the UI in some points, as is as I would add the possibility to let to scroll the orizontal menus (like the researches) by just grabbing any point over it (like in the map over the land) cause it came more natural then use just the apposite scroll button, and is more intuitive.  I still miss, in this and later release, the massive combats, anyway they improved it a bit comparing to the V chapter.  I can't find yet a panel to look and to easly locate units around the map. Last, I guess it miss 'the wake up soldiers when enemies on sight' feauture, that was, instead, much needed. I would add more kind of talks within the leaders, and I would like their idle loop more long and not started over on any (click) request, in a smoothest way. As always i experienced some bugs: the infinite load to start, some crash back to desktop, some stuck when exit the game, a few sound issues here and there, easy to fix anyway.  Less important, I also miss the selection when point enemies to attack with airplanes and have a few difficulties to select and move units sometime. I miss the zoom out over the clouds as seen in Civ III or IV.   An important problem I'm feeling with the later releases of Civilization is that often, around middle way of the turns (around 150/200), you know exactly if you will lose or win the match, no matter what. So after 200 turns it become a bit boring to go till the end. Developers should elaborate some good idea to give to the game more interest and random events or possibility in the last one hundred, or such, turns.",

            "review_text": "A fine start to what will undoubtedly be a more polished game by the end of its lifespan.  I know many people have experienced bugs, I know many people have experienced balancing flaws that turn games into 'gimmes.' While I know of these, I haven't encountered any myself nor have I been trying to and so I will only speak to my own experiences.  The willingness to revamp several of the 'outer-core' mechanics is what sells me on this game. Cities are no longer striving towards the same homogenous endpoint. Warfare no longer consists of solely having the best cross-section of quantity and technological advancement. Diplomacy with AI or Human players is expanded. City-States provide worthwhile returns on investments without taking center stage. Natural Wonders provide cumulative bonuses to several tiles rather than a large, one-off bonus. And so on.  My biggest criticisms on this game compared to V would be the artistic changes. The art style is, to my way of thinking, a step back from V's, particularly the models for Leaders. In turn, while V's more realistic, animated intro scenes ran smoothly, even the lowest setting for the animated Leader scenes in VI run poorly. The New Game intro-narrations in V were read like funeral orations, exalting the Leader for all the great achievements they had in life and were tailored to each leader's cultural idioms; in VI the narration is brief, the first paragraph is generic, the leader-specific paragraph is boring and nebulous, the narrator makes no attempt to correctly pronounce names and all of this compounded by the loading screen taking much longer than the already long load times of V.  Still, this is a fine entry in a fine series. If you enjoy strategy games and are more of a Risk player than a Chess player, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.",

There are few minor technical annoyances which i have no doubt will be fixed soon in upcoming patches like no ability to restart map like in Civ V and have to setup game everytime if you don't like your starting position which gets reset to default values every time. Also you should be able to permanently assign your spies to specific districts when on counter spying role, right now you have to reassign them after every 6 or so turns and it gets tedious when you have to reassign lot of spies which usually involves clicking 3-4 times for each spy.

But when some balancing is done with expansions this game will most likely be way better than 5.    Pros: - Game isn't lacking too many major features unlike older base games - Has a great soundtrack, composed by Christopher Tin who composed Baba Yetu - Has a lot of new mechanics that are good like district system, religious combat, casus beli for declaring war, better espionage system ... etc. - Other than minor UI bugs that will probably get fixed soon, doesn't have bugs, and runs fine without crashing (unlike civ V) - Diplomacy is mostly better, denounciations and friendships mean something now and you can now ignore the war requests (When you have military units near their border they ask if you will declare war) as well. - Civics (Culture researches) and technology tree are now seperate giving you a better way advance your civ in the way you want. - City state relations are not based on gold anymore, so it is easier to take advantage of them now, and they are more useful than before - Trade routes make the roads so you don't need to worry about connecting cities anymore, which would be a nightmare since workers have limited uses now. Also cargo ships and caravans are replaced by a trader, so you don't need 2 types of trade units. - Better strategy view and useful lenses.  Cons: - Game is not balanced good enough. - In early game you are always under attack since all AI does is spam military units. - Late game is also bad because it is boring. After some point mid-game it is obvious who is going to win and who will lose and there is very little you can do to change that (It was obvious in Civ V too but you could fix that if you are losing, or someone could make a comeback and become batter than you). - Civilopedia is lacking some information. - Having a bad starting location basically kills your chance at winning since it is a lot more important now because of the district adjacency and housing systems. - Doesn't have the world congress. - Some wonders are objectively a lot less beneficial than other wonders (they were closer in civ V), and take way too much production even in a highly developed city. - Because of balancing problems you are either doing really well or horribly bad and changing it takes a lot longer than before. - This is more of a personal opinion than a review but not a fan of new cartoony graphics. - In civ V science victory was way too easy and now it is really hard. It needs to be somewhere in the middle.    This game has a lot of potential as the expansions balance the game more and add new features. In its current state it is still good enough for me to recommend it but don't expect a perfect game since it really needs to be balanced better.",

It gets to the point where you are sacrificing certain resources to build them if you did not do it soon enough. Trade routes seem to be endless, which is a beautiful thing.

Steam doesn't show that the person is online in the game, and if this person tries to join someone's game, it says something like 'failed joining multiplayer session'. The only solution I and my friend (same issue) had is to launch another game (which would show that a person is playing something) and that would work&lt; we could actually join each other's lobbies. But a while ago this method has stopped working and, as a result, we are not able to play multiplayer civilization at all! I already wrote in forums, one of the developers assured me they would look into this issue, but, well, 2 months - no results. I didn't buy this game for single player.",

If you can get a few friends to play, I say go for it. However, playing against the AI is incredibly dull and schizophrenic. I can honestly say I did not enjoy the time I played.   The new diplomacy features do very little in a practical sense, of all the games I’ve played they hate me within a few turns no matter what I do. And the few AI I befriend will launch a surprise war with no obvious provocation. So, I just fight everyone forever because there doesn’t seem to be any other way.   I expect there will be some massive patches or DLC that will tune the AI, so hopefully we won’t have long to wait.  -Post Patch-  The AI still acts surprisingly dull. My most recent game, within 10-15 turns of meeting a civ, they denounced and promptly declared war upon me. They then proceeded to do nothing for the rest of the game. I gave up when I found that all the AI seemed confused with the idea of a naval invasion, their entire army sat off their coast while my ships tore through them.   As the player population has dropped 2/3 to practically the level of Civ5, I think in general the community has given up for the near future. Maybe after a few years of play testing they can sort out their AI logic. Until then, don't bother. I regret this purchase almost as much as No Mans Sky.",

            "review_text": "Don't get confused by the hours played, I played in offline mode all day yesterday. I have logged over 1000 hours on civ5 and many more on civ1-4. Early this morning I finished a standard game, with a fractal map, all civs, random everything. SO here's my first impressions on the game. I want to start with cons so people don't read half the review and see everything that has already been said about how good it is.  Cons: -Map movement is garbage. Civ5 mouse drag was so smooth, it was like a hot knife cutting through butter. Mouse drag in civ6 is awful. It's so clunky and feels like moving a square rock that keeps falling on its side.  -Difficulty levels are too easy. I played on King last night and the game wasn't even close. The AI isn't smarter, it just gets bonuses like every other civ game.  -AI is terrible at upgrading units. There will be warriors everywhere until the AI gets infantry. This is probably due to a combination of trying to minimize unit costs, and lack of available resources in their lands.  Nitpicky comments: -Why are the menus not sorted? If I want to see victory conditions, or trade route info, this should be sorted from high to low, or at least have a button to sort it. Beyond Earth had this same problem and I don't understand why it's so hard to implement (it's not).  -The fog of war takes too long to go away. I don't really like how it fades after you move to the tile. I wish it would fade away as you were moving.  -There are several graphical glitches that I experienced relating to city walls where the city walls would extend, in a pixilated manner, 3 tiles from the city center. After restarting the game this went away though.  -The civilopedia (is that how you spell it?) is pretty bad in my opinion. It used to be detailed but it just seems very bare bones now.  -No world congress, as far as I could tell, but it was getting pretty late. I thought this was a very nice addition to civ5 and I would love to see it return in a future expansion here.  -I wish that, with the new movement costs, that if you unit can't go anywhere else its turn would just end. Instead, it just sits there like an idiot on a hill with 1 movement left and hills all around it.   -This will never happen and I say it every time a new civ game comes out: please make early game naval units have the ability to go in the ocean, but with some probability that they will be destroyed at the end of turn. I loved this in civ3 and it's been gone since 4.  -Tech tree feels limited. I get that the civics tree should make up for this but it doesn't feel that way. The jump between eras seems very forced rather than flowing like it did in civ5.  -Game froze upon exit twice.  -Can you not negotiate with another civ about making peace with someone?  Pros: -Game is beautiful. I personally love the art style. Yes, some units look cartoony, but overall the look is very crisp.  -Love that everything has a build animation. Especially wonders, as you can see them being constructed, and then, bringing back some civ4 vibe here, see a small movie of the entire construction.  -Unit 'stacking' is back, but not in the way of stack of doom. This time you can group a certain number of units together to form corps, and eventually armies. The addition of support classes is a very nice addition as well.  -I very much enjoy the unstacking of cities. Districts make the game feel much more personal, and adds an entire additional layer of depth into the game. Most buildings within each district also feel like they belong there, rather than just placing random things in each one so that the tile gets filled up.  -AI does seems better at managing combat, not by much, but definitely better than vanilla civ5. But, see previous comment, AI is horrendous at upgrading units.   -Maps are amazing, and distribution of resources doesn't feel forced or completely random.  -Music is the best of any civ game. Yes, 4 has Baba Yetu, but the main theme of 6 is pretty close, and the in-game music is just incredible.   -Supposedly, 6 has even better mod support than 5, and 5 has over 5,000 mods.  -New engine feels great, as buildings are built on the environments you build them on, rather than being the same thing placed wherever. Also, mulithreading support is a nice addition, and turn time s absolutely improved.   -Leader screens are nice, and the amount of information in each diplomacy screen is waaaaaaay more than civ5.  -No more global happiness, which was a bad addition, but health still isn't back in from 4. Instead you have manage amenities. I mean, it's the same mechanic, with a different name, but it seems much more forgiving than the happiness mechanic.   -Nukes are great. Enough said.     I could go on for days. Essentially this game is easily the best civ game at launch, there's no debating this. Are there some bugs, yea. Does it needs balancing badly, yes. But it hasn't even been out for 48 hours, so be patient. The team behind this game seems very devoted to keeping up with the game, unlike some games, so I have no doubt that this game will receive just as much attention as 5 did. 6 also has so much on release day that 5 didn't have until its third expansion, and over $120 later. So I can't wait to see what the expansion(s) for 6 will bring (I know Ed Beach mentioned at least 1 expansion being planned).  Overall, this is really good game. On-par with brave new world in my opinion (assuming balance patches come out), and is absolutely worth the $60 price tag. If you love civ, buy this, you wont be disappointed.  Final Score: 92/100 ",

            "review_text": "With over 450 hours on civ 5 i know what I'm comparing this game to. Over all i really like it.   Pros: -looks and runs better -progressing technology though actions makes alot of sense! A civ built on the ocean should learn sailing faster than an in land civ. -district system make sense and adds a huge new element to critical thinking. You want the pyramids? Oh no...you built a district on your only desert space.  -the worker system requires more thinking. In civ 5 i would control then when needed but mostly have 5 running around on auto.  -trade routes are better - victory conditions are better -cultural victory isn't dependant on small civ size -happiness system better -stupid housing! But it makes sense... -declaring war is very cool! You can plan wars so that you are seen as less evil. Fight someone who is behind kn tech in the name of colonialism and other civs are less mad  -spy system is better -new aspects to diplomacy that are nice. Say you wont settle near a civ, and you are rewarded for keeping your word.  Cons: -AI appears weak. I have only played a full gsme on warlord so i expect this to change, but without knowing what i was doing i absolutely destroyed every civ by a huge margin. They had clubs, i had muskets. -tutorial is bad. It was trial by fire my first game. I feel there is still much to learn (not necessarily a bad thing). But i have never depended on the help menu so much. -city AI is different. At this point i dont like it...but it is growing on me -diplomacy appears weaker. Civs don't try and gouge you. Infact many times when i refused their initial offer they came back with a deal that benefited me way more than them.  - unclear who is in the lead and when. I really liked the periodic reports in civ 5. I literally won my game and had no idea it was close to ending...  Ultimately its better. But like anything new it takes time to learn. Who wants to play a game that you know everything after the first game? I'm stoked to play again and implement what i learned.  ",

            "review_text": "Is Civ6 a perfect game? No.  Is it a fun game? Yes  I have played every iteration of Civilization and with every change over there are complaints and issues. These are all fair enough, as things we have loved are changing. But, over time, they will sort themselves out as get used to them.   Of all the vanilla releases of Civ this is, by far, the deepest. There are new mechanics and concepts that really take the series in a good direction, such as districts and AI agendas. However, they really need to polish the game a bit more, as some of these great ideas have issues (eg it can be very hard to keep anyone liking you, and there may be no way to prevent it. The warmonger penalty may be excessive. etc).  But there is one GLARING negative. The AI. Civ4 and 5 both suffered with horrendous AI upon release, and 6 continues this trend. The AI is PATHETIC. They often refuse to attack, instead shuffling their units about infront of your army while being massacred by ranged attacks. They don't seem to use districts overly well... it's not thought out to flow across the empire. Instead being a random mix that doesn't necessarily help them. And it's plain too easy to win, even on the hardest difficulties.  Complaints about the art style will likely fade. People hated Civ4's art initially, but now love it. It is just jarring when you look at something you are not used to. Yes, it could use some touch ups as it can be hard to distinguish hills, but overall it looks amazing.   Will this get better? Yes. Civ 4 and 5 had similar issues and they were ironed out. Civ6 is still very playable and very fun. It's not up to the standards of Civ4 BTS, or Civ5 BNW, but let's not forget they had 2 expansions and then almost a year of patches to become the masterpieces they ended up being.",

I've spent too many nights staying up until stupid times playing the various civ games, and this is no different.

In addition to this you have to consider cities' access to water, which increases the population cap.

It seems like most of the time they'd rather declare war on me, even if they have no hope in hell of attacking anything I control. Usually a few turns after declaring war and losing most of their army to one of my cities defences, they offer me peace along with most of their strategic &amp; luxury resources.

The AI is not the greatest--and sometimes it is downright atrocious--but three months after the game's release, the developers at Firaxis have already released two patches tweaking the AI and rebalancing the game. They are very much involved with the community and are seeking to better the product they created.   The gameplay mechanics are fun. Unstacking the cities adds a new twist to the mundane city-building of past Civ games, and the Eureka/Inspiration systems provide neat side-quests to keep the mid-game from getting boring. All-in-all, it is a work-in-progress, as all Civ games are post-release, but it is a lot of fun to play.",

I am a huge civ hardcore player, around 600hr each episod, playing mainly in king-emperor difficulty. To sum up : Everything in this 6th opus was put in a more logical way.  PRO  -Civ6 new features are beyond awesome, especially worker management &amp; Quarters. it's fresh &amp; very clever. -Gold managment is extremly important and got to be hard-worked to win in decent difficulties. It's not kind of joker you can use to gain a little help like in civ5. Here you have more gold than previous civs games, but spending gold is mandatory to win and that's a first. Cpu's are spending gold more effectively aswell.  -Politic &amp; Dogmes (Brand new system with cards and a separate tree tech, i love it ! best civ6 new feature so far) -People happiness works in a more complexe way (finally), it's more difficult to have 100% satisfied people. -Diplomacy got new levers you can pull and they are really effective for once. Everything is clear, a real pleasure to play. -Religion is not a joke anymore (unlike every opus that ever existed) and you can actually win through it. -War a more passioning than in previous civ episodes, i don't know why exactly, i got the feeling bad moves results of a punishment more often. City are kinda easier to take, but enemy units are harder to take down. That's a clever tweak.  -Game's Overall balance is not perfect but close, but really nice, first time i feel like playing a hard &amp; complexe strategy game.  -Cpu are doing tiles improvments and more, you feel like they are playing the same game as you (a feeling i had lost since civilization 3) -Art directions is something that change drasticly. I won't say it's bad, not at all, it's even pretty impressive in some ways. Some people may not like it but i think i adds a lot of clarity to the game.  -Leaders modeling and animations are upon fun ! Good job Firaxis !  CONS  -That game is a bit slow, there might be tons of AI code that run behind in solo mod for PCAI. Aswell there are lot of heavier scripts than in previous civs (events, randoms stuff, barbarian, state city). That end of turn button press resulting a small moment to wait at least for me. -Units animations are real fun when they fight but sadly we need more different ones -We need more civ specific units/buildings  -Some specific units are not balanced (either too weak / either too strong) -Art direction if you don't like it. You should be open minded though because Firaxis still did huge improvments in 3D modeling &amp; animations. -Random events can be deadly and not fair (i had a barbarian horde of horseman at turn 23, they wiped my ♥♥♥ ! it was a pleasure somehow to find a harder game than before though, idk yet if i like that fact ! but at least it's realistic &amp; immersive, if you don't make units you have good chances to pay a huge price !)  CONCLUSION  Civ6 is a must have, at least for any Civ hardcore fan. After seeing all the improvments they made, after 3 games (so far), the number of variables &amp; levers are crazy good. I think i will simply uninstall civ5 &amp; 4... Because it's also far better in at least 70% of the game mechanics. With this opus, civilization is becoming a true modern strategic game and i think that's what everyone were waiting for.",

I'm also delighted by the addition of map pins, and the introduction of corps/armies is a great compromise between Civ4 and Civ5 military tactics.   That said, there are significant flaws that we really shouldn't have to play through while they hotfix. First and foremost is the AI; this is the least competitive (borderline inept) AI in the series and makes me concerned that the franchise may be heading towards multiplayer focus to the exclusion of single player. AI doesn't yet know how to wage war effectively, settle cities in logical places, pick district locations strategically, etc. It's frustrating because Domination victory in particular feels quite hollow when the enemy won't fight back.   Another major step back in 6 is the reporting/UI features, which have been radically pared down since 5. Anyone who used the different advisor reports, military overview, trade overview, notification log, demographics, etc to help manage their civ will feel they are flying blind in 6. HATE IT.   They also drastically reduced the number of civs and leaders, leaving out some major favorites like Persia, Mongols, and Babylon but I can only assume these will be forthcoming in DLC form or expansions. More concerning is the restrictively small selection of maps- what happened to Terra? Earth? Small Continents? Tilted Axis? Very disappointing.   Still, this game is an improvement over 5. Let's all cross our fingers and hope the most glaring feature oversights get sorted out and the various bugs and glitches (some game breakers in here, really can't believe they shipped like this) get fixed pronto.",

Trade deals of luxury goods are still horrifically imbalanced in the AI's favor.  It does not matter what building or Wonder you have the technology to know how to build, if you lack a dedicated district for it, then you are unable to build the improvement. It makes happiness next to impossible. Speaking of which, what happened to the Golden Ages?  Now for my Wonder complaints: They have tile requirements that require extensive city planning from before plotting your first city in order to maximize the land's potential. What's worse is that if you build a district or a Wonder over a resource, YOU LOSE THE RESOURCE! To make matters even more fun, your workers no longer get to work the tiles upon which the Wonders are built. Say goodbye to the production from hills, thereby hamstringing future developement.

            "review_text": "I love the majority of the civ series. This one is not the worst, nor is it the best. This one is better than Civ 5, but not as good as Civ 3 or 4. I haven't played 1 or 2 in so long I can't compare since I remember how much I loved the games but I'm not sure if my recollection is accurate enough of those two to compare. Over all the best of the breed remains Civ3 with Civ4 being a close 2nd.  There are several game design flaws in this game. Not just 'Oh I wish they'd done 'this' or 'that'. The game is just full of changes. Most of which are very obviously change for the sake of change rather then change to make it a better game.  Diplomacy does not work at all. It is never rational or reasonable. And it progresses fairly quickly to everyone hates everyone so it is not just broken in the human v. AI. An example, you crush a foe; they are down to their last city and they beg for peace but the only terms they will accept is with you giving them all your cash on hand and all the cash you earn every turn, and give them back a couple of the cities you captured. What you can ask for in diplomacy is broken. I was at war with Sumeria. Russia and India hated Sumeria and had 'denounced them'. But I could not ask them to join in the war, I could only ask them to start a new war against each other. You can't even do basic things like share maps. Declarations of war have nothing to do with their ability to win the war or even their preparedness to wage a war. The chinese declared war with only 4 military units, not a single one of which was close to current tech. Also the AI declaring love or hate based on nonsensical things is just plain stupid. Why in the world would any nation declare affection for another because the other built a factory, a sailboat, or hate one because they built a fancy light house? it is random nonsense in the place of actual logic based diplomacy.   Economics does not work at all. A 6 city empire can make just as much or more cash as a 40 city one. Trade routes are more important than any thing else. In fact most everything else (economically) can be ignored until your trade routes are full and then only build it when you don't have anything more important to build. In a game I recently played a 6 city empire had a larger military and more cash on hand than mine with close to 40 cities.  Road build 'works' but is done in the most annoying way they could devise. Workers can not build roads, only military engineers can, but should have been called 'Combat engineers'. 'Combat engineers' can only be built in cities with a 'barracks' (now called an encampment). They can only build 2 roads (or other items) and then disappears. 'Caravans' (now called Traders) will sometimes build roads (and will other times decide to go over water). So you are stuck using one of your cities to nearly constantly build 'road builders' since these units take about as long to build as most actual military units.  The tech tree is short and completed rather quickly. At which point everyone is equal for however long the game lasts. Boring.  City management is cumbersome. There are no build ques. Unlike previous versions you can't simply drag a city 'worker' to the new task. You must lock all the citizens in place except for the only one you want to move. Well now, that makes perfect sense to no one. click on and Lock 20 rather than just click on the one you want to move.  City state is a cute idea done badly. You surround a city state. A rival can send enough envoys to become their 'Suzerain' and the city state will then follow that empire to war. The equivalent of this occurred. Kansas city decided that Taiwan was their most favorite place in the world. For some reason Taiwan declared war on the USA. So Kansas City followed their lead. They send out half a dozen spearmen to face down the american tanks. Sending envoys leads to that city state granting your civilization their magic power, um ok??  Naval power is a joke. Most of the ships of previous games have been removed. Even cargo ships are non-existent since just moving a unit in to the water turns them in to a transport ship.  Air power is poorly and awkwardly done as well. Even the AI seems to know it since I played to 2096 and never did see an enemy plane.  Military power in general is going to disappoint. If you play to for a domination victory you'll hate this the most of all. The AI uses no logic at all. Units are just randomly sent your direction. A few 'artillery' units, but not escorted. Unit combat strength make no sense. APC's can destroy a max-tech tank. A tank can attack and destroy a helicopter, so even the old rock-paper-scissors part of the old combat logic is broken. Cavemen damage tanks with their sticks. There are game imbalancing things which can not be undone. For example, one AI had a tank 'base' strength of 107. While in my case they had a base strength of 90. I compared policies, government bonuses, religions and so forth. So far as I can tell I had all the stuff which gives you a bonus and he had none. It was not one unit which happened to be high level, but all this units had a 17 point 'head start' within nothing in the game giving it to him. This 17 point head start translates in to needing a 3:1 advantage in number to prevail. Not impossible, but given the way units work in game (limited stack possibilities, 1 unit per tile) it was vexing. The only thing equalizer was the AI's lack of tactics or logic beyond drive our stuff towards the nearest city in an unorganized mob.  The game over all feels half-baked (as in they took it out of the oven before it was done). The nations and leaders bonuses and such are not at all equal. I doubt much attention was payed to game balancing. The load times, turn lengths, responsiveness are all bad. Even on very high end computers. Scrolling the map up to move a unit, for example, is very time consuming as it is hit or miss if the map will scroll at all.  There are more issues, but for me these are the high-lights. Your love/hate of the game will depend on how much control you want (the more you want, the less you'll like this game). If you have played and enjoyed the previous versions (other than 5), this may well impact your ability to enjoy this one. If you like a 'war' game this one will drive you nuts. ",

            "review_text": "- Pro Con list down below -   I've played Civ5 over 600 hours, skipped the dud that was CIV BE and came back to this with dripping wet panties - and it satisfied all the hopes I had for it.  It can be said, without restriction, that Civ6 picks up where Civ5 + DLCs left off, took the good things and made them greater, and took the things that weren't as desirable (AI diplomacy was straight up bullsh*t, pardon my french) and improved them by lengths.   Having read several complaints that the AI is crap in diplomacy, I cannot confirm that. It's less random and more predictable, if anything else.   What Firaxis couldn't improve on, was the crappy Battle AI. Going to war with any AI is simply too easy, and sometimes just annoying, like swatting at flies that sit on your face on a hot day.   Speaking of war, the warmongering mechanic is perhaps the single most annoying thing in Civ6. It doesn't seem to disappear, so you'll be marked a warmonger forever and ever, even if the year is 2025 and you razed a few cities back in the ancient era. If there is a way to reduce warmongering, please feel free to notify me - because I havent figured out how.  Which brings me to another thing: the new big additions, like the city districts are explained well - but all the other little changes? They're just there, leaving you to sink and swim. It took me forever to find the WMDs I had produced, I was utterly confused as to where the citizen management went, and for the love of christ almighty where do I delete buildings I have built ? Nowhere? What? Really? Damn.   Conclusion: While the game came out strong and blew me off my feet, there is undoubtedly a lot of little issues that dull the shiny, glorious achievement that is this game. Having said that, this game is not unplayable! Quite the opposite - it's excellent regarding game play and flow. It simply has occasional hiccups, that should be fixed with coming patches.   Pros: - Better diplomacy (Agendas make the AI more readable) - Very nice graphical overhaul.  - District Tiles are very cool addition. - Espionage is devious - spawn partisans, blow up districts, steal art, tech and gold! - Civics allow a very varied play style   Cons: - Agendas are a bit stale - there are two per NPC and they remain the same throughout the game.  - UI is just a bit too cluttered and unintuitive at times (I'm looking at you, damn x button) - Some bugs force you to reload the last save (sometimes the 'unit requires orders' button wont disappear after you've given the unit an order. It doesnt break the game, but it's annoying. Happened 3 times in 26 hours of game time so far). - The warmongering mechanic is frustrating (Ghandi denounces me for my warmongering 200 years ago - you need to let it go, pal.) - some new mechanics are not well explained (I played 'Find the WMD!' for 10 minutes until I finally realized you need to manually load them to a sub or silo.

Highlights:  Looks great City Management / districts Civic tree Builder mechanics Lack of global happiness meter Spy Mechanics   Lowlights: Lack of content..  the whole game feels brief. The tech tree is small. Smaller than civ 5 I wager. Definitely nothing new in there, I got to ‘future tech’ very easily. Very little in terms of new stuff to do other than the district thing and the spies. Feels like a missed opportunity. Still missing basic functionality from old Civ games. Power plants, pollution, railroads, tech beyond stealth fighters. The only new units are unique units. For 6 years and 80 dollars it falls short IMO. Perhaps they have 2 or 3 huge expensive expansions planned as per usual, but still, do we need to wait another 3 years and another 100 bucks to get the full experience.    I think the Civ franchise is ripe for being surpassed. Just like City Skylines is now the defacto city builder after the much anticipated 2013 Sim City came out with a yawn. Too bad   Conclusion It’s a good game, would play it over civ 5, but still a letdown. 4+ player multiplayer sync bug is still a problem.",

Nor is it Civ IV  I've played 1 game so far. I played as America (♥♥♥♥ yeah) on Prince and went for science.   It was by far, the easiest game of Civ I have ever played.  The AI didn't do jack to stop me the whole game. I was neighbors with Gilgamesh. I was expecting a warmongering, domination focussed Civ like Sumeria to give me problems.   Nope, they immediately befriended me for no reason. They had more gold, more units, more science output. It was ridiculous, yet they basically just jerked me off the whole game, giving me gold for Ameneties that they had in their own empire.   China must have denounced me every 5 turns, yet I never went to war with them.  Hell, I never went to war with anyone.  At one point, I had researched more tech's then Gilgamesh despite him having a 20+ lead on science output. I realized that the AI doesn't go for boosts. Like, ever. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Eventually I surpassed him and was maybe 2 era's ahead of everyone. They all hated me for building tall, having a lot of wonders, being BFF's with every city-state and not being religious. Yet they never did ♥♥♥♥ to stop me.  I felt like I was playing a solo game. I just built districts that helped me make more money, to fuel my production to fuel my science to have me win a pretty boring victory.  When I won in Civ V, I felt proud. I watched Civilizations fall to eachother. Cities traded hands, the sites of my ancient battles became ruins for me to excavate later, I made trade deals and alliances. I felt like I actually won.  In Civ VI, I fought no units except barbarians. The only indication that I was progressing was the tech tree, and Sean Bean's silky smooth voice reading me more quotes. It felt empty.  It doesn't help that the options are lacking and the UI looks like it's from a mobile game.  It looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful and it honestly play beautiful. The districts and amenities and Civics are awesome, but the AI is so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid that it just detracts from it all.  If you're a diehard Civ fan, get it. It's not bad, but it's not Civ V with the expansions. ♥♥♥♥, it's not Civ V at launch.   I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet because I have no friends and my dad beats me.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Most fresh and exciting game in the civilization series, a worthy addition that will stand the test of time!  As someone who put many huindreds of hours (not a figure of speech) into Civ games, I was really excited when Civ 6 got announced. As many others, I got disappointed by the cartoony art style, but as details on gameplay started to be revealed, I started getting hyped. And sure enough, I fell in love with Civ 5 after my first game. I got used to the art style so fast, and the game is fresh and well-made..well, I guess this is my life now!   This review is meant to discuss all the new additions in Civ 6 over the previous games in the series, especially Civ 5. If you haven't played Civilization before then what on earth are you waiting for? Buy it now!  Things done better than before:  - Districts: This is probably the biggest departure from previous civ games. Forces meticulous planning ahead and city specialization more than ever.  - Civics: Having a civics tree that runs on culture parallel to the science tech tree? Unlocking governments and policies that can totally change the game and give more customization options that ever before? The ability to plan around civics completion time s and inspirations and when a specific bonus is needed at which time? Yes please!  - Boost and Inspirations: Civilizaiton is now less tedious and more dynamic than ever..you will ALWAYS be looking to achieve those conditions that boost your science and civics, trying to plan ahead and use what you got, even switching at times a tech or a civic half way to save it for the boost, and you will have to decide when you really need to rush this tech or civic now and can't relaly wait for the boost.  - Religious victory: That's how I won my first game! It's a new rutheless type of war, building on the religion system from civ 5, but adding a much more hectic and fast paced race..suffice to say your religion can actually get erased from the world if you're not tenacious enough! And religious units can fight each other with bolts of lightning (sound rediculous for civ but it's glorious in action, trust me!)  There are many other new mechanics, but I think I mentioned the most game-changing ones, as well as the ones that really left an impact on my soul!   Things that need to improve:  - Civilopedia: The most negative thing I've encountered so far. I've consulted the civilopedia dozens of times i-game, and not a single time (no exaggeration) did I find the piece of info I was looking for. More than often the keyword I was searching for did not turn any result, and when it did, the info I found were so brief and vague that I didn't find the specific thing I was looking for.  - UI: the UI is not bad by any means but still needs some polish IMO. Things like city production turns not updating on the same turn, no Alert (fortify until enemy in range) function for units, no option to turn off auto-siwtching for units, and limited hotkeys selection..and a lot more tiny quality of life sutff that needs some extra polish.  - Diplomacy: The bane of civ games. I still face the same problems as before. I actually now feel it's much harder now to please other civs than before. I know you're not meant to be able to please them all, but even pleasing one is difficult.. guess having 2 agendas for every leader that can immensly affect their opinions, as well as the factors of government and religions and others, make it very unlikely to have more positive than negative stuff with any civ..I have no idea how this can be improved, but it really does need improving.  That's it for now! I may edit and update this review later as I play more games. Now go stand the test of time!",

And it sucks because you will invest 10 hours into a game, have every AI declar war on you with stone slingers, and then you win. It's then that you realize all of that time you spent on economy/religion/millitary/culture strategy, map scouting/planning, science &amp; civic allocation and resource management was a waste of time. You just need to hang out until every AI irrationally declares war on you with a sea of shirtless men carrying stone axes. And then you win.  And the bugs, whooo boy the bugs. This does genuinely feel like a beta.  At the time of this review I've played 22.5 hours, and will probably play a couple more games. This might seem hypocritical, but my weekend was scoped out to include thanksgiving leftovers, Civilization 6 and never wearing pants. And by God I will continue to do at least 2 of those things.  Finally, let's all be clear going forward. These people better not release any paid DLC until the base game progresses past beta. If I HEAR EVEN a mouse fart of paid dlc before addressing all of the nonsense in the base game, I will forever be done with Civilization. I don't give a wild donkey's general stomach irration bowel syndrome if you have something in the works for future content. Don't even discuss it.

I'm not sure if it is just me, but there are the main musical pieces that play through the game, and then there are variations of those same pieces depending on some factor. I'm not sure if this is if you are at war or depending on what era you are in, but it changes and it is very cool. The characters and interacting with other civilizations is very nice. When in a character screen, the music changes to that specific civ and you can hear the little claps of Pedro IIs shoes on the ground as he walks around if he is mad at you. You can hear the *clinks* of his necklace. You can hear the fan of Elizabeth as she gets nervous over war. All of this makes the civilization's leader feel alive and much better than what pictures make the new cartoon look out to be. I have seen people complain about wonders and districts and how they take up room now, but I personally like this feature. It focuses more on strategic placement of districts and the impact on situations from this placement. The cities look really good with a lot of districts and wonders. You feel more personal about your city because of this. Every time a wonder is built by you it does a cinematic view of the wonder and it feels accomplishing. There are a whole lot of new mechanics that make the game a lot better excluding the little things that I discussed above. There is constant visual feedback on your relationship with other civs which is huge as it influences your decisions more than I would think it would. The strategic view is better and could be nice for others. Personally, in Civ V, I thought the strategic view was useless and annoying but in civ 6 it is much better. I have seen complaints about the UI and I did not like it at first but got used to it and actually enjoy it now. The only thing that I would like to see is a border growth timer, as I do not think there is one as of now without doing math. I can see how people would be confused and annoyed by the UI at first. I like the difference in happiness mechanics.  There are a lot of other things I could talk about that make me really enjoy this game. If you really like the civ franchise and you are, of course, willing to see change, then this game is a great buy.  THE MAIN ISSUE I SEE IN OTHER REVIEWS:  The AI seems to be the reason that everyone is not liking this game. That means that if you are not interested in AI and have enough people for an enjoyable game through multiplayer, the game is amazing. As for me, the AI are angry as people have been saying but that is because I am partly playing domination and that is my goal. There are civilizations in my game that I am not being aggressive towards so diplomatically I am happy with them and they are happy with me. I do not see the AI as too easy or not a threat. They have specific criteria that is learned. Sometimes you make promises to them, such as moving troops off of their borders. This could have been unintentional, so you could move them and they will later thank you for keeping the promise.  A lot of people have been complaining about districts and their space. Here are some points that i have seen:  -Cannot remove districts Removing districts? So pick up a huge chunk of your city and just move it somewhere else. This doesn't make sense and it promotes mistakes and lack of city planning. -Takes up a tile I see this as a neat benefit that adds a different strategic aspect of the game, like the Military district acts as a sort of fort to protect units and as another range city attack with walls. The game takes a little time to understand a lot of the concepts and some people will not like that.  I do agree that the AI need to be worked on. If it is a huge deal, don't get the game, but you can still have a lot of fun with flaws in the game. I am having lots of fun and I see myself doing so for a very long time.",

Actually, I like most of the changes from Civ5 to the new Civ6 game.   The Good  Religion really seems to be a major benefit rather than an add on. Causius Belli (Reason for War) really makes the warmonger penalty make sense. Separation of Civics and Tech works very well. Eureka moments really help make Tech and Civics that work for you. Builder units make sense, and the Trade units build sensible roads. Religious combat (yes, that's a thing) is hilarious. Global happiness is long gone. Please stay dead forever. World Leader animations are charming.  The Bad  The AI. It's just as awful as it was in Civ5, no matter what you read. The unit diversity has been severly simplified, to the point that battles simply become rock-paper-scissors. The neverending barbarians - see below. Critical info is usually buried in some out-of-the-way location, particularly with cities.  The Unplayably Ugly  The new districts feature is an *almost* well-thought out idea. I like the notion of a city 'unstacking' and needing to place little districts around to replresent certain specialisations. The problem comes in the implementation. In the mid-game, all my cities were simply building districts. Not trying new units, not exploring the map, not beating up weaker civs, all I could do was build new districts (because they cost a mountain of production) and move on to the next. The problem was I was doing 'well' and had a number of Great People who produce Great Works, and like in Civ5, Great Works need specific buildings to house them. Unlike Civ5, these buildings required a district to build them, and then the new district required a higher city population to build them, which required a different district to add housing, which cause Amenities (local happiness) to run low, which required a different district to improve, which with so much building to do required an Industrial District.... you get the idea. As written, they're just too labour intensive to use properly.  Speaking of labour intensive.... the automated citizen management for the cities is absolutely terrible. You have to micromanage your citizens from the dawn of time or your citizens will ignore massive gains to work barren tundrid tiles. On top of that, the city info displays are absolutely lackluster. In Civ5 they were piled with too much info, now they're so nuanced it's easy to overlook important details.  The AI. Why oh why? Still will walk a settler right beside your capitol city and found a new one, and act shocked when you declare war, which makes you an unforgivable warmonger for the next 6000 years and all the other AI opponents hate you forever and ever. Especially if you raze it because it was built in an awkward terrible place. Still randomly asks for free stuff for dubious benefit. Still goes cliquey for whatever reason.  As far as the barbarians go... it's strange. In this iteration of Civ, cities are more prominent, but also fewer in number. Especially given the production costs of districts, it's very unlikely you'll go spraying settlers around the map making cities everywhere. This means large segments of the map are and will forever be unwatched, causing barbarians to plague you till the end of time. They're quite dangerous in the early game, but quickly become a nuisance.  Conclusion  Civ6 is an intellectually interesting game, but I can't really call it a fun game, as it gets so mired in district building that there's little else to do (except ignore them entirely and just go kill everyone). I think a few tweaks on balance can probably sort that out, but that still leaves the laughably inept AI and very short unit list, which would are pretty big problems too. I have no doubts that with some polish and some hefty patches they can make this a proper Civ game, but whether 2k will remains to be seen.  'Do You Recommend This Game?'  ... ... ... ...no. I think as the sixth game in the series, it's right to be disappointed that the new systems don't work very well, and the changes that do work were to fix what didn't work in Civ5. I think if you have *never* played any Civ game before, Civ6 is probably the best place to start, but this is the sixth game in the series - getting brand new players in who haven't played the franchise before will be rare.   I really wanted to like this game, but I'll be playing it again when the next major revision comes out.",

I have played 4 different games, 3 of which are no longer playable due to crashes (I am not 100% sure what causes the crashes, but I have tried to salvage the games by going back 10 autosaves and replaying the game from there, sometimes it works but in 3 of the games I have started it got to a point it didnt work, so I had more than 3 crashes in those 3 games but some I was able to get past)  The AI is dispicably bad. I am on the 2nd hardest level in my last two files, and it is so easy. The cpu never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever attacks other factions and gets to the point that they steal a capital. In all 4 games I have played, only I had ever stolen a capital city from another civilization. That is just absurd. On my newest file (which just crashed, I havent tried to play it since the crash, I may not try, so it may not be a lost game) I set it up to where only domination wins the game, there is no set time frame so the game has no last turn, just runs til someone has every city, and I made every civilization active so there is 19 leaders (19 plus 1 for me? I think it is 18 and me though) on the largest map, which still everything is super clustered up. Cool things are tightly packed, surely they will fight each other.. Nahhhhh, several wars break out and not one capital has been lost let alone a single city. (outside of the ones I have stolen obv)  You wanna beat this game on the hardest level? Start game - destroy two civs in the middle of the game somewhere or before - just make sure they have 3-5 cities when you destroy them. Build nothing but campuses, theatres and either industry districts or market districts. Dont build hardly any troops, they arent needed...... No one is coming for you........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Click next turn as fast as you can after you do your productions and research, now since you have a couple different civs cities, you are producing more science and culture than the others.... You win the game, since no one comes after you....  Civ 6.... A smart looking game to make dumb people feel smart. This game is painfully easy thanks to the AI being painfully bad.",

Civ6's city planning is a revolutionary design that allows players to have more thoughts on how to maximize cities' efficiencies and define a particular city's role (Ex.Industrial cities) at a country. Different districts and wonders that are shown in a city absolutely make big cities a lot more prosperous than those in civ 5.   Furthermore, Architecture's styles are different between countries, even countries that have simillar cultures like China and Japan have their unique styles, whereas Civ 5 has a lot less diversities between countries.  One sad thing about Civ 6 is that demographics seem to include a lot less details that Civ5. I hope that they can have a more detailed one, their AIs also need a lot of improvements.",

Civilization has been one of my favorite game series over the years and this one has really disappointed, mostly due to new additions being over hyped or for that matter utterly broken. Faulty diplomatic relations result in denouncing before given a chance to fulfill the AI's agenda, or even being denounced even when their agenda is being met. There's the new 'every game pick the same civic cards' system. While fun at first, after the second game I had every card preselected from previous games. I could see if one was at war at anyone point this could deviate, but for most situations there were obviously better cards for most situations and even play styles. Religious victory also bothered me. While I know you can turn it off, there was one game where I did not pursue it and left it on in which pretty much medieval era forward I was swarmed with religious units left and right, taking up a large chunk of my territory. While I never let the AI fully convert all my cities, it was so annoying having this happens all game. While I could go on and on about different faults, and while there were some ideas that were beneficial to the game, I can't recommend the game in its current form.  I will say that most vanilla versions of these games are typically horrible, so I can't say I'm not surprised, but this one will need a ton of fixing up before I consider buying the next expansion.",

There are plenty of other reviews detailing the horrible state in which this game was released ... moronic AI, numerous UI bugs, lack of information given to the player, and the game is in serious need for a balance overhaul. Although the game is playable, it just isn't fun with all these flaws.   The lack of any information from the devs is dissapointing as well. I know from past Civ games that there tends to be large patches after a month or two instead of multiple small patches, but it would at least be nice to have the developers acknowledge the issues and give us an idea on what they are working on first. Frankly, this game has so many issues I feel they should focus on some smaller, quicker patches first rather than a larger patch that may well break other elements of the game.  I'll change my review when they fix it. Until then I've shelved the game.  Update: After two patches I still cannot recommend this game, and I'm really starting to lose faith in Firaxis. It took them two patches to add something as basic as a unit alert button. When a city production is finished the item it lists as 'last finished' is actually the item before the item was last finished. The game will still freeze sometimes when exiting. The AI is still horrible. There is still a horrible lack of information (without mods); for example you are not informed when a trade deal with another civ ends, or what trade deals you have active with another civ. The trade menu cannot be sorted in any way. The list just goes on and on. There is so much potential in this game, but it still needs a LOT of work.  At this rate, I'd recommend waiting for at least another two patches, which at the current rate will be about 6 months from now.",

I love IV, V, and BE and they took everything that was great about those games and tossed it and you're left with this hollow, convoluted mess.

Units can't move if their movement point is less than the movement cost of the terrain, which results in a tedious slog of chasing a barbarian scout across the map. And what's more tedious is how district production costs go up really quickly based on the number of cities and districts you have, resulting in yet again another midgame tedium of pressing next turn constantly.   However, this time, the early game has some fun tedium too with barbarian outposts spawning constantly in a fog of war. So you better spend some of your early game building scouts to get vision everywhere around your city or an outpost will literally spawn near your city and start spamming at least 6 Spearmen and Horsemen at you in 10 turns.  To compound to this tedium are housing and amenities. Housing is just a specific resource that you get that increases the upper limit of the city's population. Go higher than the amount of housing and your population growth will slow down. Amenities is just happiness, except that instead of empire-wide happiness, it's local happiness instead. And each unique luxury will give 1 amenity to 4 cities. You need 1 amenity per 2 population. And you will run out of amenities quickly, and if you dare reach -2 amenities, your city will start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about rebel military units of the highest tech available. And guess what, THERE'S NO WAY TO LIMIT POPULATION GROWTH. THEY REMOVED IT FOR NO REASON.  The worst offender is the UI. Tiny texts, large empty spaces, scroll bars, no unique icons for policies or great people, tiny icons for wonders and buildings. The city amenities menu is just filled up with the word 'amenities' repeated. The city reports menu HAS NO SORTING FOR SPECIFIC YIELDS OR UPKEEP OR AMENITIES. Why would they remove that? Especially since cities need to specialize,   Oh, and as a cherry on top, AI civs will constantly flip out at you because of their agendas. Cleopatra hates weak military and it's turn 10 and you aren't building warriors constantly? DENOUNCED. Germany hates city states and you send an envoy to one? DENOUNCED. They go from friendly or neutral to instantly hating your guts in an instant and waste 12 seconds stating it dramatically.

So I've watched the entire series progress. 2 was better than 1, 3 was better than 2, 4 was better than 3.... then the progress went in entirely the wrong direction. 5 had some interesting features, I loved the hexagonal map. The game is much prettier than the ones before. But it lost something. It wasn't a wargame any longer, it was... well it was something else.  And whatever that else is, Civlization VI is even more of that. That's not to say there aren't some things I love about Civ VI. The technology tree, the civics system, the governments panel, the way great people are now born, those things are genius. And seriously add some depth to the game in ways it didn't have before.   But it's clearly been dumbed down to be a console game. Where is the sentry command?  Here is something I found personally outrageous. When you put scouts on automatic explore, they stop each time they see a hostile unit and look for your input. But when I put my warrior on fortify, a barbarian slinger came into my city and beat the unholy crap out of him while he just sat there enjoying the free rocks to the head. ??? WTF? Why is it that one type of unit can recognize danger (it actually says danger on the move screen when you're summoned to deal with your terrified scout) but all others just sit there like idiots? I had the game set to auto end turns, so if my city hadn't produced something that needed my attention the warrior would have died of his free rocks to the head overdose.   That's just stupid. This problem could be solved with one command that EVERY other version of Civ had, but this one lacks. Sentry. WT unholy F, Sid Meier. I'm seriously disappointed in your for this one unbelievably stupid change alone.  Is this a great game? Absolutely, and if you're looking for a dumbed down pseudo-wargame, you should buy it. And you will have war, because the moronic AI of the other nations attacks you every time you turn around pretty much regardless of you standings, your previous relationship with them, or anything else for that matter. Then they'll zerg you with whatever unit they like the most, even from across the entire HUGE map. Scythia sent about a dozen horsemen after me, and they literally took 50 turns to get to me from the time the war was declared. I, being unprepared, went down in flames. Spearmen don't seem to have any increased effect against horses at all, as they have in previous iterations.   If you want to play the game I mentioned above, then yeah, I do recommend this game. the videos at the top of the store page for this game tell you exactly what the game play is like, other than the lack of features like SENTRY (durrrrr), rally points, etc.   If you want to play the best Civilization has ever been, do this: Buy Civ IV and all the expansions (it's cheap) and then go to  www.civfanatics.com  and get the mod for the game called Caveman to Cosmos. That mod makes Civ into something beyond anything Sid Meier could ever dream of. Another good one is Fall from Heaven.   So I don't recommend spending $60, or the $80 I spent for this game. Wait until it's $20. It's worth $20.   Now that I have it, I'll probably still play it some, but mostly I'll wait for the modders on here to make this game not suck in the way that PC games shouldn't suck. Add in a sentry command. Add in rally points. More diverse units. Twink the AI so it doesn't act like Hannibal Lecter no matter which leader it is.   For Pete's sake, Sid, I thought you were better than this.

Well just because - Districts are a pointless waste of time. You won't notice them on the cluttered map. You won't understand what they do (you can have citizens work them but good luck trying to work out what that achieves). On your deploy citizens map IT WON'T EVEN TELL YOU WHICH ONE IS WHICH (seriously you either guess or exit the menu to main menu and wait for a pop up on the main map) - Sean Bean was a bad choice but his voice overs are so lacklustre you'll end up hating him - Music and sounds are almost non existent - get used to hearing endless repeats of Scarborough Fair  - The camera jumps you around so that you do what the game wants you to do like a boring series of 'to do' lists. There is no strategy. By the end of the turn you can look around a bit if you want but don't try to actually do things in the order you want or you'll accidentally give a stupid move or build order - Religion is just an irritation - Combat is dictated by the PC as it tells you which unit to order and when. Also get used to not knowing why your artillery can't fire  I won my first playthrough. It's not tricky. What they've done is take away tool tips and insert as many irritating mechanics as possible.  And that leaves BARBARIANS. This is basically Civ 6:Barbarians. They are a constant irritation (and I mean constant). Thought your super Empire could focus on external threats? Think again. If you leave JUST ONE hex uncovered the Barbarians will spawn there, every few turns, forever. If you have a City State inside your borders then EVEN IF you can see ever hex, Barbarians will spawn there, forever. Not difficult, but irritating and likely to mess up your trade caravans.

The more difficult AI settings do not make the AIs better at the game, they just cheat. So even though you can SEE that an enemy does not have much, he somehow has more gold/production than you. Thus your only way to victory will be war, no matter how good you play.  That in itself annoys me, but might not be a problem for everyone. However, the AIs are also extremely bad at waging war. They will throw their units away (if they even use them) without achieving anything, then beg for peace. Not only does that make wars boring, it also means that wars between AI players rarely change anything. So again, you cannot win while only dealing with your neighbors. The AI also does not upgrade its units.  I learned in Civ5 how to repel any number of AI units with just a few units - it still applies here, five years later.",

I am also anoyed that there was no Linux version on the DVD nor on-line to download as the game had been widely advertised as having a linux native binary during run-up to release.  Quibs asside I eventually gave in and did a windows install to play the game. Having now played a 500 turn game and some smaller skirmishes I am left feeling like there is a lot of work for improvement and depth. It feels much like Civ 5 but it doesn't have the Workshop editor, so basically this ommision of any DLC/workshop content creation path and no Linux native binary would very squarely leave me recomending anyone new to the franchise instead invest in Civ 5 which offers basically the same play experience but with more expansive options for creating your own story and content.",

            "review_text": "CIV VI includes a lot more features compared to Civ V base game (e.g. espionage and faith only included in Civ V expansions) and overall does seem more fun than Civ V vanilla. The mid to end game is not as boring compared to Civ V, but there's still some slowdown. Civ VI makes you plan and think more strategically instead of just following one strategy in every game (e.g. you don't build the same buildings and units in all your cities and you don't follow the same tech tree path route every single game) making replayability a lot more fun.  I think the changes made in Civ VI are in a good direction, all the changes are intended to make you think and plan more strategically and they really fleshed out some of the previously weaker parts of the game (e.g. the faith overhaul in Civ VI is amazing, and science victory now have milestones instead of just stacking great scientists), and hopefully there will be more polish as the game gets patched/new expansions. Also, in Civ V you're nearly always going to play tall if you want to play optimally and roll with only ~4 cities, but in Civ VI because of global happiness being removed you can pretty much play wide and build as many cities as you want, it's a lot more fun to have the choice to play wide and have more cities to manage, than just looking over 4 cities all game.  So overall I would definitely recommend to buy this over Civ V (the music and graphical update themselves are worth it - game looks and sound gorgeous).   I do have some gripes about the game, I guess the launch was a little rushed as most of the problems could easily be fixed if they polished the game more and did some more QA, from their past records they seem to do a good job at patching and polishing games after launch, I don't think any Civ base game launch has been polished enough at launch but they end up able to address most issues after multiple expansions. However, in retrospective, this launch is a lot better compared to Civ V vanilla launch as that game was pretty terrible without all the expansions that were released after launch.  -UI needs major update, missing crucial information and very cluttered.  -Fog of war graphical update is very messy visually, hard to differentiate things.  -Some broken strats like selling units for gold using certain civs  -AI acts a little weird sometimes, like the civ being in modern era but still having tons of warrior units  - they removed a LOT of keyboard shortcuts that were in the game for no seemingly apparent reason. RIP keyboard shortcuts that have been in the game since Civ II... No 'H' to set units to fortify until heal, all builder improvements keyboard shortcut removed like 'I' for farms... the list goes on.  - removed some quality of life improvements in Civ V like cannot set unit to alert mode (fortify and wake up upon seeing an enemy).. having to micromanage every unit by hand is very annoying, unit cycling itself seems a little wonky compared to Civ V as well.  - The horse barbarian camp is so much more op than all the other barbarian camps, seems a little strange.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR: Wait for mods. Wait for patches. Wait for more honest reviews.   I've put hundreds of hours into Civilization 5. It's probably my favorite game of all time. Needless to say I was pretty amped about Civilization 6 but after getting through a few games I just don't think it's ready for prime time.   - The UI is atrocious. It's probably the worst I've ever seen in a game and that's saying something. Forget getting through the mid to late game in any reasonable length of time because of the 'gossip' pop-ups taking up the entire screen through every turn. I really do not care that Frederick cleared out a barbarian camp on the other side of the map with a musketman. It means absolutely nothing to me.   - The agendas mechanism is laughably broken. For example: Found a religion with Kongo in your game and you will be called out or denounced for not spreading it to him within 1-2 turns. He then continues to taunt you until you do. Because the AI is creating more faith than what's possible they will apostle rush him and convert him to another religion at which point Kongo starts yelling at you again.   Another example: Rome likes countries that have a lot of cities and land. They're your neighbor so you build more because the game doesn't really punish wide empires as much as it did in Civ 5. Suddenly he loves you. Then the next turn he's complaining you're putting down cities too close to him and your troops are at his border even though they haven't left yours. Next turn he wants to be friends. The turn after that he declares war. Ok?  - As I mentioned before religion is broken with the AI, so they will spam Apostles and missionaries faster than you can put them out. I had a game with religious faith generation and I couldn't keep up with any other civ. I would convert a bunch of cities and within 1-3 turns they were all converted back to the opposing religion. They'll rush 10 apostles to get this done.   - The districts are a neat idea, but even in 'online' speed the build times for many things are outrageous. The further into the tech tree you get the more production is required to get things up and running. In civ 5 there was a curve for some things (policies cost more with more cities, you need to build libraries to get oxford etc) but it's really steep here.   - The civilopedia has next to no information in it. Want to figure out how corps work? Good luck with that because you can't search for it.   - Give me black fog of war please.   This game has a lot of potential but what I just listed are a few examples of the many issues this game has. I suppose you can fault me for wishing it was more like civ 5, but it seems like they tacked on a host of new features without giving them much thought. Civilization 6 wants to be civilization 5, but like some rebel teenager it feels to be different without thinking about WHY the difference is better.   ",

            "review_text": "The game and its user interface are less complete than what I'd expect from a game going into release. As a programmer myself, I feel that I might have some special insight into this.  Starting with some of the higher impact ones: - It's harder to win in this civ. But that's most likely due to the fact, that my game crashes consistently on turn 220 in one specific save. - The game usually crashes on exit. - The AI relations seem to work somewhat awkwardly. Basically everyone's at war with everyone going into the 1900's at the latest. - The wartime unit control AI is inefficient. Although I wouldn't be as harsh, a fellow community member put it like this: 'I think Firaxis let the let the inexperienced interns build it'. - Ships can sometimes pathfind on land without any 'tyres for boats' tech whatsoever, even with full vision of the area in question. - Continents used to be my favorite map. This new terrain generator, however, is very 'sterile' in the sense that when it generates continents, there's never any imperfections like coastal islands. It's just a fixed amount of very large continents. Once you know where all the big continents are, there's no use exploring the oceans.  And some little things specific to one of my domain expertises, the user interface: - The pathfinding algorithm and the movement commands do sometimes not match. The unit doesn't follow it's pathfind guide. - Adding labels into the map is really useful in district planning. Unfortunately, deleting a label, followed by adding a new label causes the text of the new label to overwrite the one that was written earlier, while the new label remains empty. This is an example of something that's called an off-by-one mistake. It's often easy to correct, provided that it's actually found. - Any UI element that spawns underneath the cursor is unclickable until the user moves the cursor away from it and then back onto it. - Some of the state-machines for the UI-elements are broken. An example would be that an element cannot be activated until it's deactivated once before again trying to activate it. - Another instance of an off-by-one error is, when a city finishes building something and the related element doesn't show the building that was built, but the one that was built before that. - Switching the construction project for the city sometimes loses one element from the buildings list, and it's not the one that you just started constructing. In these cases, there's a building element in that list with graphics that seem to be cut off from the bottom. This is likely an off-by-one mistake as well. - It's impossible to switch from constructing a single unit to constructing an army, without selecting another construction project in between. - The complete information about what a wonder does, is not always available in the button to construct that wonder. - After a construction project has begun, it's impossible to find out what that building does without visiting the civilopedia.  That said, I do appreciate many of the game design choices made while going for this implementation of the franchise. Especially the combat mechanics, and the requirement for having to actually think a lot about where to build each district. Unfortunately I'll have to set the game aside for at least a few months, due to some of the larger issues affecting playability with the current release.",

I'll get into the good stuff, but I gotta rant a bit about this first. Every civ has an agenda, which is basically something he values, and will get mad about when other civs do said thing. The thing is in a game with multiple civs there is no physical way to avoid these agendas unless you sit in your capital and punch rocks all game, (but even that will make Rome mad because Rome doesn't like small civs). The end result is everyone hates each other and war happens every 12 seconds.  In civ 5 I had this problem, I accidentally became friends with everyone and had no justification to use my massive army I built up because I'm not a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who attacks his allies. Oh boy how that's changed.  If you build a wonder, China hates you.  If you get a great person, Brazil hates you.  If you found a religion, Arabia will hate you.  If you don't like Sumeria's friends, Sumeria will hate you (but that one's OK because Gilgamesh is a ♥♥♥♥ and has no friends).  One time I actually managed to become friends with my boy Pericles, I intentionally didnt touch any city-states because it would make him mad. We were best buds, we traded gold and resources for years, had an alliance, it was great... PLOT TWIST, PERICLES HAS A HIDDEN AGENDA THAT SAYS HE HATES PEOPLE WITH UNHAPPY CITIZENS. MY CITIZENS ARE MISERABLE BECAUSE JAPAN JUST INVADED ME, PERICLES DENOUNCES, RELATIONS BREAK DOWN, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!!  Yeah you can't have friends. Also people keep asking me for free resources even though they hate me and I hate them. Their battle game is weak AF, they just ditz around with donkey carts *cough* Gilgamesh *cough* until you kill them all, and if their units take even the slightest amount of damage they refuse to let it attack anything because it might die, and then it dies anyway because it's been ditzing around within range of my cannons this whole time.   K it's time for the good stuff, the stuff that makes this game worth the buy.  Graphics: Some people don't like the cartooney graphics, but I personally love them. Everything is animated and beautiful, theres a day-night cycle, you get to watch a time lapse of your wonder building when it finishes, its great.  Music: The music is awesome, the medieval themes are the best tho.  Espionage: Spies are more in depth, they target specific districts and can steal great works, steal money, steal techs, perform terrorism on innocent civilians, good stuff. Oh but the AI only ever uses spies to steal your money because they always in debt and are stupid.  Combat: The animations are way better, although I'm kinda annoyed they dropped unit sizes down to 4 dudes from Civ 5's 18 something.  Districts: Cities can now make specialized districts for stuff which is cool.  Gandhi: Our favorite warmongering pacifist makes a return, now almost as creepy at his Civ 3 form. And now his hidden agenda is always nuke happy, which is just great.  Quotes: They put freaking Monty Python and Garrison Keillor quotes in for when you research some of the techs, This alone makes it worth the buy.  Other stuff: I forgot the specifics but overall I've had a lot of fun with this game and do recommend it. Workshop coming soon too, can't wait to nuke Gilgamesh as Billy Mays and the OxiClean Civ.",

(Owned and faithfully played every Civ game since Civ 3, over 500 hours in Civ 5)  Don't you guys dare ask us to pay for DLC without fixing the current state of the game. Fully fix and flesh out the current game, then DLC to add new gameplay features",

Now civ 6 is here ,people have said about the graphics and i respect everyones opinion but wow, so much more alive , your cities actually feel alive , you see every little bit growing from the market stalls to the churches and holy sites , THEY GROW AND EXPAND ,not just one city that you barely see alive like in civ 5 (loved civ 5 but it felt wooden at times) , this game is alive.  The maps are clear and bright(changeable setting) , they show every litle thing even with a modest pc you can have great settings.  The units yes they are chunky but this feels so right , and makes you actually care about your last little warrior as he is pinned in by a horde of raging babarians , Babarians are more violent and lifelike , they send out scouts from their camps as soon as they see your city , they try and run back to ttell the camp which may then attack you, chase them bad boys down before they make it.  Building your city is now not just build every single building , you plan HENCE WHY ITS A STRATEGY GAME , civ 5 was brill but lets be honest you just end up build build build , not here , you plan each city each wonder takes a hex tile, each district(new) takes a tile and you then build ibnside them.I.E build a financial district then inside that build the markets etc..ITS BRILLIANT and takes thought and planning,  THEMUSIC...OMG AMAZING check out on youtube the soundtrack , its brilliant ,each nation has their own distinct music,start in the ancient era and for each civilization its a basic music (england , pipe music etc) and as time progresses through the eras it builds to better more modern music, the opening soundtrack is breathtaking and overall its quality  9/10 only downside i agree is 5 maps is bare (yes more will come for defo) , but a nice 8 to 10 would of been nice.

Unfortunately, the developers of this game decided to tilt the balance massively in favor of micromanagement, to the point where the joy of this game has been sucked out of it. Even the workers, now called 'builders', now must be micromanaged, along with the placement of every wonder and zone. Meanwhile, the horrible graphics--who came with the idea, anyway, of distinguishing between unexplored regions versus regions with no units nearby bu using two different shades of brown?--make it hard to get any kind of strategic overview of the world map. I don't expect the graphics to be earth shattering, but they should be pleasing and useful--and in this game, they are neither.

That pace of this game now is enough to make you want do something else. The idea now of 'Just one more turn' is kinda lost. It's too bloody boring compared to Civ 5.   This game is now incredibly boring and plodding even on 2nd to fastest setting. Things just take too long, I wasn't really able to see roads until around 1600 since there was only like 1 trader and I had to focus on other stuff.. only was able to build about 3 cities to this date. Seriously? This is a snoozefest at this pace.   Just weird thing like seeing a modern day caravan (aka an RV camper) character represent my settlers in the year 1740 and a modern truck represent my trader. Totally kills the feeling of progressing through the ages.  What is the purpose of seeing so many trade routes, but really only the one back to the capital city has any value?   Feel like I can't zoom far enough  One turn a civilization loves me, the next they declare war, on the 2nd to easiest level? This has happened in 3 different play throughs so it's not a coincidence. Super aggressive but also just inconsistent or erradic  The roads, once built, don't even look like roads now, like a thick bluish greyish line. Awful.   When alot of cities are present, from various nationalities, really hard to tell, without turnng filter on on map, which boundaries belong to which.  Cut screen leader stuff happens way way too often to the point of wanting an option to shut them off.  So far, I'm very very disappointed with this game. For me, it's slow plodding confusing mess with graphics that are different but not any better than Civ 5  I love the Civ series, but this is a step backwards in my opinion and &gt;I think&lt; as more people whi have played 3, 4, and 5 play through a few games, they may come to this same conclusion.

Just keep that in mind. Your cities will end up being broken into many different sections or districts as it is known in the game, to get the benifits that they once yielded in past games. That being said, it also applies to the wonders. 3. You may remember that units late game would need to be near support units to survive some attacker, (I.E.

He's no Leonard Nimoy. To be honest I would have preferred it if they had just brought in the same guy who narrated Civ V.     The ludicrous AI from Beyond Earth's awful expansion pack is back in full force. They will frequently get annoyed and declare war on you, and you won't be able to find out what their grievances are aside from 'They are upset because of an unknown reason -14 relationship points'. Diplomacy feels more flat and uninvolved than normal.     Remember how Civilization V had some really bad netcode that made multiplayer incredibly frustrating? Well, that's still present too. We got desychronized 7 times before we had reached turn 100.   I'm not recommending this game to anyone right now. It's not that I don't like the new gameplay; I've been a fan of this series for  20 years  now. I've played through changes before and been fine with them. I even like several of the new ideas this game has. But as it stands? This game just doesn't work on an objective level. Just a few hours in, I stopped playing Friday and haven't been able to bring myself to launch it again.  After turn 95, that friend I was playing with described it as 'About as polished as a rock in the middle of a meadow'. I'm going to go a step further and describe it as ' desperately unfinished '. If you're going to charge CDN$ 105 for the digital deluxe or CDN$ 80 for the normal release, for God's sake, make a product that  works .",

This sucks, and makes the game much less fun. That's my main complaint. Other, lesser complaints:  1. AI take their actions very slowly. Near the end of my game, each turn took a full 2.5 minutes. This is painful, especially when you're just hitting 'End Turn' a few turns in a row. 2. Leaders are not very diverse. Civ 5 had neat weird stuff like Venice, which completely changed the game. In Civ 6, each country has one slightly better building, and one slightly better military unit. Granted, this will likely improve over time with DLC. 3. In order to assign Fixed Teams from Multiplayer, you have to edit config files. Manageable, but sloppy.  I'll give credit where credit is due: there are a lot of good ideas in here. I love Districts, and I love Culture as a parallel research track. I like the new art style (haters gonna hate). But overall, a weak entry to the franchise. Stick with Civ 5 or Endless Legend.",

            "review_text": "This is a thumbs up review, but just barely.  Previous Civs were finely balanced and had a certain elegance about them, despite their complexity. This one, well it's half-baked and unpolished. It feels like a beta. There are gameplay imbalances, minor bugs, UI problems, and despite it's multiple paths to victory, following the path of least resistance narrows down viable choices significantly, to either military conquest or the space race. Many parts of this game are just flat-out frustrating. I've never dropped F-bombs while playing a Civ game before, that is not until I played Civ 6.   It's a good game, but who put Dark Souls in my Civ? This is easily the hardest and most complex Civ by far, and that's saying a lot. Graphics have a washed-out color palette which I don't like, but hey it's Civ I'm not playing it for the graphics.  Some new game mechanics ('housing' and 'appeal' I'm looking at you!) limit the speed of expansion and city growth and just make the game slower and harder, kind of like they limited city growth with Beyond Earth, which as we all know was not a well-received game (WTF why'd you put concepts from that crappy game in Civ 6?!?!).   I'm playing on Prince level which feels harder than King level in Civ V. Other leaders now seem markedly more aggressive and love to play nice then surprise attack (of course some are still pacifists, like Ghandi).  The biggest difficulty spike is with barbarians. I do NOT like the new barbarian system. Yes, I understand once a barbarian scout sees your city they'll send troops after you, so you need to eliminate their camp fast, but if you're unlucky enough to come across multiple camps early on, you're f u u u k t. Even a single camp will send WAAAAY too many troops very quickly, and even at the very beginning of the game they already have spearmen, horsemen, ranged units, etc that you have to fight with warriors, and they'll send up to 4-5 at a time, straight for your cities. Really?! At Prince level?! And then there've been a few games where I didn't see many barbarians at all. Yes there is an option to turn barbarians off, but why only on or off? Why not have an option for different levels of barbarian activity, like you did in the last few Civ games? I actually think some players (the same who love Dark Souls) will like the new barbarian mechanic, but the on/off only, with no in between really sucks.   That's how it is with many parts of Civ 6 - it's more complex than vanilla Civ V, but its customizability has been dumbed-down. You can no longer sculpt gameplay parameters to play the type of game you want to play, because the ability to tweak various gameplay aspects has been stripped.  As far as extra features compared to Civ V (note: I never played Civ V expansions), they throw everything but the kitchen sink at you. Some features are great, others not so much. You have civics with subset features, religion with subset features and a new type of religious 'currency' called faith, culture, city buildings, air/land/sea military and support units, espionage, science, trade routes (which now build your roads), diplomacy, a new feature for your cities called districts, housing (if you don't have enough, your city can't grow, and it's not easy to get more - not a good system please get rid of it!!!), resouce development, tourism, natural wonders, world wonders to build, the list goes on. Whew! If you like deep strategy you definitely have it here! Honestly it might be too much. Too many gameplay mechanics muddies everything up and dilutes the power of certain focused strategies and decisions.  The game seems to move slower than previous Civs. Maybe it's because the extra complexity means I'm spending more time doing more things each turn. But as a result that 'one more turn' feeling goes away after you're empire is big and requires lots of micromanaging. So I have mixed feelings. I think some changes are fantastic and others are really frustrating. I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's still the addicting Civ gameplay, but I STRONGLY recommend you watch some gameplay videos, reviews, etc. before buying this game because it won't appeal to everyone, even many past Civ fans. IMHO Civ is now SO complex and difficult, it's now a 'hardcore fans only' niche type game. If it's your niche, however, you will love it.",

            "review_text": "The point of this game:  CIV 6 focuses heavily on the first X of the 4 X's (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate). The first 70 turns definitely take a lot longer than they used to with far more early threats to you, from barbarians to exploitative AIs who will warrior rush you if they catch even the faintet whiff of weakness. Exploring the land around you eventually leads to holding the space with a moderate sized army - then frantically pumping out settlers to yank as much of the surrounding land as possible before the AI gets it, setting you up for at least one conflict in the next 50 turns.   Here's my way of maximinizing the amount of fun I have with this game:  Bigger maps and more space to expand I find is more fun. On a small map with regular settings I find that I can settle maybe 3-4 cities and then the rest is conquering, which is sort of a bummer. I reccomend playing on at least standard size with low sea levels to increase settleable land. This lengthens the time that the early game takes, which honestly usually ends up being the most fun part. The rest is too easy.   The one, big problem:  The AI is unbelievably stupid. If video game AIs could write civ 6's AI would write youtube comments. Hopefully they fix this. Basically by the time we reach that first conflict we talked about the AI has either neglected gold or science so you're already 2-3 military tech levels ahead of them. Normally they DoW on you forst so you can eat their civ with only a small warmonger penalty and then just run away with the game.   The amount of fun you're going to have with this depends on:  The best predictor of this game is whether you enjoyed past CiV games. If you enjoy economic/other resource management games that's another good sign. I like most of the changes in this game (distrits, wonders, etc.), I just wish I could stop steamrolling the AI effortlessly if I make it past the first 120 turns.  ",

            "review_text": "I wouldn't recommend this game in its current form. It needs some pretty hard tweaking on the numbers for it to be a viable game. Certainly the gameplay of every iteration of the civilization franchise has changed from the previous one, but in this version there are many things that are lacking.  1. The AI. The ai is often incredibly dumb. They couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag. The number of suprise wars is staggering, yet making peace is just as easy. You are constantly inundated with the AI's 'advice' about your country, but soon these screens are annoying as they take up too much time.  2. The production costs. In the game units/buildings/districts take way too long to produce. I'm playing on the 'online' speed (double the speed of the normal game) and it still takes forever. The cost of districts is simply too high, it feels like players need to be focus on hammers/production much more than ever before.  3. The interface is just bad. The mouse over to expand elements is finicky at best and downright frustrating at worst. The game will NOT let you do things out of order easily. When I'm in the middle of waging a war I want to go focus on managing units, not being FORCED to pick science and production for my cities first (and sometimes you are FORCED to deal with certains things at certain times regardless of what you want.) Additionally, the diplomacy screens drone on and on, and even getting to the menu to click through them takes a long time. I LOVED them at first, the animation quality and emotive content was great, but now it's tiring to have to wait so long.  Overall civ 6 feels like a bad move, it seems like they took the idea that a game of civilization should last a long time and turned it up to 11, in a BAD way. Things take way too long, the interface is confusing, there is a conspicuous lack of options to alleviate these minor problems, and the game just feels unpolished. I play games to relax, and I only have a limited amount of free time to play them. It's frustrating when it seems like someone designed a game to take a long time on purpose, not designed an awesome well paced game I want to spend a lot of time playing.",

For a game that was just launched the other day, it plays well. I don't have the best gaming computer, but I can run it close to max regardless. My graphics card is Nvidia 745 compared to the suggested 770. I did turn off anti analyzing and lowered shadow resolution. Neither of which are noticeable. Load times are kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you don't have a solid state drive, but they're tolerable without one. UI makes sense and scales to the screen correctly for the most part. Minor UI glitches here and there (Stuff overlapping each other. Next turn/open close a menu fixes it.) but it's nothing that can't be ignored.   The biggest complaint I can make is how war civs use open borders. It's only war civs that bother me. There's a new feature called districts, you can read about it in the description. Anyways, they are vital for great people and you must have your great person on the tile the district is on to use it. AI civs love to sit on important tiles forever. Even if they're your ally they will sit there. It's not that the AI is trying to hurt you, it's that it doesn't realize it is. Sometimes when you give open borders to a war civ that doesn't like you, they'll flood you with their troops. I believe they're trying to actually attack you but were not coded to start a war by attacking a city. Only by passing the borders. I've had 20-30 troops in my border than when open borders ended they all left, and he declared war on me the next turn. Really annoying, but was manageable.    All the negatives aside, this is easily the best civ game. I've played hundreds of turns and still have yet to actually win. This is coming from a player who was able to play higher difficulties online on civ 5. It's different, but in a good way. It's refreshing. A lot of the civs have been the same ol' wait 30 turns to do anything. In my experience, there are only short wait times before something interesting happens. Whether it's a city state kicking your ♥♥♥ (Yes, they're more robust now.) or Gandhi actually being Gandhi and sharing his religion, something is happening. To me, it always felt that the only fun speed online was quick so you could actually experience an age or two. With this release, we've been playing longer games, and they feel good.  City states were something I never utilized in Civ 5. I'd rather just pump my money into my cities rather than those jerks who didn't even help that much. Civilization 6 introduced a where you can add a 'point' to a city-state to gain a little bit more control over it. They're actually useful enough that I have yet to play one game where I didn't try to get a few. Also, the game helps you get them in a non-forceful way. Kind of like accumulating faith, it's a little dial that fills up and once full gives you one point. Other civs will compete to get these city states. So ensure you're supporting the ones that will help your win condition the most.  New win condition: Religion. Adding this win condition they removed diplomatic victory. Now, you can properly start a crusade. Other civs will recognize that you are doing a holy crusade, and you're not just warmongering. You have a true reason that a war needs to happen to make the balance exist. If you spread your religion to every civ, with your religion being their dominant one, you win. Simple as that. It's a new play style that feels good. Gandhi plays the best, in my opinion, have had the most success with him. Arabia was pretty good too. But I've yet to try all the civs still.  I know I'm forgetting something. I'm sure I'll edit this review. Also, I'd like to point out that I'm writing all this not even 72 hours after launch. I'm sure a lot of the problems that exist will be removed as time goes on.   Overall: Highly recommend. I might as well uninstall civ 5 now.",

Since they have taken out global happiness and included a bunch other features the game has become more intricate and more challenging than it was before. Its possible to play it in many different ways, with no optimal way of playing it immediately evident, which is crucial for gamers such as me at least. Easily one of my favourite titles since they combine realistic historic events and paying attention to detail. Apart from small immersion-breaking things (such as Nidaros/Trondheim is not the oldest city in Norway, which is Tønsberg) they have managed to incorporate even better details than in the prequels. I have downed well over 200h game time in civ V and looking forward to do the same in VI.",

            "review_text": "To Firaxis and anyone else who cares...  Just did my first playthrough and it left me a little wanting. Im going to say better than civ 5 but I personally think 5 sucked a big fat one so that isnt saying much. I've played all of the civs starting at civ 1, thats right all of them, so I have some experience with the franchise here. First of all this one suffers from the big thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about 5(one of the big things i guess) which was the DAMN ONE UNIT PER TILE THING, didnt they figure out that made it rediculously bulky to move crap around the map and just plain take away from the fun of the game by adding unneccesary tediousness. Okay that said ill say it again, one unit per tile, where can i get some of THAT weed people...  On to some other obvious things, you took out the rifleman unit, its only been in EVERY other civ game i mean WTF Then, i like the idea of traders building roads thats new and innovative, i soon realize...theres no ♥♥♥♥in railroads, like what the hell. No damn railroads, did the devs even play the previous games.   Pikemen dont upgrade until like the modern era...what the hell with that, its like one example of an easy and straightforward thing that they messed up in this iteration of civ.  The diplomacy screen doesnt seem to have a way to view everything at a glance like in 4 and 5, another obvious thing they overlooked.  The food shown in the city screen thing is the gross not the net so you dont know how much food profit you have u have to do the math in your head which is yet another example of a stupid way of setting up the user interface.  Lots of things just needed simple tweeking and it would be a gem, get rid of the one unit per tile, and get rid of the one unit per tile, or add an option to select the max number of units per tile, mods did it for civ 4, why dont u do it for civ 6.  The game is still a nice take on an old classic, but civ still hasnt gone into the future in a good way, Alpha centauri was the best and that was like 20 yrs ago. I guess people dont really know how to make inspired games anymore, or im too set in staying only with this franchise, time to go somewhere else for my kicks you just cant jerk me off like you used to.  Im going to say it one more time because everyone seems to be all too glad to slob on your knob, lose the one unit per tile rule, if anyone disagrees with me they are wrong, this isnt a debate, I am just right on this I dont wanna listen to anything to the contrary.  more stuff...the fog of war is brown the unexplored is brown, the person that made this call must be color blind and so didnt give a crap, literally the color of crap.  more stuff, I keep coming back and adding stuff to this review...here it is. Even the rocket artillery cant move and attack in the same turn, bummer. They replaced the stealth bomber with the 'Jet Bomber' what the crack rocks, and the modern armor unit needs what resource.#!@##$ uranium??? does it have nukes now?  Oh yeah, i didnt see any way to trade maps yet, no big deal right, im joking of course. The journey continues.  The unit autoselect is pretty sloppy, it moves around when i dont want it to, and doesnt move around when i do want it to...this needs to be addressed. I dont know if I said this already but it looks like this game didnt get play tested, or it got play tested by a blind, deaf monkey.  I guess i recommend this game, if you're a fan of the series, if not, go for civ 4, cuz civ 5 is kinda poopy also, but civ 4 is good as beyond the sword expansion. Its probably cheaper and the mods that are already out give you a lot of room to expand the game after you learn the base game so you wont have to wait months or whatever for the community mods to pop up if they do.  I almost feel like Im a mother trying desperately not to hate her newest baby or adopted child or something like that, this THING that i bought seems very...meh, that's the best way to describe it, meh.   With more playthroughs will come more insights I think.  Oh, Im still waiting for them to realize that future tech can actually be utilized for something, like a bunch of selectable bonuses that u can choose from to keep the science from being wasted, some of which would just keep stacking ad infinitum and each future tech getting more costly than the last, but thats just one more good idea that they'll probably never use and others will probably bash.  And fix that one unit per tile thing with a patch or an expansion, cuz im still gonna play your game, I did pay 60$ for it.",

Some may say that Civilization VI is just a re-skinned version of the previous Civilization V but I beg to differ with the help of some people and friends around me.  The district systems are a new feature that Sid Meier and the team at 2K and Firaxis have implemented into Civ. Districts require you to pre-plan and think ahead which calls for some more thinking and skill rather than just clicking a selected building like in Civ V.  Wonders work in a way that you must, again, put thought into because in the middle to late game, you will have limited areas where you can build your wonders and the overall city condition can be drastically effected if one makes a decision poorly.  These are two fairly important changes to the game that will either make or break your gaming experience.   Now on the contrary I would like to say that I am really not a fan on how the aesthetic map works in Civilization VI. In Civilization V you have the basic 'Fog of War' or clouds that conceal an area that is yet to be discovered, however in Civilization VI you have this pretty yet annoying old, rustic map look. You may not see any problem with this but hear me out. Back in Civilization V, the map will just become darker when you no longer have sight in a certain area but you can still see the land in detail. Now in Civilization VI you have the world turn back to a 'drawing' of the world which looks very similar to the areas where you haven't explored. This may be as easy as getting used to it but I feel that its not the best.  Thats all from me but I would still recomend this game 7.8 nukes out of 10 nukes.",

Newly implemented gameplay mechanics, such as a division between the civics and technology trees along with boost bonuses towards civics and technologies for completing associated actions/projects, adds a new level of immersion and depth to to an otherwise familiar system. It is also worth noting that the improved Civics/Tech system is a major component in alleviating the previously tedious mid-game. The addition of building districts onto your cities is also a much appreciated component that allows players to spread a city across multiple tiles. Interaction with AI leaders has also been improved by adding an 'agenda' system of punishment and rewards corresponding to the player's choices.   It is worth noting that, at the time of this review, there are a number of launch-day bugs that have yet to be patched. Nothing game-breaking at this point, but still enough to be an annoyance. Also, I have to admit my biggest complaint is the current lack of single player scenarios, which I found to be particularly enjoyable in Civilization V. Multi-player functionality, aside from options that allow for more stringent control of game length, are nothing new, which I find to be a positive aspect. Civilization V had a highly successful and dedicated community of online players to which Civilization VI is poised to continue and expand.   As for value, I find that the $60 price tag is more than justifiable considering the sheer amount of gameplay by hours you have the opportunity to experience solely in the base vanilla game. That being said, I am eagerly awaiting the expanded roster of civilizations, scenarios, and gameplay mechanics to be found in future additions. Additionally, the soon to be implemented full mod support, which also had a highly talented and dedicated following in Civilization V, offers an almost limitless potential to enhance and expand upon the base game. Considering this, the total amount of play time per dollar spent is only going to improve as these aspects are implemented.  Bottom line, those familiar with the series will find plenty here to provide ample amounts of challenge, intrigue, and entertainment. Those new to the series will find the same, but also may experience a bit of a learning curve, particularly on higher difficulty levels. Lower difficulty level are perfect for learning, and the game provides an excessively detailed tutorial option on the main menu if lack of familiarity is a concern for you. Overall, Civilization Vi is true to its core, while intelligently innovating many areas that were in need of improvement. I highly recommend this game.",

About the game, for anyone who played Civ V, It feels that each turn has many more things to think in between, but at the same time makes the process of turns more logical toward your objective, With the addition of Governments (which allow you to develop just the way you want and need) and districts which makes cities less posible to be a one for all, and makes you build many more cities to focus on different needs of your Civ, Which in my opinion feels more natural, and less punishing than the happyness in Civ V. But still not sure if worth 60 bucks without all dlcs and expansions.",

Unstacking the cities is brilliant &amp; adds depth to game play, as well as requiring you to plan out your civ's development. From terrain features, to adjacency bonuses, to what wonders you might want to build, everything has to be considered; as you can't simply spam every building &amp; wonder into a mega city or two.   The Civic's Tree &amp; Tech Tree are both impacted by the actions that you undertake, making your cvis development in both effected by what you've done previously. The different forms of government allow for different numbers of policy types to be adopted, along with providing specific bonuses that can dramtically effect how your civilization operates.   Great people are dramatically improved, as each great person provides different benefits &amp; bonuses, rather than each being essentially the same character with a different name. &amp; you are given not only the possibility to purchase these great people with faith or gold, but to pass on a certain great person, if you think the next one will benefit you more. Something that is very important, now that every scientist, engineer, merchant, etcetera is different.   Influence with city states are no longer procured by simply dumping gold coins on them, but by investing envoys, a unique diplomatic currency with them. With the removal of world congress, you can't simply spam city state votes to a diplomatic victory by simply throwing enough gold at them. Yet your alliances with these city states can still greatly impact your civilization, providing resources, military assets, &amp; additioanl benefits based upon the city state in question, as well as the policies you've adopted.  Military tactics are greatly improved via the creation of combining units of the same types or combining combat units with support units as both enhance unit performance. Legitimate secondary defenses are created by military districts that provide additional defense to civilizations, especially if due consdieration is given to terrain features &amp; positioning. &amp; the promotion tree for each unit is clearly layed out, so players can play what traits to focus on for each respective unit. Not to mention being able to name your units if they gain enough status, is a rather nice touch.  Put simply, ignore the haters, Civilization VI is brilliant, &amp; the nay sayers can go back to playing COD or angry birds according to their respective preferences.",

The new district system really makes the game come alive. It's not perfect but you'll never be able to go back and play previous Civ games.   There are a lot of complaints about the AI but the Civilization series has always suffered from poor AI. The difference in Civ 6 is that the AIs at least have motives and agendas that aren't totally random. So unlike previous Civilization games, it seems reasonable that the AI could be improved with a patch. I do think the change in AI is a step in the right direction - it just needs a few more steps to get there.  Overall, this is the first Civ that didn't just iterate on the previous version.

The game is also welcoming and easy to learn.  They took all the best things from previous civ games and put them together. The district system is unique to this game, it makes the possibilities of how you put your city endless, although you can't remove them once they are placed. They have also made the combat system better, allowing you to merge units to make them stronger.   - What I like about this game: It's easy to learn.  You can start your cities litteraly anywhere on the map, and do whatever you want with them, rename them, make them specialised in science, military, make it a religious capital ect. This is something that you don't have in the Total War series. Although in Total War games you have the RTS element when doing battles, which Civilization doesn't have.  There are many options. Make a huge empire, play and win the game with only 1 huge city. Make alliances based on religion/political views or trade. Anything is possible, and there's more than one way you can win.   - What I don't like so much: Turn-based games also means it takes forever, I often found myself playing the game for hours on an end only to save it and continue the next day. Games like this can take forever.  The game also has an online multiplayer option, but I wouldn't encourage playing it together with someone, just because it takes so long.  I almost didn't buy Civ 6, because their previous game Civilization: Beyond Earth (Civ in space) was total crap and I thought they would go in the same direction with this game, I'm glad that they didn't though.

Wonders are built out side the citys and you have 2 sets of research (One for civs and the other for tech) that are indpendent but worked on at the same time.

I don't like that, maybe you will, but they are an issue. The map is distracting to me, as well, although - again - it's gorgeous. Although the UI is fairly intuitive, there's too much going on for my tastes, too much like Europa Universalis with all the small print. And the diplo scenes are slow and annoying (maybe there's a way to turn this off that I haven't found yet). It is very different than Civ V; I don't like that. I guess I really just want an improved Civ5; BE tried and failed; Civ VI strikes out a whole new path. I'll give it some more time, cuz I want to like it, but I'm probably going back over to 5 tonight. Anyway, if you're really hoping for something a little more like an improved version of the old game, maybe you ought to wait until this is cheaper to try it, cuz it's a very different experience.

Next I tried a religious victory, but had trouble spreading my religion because the AI were declaring war on me  constantly . Next I tried Science and had a similar experience. I actually met two new Civs in the same turn, they both declared war on me the next turn! China desided to join the party as well, declaring a 'suprise war' on me for the second time in 20 turns.  I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet. So I don't know how the game plays without the hyper agressive AI. While the military aspect of the game has been improved a bit from Civ V, it's still  really boring  to have long, dragged out wars. Which is pretty common, when you have at least two civs who want your blood every game.  Other than that, it's a pretty solid Civ game, that borrows more from Civ II than Civ V. But IMO Civ II was the better of those two games, so that's hardly a bad thing. Religion is actually a victory condition now, as I mentioned earlier, so it feels a bit less tacked on than in BNW. The UI for religious influence is really nice as well. It's probably my favourite part of this game.  I'm a little bit on the fence about whether I like this game or not. I definatly don't think it's very fun at the moment. But I think that firaxis will probably fix that. If not, then I guess I'm never going to recommend this game for anyone who wants to play single player and go for any victory other than domination :/",

First I will start this review with the negatives  Cons  - AI turns are VERY slow. My first game was on a small map and as I got to late game, the AI turns last longer and longer getting up to 5 minutes per turn. (And yes, I have turned on the quick movement and combat. This is a HUGE annoyance as it prolongs the game to the point where you will waste hours.  I like to play huge maps with extra AI players to give me a crazy unpredictable game, but in my current playthrough of this, I am at the point where turns are getting over 5 minutes long, and im only in 1500AD. This makes the game unplayable in my opinion.   From my playthrough so far, This is really the only negative I have about this game. If they can patch this and speed up the AI turns, this game will be so great.    The Positives  + The new tile system and disctricts are a gamechanger, and for the better in my opinion. This system while wasy to implement, adds a layer of tactics and strategy that makes the game so much more intense. It also adds a ton of replay value. The geography you start on, truly dictates the path you will follow. Each playthough I open, I have to adapt a different playstyle.   + Combat has improved. Although the system hasnt changed much from Civ V, The addition of corps and army, as well as escorts have greatley imporved on an already good system.   +Diplomacy has slighlty improved, however I still find myself not getting along with anyone, and pretty much all the civs tend to hate each other. They also still are very stingy and dont like to trade on fair terms. This, I believe is a flaw from the system giving so many reasons for a civ to dislike you, that they will refuse to trade with you.  Overall, the game is so much more fun than previous Civ's, and really makes you think hard on higher difficulties. My first play on level 6 (Emperor), I slacked a bit on reaseach, as I did not have moutains on my island, and Germany got to the combustion engine by 1450 AD. I couldnt start any wars as I was not very advanced in tech.   ",

All in all, the game has become slightly more complex with the ideal to allow the player to become more engulfed in the actual run of a city. Combat hasn't been altered, but the negotiation tabs have... Less options yet more information.   If you're a fan of the series; i'd recommend as like Civ V, I'm sure i'll find myself losing many a hour playing this.

A couple of examples that come to mind after a dozen hours of gameplay: I could overlook the overly bright colors and cartoonish visuals if the UI was better organized, but I find the explored-but-not-currently-in-view areas are harder to discern than the fog of war style of the predecessors. Civ 6's civilopedia is written in a style that is less scholarly, more cynical, and several clicks away to find the entry to the technology you just gained. It doesn't resonate well with me. The card system of civic policies is busy and gets in the way of actual gameplay, because new ones are made available at such a rapid pace.  I play Civ to relax, but playing Civ 6 feels like a management sim. Maybe I'll pick it up again after someone's had the chance to mod some fun back into it.",

The addition of disticts, the civics tree, religious victories, and more goverment types are welcome. In particular, I like how the system of unit promotions has been changed. Tactical combat feels well-balanced and an improvement over Civ V. Civ VI also succeeds in streamlining the midgame, whereas it was easy to feel stagnant and bogged down in Civ V. The cartoon graphics are nothing special, but nor are they ugly. Meanwhile, the sleek aesthetic of the menu screens is pretty cool.    However, my positive recommendation of Civ VI comes with an important caveat: I assume Firaxis will patch some of the game's current flaws. Namely, diplomacy. The AI is absurdly hostile to human players and not sophisticated enough for hidden agendas to feel like anything more than an obstacle. Having a different type of government (a likely situation, given that there are 10 types) is also a major hindrance to peaceful relations. During my first 26 hours of gameplay on Prince difficulty, at no point was any AI civ anything other than 'unfriendly,' 'denounced,' and 'at war.' Strangely, human players quickly incur warmonger penalties even when they are not the aggressors. Introducing casus belli seems like a neat idea, but diplomacy needs to be massively re-balanced before such a system becomes worthwhile.   There are also a few minor glitches and buggy features to consider. For instance, sometimes when hovering one's cursor over a side menu, the dialog box for the terrain tile behind the cursor will still appear. Sometimes units will obscure the ranged attack option of a city or fortification. And the map is cluttered that (even in strategy view) it's easy to misclick and send the wrong unt to the wrong location. On the whole though, these are not at all game-breaking and I trust that Firaxis will patch some of the more annoying ones.   Conclusion: Worthy of the Sid Meier's name and worth buying now if you liked Civ V, but still in need of improvement.",

Builder's having a building limit is alright. You just have to remake them instead of having like the same ones through an entire match.  Having the AI 'dislike' you is cool. Different goverments usually don't like eachother back in those times so in the game they don't like eachother.  I like the changes from Civ V to Civ VI, it's going to be intersting to see what expansions come to this.",

When I finally played the game, it was as good as I expected it to be. Interesting Civ's, cool maps, fantastic mod support and interesting gameplay were things in this game that I thought made this game great. However, I won't ignore that the game has a few problems. At times, the game can get a little tedious and boring; especially when going for a culture or scince victory and are waiting for something to be built while at peace and it's bad AI. Bad AI does grind my gears and it is near impossible to get allainces.  Civ is a great game that has the problems that Civ 5 had, however; it brings new and improved things to the table and improves upon things we loved in Civ 5.  Final Verdict: 8/10 but if the game can update and improve it's AI it has potential to be a 10/10.",

            "review_text": "Civ VI takes the tried-and-true formula of Civ V and alters it in some promising ways. The addition of disticts, the civics tree, religious victories, and more goverment types are welcome. In particular, I like how the system of unit promotions has been changed. Tactical combat feels well-balanced and an improvement over Civ V. Civ VI also succeeds in streamlining the midgame, whereas it was easy to feel stagnant and bogged down in Civ V. The cartoon graphics are nothing special, but nor are they ugly. Meanwhile, the sleek aesthetic of the menu screens is pretty cool.    However, my positive recommendation of Civ VI comes with an important caveat: I assume Firaxis will patch some of the game's current flaws. Namely, diplomacy. The AI is absurdly hostile to human players and not sophisticated enough for hidden agendas to feel like anything more than an obstacle. Having a different type of government (a likely situation, given that there are 10 types) is also a major hindrance to peaceful relations. During my first 26 hours of gameplay on Prince difficulty, at no point was any AI civ anything other than 'unfriendly,' 'denounced,' and 'at war.' Strangely, human players quickly incur warmonger penalties even when they are not the aggressors. Introducing casus belli seems like a neat idea, but diplomacy needs to be massively re-balanced before such a system becomes worthwhile.   There are also a few minor glitches and buggy features to consider. For instance, sometimes when hovering one's cursor over a side menu, the dialog box for the terrain tile behind the cursor will still appear. Sometimes units will obscure the ranged attack option of a city or fortification. And the map is cluttered that (even in strategy view) it's easy to misclick and send the wrong unt to the wrong location. On the whole though, these are not at all game-breaking and I trust that Firaxis will patch some of the more annoying ones.   Conclusion: Worthy of the Sid Meier's name and worth buying now if you liked Civ V, but still in need of improvement.",

            "review_text": "Civ6 has a lot of potential. You can love or hate the new graphic, but overall, it works pretty well. And let's be honest - Civilization was never a game you played because of the graphics.  The new features are very promising as well. The new city districts are very interesting, and the re-design of technological and cultural advances in two similar, but separate trees add a lot to the game as well.  The technological and cultural boosts are also hugely interesting, as they add more decisions to the game. Do I develop this new technology right now, as I could really need the benefits it brings? Or will I develop something else first, and wait until I have earned the boost for that technology, cutting its development time in half?  So in a nutshell, Civ6 is Civ5 with a few very promising new features.  But then, why do I not recommend it? The 2 reasons have been mentioned in many other reviews already, and I can only emphasize them.  1) The AI is abysmal. It may be 'A', but it most definitely isn't 'I'. It acts so unbelievably stupid that it just does not provide a challenge. Only in the highest difficulty setting, it gets so many boosts that it provides a challenge for scientific or cultural victories. But in terms of military conflicts, it acts laughable at best, on all levels. The AI in Civ5 was not too great already, but the AI of Civ6 is much, much worse.  2) Bugs. Tons of bugs. Most of them small ones, but still annoying.  Buildings disappear from cities. The 'finished production' display is broken entirely and never shows the thing your city just finished producing. AI military units disappear. City states give you a quest to build a specific unit, but that quest doesn't finish when you build the unit (probably a result of the 'finished production' bug mentioned before). Convoys don't work. Units are displayed in the wrong location (i.e., they are indeed one hex, and the game knows it, but they are displayed 10 hexes away, caught in an infinite 'running animation' loop). Trade is broken. I ask the AI what it wants for a specific luxury ressource, It asks for 8 gold per round. I refuse and make a counter-offer of 4 gold. The AI refuses. I ask what would fix the deal. The AI now demands 2 gold per round and loves me for accepting the deal. The game tells me than an unmet player has been eliminated. Several times. But when I keep exploring, I meet all civilizations that were supposed to be in the game. Diplomacy is broken entirely.  I could go on for hours. This was obviously a rushed release, that leaves a strong 'early-access' aftertaste. It was more important to publish the game well in time for Christmas, rather than releasing a finished product.  Again, the potential is there, and I honestly hope that I can amend my review at some point.  But if you are to decide whether to buy the game right now, or to wait for the first sale discount, then my advice is to go for the latter. Chances are that, at the time it goes on sale, you will receive a much better game than you'd get right now.",

Though it seams to have those new things they had to cut out huge sections of the game.   for example.  the 'huge' map setting is tiny. literally, the Tiny setting on Civ5 gives you the same amount of space as you'd get from huge in 6.  The amount of civ's to choose from is laughable. I get they need to make lots and lots of money, but the 40 pound game that has less content then civ2 might be making you back money unless it cost them loads due to..  ..♥♥♥♥♥♥, shiney, cartoony visuals that serve 0 purpose. I hear the idea was so they can animate expressions in the diplomatic screens so you can try and tell if they are lyring. which would be good but it seams to have come at such a massive cost.  even on marathon you research tech fast, a marathon game in 5 would last 12 hours maybe more. here you'd be lcky if it took you 4.  NO ♥♥♥♥ING RESTART BUTTON ON THE GAME MENU!. This may just annoy me, but when i played single player i'd often marvel at the stupidity of both my early tribe to decide to settle near a tundra when literally 3 spaces away was wheat and grassland, or shocked at god to somehow have tundra next to a desert, but at least i could restart the game on turn one and see if the next start position would be a bit more playable. GONE! nope you have to like what you get however ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the random dice are to you.  setting up a game is a joke. I seam to recall in civ5 it would remember the last game you made if you handle it right, here it remebmers NOTHING everything is a blank slate, which would not usually be a problem but like i said you cannot restart the ♥♥♥♥ing game, so you have to set up all the game to make it semi-playable. Marathon so the game lasts longer then an hour, huge maps so you arnt accidently falling over 3 civs at turn 10(which i did several times) etc etc then start the game, see you have started in the middle of a desert with 0 resources nearby and do it all again.    tl;dr. Don't bother, its smaller, shorter, dumber and more annoying then civ 5. Which is a much better game which you already have all the DLC for they will sell you again to have more then 10 playable races    remember civ 2? i do. they had more then 10 playable races. *sigh* didn't realize progress was a massive leap backwards into a pile of aids infected rusty spiked ♥♥♥♥♥'s your mum used.  avoid at all costs. maybe if they make a mssive loss on the game they will remember that games need to have more content not less.

Religion is virtually usless for the cost to acomplish it. The appropriate synergy that Sid Meier's sought simply isn't there yet. Unless, you are a war monger.

If you like that, along with detailed task oriented planning then this game is for you. Me? I'm going back to 5 until I can test some DLC to see if it gets better.  On a side note, if you like Civ with culture, religion, and diplomacy with a real challenge this game will provide, though it's still beatable. The science war approach is quite easy. Why? The AI will give up the farm after you've defeated a few units, thus weakening it enough for a proper invasion later.",

Do not waste your time to see the whole text if you can play the game after it is released in your zone. 2. I will leave the review negative for 1-2 days to make more people saw this reivew, and then change it to positive. (Which I have mentioned earlier several times, but many people ingored it) 3. Since I found this review is in the top, I will try make to it a more general tutorial to slove the runing problem.  Problem and Solution (The methods I have searched but not test by myself). Problem:  Cannot run the game. After pushing the start button, the game in steam client show it is running without any winodw opened.(Maybe a window flashes, then quickly closed). After 2-3 seconds, the runing state dispeared. Or the steam VC++ setup crush. Solution:  1. Un/Reinstall the VC++ 2012 2015 for your own OS (x86 or x64) and DirectX in the _CommonRedist fold of the game. Restart the computer. 2. If the installtion is not sucess,  If your use win 8/8.1 of x64, see the 'A Note for Windows 8 Users' pinned in discussion, make sure you install the two needed update (KB2919355 and KB2919442). Then Reinstall VC++.  3. If you use Win7 sp1, and directly run the CivlizationVI.exe file in \\Binaries\\Win64Steam of game fold. If the error is missing api-ms-win-crt-runtime-1-1-0.dll, make sure you install win update kb2999226 (KB2919355 may also be needed). 4. If the runing exe file throw '0xc000007b', See 'My issue Summary:' in the following. 5. If you get stuck at the 'Continue' button after run the game, Make sure the installation path is pure English.  From a player spent 6+ hours searching the runing problem, and finally run into the game. And spend one hour write the general solution.  ------------------------------------------------ My issue Summary: (2016-10-21 07:19:09 GMT+8） Thank you for the players give me suggesions. I can finally play the game.  If you have the same issue as mine. Simplely cannot start the game, un/reinstalled the vc/DX successfully but does not help. Directly run the game exe file throwing Error 0xc000007b. You have installed Try the following steps: 1. Remove VC++ 2015 of both x86 &amp; x64 versions in the Programs of control pannel. 2. Download and Run the DirectX Repair Tools. 3. Install VC++ 2015 of both x86 &amp; x64 versions in the _CommonRedist fold of the game. 4. Run the game!  PS1: Mac Mini 2014Late (Medium) with Iris 5100 can run Civ6 with default setting in 1080p in the Offical Test of Civ6 with 18-22 fps. Do not give up your old or intel video card, try it.  PS2: To make more player who encounter the same problem see this solution, I will leave this review negatively, and to change it to positive in 1-2 days. (I believe someone encounter the same problem will check the negative reviews).   ---------------------------- Issue history (Sorted by time). Save your time and skip the following. ----------------------------   Original: About 4 hours after the game released in Zone 1. I cannot play the game. After I push the start button, the game in steam client show it is running without any winodw opened. After 3 seconds, the runing state dispeared. I have restarted the client and computer, un/reinstalled the vc/DX in the _CommonRedist, validated the game data many times, since many other players encounter this problem, some have run the game successfully after doing the above procedure while some still cannot play. For me, I have tried every methods which I searched, but it still does not help.  -------------------------- Update: 2016-10-21 04:24:50 GMT+8 I am a big fan of Civ series. For Civ 6, I have watched many demo and introduction videos and cannot wait to play the game by myself. However I cannot play it after 4 hours after it released.  I have checked the pinned note in the discussion 'A Note for Windows 8 Users', which is the same as my machine, but unfortunately, it still does not help ( I have install both KB updates). My problem is not single. I believe more users will encounter the same problem after it is released in the whole world. Hope the developers can solve this problem as soon as possible.  -------------------------- Update: 2016-10-21 04:56:31 My computer: MacMini 2014Late (Medium), i5-4278U 2.6GHz, 8GB, Iris 5100. Windows 8.1 x64 using Boot Camp. When directly run the CivilizationVI.exe file, it throw Error 0xc000007b.  ------------------------- Update: 2016-10-21 05:36:14 GMT+8 For the negative review：  1. It is not a individual case. Many Chinese players have the same or similar problem, and have discussion in Chinese in steam discussion and other Chinese forum. Some have slove this problem, some have ask for refund. For me I really want to play this game. Although I have played it, but I have learned and experimented in other trial videos. 2. I will delete it or change to positive after I solve this problem or refund the game if my machine can't run.  ----------------------------------- Update: 2016-10-21 06:04:13 GMT+8 Many people thought it is because my low performance machine: My mechine can run Civ 5 on the default setting in the biggest map in 1080p more than 30 fps (I can distinguish using my eyes), and feel the fps decresing when in the highest graphic setting (but can still run). I believe it can run Civ 6 in low setting (maybe the result is not). I will post the result if anyone is interested.  ----------------------------------- Update: 2016-10-21 07:03:32 GMT+8 ╰(*°▽°*)╯, I finally successfully run this game.

For example, each of my cities rebelled w/ half a dozen helicopter gunships who proceeded to destroy all of the districts providing amenities and the Pikeman and Musketman defending the city. That is the point when I can't keep up, and the game is no longer worth my time. I slected the lowest difficulty level, Settler, so I could test drive the game. I do not want to play the game every hour of my life. i just want to play a short, quick game for entertainment purposes. I do not play the game to show the world that I am some sort of power gamer, as i am not. I just want to play the game to have fun. Also, this game is for adults, as it is highly addictive technology, which should not be provided to children of any age, therefore, the cartoon graphics also detract from the game. I stopped buying 'Total War' games once they became unplayable on the lowest difficulty level, and it looks like Civ has reached that point too. I hope an IGE comes out soon.",

            "review_text": "(Reasons below.) Conclusion (for now): Don't come looking for a Civ V experience, you won't find it here. The game has been drastically changed on a lot of fronts. Graphic-wise, I personally really had to get used to it and still do though a lot of nuisances I had with Civ V and graphical clipping have been removed. I think I can eventually enjoy this game more (I have already, but it hasn't gripped me from the start like Civ V), it hasn't blown my mind and I wouldn't recommend it for 60-80 bucks, hence the negative review. Consider purchasing when it is 30-40 for the base game and 40-50 for the digital deluxe. (Or less. I'd refund it if I could and likely repurchase it later down the line for less.) This game definitely is NOT perfect contrary to what other reviews make you think, hell, I'm leaning to believe it is a step backwards for the Civ franchise. Gone are the glory parts that made me want to stand the test of time.  So.. What can I put down about it in this short timeframe. I'll compare things to what I'm used to in Civ V as that's the game that got me really hooked on the series.  + No technical issues whatsoever. + Less graphical clipping and overall cleaner state of the game. Roads look nice, bridges look nice. Wonders and natural wonders are quite pretty. You can actually see buildings being build and adding to your city or districts. + Traders. I really like how they go out and build roads, give a line of sight through the fog of war areas. + New combat animations. Not all are mind-blowing, but for instance, destroying a cavalry unit shows the soldier falling off the horse and the horse running off. I thought it was a nice touch. + Scouts get upgrades for exploring around the map. A mod I've used for a while for Civ V so was really happy with that myself. + Envoys in city states. I really like this touch and the bonus they provide, it really feels like you build up to a bigger and better city-state ally over time, later on you can even use gold to gain temporary control over their units. (Which should in theory, help reduce the issue of the city-state being useless in a war like Civ V. It rarely if ever send its units to fight the enemy.) + Narrating for technologies. I like it, pleasant voice, interesting text. + Unit promotions. Less options and simpler, but nicer overall and easier to plan ahead since you can see all of them when you promote a unit.  +/- No more ruins, settlements instead or so I'm led to assume. I haven't seen any ruins and while visiting friendly tribes is nice on its own, Civ V had me going on that 'will you stand the test of time' idea to which ruins really fit. I'd have liked to see settlements and ruins or perhaps a mechanic of barbarians visiting settlements first, so they -become- ruins. +/- Opening cutscene / main menu sound track, some love it. I'm not blown away by it but it isn't bad. They added an option to skip the opening cutscene in the options which is neat. +/- Leader overlay. They have seen several improvements to animations and the voices aren't bad, though the screen when heading into the game has been almost completely robbed off history and accomplishments like you had detailed in Civ V. Once picking a civilization and heading in-game (so after load, just before going in-game), you can't see the unit details or special building traits like you could when hovering your mouse on it, and yet there's plenty of space to have included all of that in. I'd have liked more narrating like it did in Civ V. +/- In-game music, unit movement animation; I feel these two combined give the game a really 'serene' touch in ways. I find it relaxing, to the point where I feel it becomes.. Too slowed down? It looks nice, it sounds nice, but unit movement doesn't have the same 'swiftness' to it that Civ V had. +/- Graphics overall. A lot looks nice, rocky edges on ocean tiles look absolutely fantastic but the combination of everything may feel ever so slightly 'young' or 'childish'. I don't hate it, it looks clean, it looks crisp, it is new and different but I'm not sold on them yet. They really take some getting used to. I may simply be too used to how Civ V looks.  - Removed right-clicking on 'next turn' to skip over a supposed assigment. (Such as envoys.) You have to open the entire message, exit it again, then you can go to the next turn. Tedious, slows gameplay down even further. - Can't restart the game with the same settings on the first turn when you for instance, dislike your starting location. Have to go through all menus/settings again. - Early game, the game is even more slowed down. Production is hard to get, citizens are acquired rather slowly. The first ~150 turns you do nothing but selecting research, selecting a policy and hitting next while exploring the map. This is nothing new, but it has gotten even worse. No chance for say acquiring rams early on and capturing a city-state or city. I've yet to receive a troop upgrade from a settlement so I think those are removed too. You'll only get a scout at best from them unit-wise. - No renaming cities, no renaming Civ's. Units can be renamed after earning two promotions which is really strange though they added a random title generator for them. - Barbarian AI is dumb. Like really dumb. The barbarians can surround your city and casually sit there on prince difficulty. They will not ever attack, they will not pillage or become a nuisance like they were in Civ V. (Sometimes overly so.) At one point I had my city surrounded by 3 barbarians and they continued to sit there as if it was open-bar night; I casually made a slinger and began throwing rocks at their faces for the next couple of turns. When I killed two the last one finally ran off. (And then I killed that one too to make a statement.) They had mines to pillage two tiles away in my kingdom, farms to pillage, a trader to capture. They did none of that.   Furthermore, barbarians can't make proper decisions on how to move horses and will often move the same two tiles back and forth for a few turns in a row. Their barbarian warriors either purely fight randomly or select the highest-HP unit meaning that if they could potentially kill a low-HP soldier of yours, they won't go for it when there's another unit nearby. - Civs are even quicker to anger; They will hate you for exploring more of the map then them, they will hate you for acquiring a great person or because you got a luxery resource they don't. It is like the Devs didn't want you to play the game so the AI declares war on you for playing the game. - Some things will leave you confused and feel unintuitive. Cities not being able to attack anymore before you build a wall in them for instance. (This may be a thing from the older games. I did not really touch those much.) - Wonders while looking pretty, don't feel impactful. I build the hanging gardens only to scratch my head on completion going 'Wait, what does that do again?'. I mean, I can guess as I played Civ V but instead of adding the information to the overlay screen like it they did in Civ V, you simply see it getting build now and looking pretty. I'd like to have seen the information added upon completion. (Like it was in Civ V)  ? Multiplayer maps seem scarce, though I genuinely don't recall how it was anymore with Civ's V release. May have been more, may have been less. Missing an earth map, skirmish, north vs south and things like that. ? Some AI always seem to die very early on no matter the game. I've had two AI die in a six player game on turn 68.  ? Diplomacy systems, districts, housing, water, etc. I've yet to fully grasp these mechanics and have no real opinion on it yet. ? Religion Pantheon choices don't.. seem useful like, at all or incredibly minor. Not sure if it is worth pursuing a religion at all. They have been severely narrowed down from Civ's V options.",

I know, I know, I didn't believe it at first either.  Barbarians are EVERYWHERE. Don't recruit scouts, they just bump into barbarian camps every couple turns.  The movement system is now just flat out dumb. Want to cross a river? Do nothing this turn THEN move next turn. That's fun.  The gross brown color pallet is nauseating. Land you can currently see is lit up dayglo, land you've seen but don't occupy is a gross faded brown color and instead of fog of war you just have more solid brown.

This is an early 90s game at best, packaged alongside a handful of (admittedly pretty looking and well animated) character cutscenes that may as well not be there and are irrelevant to the gameplay, they're almost shoehorned in to pad the game out and make it feel contemporary. Can you believe that this has minimum system requirements?  I don't understand how a 'grand' strategy game like this can have such a buzz around it.

Shut up, your argument is invalid.  If you wanted a rehash of civ 5 you should've just stuck with civ 5.

The district concept definitely makes for a more challenging city planning strategy (you can't simply build everything everywhere), and gives you a fresh new experience. The double research tree is a bit different, but sort of just feels like one accelerated one. I'll have to get used to the cards, many of them feel insignificant or similar to each other... I played on the default settings which made the game too easy, so I didn't get to try some of the new combat ideas -- observation balloons, corps, armadas, etc. It looks like they'll be interesting to try.  Negatives? Just a few... Trade caravans are just as tedious as they used to be. When you're up to 20+, all you're doing every turn is reassigning at least one or two :(. I can't believe there's no 'send to same as previous' button. I'm sure a mod will come shortly.  Diplomacy is a little more transparent, but it pretty much feels the same. AI will repeatedly surprise-attack you, then settle a bunch of cities right next to you after promising not to, and then when you attack him in return everybody hates you for being a warmonger. Bah.  I was pleasantly surprised that game didn't crash at all. Until I exited. It hung after I clicked on 'Exit to desktop'. I tried one more time, and it hung again. That's annoying, but at least it seems stable while I'm playing :).  You can't queue up production? What?!",

That's not to say the game is 100% perfect. I'd like to see bonus resources factor into the new Amenity system, &amp; I'd like to see multiple copies of the same luxury and/or strategic resource have some kind of point (beyond foreign trade)-indeed, I'd like to see luxury and strategic resources work in very much the same way as strategic resources worked in Civ5.  The Civics Tree, District System, Eurekas/Inspirations, truly novel City States and Great People and the government system are all truly brilliant IMHO.

Most of these complaints from people I've seen are, 'It plays differently'.  Overall the game is great, interesting new ways to play. The limited builders, which many are whining about, is just fine as it means they're actually important and you don't just slap out a few and forget them. The graphics are obviously going to be down to personal preference. The pictures don't do it justice, in motion it looks better than the static images. Having said that, the designs do look more like Civilisation: Revolution. I do think the graphics is something many can't accept because they see it as a mirror of simplification, which the game has not done.   In all, it's a new way to play a great game.  However, this is the negative part that I do find irritating;  As with the original Beyond Earth you get the other leaders show up and complain or compliment you. There's a little animation, which is nice, but silence. No speaking. They just wiggle at you or smile at you and say something that you will probably find irrelevant, such as 'your culture growth is good'. They interrupt your game just to tell you this! In Beyond Earth: Rising Tide it was removed and changed to small boxes at the top of the screen that would show every now, approving or disappoving of your actions. This was much, much better! And yet, here on Civ 6, they've reverted to the original, annoying system of interrupts.  I hope this irritation is removed and replaced as it was with Beyond Earth.",

            "review_text": "(Under editing as I play) Ok, I'm really enjoying this game, but if you've already got a copy of Civ 5 with most of the DLC, I would think about whether it's worth switchg at the current price (I've just changed this to a postive review). As a rough estimate I'd say it's 25% different, and the differences became more apparent as I went on. If you feel the cost is pocket change, then absolutely buy it; otherwise you might want to hold out for 6 month to a year until it's cheaper- it's your call. I personally love a whole new set of achievements to meet and new mechanics to learn, but the gameplay experience is really putting it in the 'similar yet different' category.   If you're new to the franchise than I absolutely recommend the game- it's a lot of fun and holds many of the features of the last game with DLC, while adding some new ones. If you enjoy other strategy games like Age of Empires, SimCity, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis then it's definately worth giving Civ 6 a shot. Most of this review will be focusing on how it's different to Civ V though.  Pros: -I really like the mechanic that gives you a boost to your research or culture (civics tree) if you've already completed a given task (it differs for each one). It's great and really makes sense. I found it changing how I chose the next thing to move on to depending on the likelihood that I'd complete the boost anytime soon. - Diplomacy seems to be better. Sure Gandhi still love his nukes, but it's very clear that this is the case (long running joke), rather than it seeming like a bug. I've so far found that the characters conform to their agendas more after just one game then they ever did in Civ V. Why Gandhi refused to accept my embassy/delegations when we had a decent neutral relationship remains a mystery however. - Easy to learn and get into. (I'm coming from a Civ 5 background, so not sure how intuitive it would otherwise be) It still however adds new concepts and challenges that are interesting to a veteran of the games. Hope that appeal will last, but I'm too new to it still in order to make a fair call. -I really like the information system later in the game. You actually get too much information and have to try and look for patterns in it to see if you can get a sense of the strategies the other players are using. - The great person system is much more realistic and I think will lead to more in depth strategy to get the ones you want. You are actually competing for the attention of each great person with the other cultures and each one seems to provide unqiue benefits. For example, your Industraial era great scientist offers different benefits to the information era one. - You have different government types available to you throughout most of the game. There are three 'stages' each with three different options that allow you to customise the benefits your society receives. It's a good expansion of the ideology mechanism in Civ V.  Cons: - My first game I was going for a science victory and was working on building the space districts. I get a video take up my screen and think that I've lost and there are achievements related to loosing because they're popping up on the side of my screen like crazy... Nope, I won a culture victory without even noticing or being told that I was close... I was only on Prince difficulty to get used to it, but I found this a little strange. - There was a stage in the early game where I got really bored (about 1 hour and 10 mins in) and I was looking like I was going to ask for the 2 hour refund. It did improve later though - It still takes too long in between turns. Sure I played the first game through with the combat and movements on just to see what they're like, but it doesn't seem any faster which is one of the things I was most hoping would be fixed. - Movement for units takes much longer than previously. In Civ V you could go across a field before going into a forest in one turn, now it take 2 turns as if either of the terrains require you to slow down it now takes the whole turn. This really makes sense- it was strang how it worked before, but it does make the fighting with all the barbarians stage drag a lot. And there are way more Barbarians -I'm not the biggest fan of the art style; though I'm used to it now. I feel that it should feel a little bit more provincial and realistic, but I do find it quite functional. I totally disagree with views saying that it makes it like a simple mobile game. It's different than before (and you do want change with a new game), and do see some of the benefits it brings with easier identification -I had a message saying I had discovered a coal site, however it wasn't clear at all, and it was actually under one of my districts. I was receiving all of the benefits from it, but I wasted a fair amount of time until I was able to figure this out. - If someone finishes a wonder before you do, even if you've been working at it for many turns and are almost done.... well nothing... No credit, no money, no compensation.. it's all just a waste... (Writing the review as I play you get smallish comments like this) - I start negotiating on a trade that I don't realise is really favourable to me. I change anything and suddenly not only is all they were offering me in addition is gone, a 'fair' trade of resources is no longer acceptable... WTF? (It's actually much worse than in Civ V- This needs to be fixed- or the screen where you see what they're offering needs to at least be big enough to see everything) - The icon saying ... has declared war on ... etc is a bit buggy. It'll be clear for the first one that pops up, but if there are more than one, usually with city state involvement, it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on as the second to 6th notifications don't always work so well. Would be better if on provided a summary of declarations of war in that turn when you clicked on it. - Ok, I like that the quotes change. i just got one from Courtney Cox though... Yeah, can we stick to slightly more profound quotes. Keep it up to date as you get into later eras absolutely, and if the quote was related to entertainment or culture, fair enough, but it was for a scientific laser discovery. Unless I'm really misssing something, that's kinda an insult to modern scientists... 'I'll be back' for Robotics, however = Gold.  Overall:  I think it's a worthwhile game. The price tag is kinda high if you've already got Civ 5 with most of the DLC, as the experience isn't really that different, but it's still been an enjoyable experience so far. This will probably change to a positive review as I play and explore the differences more and get more used to the different mechanics. There should be a neutral option as I'm currently juggling the recommendation based on the cost vs how much it feels like a new game.",

Ive literally read 'to much to do' 'to much micromanaging' and half of them were stuff like oh this isnt in the game oh you cant do this oh they took that out. NOPE just have to learn how to read and not expect everything to be the same. pretty much everything is in this game from civ 5. some even complained about not being able to rename stuff. WHO GIVES A ♥♥♥♥. but yes you can rename units and you will be able to rename cities later in future updates. This game is a solid 10/10 great step forward. alot takes some getting used to but in games change is good if done the right way. districts make it much harder and so much better. more strategies and tactics. the a.i has its moments but overall much better. BTW PEOPLE for those complaining about a.i attacking you randomly for no reason well DONT just accept everyones deploy (embassy basically) right away. study them first see how they are playing and what your strategies are then who ever works best for what you wanna do trade do all you can to make an ally. THEN later depending on what the a.i. is trading and or doing befriend them. once you accept their deploy gifts then they will know all what your doing and it will effect them. its all about CHOOSING wisely and paying attention to everything. its much more immersive and realistic.also on that note ive noticed atleast from my last session the a.i seems a bit greedier. again realistic.

While some are more personal preference, one outstanding strike against this game is the AWFUL A.I. For instance, play a single-player game for more than ten minutes and you'll find out every civ you meet is made up of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. In the games I've played, I have been denounced and have been in 1000-year-long wars for all of the following:  1) My military being too small  2) Being behind in the tech tree of another civ  3) Existing  4) Having my scout get too close to a civ's borders, causing accusations that I am building up on their borders  5) Building too close to their cities when I'm separated by a dozen or more tiles  6) Building too close to their cities because they built a city right on top of one of my city's borders  The list goes on and on. It makes the game unenjoyable because you spend the game in an 8-way war with every civ for 800 years and get burned out. It is almost impossible to befriend civs or make peace during any war. When they do attack, they're idiots. The A.I. doesn't even really put up a fight. They declare surprise wars on you like war is going out of style, but they fight wars like their master strategist is a bag of potatoes.   I could keep going on about the A.I., but I won't. There are other gripes I have, but like I said, mostly personal. I hope the developers work with the A.I. in some much-needed patches to even the A.I. out.",

            "review_text": "My initial review after 10+ hrs of gameplay. Background: Dedicated but casual player of every Civ since the first. Score so far: 8.5/10  Bottom line: It's fairly similar to Civ V, but different and interesting enough to warrant a new version. Some new interesting dynamics have been introduced, and religion is back.   Pros:  +Districts. This is the main difference between in Civ VI and all other versions. Now, many upgrades to your city actually are located on a district tile outside of the city square. This adds new levels of location strategy.  +Units. The unit gameplay is similar to Civ V, which I thought was an upgrade from doomstacks of earlier versions. Now, though, great generals can stack with regular units and support units to have 3 things on one tile. This is a good compromise.  +There are two full skill trees now. Technology, and Civics. In Civ V, the civics tree was a mini-tree. There are various ways to get 'Boosts' to research by means of meeting certain mini-objectives, which include researching something on the other tree, building X number of specific unit types or city improvements, or defeating an enemy unit with a certain type of unit. Now, it's not feasible to hide behind walls and spam science.  +Music. Always a strength of the Civ games, the music is well done. In Civ VI, the music you hear is based on the culture of the empire you choose, the scientific age you're in, and the other civilizations you meet. My first game was Rome, and early on I met America. So added to the traditional Roman themed music was some pleasant banjo bluegrass, which kinda worked, considering 'America' didn't exist in the ancient era. Later on, after I built my caravels and explored other continents, the sounds of Norway, Germany, India, and Japan were added to my soundtrack. It gets pleasantly quite grandiose in the Industrial Age. The only caveat is I wish they had more situational music, ie, more martial music while you're at war. It doesn't feel right to have some serene music playing while Rome's Legions are on the march! Of course, though, I'm sure the novelty of the music will wear off after dozens of hours, and eventually I'll probably end up muting the music and listening to other stuff while I play, but that should take a while.  +Graphics. This is a tricky one. This will be in the Pro and Con column. But as for the Pro, it's detailed and creates distinctiveness. Problems with earlier Civs is that by the modern era, all the tiles look very similar because of how the workers improved the land. Now, with the Districts and varied ways the land is worked, the landscape looks very different as you pan across the map. The map itself is nice, showing art in Terra Incognito, and displaying as an aged map in the Fog of War area, where there is no longer any visibility. This is an upgrade from gray an black. As an unadvertised interesting option, you can also turn on a day/night cycle in the game settings. It adds an interesting graphical variance over time, and even in a small war I haven't turned it off out of concern of being able to discern things properly at 'night.'  Cons -Graphics. Despite the praise above, it just looks cartoony. From what I've been reading, it's by far the biggest complaint people have with the game, and feels like a regression from earlier Civs. Even in the cinematics, it looks like they're characters from Frozen. Civ is not alone in this approach, as many games have gone to the 'stylized' approach, a trend that emerged with Warcraft III, I'd say.  -Less available info. It feels like when I want the data or lists of things I used to be able to have before, I can't find it. Is there a unit list? What happeneed to all the cool timeline data charts that every Civ has had?  -Religious combat &amp; victory. I like that there is Religious combat, but opponents just spam apostles and try to roflstomp their religion for the win. Ghandi is on the verge of winning this way because he dominated his continent and I dominated mine, but then he pulled a religious normandy, storming my beaches with waves of zealous Hindu apostles, which don't need any permission to enter my territory or incur any negative for doing so. I have mostly repelled the horde, but it's touch and go. After seeing this system in play, I like the concept of it, but it needs tweaking. I don't think there should be a religious victory option. And, especially in more modern ages, there should be the development of non-religious populations, or reducing the gameplay effect of religion in the modern era and beyond.  -Price. It's $60. I would have expected to see $50 at launch. If the price is an issue for people - and I don't blame them at all if it is - wait for the Steam Winter Sale. It should be on sale then. All I can say is that I am pleased with the purchase at this point, which is FAR different from my disappointing experience with Civ: Beyond Earth.  As I continue playing, I will provide updates.

Stacking units is back but not OP bc with research you can only do 3 in a stack max. Animations are great and the combat is cool...nukes look amazing!  Cons- for some reason camera always resets (after your turn) to your main city..makes hunting for units annoying afterawhile. UI needs some tweaks...i.e. i lost my first game (was leading in everything but religion) and AI got religious victory...but no popups showing i was behind (to be fair i should have been checking this) but realisitcally the game should give you a heads up you are about to lose...Spies...are annoying in this game. They only protect your cities for one turn...and you have to constantly retell them what to protect each turn. Also, multiple spies are needed to protect one city (as each one only protects one type of district). This part of the game needs to be fixed as with large sprawling civs..just getting your spies to work is an aggravation (at the very least automate the damn things.   Overall- since this is a new game i am sure they will patch the spies and amend the UI and camera reset issues pretty soon. Despite these minor annoyances though, the game is awesome.

Hmm okay, I attack anyway, capture their capital, wreak havoc everywhere with my superior troops that I immideately start pumping out, truns out their military wasn't that strong. Yet, every nation, including my neighbour that would cease to exist if not for my actions, denounce me and all their attitudes turn red. Like reeealy, this makes so much sense. So if you're the 'warmonger' - all bets are off, they'll spit in your face, but if you go after an AI-leader who is the original warmonger and already took a few capitals before, that's a no-no thing. Like how it even adds up in those AI heads? Apparently the game is made to be challenging, sure, but by such means?",

            "review_text": "***AS I PLAY I AM UPDATING THIS REVIEW***  ***THIS IS THE MOST UPDATED REVIEW***   Quick Summary/ Analysis- This game is pretty damn good. My first game was rough, but that was simply becuase I had no idea of really what I was doing. However, once you get the hang of amenities (happiness), housing (population room), and the tech/civic trees (science &amp; culture) then the game is a boatload of fun and you can really get immersed into the game. There's a tutorial if you want to be taught, but I ignored it as I prefer to teach myself through trial and error. Eventually, you have a general idea of what you're supposed to build and research, but the general timings and the overall importance involved with building &amp; researching takes a little while longer to get use to since there are so many buildings, wonders, and districts. Workers also now have a limited amount of uses, build improvements instantly, and can no longer build roads. The game has some serious leg room for improvement and for more awesome content in the future (DLC and mods). I played the crap out of Civ 5 (1293 hours) and when it came out, it wasn't nearly as optimized or complete as Civ 6 has been so far during its release, so that makes this game all the more promising; although Civ 5 turned out pretty darn good.   Graphics and Audio-  I personally like the graphics style a lot, I wouldn't go as far as to say that I love it but it's a nice change from Civ 5 in my opnion. However, it is important to note that the game has a sense of a 'cartoony' type graphic style that will take a few hours or minutes (it depends on the person) to get used to. The soundtrack is very good and changes slighty throughout the game to keep things abstract and not so stail. Every leader has their own country-themed music that seems to suit quite nicely with all the civs I have tried so far (America, England, and France). This makes me assume that the others Civs will have good soundtracks as well, but I will update that with confirmation after I play all the other civs.  Leader bonuses and A.I.-  The leader's different bonuses seem to be fairly well balanced, however there are still a few Civs who are significantly better than others (Which is to be expected). The A.I. is fun to play against but sometimes still makes some absurd decisions (like building wonders instead of troops when I'm about to take their capital after I already took their other two other main cities), but still is good enough to provide not only a learning experience but also a decent challenge. If you want a true challenge though, you should be playing online against other players since humans always provide more of a challenge than the A.I; except for Deity. The A.I. is a decent opponent, but they are suceptable to early wars and large late game wars. They sometimes will settle right next to your capital in the early game instead of near their own capital for no obvious reason. It seems to me that the A.I. does this to either drive you into an early war and make you fall behind or to try and force you to take his city that's bordering your capital and frame you to make you look like a warmonger. The A.I. is improved over Civ 5 A.I. for sure, but they definitely still make some noticeable irrational decisions that have severe consequences (for them), even at high-tier difficulties such as Immortal and Deity.  War- War seems to be more focused on unit positioning, terrain, and your level of technology than ever before. War also lasts longer and feels similar to Civ 5 combat, but a little bit more refined in regards to the impact of terrain modifiers (which makes war more realistic). You may build encampments which are like military bases that can serve to shoot like a city or garrison units in like a fort, and in turn that provides a unique defensive aspect to the game and a nice aesthetical appeal around your cities as well. There are variety of units from archers and spearmen to thermonuclear warheads and rocket artillery. Additonally, there is even a new feature called 'corps' and 'armies' which are unlocked with the appropriate corresponding technologies. 'Corps' comes first and it allows you to have two of the same military units stacked on top of eachother on one single tile to form a more powerful &amp; formidable, yet singular unit. 'Armies' are unlocked after corps and is simply an upgrade to corps because it allows you to stack up to three military units of the same type in one tile instead of merely two. You may also now bomb and destroy tiles, improvements, and districts with aircraft for added realism and additonal detriment to your opponet's economy and infrastructure.  Wonders &amp; Workers-  Wonders are no longer built in the cities themselves but rather on a tile itself with special placement properties such as being adjacent to certain tiles/districts or being located on or near a certain tile (flood plain, grassland, desert, etc). One tile per wonder, but the tile needs speical attributes/districts. This means that wonder spamming is less prevelant and also dedicates more space of your empire to your wonders; so you can't build improvements on those tiles, but you can admire them and your Civ with an insurmountable amount of glory, admiration, and pride like never before. Workers can no longer build roads and instead roads are created via trade routes to and from cities in which the road is gradually built as the trade caravan ventures across the land to its final destination. Workers also have a limited amount of uses, can improve tiles instantly, and can aid in district and wonder construction.   Multiplayer- I have not played multiplayer yet, and therefore I cannot comment on it other than I recommend multiplayer to anyone who wants a challenge to test out their strategic mind and methods against another human; which in turn is better because we humans can analyze complex situations and algorithims while creating the appropriate responses to rectify those situations/algorithims. This also happens to be something that modern-day A.I.'s simply cannot do and are also severely lacking compared to human intelligence.   Final Purchasing Advice and Opinions- I recommend this game as it is very fun, immersive, well optimized and full of content that is definitely worth 60$. Unfortunately 60$ is a lot of money for some people so I can also recommend to wait until the game is on sale (like the winter or spring sale) that way you don't have to pay full price and then you may also play the game once the minor bugs have been ironed out and the modding community is up and running for Civ VI. I recommend this game to anyone who liked Civ 5 or is new to Civ in general, but like I also said, I highly recommend to wait until the price comes down in the future unless money is not a problem for you! Have an urge to rule the world? Or maybe you simply like history, strategy, and managing nations/armies, whichever it may be you will not regret buying this game! Good luck my fellow strategians.   P.S. Trade with your enemies before you go to war with them. :)",

            "review_text": "More options and variety when it comes to the civilization aspect of the game, which is a nice change of pace. Space on the map matters a lot more than civ 5 since improvements add housing and district locations are important and stop the yields of its space. City planning is much more of the game instead of just clicking the buildings you want.  The AI still is wonky, but that seems to never change. It definitely performs better than civ 5, but its interactions are glitchy. For example, when our borders connected, I kept getting penalties for having troops near the AI's borders even though those troops were in my borders. I have only played on Prince so maybe it gets better. Fingers crossed.  The new declare war mechanics are very nice. No flat war monger rates any more and an actual reason not to blitz your opponent.  The new government/civics system feels like a definite improvement. This is more of a time will tell thing, but being able to slot bonuses in to the different governments feels satisfying. Having culture unlock its own tech tree is also a nice change.  City state management seems a lot better. No more stacking cash to insta-buy all the city states (though maybe there is something like that, haven't played with late game techs/civics much). Sending in envoys represents a better long term investment for controlling city states and the quests are way less random and much more doable to get bonus envoys.  Trade routes making roads is also just great. Roads develop much more naturally now and mid tech units still let you put them down in specific places if you want. Trade has been buffed significantly overall, without being stupid like it was in BE, adding to the level of depth that the player can interact with outside of war.  The amenities system seems a little too streamlined, but that could be me not entirely understanding in. In my last game I expanded pretty heavily and it wasn't a problem until a long war and losing a city state's support caused a city to rebel. The rebel units were significant, so there is that, but if I had been paying more attention to just not expanding everywhere, it probably never would have happened.  Overall, I am going to say worth it, even at full price. My wife and I play together and we are both enjoying the expanded mechanics and I am glad they seem to have kept what worked from civ 5. I was hoping for limited unit stacking, mostly to help the AI do better in war, so hopefully that will be a thing. I don't want to go back to the doom stacks of civ 4, but letting the AI stack an archer on a warrior would help them navigate the hexes a lot easier. ",

And because of the new district mechanic some cities including your own may not have a strong military foundation, you may want to go for science or religion. So depending on the terrain you maybe screwed militarily early on.   Even if you keep track of the AI's new 'Agenda' mechanic and make sure not to go against it, they will still war dec. They also war dec. in packs of 2-3 at a time very early on. The AI earns no warmonger penalty from what I can see but if you decide to retalliate then all the AI's will go against you.  And that is the basic negative feeling I get from the AI, that they are ALL AGAINST you. You are not playing against individual AI's that have unique personalities, instead, you are playing against one computer with different skins.",

Things that I think about halfway through my first Civ 6 game (Aztecs on Continents, Prince level):  THINGS I LIKE: Happiness per city instead of civilization-wide. Districts -- they really make sense when you think about it, and they will make you think! Being able to change governments and policies to deal with changing situations. Stacking with support units. I haven't done this yet, but I'm looking forward to merging units into corps and armies.  THINGS I LIKE BETTER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD: The cartoony look grows on you -- it's just different than Civ 5. Builders' limited usage -- instant improvements are a good trade-off. Research split into Science and Civics trees.  THINGS I DON'T LIKE: Not being able to change names of cities and units! Movement seems really slow compared to Civ 5 and roads don't seem to make much difference.  INTERESTING: The foxy, feisty Boudicca is now one of my generals instead of being a pain-in-the-♥♥♥ Civ 5 leader. Sumerian civilization instead of Assyrian -- I guess it doesn't matter since Gilgamesh reminds me of Ashurbanipal. Barbarossa instead of Bismarck as leader of Germany -- Bismarck was never a prick like Barbarossa seems to be. Diplomacy. Sending Envoys to City-States instead of gold to earn influence.  WTF?! The AI makes some odd decisions in the heat of battle, such as advancing a war cart into hex surrounded on three sides by enemy crossbowmen. The Civ 5 AI wasn't that great at military campaigns, but so far, I'm even less impressed with the Civ 6 AI.  SAME OLD SAME OLD: After a good start, I started hearing complaints about a lack of luxuries/amenities, then my treasury started bleeding money. Same thing used to happen a lot in Civ 5. Barbarians are still bad hombres (maybe worse), but I can still keep them under control (sort of) with a roving team of an archer unit and a melee unit.  I'VE LOST MY RELIGION: Immediately after creating my religion, Hep Roc Heresy, I was flooded with German missionaries and now every Aztec is Catholic and I have no Hep Roc Heretics. I'd like to find out how to get my religion back. What I said: Barbarossa is a prick.  BUYER'S REMORSE? Absolutely not!  AM I HAVING FUN? Oh, hell yes. ",

It's a fun game with it's own unique featues and gameplay. It definitely set itself out against other civ games, but still feels like a civ game... Well, like Civ V. Not like the other ones before. I only played Civ Rev and Civ IV BtS, and Civ IV BtS is my personal favourite and personal opinion as to best Civ game. But Civ VI makes me like Civ again - the modern version. Civ V is still dissapointing. My Steam hours recorded my mom playing though. She loved it. It was simple. Simplicity for the new audience works out best. Civ VI captures a little simplicity and adds a spice. Not a strong spice, but one which can be dealt with over time. Exploits are easy to come by if you know how to do it.  I just can't wait for Map Editor!! This is what makes a Civ Game a Civ Game. It's all about the editor. I miss the Civ IV editor, it's beast. Doubt they'll make anything that good now though. Not calling the devs lazy, but I sort of kind of am.. Which is rude of me since I'm not a dev or programmer. I'm a wanna-be computer engineer who is going to school for it. EDIT: Forgot to mention, if you want to play hotseat mode, be ready for the last player to make his turn only to stare at a black screen until player 1 is allowed to go. No wonders are watched being built by the individual player. Otherwise, it plays pretty normally besides that.",

I began with culture because my territory expanded quite slowly and buying tiles was quite expensive. I conquered 2 cities of Spain and this was the only time i waged war. Spain denounced me and attacked me twice. I just fortified on good terrain and even do his army was a good bit larger he could not hurt me if he wanted to. I was picking of a couple of units with one archer behind 2 warriors.  At the right time i beelined to legionairies, build 6 of them, and compstomped Spain. Taking control of his best 2 cities. And the only ones that were of any use to me. During the game i loved Spains animations. When he declared war on me, denounciations and the times he offered me an unfair trade deal which i declined. Philip is such a clown.  In the middle game i was very busy keeping my production up. I`ve invested way to much in culture and science as i had not decided which victory to go for. I won the game in 483 turns by science victory (the game would have ended on turn 750 by score). I guess i could have won the game at about the same speed if i would go for culture victory. I took all the culture techs in about 70 turns before the game ended. About 40 turns were wasted by science when i developed the latest tech. I would say easely a full era was spend on the last tech. Repeating it over and over again.  All in all the AI was quite passive. Only spain declared war on me 2 times. The AI fought among themselves quite a lot. When i knew i would win the game. About 100 turns before the game ended. 2 out of 3 stongest AI`s badly wanted to be friendly with me. And begged for an allience. China was unfriendly with me but could not be bothered much what i did. I declined most of his unfair trades. And he grunted.  By the end of the game i had 9 cities. 3 off them were founded in about the middle of the tech tree. I guess early modern era. They were about useless. As they never had the hammers to keep up with the rest of them. Even do the spots i settled them on were quite good.  Of my 6 tall cities i build a culture and science district and completed all buildings on them. Most of them had eather a harbor/commerce district or and a industrial zone. With the experience i have now. I would have focussed more on hammers. You can never get enough production. Besides that i would probably invested more in housing/amenities or military. My military was not very strong through the game. I could have won with 2 culture and science districts less. Focussing more on other things as there is never a time you dont want to produce something badly. Those power plants did wonders in the late game.    There are some ballance issues i`ve encountered  - hammers are very hard to get, and in some degree money as well. You get enough gold each turn but land purchases and unit upgrades are very expensive even with policy cards.  - science and culture progression goes way to fast. I would say they should have been 1/3 more expensive. I did focus on them a lot but my tech/culture boosts on them were not planned very intelligently at times. As i was rushing through them and my production could not keep up.  - The AI plays this game to passively. (It should bond up to take down a strong opponent instead of working together with the player that is one the way to win the game)  - going wide might not be that strong. Tall works just fine. You dont really need more then 6 well build cities. Undeveloped cities really could use the help of traders. I did not bother in my game. Probably should.  - there is no real point to found new cities past the modern era. They can`t keep up. At the most you could get 2 developed districts on them.  - The world councel is much needed to spice up the game behind modern era. Miss this the most from civ 5 besides an earth map.  - Most of my AI opponents stayed unfriendly with me after i captured 2 cities from spain. For an unclear reason. Our relationships were not negative from what i could see. I did have a casus belli.   Some odd things:  -China had 3 Crouching Tiger Cannon corps walking besides their anti tank crew in information era.  -Clinking through 30 turns waiting to win the game without any distraction aint much fun.  -I loved the spoken videos on the first 2 steps of the science victory. To bad the 3 mars project were kind of dull in comparison. No tekst and the same video.   (i did not read much experiences/impressions from other civfanatics up to this day. What i wrote down today is based on my own experience. Some of them might have been well known issues by now)",

If you're looking at this game based upon graphics, you might be a tad dissappointed, but it works for some people, and I'm one of those people that doesn't seem to mind the more cartoony aspect of it. It's actually cool to see each civ and culture's units actually take a unique skin for once. Egyptians and their non-unique units (such as plain Spearmen or Archers) for example will take the shape as more egyptian vs. a Greek, Roman or Chinese spearman. It's also very fun around mid game, neighboring civs will start to get more hostile (particularly around the medieval ages) and so there's almost no boring mid game for the average player. If I had to give this rating based on the cliche 1 out of 10 scale, I'd probably give this a 9.5/10.",

It plays fairly differently from Civ 5, with systems in place such as traders placing roads, districts for the cities, and the new civics tree, and most of these systems work petty well. However, there are many bugs, AI issues, and a few balance issues, to name the biggest flaws. Also, never give a distant 'move to' command to a unit if you care about efficient and speedy movement, as the game will frequently plot out an inefficient course that takes a couple turns longer than if you had manually selected each move. I like the change to movement, but they didn't adjust their pathfinding well enough for it.  I'd say get it if you think you can deal with the issues and want to play with the new systems, otherwise wait for updates to fix the big issues.",

For example, some mechanics are not well-explained (why can't my archers shoot targets that are 2 tiles away? I found out eventually by experimenting but 'line of sight' is not properly explained even in the Civilopedia). There are also numerous bugs such as victory not triggering and game crashing when conquering a city on the side of the map. As a Chinese national, I am also more comfortable to play the game in English because the Chinese translation has a lot of errors and inconsistencies (not translators' fault; the way the texts are formatted in the source code doesn't give translators enough context to translate 100% accurately).   Despite all that, I find the game really enjoyable. City planning, music, making best use of each civ's unique abilities to optimize, etc are all great. For now, I believe Firaxis will listen to player's needs and fix as many problems as possible in the next patch.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: I will update this as I find more ridonculous stuff in the game.  Ok, super excited, starting my first game as Rome after looking up leaders and faction traits yesterday. Turn 3 I meet Carthage - think to myself ok, that seems kind of scripted, but I do like it, they ask me to destroy a barbarian settlement within 5 tiles. I find the barbarians (couldn't get the scouts, they move faster then my warrior, but no matter, gonna kill them anyway, right ?). The spearman there was tiny bit stronger than my warrior, so I thought I'll just fortify next to it, if they attack me, I'll be stronger.  Lo and behold, Carthage sent their warrior to assist and started attacking the camp themselves ! Again, thought to myself - that's pretty awesome, however the problem was that Carthaginian warrior destroyed the settlement which doesn't finish the quest !!! So the next circa 15 turns I spent reloading and retrying this scenario, because  1. Their warrior retreats when low on health, so you'd think you can finish the fight now. 2. ...but as soon as you start attacking (because obviously earlier you wait until they move away, so you can finish the camp off and get the quest) they come back and kill steal the encampment !!! 3. And you can't wait for them to move too far away, because the barbarian unit will heal and you won't be able to finish them off anyway. 4. Ok, so to prevent that you load an earlier autosave to reposition yourself before the fight in such a way that right as the Carthaginian warrior starts moving away, you move into their spot, so they have no way to reach the camp and kill steal it for you, so you can finish the quest they originally gave you.  Not really ranting, but damn, that was a funny scenario.  Also how the barbarians already have spears when Rome has warriors with clubs I dunno.  10/10 anti kill stealing so you could finish Carthages quest in the first place and prevent the punic wars simulator  would recommend.  EDIT 1: so for some reason Japan is willing to offer me 4 gold per turn for my extra diamonds, which is cool, however they will not offer their extra tea for them for some reason. Aside from the diamonds vs tea value issue, what they will offer is tea for my diamonds and me giving them 10 gold per turn. aside from which resource that is (but if we look at that in that way, yeah, diamonds and gold for tea) as I'm pretty sure it would the same for any other resuorce why the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to give them my lux resource + 10g per turn for their lux resource ? How is that really an improved AI. I like the game, but I am switching to not recommended at the moment, as this is just balls. And not in a balls to the walls kind of a way.  EDIT 2: I really do like the eureka mechanic I have to say ! the game does have it's improvements, don't get me wrong, but the tediousness of previous issues is still there even though you already learned to play around them. Ghandi no longer a warmonger though :)  EDIT 3: just got denounced by scythia because 'my empire is going towards bankupcy' in 580BC. I have 1600gold and +16 gole income per turn. nice. real nice.  EDIT 4: now scythia every few turns declares they like the fact I have a lot of money, interchanging with how they dislike me for going towards bankrupcy - no change in money situation, stable income between 12 and 20 gold per turn.",

The game itself is a turn based long term strategy game where you guide your empire through the ages to achieve world dominance. The basic gameplay is simple enough for a newcomer like me to understand, but there is still depth if you want to optimize your strategies. There are almost an unlimited amount of strategies to pursue and even victory can be achieved by many different ways. Each approach has their pros and cons, and more often than not having a balance of economy, science, culture, religion and military seems like the way to go.  I don't want to bother my readers any longer and therefore I'll jump straight to the conclusions. Overall I'd rank this as one of the better turn based strategy games I've played, but not my favorite. (advance wars -series and chess will always be close to my heart).

            "review_text": "Okay, after 100 hours of gameplay, I feel qualified to write this. This game gets a lot right and a few things wrong. I have won games through the space race and the cultural victory and have not lost on king level.  The good:  1. The graphics are excellent. People complain about the cartoony feel of them. I agree in some aspects. Units and leaders are cartoony. Terrain, wonders and features are not. The units could be less cartoony, but the leaders are EXCELLENT.  2. The depth of the game is much more advanced than other civ games. There are more kinds and types of resources that all help your cities develop. In Civ V, you needed food and luxuries to grow your cities. In 6, you need housing, food, and amenities which are kinda like luxuries but come from many sources. This is just one example.  3. The game is more shaped by the map than in previous editions. Climate and terrain are some of the most influential contributing factors to cultural development, and so terrain helps suggest and shape a path for your civilization.  4. The cultures are much more thought out with their advantages and disadvantages. Some cultures have a natural inclination towards a certain type of victory, but you can often pursue different avenues to victory.  5. City layout is both more pleasing to the eye and more fun to watch than in previous versions. Wonders are built over time and you can visibly check their progress as they are built.  6. Barbarians are a big challenge. They can really ruin your day. Single units against barbarians are just meat.  7. There are many paths to victory especially in the early game. There is no race to build certain wonders before the AI that greatly increase your chances of winning. In Civ 5, I would always race towards the great library and Chichen Itza. Now you have more things you can do.  Now the things that need improvement:  1. Diplomacy: The various leaders all have their own agendas and seem to follow them a bit illogically. You really need to watch your army strength in this version as even friendly nations will come after you if you have things they want. They are much less likely to come after you if you have a middling or higher ranked army. Several players have mentioned that historically friendly cultures will attack you without cause, and they are right.  2. The map is smaller, feels cramped and resources tend to clump up. In the game I'm working on now for example, there are no less than 7 pearls resources within 3 tiles of each other. Map generation is such that land masses almost universally stretch from north to south so that navies are pretty pointless in most games. Even in games set to islands.  3. Game pace feels wrong. Its soooo easy to race ahead in tech and culture that you do not have time to build most of the things you want till later eras. Many wonders are left behind till later eras. ie. I built the pyramids in the modern era... Everything seems to take too long to build especially ships and wonders. Often you can develop a tech, and start building that new unit and develop a newer, higher tech unit before you can build the first one....ie. ironclads -&gt; battleship.  4. Wonders are interesting yet somewhat underwhelming in effect. Some are very nice like the ones that add civic cards to any government you are using at the time. Some are seriously meh. like the one that increase production for lake tiles... midly pointless in 90% of games.  5. If you survive past the medieval era, its very easy to get a tech lead and win any way you choose. I don't feel the need to specialize most of my cities to achieve the victory I want. The AI doesn't upgrade its units or build many more advanced ones. In my current game by example, Germany just threatened me with his huge army of horsemen against my army of musketmen and field cannon....Army strength calculation is warped so the AI always thinks its stronger than it is. The AI is stupid on attack often running from the city or unit it is just about to conquer because its units are weak and I just moved a supporting unit within attack range.  6. There are fewer types of maps to generate. You are limited to continents, pangea, islands, and one I just call random type. Even in islands mode, you can get huge land masses.  7. Ill use this point for a catchall for minor things. The UI doesn't have interfaces that allow you to keep track of many items ie. trade, population, land area, etc. Movement takes waaaaay too long to get anywhere. Exploration ai for your units is very very stupid... you often have to unstick your units to keep them moving in the right direction. etc  All in all this game has started out much better than Civ 5 did. There are doubtless expantions and patches coming to balance many of the issues I discussed. The game is VERY fun for the first 3rd of the game with the AI being both relevant and dangerous. The later game always ends with you dominating the AI because it forgets where its going.",

The civilizations feel a bit inconsistent in my opinion, some have a super obvious victory condition (e.g. Scythia, Aztecs) where others are incredibly flexible (e.g. Russia). It's not a big deal at all, it just felt awkward to me.   Barbarians are present, and by that I mean they'll defeat you if you don't build units to kill their scouts. Which can be frustrating but my first game when I tried to build no units, I honestly found it to be a nice surpfise to have my capjtal surrounded by barbarians. It's something you wouldn't see in Civ5.   City-states now have a nice variety of quests (instead of just killing a camp every damn time), additionally they have individual unique bonuses for being their suzeran (equivalent to ally in civ5) and you can levy their military to control their units, which is something I always wanted in Civ5 (Feels like they really listened to the communith and wat hed how we played).   Overall if you liked Civ5 then you'll like Civ6 even more. Also to those ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the art style, shut up the game is gorgeous now.",

Cities require walls to defend now which is logical and much more strategic. Cities without walls can be taken over very easily.  Culture is 100x better now. No longer is it just a simple mechanic with bonus trees, but now there is a culture 'tech' tree that you must put thought into when selecting policies, and governments (which make a return here in Civ 6).  Governments are strategic and an awesome idea. I just wish there were more of them. Which I'm sure will come in time (and with paid DLC)...  Barbarians are so much better now, they actually make sense, and add depth and not annoyance (for the most part) to the game. They spam units at times, but it only makes them more challenging when their fort is close to your base.  Diplomacy and diplomatic victories don't make a comeback in this series of Civ. Sad because I actually liked trying to hold leader of the global congress and trying to elect myself world ruler (which I never mananged to do sadly).  Computer AI is handicapped in this Civ game, which sucks for single player, and when players leave in multiplayer. But to counter that just play against real people. The game is more enjoyable that way anyhow, and you can roleplay better and more readily in multiplayer.  So far I like almost everything about this Civ game more than Civ 5 with all the DLC, I just wish: - The AI was not so stupid and actually tried taking your cities, made unit formations, and balanced diplomacy better -1 - There were more government choices -0 - There were more policy choices -0 - There were more civilizations to choose from -1 - There was more futuristic (and end game) technologies at the end of the tech tree. Something to make it seem more futuristic and abstract. Maybe robot drones, teleporters, advanced buildings, mechs, something to make it reasonable to tech incredibly fast to dominate with unstoppable technology. -0 - The graphics style was realism and not cartoonified... This was probably my least favorite change, but is something I can live with. Afterall it likely has to do with the style they went with for the fog of war and map in general. -1  So basically I just wish there was a little more to the game, but these things are almost certainly going to come with coming paid DLC. The only question you should ask yourself: is it ethical to make user pay extra for content that probably should've been in the base game?  Overall rating: 7/10",

The a.i. is different than it was in Civ 5. Thats a good thing; it keeps things interesting.  The other civs seem to adjust their agression based on a more sophisticated assesment of your intent rather than a simple calculation of the size and quality of your military.   When I setup a military geared civ I'm more likely to be attacked by other people. If I start putting military encampments in all of my cities, build a large standing army, and focus on developing military technology, my neighbors are more likely to attack me. They want to attack me before I get even bigger and stronger and can destroy them.  When I play a peaceful civ and build only a small military, without investing in encampments, and prioritize peaceful technology and policy, my neighbors tend to be much friendlier. Even when they are grumpy and denounce me they don't declare war if I'm not worth their time.  The new builders and road system is still a bit weird to me. I've always really enjoyed using legions of workers to build superior infrastructure from the early game. The new system makes that building more challenging. It's slower and I have to be more strategic about where I improve tiles. That seems super cool. I'm still getting used to it though.   The barbarians though....... They are a force to be reckoned with. It really changes the early game.     ",

Lots of change always garners a negative response from the gaming community, especially die-hard fans of series. Being a die-hard fan of the Civilization series myself I am delighted by the refreshing updates to the system that works so well. That might be because (and I wonder how many people will remember these) I stared on the Activision series Civilization: Call to Power. For me, transitioning to the Sid Meier's series at Civilization 3 was a refreshing change of pace, just as the changed religion, branching civics tree, and interesting eureka quests alongside the numerous updates to combat is an amazing change from the powerhouse that was Civ V.  The other point of hate I see and don't understand is that its not good for new players. Just as every other civ game it has intuitive advisors that allow people to learn as they play. It is perfectly viable for new players, and I cannot understand why people are saying this.  Finally, the bad AI is the last main reason to garner hate, and for that I refer you to the horrendous AI that was in Civ V that only mods could (marginally) fix. A lot of the glaring errors are now fixed after the fall update and as thus, the AI is probably going to be innately better than that of Civ V.",

To me it seems it sucks even more than civ5. At king you'll notice the AI spamming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t units all the time. They still use them as ♥♥♥♥ but it's annoying as hell - AI keep trying to convert your cities. If you're near a religious civ (like 2/3rds) they'll keep sending their stupid missionaries to your cities over and over.

Cities are managed WAY differently and governments are much more complex. There's more depth with unit/corps/army composition including dedicated support units. The AI is a bit more brutal, I've heard of many times where AI's kill each other off within 100 turns - though I'm still not sure how I feel about Ghandi's hidden agenda (holdover from Civ V's mid-to-late game warmonger vs. the peaceful protester that I've read about). It might still annoying that barbarians can progress in technology as fast as nations, but they seem so far to be more manageable in numbers, that or I've been lucky. Other things like roads, builders, archaeologists, and a few other random things are welcome changes.  I think I'll have a 1000 or more great hours of playtime on this game before the next one comes out.",

            "review_text": "I've been a fan of Civ for ages upon ages. This version is an upgrade to the old game with a few changes. I've read through and seen some negative reviews of it, and have to say, a lot of what some people are complaining about is very trivial. I love this game, I think it's a great improvement, I would recomend it, and I would tell the smug people writing poor reviews to eat a d***!!!   I will however list my top 5 pros and cons:  PROS * The Music. Seriously, Civ6 has an amazing score. Better yet, it is fit to each Civ and the era you are in. * Districts. This is probably the biggest change in the game itself, and it is an interesting system, it make sense, and it offers some good strategy to the game in more than one way. * I love the new look, it's a gorgous game, and the new art style takes me back to the old Civ4-CivRev days, but with the feel of Civ5. A well blended mixture of the old and new that is pleasent to the eye. * I like the way they changed the entire Civics Policies and Tech Policies, giving you two trees to work through. It works really well, and progresses at a good pace in each game speed mode.  * Not enough people are talking about the menus. Start menu, multi player menu, the tech trees, all the way to the city menues, they did a great job improving everything all around (especially after the new patch lets you change the city names, thank you DEV team!!!) What sticks out the most to me is the Multi Player menus, and Multi Player in general now, big improvement, much smoother and easy to navigate. It just FEELS right!  CONS  * Even the Fastest speeds (Online, Quick) seem to take forever to run through. I personallyt like marathons, but I have noticed the quick games can still take 2-3 sittings to finish. Thats fine in single player for the most part, but when you play Online, you want to start and finsh a game in one session especially if you are playing a pick up game. With a group of gaming buddies, Marathon games can be some serious epic games though!  * AI is still f*cktarted! Their war strategies (or lack there of--- seriously, they just CHARGE! or RUN AWAY) I've experienced countless matches where another civ just gets in the way when I'm at war with another Civ, just posted up around their borders, this can be a real cluster f*ck in small maps if one of the AI civs tends to spam units often. * I was hoping for more leaders on launch. I know there will be planty to com in future DLC, but I want them NOW! It's also not a matter of there not being ENOUGH, because really, their are plenty, but I'm just used to Civ5 and the 1800 Civs you can play as! * Not enough Maps. Where's the US map, Accurate World map, European Map? Seriously lacking in this area. I've also played way too many matches in Continents where I start off on my own continent without a single AI Civ. Nearly HALF of my Coninents matches have been this way. * I'm all out of Cons so I'll complain about the AI some more. Seriously, the AI is f*cktarted. Changing difficulty doesnt change their play style or tactics, either, it only gives them unbalanced handicaps  All in all, this game is amazeballs. If you like strategy games, buy this game. Dont wait, dont listen to the nit picking @$$holes, just buy it, you will enjoy it, I promise.",

I came into the game without really reading up on what they were changing from V and was really surprised with the way that builders work in this iteration. Gone are the days of creating builders and turning them onto auto build. Now builders have a specific amount if things they can do before they disappear, which, in turn, means that you have to be more strategic with them. Besides that, there is the change to the tech tree since they split civic advancements apart from tech advancements which means that when you go about generating culture, you are actually doing it for a tangible advance.  I have seen others state that the game's AI isn't that great, and while I agree, I don't mind it that much since I don't play these games for a challenge. That said, I don't think that it takes anything away from game in general, and honestly, if you are on the fence about buying the game the best way to describe it is that it's Civilzation. If you weren't a fan of the previous games you probably won't like this one either.",

However, Civ 6's gameplay has seen enough distinct changes that make this iteration in the franchise feel unique while still maintaining that Civilization feel. The district system is Civ 6's shining feature that actually makes city planning complex and interesting, compared to Civ 5 where once you got a feel for the game, city location felt like the only real strategy. Civ 6 is not without its fault, however, but many issues with the AI, warmongering penalties, etc have been addressed in the recent Fall Update patch. Civ 6 still needs some features that are clearly lacking, such as the city production queue and fixes/improvements to the UI (which in some ways feels like a downgrade to previous Civ games). But while Firaxis is often silent on their upcoming plans, they are clearly listening to the community, as seen in the recent patch, and I have high hopes for continuing improvements to the game and the future of its DLCs and expansions.",

Since the number of districts a city can have is also limited by population, you must prioritize which districts are the most important to your strategy.

This is not to say it is a bad game, but its unfamiliarity would even have new and old players ponder what everything does. Everything has been balanced very well, but noticing the turns take longer then expected.  Engine has been revamped. Remember ('Member'?') when map was huge and playing friends then disconnected? Ugh, that was abysmal. Well, They did NOT Fix THAT. So if you are planning on playing with friends, be prepared for a rude awakening.   Two trees you now have to research with that involves Science and Culture. This is familiar, but what they in fact did was put cards that you can change every 2-10 turns. One moment you are reinforcing your armies and pushing them out the door sort of speak. Then another you are conservative and cutting costs to not only maintain, but to save money and upgrade your units.  Units have been changed such as promotion and even the workers themselves. The workers have between 3-5 turns before they retire involuntary. This means you have to be careful on what you build, if its truly important or not. Traders build the roads and provide the eyes and ears of your competitors. Promotions have been greatly changed for the better. Not only do they add perks, but they also heal. Again, this is not to say these are bad, but different. Spies are used differently now too, used to be just a tab in the menu to determine where you want them to go. Now, they are actual units. You can have them steal money, technology, science whatever you like. Or can have them protect your own. Even the faith-based units have been changed a bit. There are apostle which can be used as warriors to defeat incoming faith which I admit is exceptional. There have been many times I was getting frustrated that there was nothing I could do before in Civilization V.  A.I. Is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you have 6 people, 4 of them will hate you and will go to war with you for no reason.  Overall, it is highly satisfactory. If they fix the ever so minor issues I consider this a masterpiece in comparison with the previous games. I have completed over 470 hrs in civilization 5 and aiming to double with this game. Wait until this game get's fixed, because you are likely to still play with civilization V.",

If you ever enjoyed one of the previous games you will love this, and eventhough you might think 'why don't they learn from previous CIV games and keep the cool gameplay/interfase features when they worked so well before', you'd still want to play this game. It has some of the best new introductions in a CIV game so far, and I am positive they will listen to the community and make changes accordingly.  Regarding the graphics: Don't adopt other people's opinions - the graphics and the leader interfase interaction pages might look a little cartoonish, but I like it to be honest; it never looked real in previous CIV games and it doesn't now - I don't see the issue.  Buy the game because you love CIV and want to play more of it, and I promise you wont regret it.  Cons: - Unit cycling often sends other units across the map when you want to decide the new unit. - Diplomacy needs an overhaul. The AI doesn't seem to have any understanding of the words 'DO NOT CONVERT MY CITIES!', it will say 'oh my, I am sorry - we will stop' - next turn it will continue to convert your cities. - Religion pressure is less understandable now and less visible - it would have been nice to have some of the CIV V features where one would be able to keep better track of the pressure. - Some times a unit wont cycle so you can't end your turn until you manually found THE ONE unit with movement left.  WILL UPDATE CONTINOUSLY.",

Given how good the previous games became after a few patches this will probably turn out to be the best Civ game so far (including the previous versions with DLCs).  I love the unstacked cities (districts) and how civics and government gives a new dimension to your tactics and planning. The boosts to tech/civics research is also a great feature. Graphics wise it feels fresh, but not dumbed down as some claims - I am generally a sucker for realistic graphics (loved the Blue marble mod for CivIV). Performance is really good, in comparison to how bad both Civ IV and Civ V was on release.  A definite buy, which will just keep on improving. 8/10 on release, and when AI tweaks are done a definite 10/10.",

Pros:  *District Management, a swell feature and alot of fun puzzling them with each other. Each district can be constructed on a specific tile, that goes for world Wonders as well. Not all buildings crammed up into the city.  * Visual, many have complained that the cartoonish style looked like a mobile game. Its too childish, yada,yada boom de yada. FOr me, i have no problem. I played Borderlands which had a cartoonish graphical style, i played Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 which falled in to the same opinion, oh its cartoonish.. For me, its just makes things clearer.  * City State Diplomacy, finally no more 'here ya go with this gold now you are my B****!'. They removed the gold gifting from Civ V which made it stale and boring, here we go with Envoys. A specific type of resource that can be used to gain influence and become suzerian. An oh Suzerian, a new type of improvement that grants each citystate a diffrent type of unique bonues, some are awesome and some are medicore (Preslav.... I still love you but give me something else instead of combat bonus towards cavalary on hills).   Cons:  * AI, here comes the biggest concern for me. Playing against a stupid AI makes me feel smart and i dont like it.... Honestly when i pull off something that makes players goes 'OH My'... Myself be like: 'Is this too easy?' I always sucked at video games from the beginning at 5 years old. But thats just me but something is off... Really off, i had a hard time achieving a victory in Civ V on King but here i am rolling through both science, culture and somewhat domination on score/lead (i am not a warmongerer).... Something is definitley off, at least i should be winning in science.  *Glitchy, a glitch in the system? I have not encountered hard ones that made me start a new game and delete my previous save but i have encountered some nice mostly visual glitches. For example, the low texture on leaders hair switches off and on when i start my Civ 6 from steam. Its something todo that i did not get all the info from the start so i have to change graphics in option which then leads me to restart whole Civ 6 because Graphic Change. Also some embarked units acts like Jesus and walks on water until it registers that they are on a boat.. Just visual ones.  * Sorting, here is something that makes me cringe. Sorting.... Sorting my traderoutes, sorting the civ that leads culture... Demographics, where is that? Sorting Citystate (may not be that nessecary)  Here is my final value, its a solid 8/10. Civ V delivered it a bit better as a 8.01/10 but this one came close. =)  Final Score: 8/10, recommends it.",

There are still issues that needs to be fixed but at least the game is now somewhat enjoyable to play.  [Original Review]  As much as I'd like to give a recommendation I can't while the game is being what it is at the moment.   For me the biggest flaw is the awfull UI. It's buggy (misleading information here and there), not responsive (mouse hover is a pain), not enough information (it simply just hides information that should be there), not fast to use (not enough hotkeys etc.) and a lot of other little things. It doesn't courage you to plan carefully which makes this game very shallow.  There are also bunch of bugs that makes me wonder if the game is working properly in other areas. Trading is broken, I've faced some crashing in certain situations where I'm changin policies (crashes to the desktop) and minor bugs here and there. How can I trust that this is what they wanted in a first place.  I know Civ 4 and 5 were not perfect at their launch either but that shouldn't be a reason to give this game a positive feedback at the moment. Almost every thing that bothers me about this game is kind of a bug that should have been caugh in in-house testing progress. If they intentionally released the game knowing these problems exists then I think they deserve a negative feedback.  Yes, they made some very interesting changes to the game and added some nice new mechanisms but those can't outcome the fact that this game feels like a pre-release version.  Reviews you can see at the store page written by some companies such as PC Gamer, IGN and Game Informer: 'I'll never need another Civ game in my life besides this one', 'Possibly the biggest and deepest game in the series' 25-year history' and 'One of the most rewarding 4X experiences to date'. Did they even play the game? Those are some bs reviews.",
