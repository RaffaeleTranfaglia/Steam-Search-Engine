            "review_text": "It's an alpha runner, alright.   You jump, before the platform you stand on disappears in fade-away style.   There's different characters with specific abilities you can use. I haven't figured out how to specifically select them; they're on auto-random select, so you might get any character or the same one every time you start a new game (which happens every few seconds). Ummm... I think that's it.   The only fun and challenge I got out of this game was getting myself to play it. And going for a score of over 200 on normal mode (253).   The end.",

            "review_text": "THIS GAME CAUSED MY COMPUTER TO TOTALLY CRASH AFTER 1 HOUR OF PLAYING.  Alpha runner is a very basic endless platformer game. You are given a random character from a selection of about 5 or 7 characters everytime you restart or die and you must dodge saws, clouds and spikes. You must also obviously not fall down and every single platforms break if you stand on them for a few milliseconds/seconds.  It's very frustating to play, because it's really clunky, your character looks like it is about to fall down then it briefly teleports to the edge of the platform, sometimes you 'double jump' on yourself while trying to jump which can get you killed. Sometimes the screen briefly freezes or the game briefly slows down which can you killed too. It's unforgivable to have all of this happen in a game where you start over when you die.  Also, there's some dumb achievements like just for opening the game and one for dying 1000 times (execpt for the other pointless 'rain' grinding achievement, I would be 100% done with the game within 30 minutes.  Overall, there are much better games of this genre out there and I don't think it's worth purchasing. Too buggy and too simple. The game feature 3 modes but they are so similar, it basically makes no difference.",

No idea what I was doing half the time, the controller works but I was never sure what buttons to push when the minigames started so I didn't really enjoy them that much. They were interestingly unexpected. This is a very basic game.   Pro:  -simple yet fun  Con:  -menu sucks -minigames don't really tell you what you are supposed to do until it is too late ",
