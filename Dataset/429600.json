            "review_text": "The Pupeet Thief offers a much more simple hidden object themed game. Typically each hidden object screen hides 12 items for you to find. This is a small amount when compared to most other games of this type. The graphics are decent, but not great. The storyline is fun, slightly different, but still secondary to the puzzles and hidden object. Overall the game was pleasant with decent voice acting and enough entertainment to make this a recommendation for others to play if this like this sort of genre.",

            "review_text": "A good, classic hidden-object game, recommended for lovers of the genre. The graphics are lush and charming, the hidden-object scenes are many, good, and fair, and the puzzles are well balanced.  The only deficiency of this game is the rather thin story. The idea that the Brothers Grimm created an academy for 'magical examiners' is rather silly, and nothing in the arbitrary plot has anything to do 'fairy tales' despite the name. (The sequel to this game more directly refers to fairy tales.)  Finally, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!",

            "review_text": "So going by the name I was expecting a twisted version of Pinocchio, but luckily it had more to do with a devilish puppeteer and his evil sorcery (spoiler?), which to be honest seemed far more interesting. THe story is quite straightforward, serving mostly as an excuse for different locations and the introduction of several 'characters' and their puzzles. Regardless it is an entertaining little puzzle adventure with hidden object games that make good use of 'hiding in plain sight'.",
