            "review_text": "This game had a few issues; The collision with other enemies is atrocious. You'll often take damage without even touching the incoming ship. The bullets are ok though; This collision issue gets worse when you notice the area you can move in around is much smaller than it looks; It crashed a few times which is really annoying; Not all menus can be controlled by keyboard, for example I couldn't close the medal earned windows, it's rather annoying to have to click it with the mouse when I'm mostly playing this with the keyboard;  Speaking of the menus, their click area also seems to be a bit off. Sometimes the option doesn't get lit up even though the mouse is hovering over it. Should respond to a rectange that expands well beyond the text to avoid such annoyance; Some weapons seemed clearly more powerful and useful than the others, so that got me into not even bothering with the other ones; The default options have to be changed. I only noticed there was a woman talking on the second time I played the game - the default Music Volume value severely overpowers both the voice (which is quite useful) and the game sounds; There is a large number of resolutions available... but not mine? (1600x900) Really? C'mon... Also, the W resolutions (which I suppose stands for Widescreen) for some reason make the game display wrong. It'll not show up fully to the top, so you'll not see most enemies that appear near the top. I don't know if I crapped the configs up to get that effect or what, but it happened, so I switched to windowed mode at 1024x768 I settled with that; The time limit for the bosses is annoying. I killed a boss at the last few seconds of the time limit, and it ran out and killed me while the boss was exploding. It offered me to continue, which I accepted, it completed the mission and for some reason the next one no enemies could shoot and they would die a few instants after entering the screen. Not sure if related, but, that's a glitch right there....  That aside, it was pretty fun, though nothing memorable. I personally found the soundtrack a bit weird, I felt like I was playing God of War or some ♥♥♥♥ lol",

It's a shame as I do enjoy a good shoot-em up, but alas I found this to be wanting. While you can use the XB360 controller I found it to be a little patchy and tended to pull to the right on it's own at times - not a good thing. Glad I got this as part of a bundle with some better games as I wouldn't want to pay full price for it. Worth a look if it comes on offer at 99p!!",

            "review_text": "Quick review coming from a shmup lover.  The Good : - the game does't look too bad. By today's standards, it doesn't look too good either, but I wouldn't mind if it played ok. - Music sounds good, but...  The Bad : - Controls are rigid. Don't even try to play with an XBOX360 controller... - Patterns are repetitive. - I have a big feeling problem with this game. Can't feel the power of the weapons. Can't feel when I'm hit. This is probably because the sound in the game is not very well balanced. - ... the sounds FX are weak. Can't hear any explosion. Shot sounds are flat and weak. - Music sounds totally inappropriate. It's good, but it feels like it's the music from another game...  Definitely not worse the full price.",

            "review_text": "Razor2: Hidden Skies is a sci-fi 'bullet hell' game made by the Brazilian studio responsible for Bad Rats - Invent 4 Entertainment. The numeral '2' appended to the name of the game begs the question as to the whereabouts of the original game. There was no Razor 1 listed on Invent 4's website which leads me to believe this is the only publicly available game in this series. Unable to find any mention of an original game, it leads me to speculate that the developers artificially appended the title with a '2' to make it seem like a more successful franchise than it actually is.   Razor2 seems to make strides in being as mediocre as possible. Much of each level seems to insult the value of your time by presenting you with repetitive and uninteresting fill content. Most attacks simply vanish into the enemies and offer little to no indication that you're actually doing damage which both makes you wonder if you're using the right weapon and leaves up unsatisfied in the shoot 'em up experience.   To the game's merit many of the enemies have a very appealing design albeit a bit generic. The game's soundtrack is very orchestral that made the game feel a bit like a movie. The boss fights offered a fair challenge but enduring the levels of mediocrity to get to them failed to make the endeavor worthwhile.  The game offers you three lives and a single continue. Once these are depleted you are forced to start the game from the beginning.  The game does support USB controllers but only in game as navigating the menu seemed to require the mouse at some point.  Score: 4.5/10",

My first complaint are bosses WHY WHY oh WHY do you have just a billion enemies spawn already cutting of what little mobility you have (Pet Peeve). The 2nd is the upgrade system, because of how I feel damage is dealt ,and how the stages tend to play there really is no point to upgrading anything but the spread shot beacause your shots are either going through which tells me that only one is hitting at a time afterwards just go regen you can't die unless you actually try to. As I said before the controls (I was using a PS3 controller) for some reason I kept switching sub weapons for no reason I had to check if I accidently assigned something to the same button but nope.  All in All just avoid this game I feel awful for installing this game on my PC",
