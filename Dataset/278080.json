I see all the hype about hyrule warriors and get an itch, I see this game on steam and it has pretty good reviews, so I buy it, then suddenly almost 100 hours later into the game and I'm not done with it, what the heck it's fantastic. It's pure and simple dynasty warriors with an outrageous amount of content. If you have no love at all for the series or this type of game you won't have much fun, but for anyone looking and unsure of curious I implore you to get this game you will not be disapointed by the amount of content at the very least.",

            "review_text": "Look upon my hours spent on this game, ye mighty, and despair.  I'm not saying you too will be spending over 280 hours killing hordes of Chinese peons upon buying the latest version of  Dynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends , but there is something innately satisfying to the series. If all you have is a PC and you haven't played any games from the franchise since Warriors Orochi, then you owe it to yourself to shell out for this version. Especially if there's a steam sale or some such.  Dynasty Warriors 8 is uncomplicated yet deep, with a huge cast of characters just waiting to be experimented upon, each character with their own unique gimmick/playstyle. This really needs to be stressed: Omega Force, the developer of the series, has done a bang-up job establishing exclusive weapon mechanics for each of its 82 characters that will keep you engrossed in finding out how to best maximize your slaying prowess. They're introduced 3 at a time at the beginning of each stage in Story Mode and even their higher functions are unlocked through leveling, so you're never intimidated by having everything thrown to you at once.  At least, not in Story Mode. Outside of Story Mode are scores of extraneous game mechanics which ultimately add nothing to the game, forcing new enthusiasts to run to any of the (honestly quite excellent) player submitted FAQS for help. The weapon system in particular needs to go, where a character's fighting style will be based on the weapon rather than the character. So if Lu Bu is equipped with Guan Yu's crescent spear, he'll start fighting like Guan Yu. Meaning you can have Lu Bu jump around like a little girl by equipping him with, say, Daqiao's magical sticks. My point is that giving every character the choice of every weapon allows cheesing and actually takes away from the uniqueness of the characters. The focus of the game shouldn't be on inanimate objects anyways.  Then there are game modes which will confuse potential players with poorly thought out goals, such as Ambition Mode. The levels are grindy, repetitive and mostly there for the gems and materials needed for upgrading your weapons or artificially leveling your characters. All the money you'll gain playing Story Mode will be spent on the faculties you've built in Ambition Mode, but you have to play Ambition Mode to get the materials that upgrade these faculties into something useful.  Tied to that is my huge disappointment stemming from my experiences playing ye olde Dynasty Warriors 3 on the PS2 in that for a game mode based upon the stated goal of reunifying China, there is little to no strategy involved at all! Ambition Mode introduces Bodyguards, friendly generals whom you can order around the map and change the course of a battle with their special abilities. In practice however, their influence on the battlefield remains minimal. So Ambition Mode becomes randomly generated stages where you unify China under a single Emperor by killing every Chinese general personally and thus bringing them forth to your cause. Bodyguards are a great idea on paper but suffers from no one on the development team having any faith behind it, leading to another extraneous and useless game mechanic.  Free Mode is Story Mode but with added goals. Optional goals. And you can play with the Bodyguards unlike in Story Mode. But it's the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. Offers literally nothing that couldn't be added to Story Mode. Like I said: lots of useless clutter in this game.  I (most probably) won't be buying a Wii U but it'll be interesting to see just how Hyrule Warriors compares to the Dynasty Warriors franchise. I remain optimistic in promoting DW8XL, though: as useless as the new options are, Hyrule Warriors doesn't seem to offer any new options themselves. And for all the mistakes that Omega Force have made, they have managed to create 82 characters each with their own engaging fighting style. And that is an achievement in itself.",

            "review_text": "Dynasty Warriors 8 is a hack and slash action game that was previously available mostly on console system. Now available on PC and Steam, this game includes the Extreme Legends DLC and even though that this is a PS3 port, it's very enjoyable, the control is good, the performance is good, the gameplay is awesome. I'm a fan of Dynasty Warriors by the way.  The story are now more focused on each kingdom and you can choose from the kingdom of Shu, Wei, Wu or the later new established Jin Dynasty. You can also play the story of Lu Bu and other officers that are not part of the three kingdom like Yuan Shao or Meng Huo. And then on each stages, you can play one of up to four participating characters in that stage/battle.  The graphics of the game is improved from the previous game but still not as advanced as any game to date, you can judge that from the system requirements. Texture of the game is somewhat poor too on cutscene. Animations still pretty much the same, just with some new animations. Physics also still pretty much the same too.  As for the performance, it doesn't have issues of any kind, no lags, no stutter, the game runs pretty smooth and very playable. I play it on Windows 8.1 and there has been no issues at all. Well, I do encounter a minor bugs but it will not hinder your gameplay or playthrough at all. One of the bug is, at Hu Lao Gate, when I defeat Diaochan, the announcement says 'Diaochan is enraged by the struggles of Lu Bu.' It should be the other way around.  Now for the feature, each characters now has unique abilites if they're using their default weapon, and now can use Rage. I simply call it, advanced musou, as it will consume all the musou energy when using it. A new game mode called Ambition Mode also present here, I won't spoil it though, it's quite interesting. The Challenge Mode also make a return here. A weapons type now includes an affinity. There three affinity, it is Heaven, Man or Earth each will outdo another.  Overall the game is good and recommended to play. Even that this is a port from the console version, it's still very enjoyable. The game only lacks multiplayer online, if only at least an online co-op is included, this game will be perfect. I recommend this.  Rating 8/10",

Nothing is more satisfying than killing 50 chinese soldiers with the flick of your wrist and altering chinese history on the hypothetical path so that the WEI MASTER RACE REIGNS SUPREME.  The staggering amount of story and off-story content is amazing. I found that the ambition mode is surprisingly addictive and trying to get all of the bonus objectives for each mission is a great challenge that takes a lot of time to complete.  10/10 would buy empires dlc.

            "review_text": "Honestly, a great game for anyone who enjoys the Dynasty Warriors series.  I had originally played Dynasty Warriors 2-6 (including Extreme Legends and Empires), and had acquired this in hopes of reliving my childhood. One thing that this game has that differs from the older titles is the ability to swap between two weapons (both can be chosen from a LARGE assortment of different weapons). This allows many different combos to be made. This also allows you to switch out a particular character's weapons out of that character (ie: Zhao Yun using Pang Tong's weapon instead of his own + another weapon), which, personally, I am not a huge fan of, for I enjoyed using a new character and seeing what his strengths and weaknesses are.   Addionally, a new feature called 'Storm Rush' was introduced. When using a weapon which has a type advantage over an enemy officer, you will see a blue crystal ontop of the officer. After using the weapon with the type advantage and breaking all 3 sections of the crystal, your character will enter a mode where he unleases a bunch of powerful attacks on enemies infront of (or around) him/her. While this may seem good, having a weapon with a type DISADVANTAGE on an enemy officer will result in your attacks not causing flinch to them. This makes it so switching between weapons with different types almost neccesary.  Additionally, switching weapons allows you to break some officer's attacks while they are charging them, and breaks guard. This is different than the older titles where an enemy's officers guard was a pain to get through. Personally, I still prefer the old system, as it encouraged repositioning.   The soundtrack of this game is AMAZING (just like the soundtrack of the older titles). The additional characters and Jin add a lot to this game.  Overall, a game I definitely recommend. Now if only I had more time to play it...",

You think how this is no SimCity or any of the other simulation, the answer is easy and very logical through battles. Through battles you gain ressources, allies or fame. (Fame is important for how much allies you can have, allies are important for building your village up you have a allies cap on buildings you need ... allies to build that, and second allies are useful in battles as body guard or generals)  And you have the arcade levels hack n slash mode, where you hack as much as possible in a limited time on a small map.  The level cap is 150 and you have tons of characters, which means you can play that game possibly to 1000 hours and up.

            "review_text": "While I love this game to death, I think it's worth noting that it is a Dynasty Warriors game, and if you haven't liked Musou games up to this point, you're probably not going to like this one either. That aside, this game is one of my favorites at the moment, I'd like to break this game down category by category, but tl;dr is at the bottom.   Gameplay  -------------------- I won't waste time here explaining the DW gameplay mechanics in depth, but suffice to say, you'll take your overpowered character of choice, and use them as a wrecking ball to destroy generic soldiers to enemy officers. Each character is skilled with different types of weapons and has two unique combos with their respective armament. Of course, there are generic combos and skills associated with a weapon that anybody can utilize, but the special combos make your character that much more deadly. One new addition is the affinity triangle - basically every weapon has an affinity on it and certain affinities work better against others. This is a refreshing, though it basically boils down to doing more or less damage to an enemy depending on who has the affinity advantage.  While there are several different modes to enjoy, there are many times that modes like Ambition (where you develop a forward camp into a palace, recruit officers, etc.) can feel like an endless grind. I've put a good deal of hours here and still have a while to go. Though stages have different objectives (randomly generated) in this mode, they more or less boil down to 'kill officer A'. Once you get familiar with these, I can see how the gameplay could get old fast.   Graphics  -------------------- I look at graphics in two different categories: design and polish. Design-wise, this game is one of the better ones. The weapons all look cool in their own ways, environments are authentic and very appropriate for the game, and the characters are unique in their own ways. Veterans can argue that they look similar to previous entries into the DW series, but they've never gotten old to me.  Polish is a bit of a different series. The graphics aren't bad by any means, but they aren't outstanding either. To touch on what I said earlier, there are times it feels like they didn't improve the graphics at all, but simply recycled them from older games. It hasn't bothered me yet, but I will say that if you're looking for a graphical masterpiece - you won't find it here.   Sound  -------------------- I've always felt that if gameplay wasn't what you remembered DW for, it's the soundtrack, and DW8 is certainly no exception. The musical score in this game is excellent and has a ton of tracks. The tracks are asian-themed, and really help you get immersed into the action. This is usually the case with DW games, and DW8 continues the trend perfectly. As of the posting of this review, the majority of the soundtrack is available on YouTube, so you can evaluate before you buy (I'm thinking you won't be disappointed).  Also, you can get the original Japanese VAs through a free DLC - this made the sale for me. :)   Controls  -------------------- Before I begin, I used a wired 360 controller for this game, so I can't comment on the mouse and keyboard layout. Controls are simplistic, and easy to get the hang of. Using the default controls, the A button goes back and the B button confirms; this is standard for the Japanese, as I understand, but can be frustrating until you get the hang of it. Combat is another story completely.  Attacking and combos are easy enough to learn, and as you progress in difficulty, you'll find the need to put that into use more and more. Overall, once you get the controls down, I think you'll find them enjoyable and straightforward.    TL;DR  ------------------------- Pros:    Fun and addicting hack and slash gameplay   Great soundtrack   Game design makes levels feel immersive   Very good port - haven't crashed once and runs very smoothly   Lots of different weapon types and attack   Cons:    Gets really grindy, especially in Ambition mode and looking for good weapons   Graphics are fine, but nothing more   $190 worth of DLC, and there's no new levels?   When playing with X360 controller, on-screen buttons prompts still reflect keyboard controls.     Summary:  If you're a fan of DW or the hack and slash genre, this is a great game, and I think you'll get a lot of fun out of it. Otherwise, I'd hold out for a sale or just steer clear, if you're not a fan of the genre.",

If you are a fan of the series, and haven't bought this game on consoles already, then buy this game! It's a great update to a lot of the mechanics and all of the characters feel and play quite well. The campaign is a marked improvement over the DW7 campaign (except for the lack of a narrator, unfortunately).  Ambition Mode is a take it or leave it thing. It's a really good way to get good weapons and level characters, but if you want any sort of deep story from it, you'll find yourself disappointed.  And just in case you're wondering, no, this game does not have online co-op. Even with that disappointing fact though, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to fans of the DW series. If you've traditionally not liked the series, or have no idea what this is, I would peruse YouTube and see if it's your cup of tea.",

            "review_text": "Hey all you people reading the reviews to decide if you want to dish out the cash for this game, I'm here to tell you the actuality of the pros and cons of this game. Let me make this real simple in a T chart.  PROS: -High-action gameplay. -Rarely a dull moment. -LOTS of levels in Freemode, Story, and Ambition. -Play through the Lu Bu, Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin, and Other storylines! -Eat your weight in meatbuns and never gain a pound -Slaughter literally thousands of questionably innocent soldiers every battle. -over 70 playable characters and weapon types! -Fun, new hypothetical battles tied in well with the actual storyline. -Kill that sick sack of ♥♥♥♥, Dong Zhuo. -Works surprisingly well on an older computer like mine, zero lag or crashes so far. -After you configure the controls to match your preference it's actually pretty smooth to play. -If you played it on console you'd have to buy the base game and then Xtreme Legends as an expansion, on PC it's all packaged. So it's actually quite a bit cheaper this way.  CONS: -THERE IS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, ONLY LOCAL CO-OP (which sucks but personally I play it solo anyway) -For some reason, there's no spoken narration between battles. You've gotta read it, which really isn't all that bad. -After playing for 8-10 hours in a single day it starts to feel repetetive. -Replay value isn't tremendous, but isn't low either. -Koei bleeds you dry for additional DLC. -Graphics are downright emberassing during cutscenes on the non-playable characters. Not noticable during battles though.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  So in tl;dr format this is a very enjoyable game for a price that's actually quite a bit lower than on consoles, it runs flawlessly on my moderately older PC, has lot's of content, DOESN'T have online multiplayer (only local co-op), and let's you practiaclly commit a chinese genocide in every battle.

            "review_text": "As a huge fan of the DW series (played since DW2 came out on PS2), I highly enjoyed this game. They did a fantastic job on the new characters and the rage system is phenomenal. That being said, if you are brand new to the DW series I wouldn't recommend this game. I believe that you have to have a love for the series in order to enjoy this game, unless combat is your cup of tea. If you're brand new and appreciate story and cinematics more than combat, I would recommend DW4, DW6, or DW7 instead, all of which are some of the only few available on PC as well (luckily).  TL;DR: If you enjoy the DW series for the combat and not so much the plotline, then this game would be for you. If you are a DW loremaster like me (although I enjoy the combat as well), the other games in the series are extremely better.    ~~~~SPOILER WARNING FROM HERE ON OUT. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK~~~~     -The Bad-   The Story Mode is argubly the best mode in the game, next to Challenge Mode. Ambition Mode is almost literally a grindfest, and Free Mode is pretty pointless unless you're farming for weapons.   Difficulty:  That being said, Story Mode has some difficulty problems. If you play on normal difficulty setting, the game would be semi-difficult in the beignning stages but once you get to the 4th or 5th battle it gets ridiculously easy. Especially if you find decent weapons along the way. Basically the 1st battle is the hardest and the last battle is the easiest. If you try raising the difficulty, the beginning stages are ridiculously difficult, but if you can get past them the rest of the games difficulty should become easier. Regardless, you shouldn't have to up the difficulty of a game because you get baby fed OP weapons. Also, some characters gain rage meter ridiculously fast and it lets you cheese the battles (Xiahou Yuan for example).   Cutscenes:  The cutscenes were alright. There were other games in the series that had way more powerful cutscenes though. Most of the cutscenes were either someone dying or a random group of peon's running to an officer and just getting slaughtered. Also, from a story standpoint, the cutscenes were a little upsetting. Big important events that had cutscenes in all the other games (like Pang Tong's death at Luo Castle) were removed and instead replaced with a cutscene at the end of a battle. People want to see cutscenes in the heat of the moment, that's what the series did so well and that's what the people love. I don't know why they got rid of it. Seems like they tried to coalesce every big event into one cutscene at the end of every battle.    Graphics:  The graphics in this game are not to be what is expected from a 2014 PC release. DW7 looks almost identical, and has more realistic features (like after killing somebody their body stays there on the ground instead of mystically disappearing like in this game). It seems like they updated armor textures, facial expressions, and some spell effects, but in all honesty I want to have an eyegasm when I'm out on the battlefield fighting, not in cinematics. Especially with todays technology, upgrading the graphics instead of copy and pasting them from DW7 wouldn't be that difficult.   -The Good-    Combat:  This game hands down has the best combat I have ever played in the series thus far. From using your rage meter, to switching weapons to gain an advantage in battle, the combat in this game is phenomenal. Plenty of options that keeps it fresh and interesting.   Characters:  There are a plethora of characters in this game. Koei did an insanely good job at making each character unique and have their own style of fighting. There's no two characters that you can pick up and play the exact same. It's also exciting when you get to play someone new, even though I play Zhou Tai 99% of the time.   Variety:  Another great feature of this game is it's variety. Instead of just having the 3 standard story modes (Wu, Wei, Shu), they added in Jin, Other, and Lu Bu's story mode. 6 different storylines to play through. This is most of the reason why I'm addicted to this game. What's even better, is you can jump between Story Modes and it will save your progress in all of them (not battle saves though). Sure, the cutscenes and difficulty may be subpar, but as a diehard DW fan I always look past that.  I hope this review helps some people out. I tried to give some insight as to what you are getting yourself into when buying this game.  Edit - Just realized the game is on sale right now for $25 once again. Highly recommend picking it up, even if you are new to the series. Pick it up cheap while you can, it probably won't be on sale anymore after this.",

            "review_text": "One of the better DW installments in my opinion. The historical and hypothetical routes gives you pretty much every scenario ever imagined so far for the series. Ambition mode is pretty interesting and really adds to the replay value. 5th and 6th weapons are for the most part a challenge to get so collectors have plenty to look forward to. I'm just really irked that they didn't include the original Japanese audio for this one. I've had it in previous DW games on consoles but for some reason they just decided not to include it.  I would definitely recommend this title to any DW fan. To those who are new to the series: It's a glorified hack'n'slash, set in the Three Kingdoms era of feudal China(following the story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms). If that's the kind of game you enjoy, I also recommend this to you.   BREAKDOWN:  The story is given in various formats. Cinematic cutscenes are used to tell some more dramatic moments, while the stories of the battles themselves are told during gameplay through dialogue. Exposition and time skip filler story is presented in visual novel format. The story itself is, of course, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. If you've played any other DW game before, you know what that means. If not, then honestly the DW games are probably the best way for you to experience that story.  Audio is standard DW, which is both a pro and a con. A pro because it's very concise and action packed, from SFX to BG music, so the audio really adds to the impact of the game. A con because it literally has not changed since like, PS2 days. The audio is more high definition, sure, but those death screams are the same death screams I heard as a child, slaughtering thousands of hapless Chinese peasants.  Gameplay is standard of a DW game. No weird gimmicks in this one like they've experimented with before, just pure and simple attacking, blocking, parrying. However, with the game's cast of 50+ playable characters, each with their own unique weapon, the gameplay can remain fresh for quite some time if you change up who you are playing or what weapons you are using.  EDIT: I forgot to mention the one new thing they did add this installment, which is the Weapon Attunement system. Basically it's a rock/paper/scissors(or in this case Heaven/Earth/Man) system where certain attuned weapons do more damage to and allow for storm rushes against enemy officers using an attunement that is weak to yours. You are allowed two weapons and the game(and I) recomment using two different attunements in order to prevent enemy officers from having an attunement advantage.  Graphics are... console port quality. To be fair, I doubt the studio ever put a lot of attention into the peons in the first place, but they look like clay soldiers when they do close ups of their faces. The officers themselves are much more defined, and they actually look good. It's also not very optimized to run in 1080p(which is an option on the PC version). I have a pretty beefy rig but I still notice huge frame drops when I first load a mission for seemingly no reason. It smooths out quickly though and will stay running smooth until the next time I launch the game.  OVERALL: I'm leaning on a 7.5/10 for this one. Really is a lot of fun, but I think it's a very niche game.  PS: About the multiplayer thing: It's been my experience that DW has never had online co-op. It's always been local co-op, so not sure what to say about that. I'm not sure if they will ever do online co-op for a Musou game so don't expect it to be a thing for this one.",

Even horse control is tighter and more useful, with improved summoning for real mobility with and trampling, with other animal as an option. Bodyguard control is nice too.  The campaigns are a little depressing with some storylines, and the roster has a surprising focus on the children of key characters like Guan Yu now compared to the series roots, but there's the expected branching storylines and hypothetical scenarios, with free mode. I miss the jungle campaign a little, but Ambition mode makes up for it with a small town-building function tied to randomized missions, a real nice collectathon grind that makes time fly. Way better than Create-an-Officer.",

Oh lord the script is terrible and the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ your pants funny. That should NOT take away from the fact that the game is pure old school fun and a cry back to games like golden axe and double dragon, which we all would assume if any modern game tried the exact gameplay as these 'classics' they would be laughed away even with PC melting graphics.  Gameplay is simple enough for any 10 thumbed monkey to play it and this is where you get the button mashing stigma but to me so many great games are 'easy to learn but hard to master'. The list stretches to the moon and back: Sonic, chess, checkers, most nintendo games, tekken, street fighter. These are all games with simple rules/mechnics but the potential of the experience is actually much greater than first expected. DW8 has all the old school stuff you would want and adds very customisable weapon and skill system which runs seperate of character levels. Graphics are a big improvement as well as the animation which you will see by the sheer volume of moving parts on screen. I also like the fact your character can have two weapons of your choice of which there is an insane number to choose from ranging from the dull to the 'no feckin way that works'.    Its not trying to be serious, its not trying to appeal to the masses, it is just a modern beat em up complete with all the cheesey nuances that added to the fun of them.

Let me begin by retorting some of the other reviewer concerns:   -This is indeed a port from the PS4 -The graphics are in HD, although shadow quality seems to be subpar. -Everything looks great. The character's have amazing detail and their Mosou moves are brilliant/vibrant and addicting to pull off. - The sound quality is excellent. Even the cheesy dialogue :)   The lack of 'online co-op' is no reason to downvote this game. It's still amazing without it. And longtime fans, like myself, won't be bothered by this missing feature.   If you're on the fence, don't be. It's a great installment of Dynasty Warriors.",

The combat is fairly simplistic but slaughtering thousands of cannon fodder troops on normal difficulty to gain levels and weapons to have a chance on the harder difficulties is fairly fun to do. Definitly not a game I would sit down and play to completion for the story, but a good game to boot up for 30 minutes here and an hour there and slowly progress through as you play other games (since I can see it being a bit grindy after a while if its your main game your playing).  In either case the console port is kinda meh, the controls shown on the screen are a bit confusing since it doesn't show what key or button to press but rather what action to press and you just have to know what key is bound to what action and for some reason some times the game will drop from 60FPS to 20FPS in the preperation map prior to entering the next battle map where the only way I have gotten it back up to 60 is by alt tabing out of the game and then back in... since it only seems to happen in the map where you buy and sell weapons and get some lore from allies and has not happened anywhere that your doing combat, not a bug bad enough to not buy the game, though still kind of annoying.  While the story line may or may not be interesting, the way its told (atleast in the campaign I started in) is so disengauging that even if the story might be good, it doesn't draw you in to giving a bloody p*** about it to the point where I feel almost like entirely skiping all of it, and I am the type of person who if the story of a game is good and told well I enjoy the game even if the gameplay is mediocre. Maybe it is better in a different campaign, or maybe it gets better later on, but my first impressions of the story is that it is entirely skipable because it doesn't do a good job at drawing you in.  All in all my suggestion is wait a month or two and wait for it to be on sale and pick it up then. Its a good time waister, but unless your really into the Dynasty Warriors series definitly more of a game you would pick up on sale. (And don't get me wrong the game does seem to have a ton of content to complete to where if you spend full price for it you won't feel like you over paid)  And don't get me wrong, despite all my complaints with the game I still do find it enjoyable to play slaughtering thousands of cannon fodder troops and getting challenged (on harder difficulties) with the generals I find fun, not something Ill do for hours on end, but still fun even if I only want to play the game an hour or two a week.t I find it best to go 'here is what I find wrong with it, but its still a good game' or 'here is what is pretty good about it but its not enough to make it a good game' ... aka give the reasons against wither or not you find it overall good or bad, that way people can judge wither or not its for them since there are things I like that others may hate and vis versa, and no game is perfect.",

Trust me, resolution and frame rate per seconds is the core issue for a lot of gamers nowadays as they approach new titles. The moment you take your very first move in your very first actual round of the game really is the moment of truth of whether the game turns you up or turns you down. We as the PC gamers don’t like the hidden 30fps lock, or anything like that! NO. Let’s NOT talk about that anymore since it’s not what we have here.  Gameplay   *** to knock out hundreds and thousands of AI dummies in a single round.***  For the new to the series players, this is an action game where you control a single character in 3rd person mode and mash just a couple of buttons (one button can do it too if you prefer -_-!) to knock out hundreds and thousands of AI dummies in a single round. If you are the causal gamer type just looking for some easy fun, this game is really the chosen one for you. Dynasty Warrior 8 really makes me feel like an overpowered monster in the three kingdom battleground, and I love that very much.   Graphics and Sound  For graphics it is 1080p 60fps, that’s important. However, the style of art in Dynasty Warrior 8 is not that charming in the first impression, feels kind of dull actually.(When do games ever match their graphics with the store page screenshot actually) But the well-made textures in the environment and the detailed face expressions of the characters really brings a smile. That in fact can prove why we can’t judge a game base on first impression of the graphics.   ***It’s like watching a Japanese film where a Japanese female screams in her own voice, but suddenly has the American female voiceover once she starts talking…… WTF. ***  The background music is engaging just to the right point, but the voice acting is kind of weird at some point. What I mean weird is that there are TWO voice actors casting ONE character! The voice that the characters make to respond from getting hit for example, do NOT match up with the voice of the characters in the actual talking dialog. It’s like watching a Japanese film where a Japanese female screams in her own voice, but suddenly has the American female voiceover once she starts talking…… WTF. So I go right ahead and check if there is any option to change the dialog sound into Japanese instead of English. Nope there is none, although that would’ve solve the funny issue, but NOPE. The officials said they will have both the Japanese version and Chinese version released and sold separately in the following of this year. If that’s their marketing strategy of trying to mess with the voice acting and get people to maybe buy their Japanese version of the game as well or anything like that, that’s terrible. A terrible thing to do. However, the visual and the audio seems legit for a game like this, could definitely be better of course. ",

            "review_text": "Dynasty Warriors 8: XTreme Edition is a Hack and Slash game where you control a single hero and fight your way through a vast horde of enemies to single-handedly win battles. You will regularly kill hundreds if not thousands of enemy soldiers and a dozen or more enemy officers – characters like yourself on the opposing side – every mission. The game is very much about the light experience of running through and killing massive numbers of foes; while the core gameplay is decent enough, and there is some amount of character-to-character variability, on the whole the game itself is fairly repetitive as all of the levels boil down to almost exactly the same thing, just in a different environment with different orders of objectives. There is little meaningful variation in the enemy units, and thus the game is pretty samey from level to level. It is decent enough as a passing experience, but it is not much fun to sit down and spend hours fighting through the game.  Story   The game is based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a culturally-important work of historical fiction about the unification of China in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. All of the major characters – all 77 of them – are given unique appearances, and their personalities from the stories tended to be reworked to give them more dramatic impact. As it is an old Chinese story, in many ways it seems odd to modern sensibilities, and many important events occur between battles, summarized in telly text.  On the whole, playing this game for the story is a waste; the English voice acting isn’t great, and while the Japanese voice acting sounds better, in the end it doesn’t matter much as the plot itself is not delivered very well and a lot of characters aren’t very sympathetic – including the characters you play as. Lu Bu, for instance, the star of one of the campaigns, has a personality which would ordinarily be found on a villain – he betrays everyone and believes that might makes right, and at the end of his campaign, he is executed for his crimes and constant betrayals. Indeed, the characters all tend to be rather shallow and uninteresting, and the story itself isn’t terribly interesting because characters keep falling in and out of the story as you follow each path along; only once you’ve beaten all the campaigns are you likely to really understand what is going on, and even then, character motivations often feel strange.  Gameplay   The gameplay itself is all about visceral satisfaction; you play as a single hero who wades his way through hordes of enemies, with some friendly officers and a handful of soldiers at your side who are, by and large, worthless. It is your job to do everything, your job to beat your way through the enemy lines, your job to keep your own officers alive, to complete all the objectives, and to otherwise do everything.  But that’s what you’re here for, right?  The protagonist you play has can switch between two weapons of the player’s choice, though it is always best for their primary weapon to be the weapon that they gain an ex bonus for, which grants them special attacks with it. The character can equip two of the same weapon, or can equip two different weapons to get a bit better versatility. Depending on which weapons enemies are you using, you may get an advantage or disadvantage, and because you have two weapons, you can always work out to at least be on even footing with them.  Each weapon has its own unique attack pattern, and as noted each character additionally has a special set of attacks with their preferred weapon. The character also has three “super” attacks which are built up by killing enemies and collecting dropped items from slain foes, as well as a secondary super meter which causes them to go into a “rage” and make a very powerful area of effect attack which will usually wipe out entire enemy forces by itself, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers and possible multiple enemy officers at the same time.  Each level consists of the player walking around it (or calling in their horse to ride around on it), fighting their way through an enemy army to try and capture various objectives, protect their allies, or just kill the enemy officers or general. These levels tend to mostly feel very similar; while there are differences between the levels, most of the levels are not very different in effect as the environments usually matter little (with a few notable exceptions) and the player is mostly just going from one place to another, fighting their way through the enemy horde.  While the weapons and characters all have their own abilities, ultimately the gameplay isn’t very different, and the enemies tend to feel very samey. Still, there is some satisfaction to be found in occasionally jumping in to murder large numbers of soldiers in a stage or two; it is not the sort of game to be sat down and powered through, but the large number of game modes, levels, alternative levels, collectables, and other things that the game offers means that it is possible to keep playing the game sporadically and still have a feeling of making progress for a very long time.  Presentation   The game is mostly fairly well-presented; the characters look decent enough, and the textures and animations all look fine, though there isn’t anything jaw-dropping in the game. The largest annoyance is that the keyboard controls are shown in the place of controller controls even if the player is using a controller.  Final Summary   Dynasty Warriors 8 XTreme Edition is a game which is best in moderation; it is fun to run through and kill large numbers of enemies, but the gameplay gets monotonous after a few levels and stops being as interesting. Still, as a “sometimes food”, a game that you play on occasion, it works well enough – it just isn’t much fun to run through the whole thing in one sitting. If you’re looking for something other than mindless killing, though, like plot or challenge, you’re better off looking elsewhere. ",

This one adds alot of extra modes, lots of collectable weapons, yadda yadda yadda it has long legs. OK great. grand.  The problem with this port isn't anything graphical, though the textures are pretty bad, early PS3 era bad, The problem with this game is the horrid interface.  In a normal PC port, to tell you to do Attack 1, it would map that key to the A key, then tell you 'Press A to attack'. This game tells you 'Press Attack 1 to attack'. It never tells you which button is which. Even when you play with a controller, it never tells you shich button is which position, it only calls out the name of a command, such as 'press jump to jump on horse'. it's really really REALLY hard to deal with. My personal way was looking up the console button mapping, and mapping it in the menu like the console.  Other than that terrible UI, the game runs alright, the game is fun and challenging, It's just that one thing that affects the game in a MAJOR way that really wears on you. It can be dealt with, but it's just such a stupid thing that could have been solved with just different icons for the buttons.  All in all, i'd give this game a 6/10. it's very fun but it's not anything to get bent out of shape over.",

I have 2 complaints however.  1: I can't just pick a character and play a specified factions compaign. You pick a campaign and battle and then choose one of the available officers from that battle to play as. If the officer you have been playing as is unavailable for the current battle, you're sol and have to pick a new officer, which will almost always be level 1 unless you played them in free mode or ambition mode.  2: When they ported this game over to the PC from the consoles, they didnt bring online multiplayer with it. The only multiplayer it has is local split screen and let's face it, nobody likes to splitscreen on a pc... ;( This is a really big bummer as several of my friends love these games and would absolutely buy it during the sales in order to play online co-op.  I would give it a 7/10. Great gameplay, lots to do, but with it's character limitations for story mode and lack of online multiplayer, it comes out lacking a bit. If you only want it for solo play, definitely get it during the sales. If you want it for co-op, I would recommend trying to get it somewhere cheap for console.  A 3rd complaint but not really an issue (lol), LuBu in this game is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥. The first encounter with him was a little tough but every encounter after he wasn't much harder than the other main story officers. My previous experiences with him in past DW games have always been 'stay...the ♥♥♥♥... away... from LUBU...' I missed that in this one :(",

I've racked up at least 60 hours with this game so far, and there's still a lot more to do (and it's not even mindless grinding either) -- and 60+ hours is pretty much unheard of in this day-and-age.  You can do the story mode on Normal (completely duoable by anyone with 1-2 thumbs), and after you finish that, you can go back and do all the special conditions (stars you see in 'Select Stage') to unlock alternate story lines. Even with the 'Complete Edition', there's still plenty of weapons to unlock (though you'll probably need Google to find them before you reach 160 hours, which is a testament to how much there is to do in this game).  TL;DR It's a Dynasty Warriors game with plenty of objectives to fill up tons of your hours. As long as you can get through the 'mirco' gameplay (mashing buttons), then there's plenty of 'macro' gamplay (unlockables) to go around.  I personally did almost all of Story Mode campaigns before even trying Ambition Mode, and I don't regret it. Story Mode is 'fun'-ish, and Ambition Mode is a lot better suited for perfectionists since it's more grindy.  The only advice I'd give for Ambition mode is    just level up your castle first and ignore enemy generals since you lose almost all of them once you build the castle   .",

If there is something I wanted from this series (apart from a PC specific version with native resolution support) it was more depth without loosing the things I liked about the original games.   In that respect it is a hit. I am loving it and still have yet to uncover a lot of the depth and game modes. Good fun gameplay. Pity about the technical limitations which make it feel like replaying a really old game because it is a great game in its own right.

My first issue is that I cannot play the game with my keyboard, as soon as the game starts the camera spins, many people have complained about the same issue online but I still haven't found a solution.  My second issue is that after my keyboard didn't work I plugged in my primary controller which won't work with this game despite never having trouble with any of my other games. Once again many people online shared the same issue and yet there was no solution.  Third issue was that even after I got the game to function with my second controller I had to rebind all the keys, navigating menus is far more complicated than it needs to be and after spending all the time I had setting it up correctly the ♥♥♥♥ing camera spun again.  It looks cool and everything and I'm sure you'd probably like it but only if you're one of the ones lucky enough to ♥♥♥♥ing play it.",

Having played and finished other KOEI games such as Kessen 2, Kessen 3 and Samurai Warriors, I though 'well, I haven't played a DW game since the first ones released on PS2, I will give this a try'.  To my surprise after I played it I found out this game is just a copy/paste thing from the very outdated PS2 version games released more than 10 years ago. By this I mean: the very same old gameplay mechanics, bland enviroments, exact same music, stupid enemy A.I ( all the enemy pawns stand in there in front of you doing nothing), exact same characters with the same old stories -remember the Yellow Turban rebellion episode from DW2?, well it's here again. There is nothing new in this game at all,  I'm not complaining whether this game is a bad console port or not, or the lack of online gameplay,(I think I would even dislike the PS4 version). My biggest complain is the lack of effort and commitment by KOEI-TECMO on the franchise. After so many years, I would have expected some new elements inside such as some strategy-tactical features, a new story, new kind of abilities such as grabbing, evading, counter attacks and maybe some kind of tag team attacks. None of these is in here.  In sum, if I were KOEI I would put DW franchise to R.I.P and start to better focus on the other franchises such as Samurai warriors, or even a new Kessen game. This game should be priced for $7.99 USD at max.",

Anyway....blah blah blah, typical story of the Three Kingdoms period, so if you've played it before you know the story already. You're just reliving the events you've already relived a dozen other times for £39.99. The change is Koei have tried to make the storytelling more serious and dramatic....but the failure is they're doing this at a time when they're making the characters themselves more ridiculous and camp. The sweet spot was DW3-5.  The affinity thing seems unnecessary and just an excuse to force weapon switching. The musou attacks for a lot of the characters are really poor, compared to previous games.  The AI is atrocious but this game, at this stage, is just about getting combos and making your KO counter go above 1000 in the first level and even higher in the later levels. It's a guilty pleasure of button mashing for the sake of button mashing.   I only recommend this to hardcore nutjobs or people that have never played DW before. Or if you're a yellow fever rice chaser that loves the ni hao la la la.
