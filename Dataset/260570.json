            "review_text": " Brightened eyes, my secrets lie not far away  His medals and his badges are all dull by day  Many have I an answered plea, my general now I'll often see  He comes at dawn, out on the lawn, in quiet steps With darkened eyes and wounds that bled, have pillow for his weary head  He lays his body down to rest, among the dogs and gathered nest*    During the earlier years of my adventure gaming career, I had the chance of playing  Gabriel Knight  series; a masterpiece of the adventure genre. I was stunned by the narrative quality, atmosphere design and character depth; yearning for more as it comes. Sadly, after the third game, there was radio silence from the creator of Gabriel: Jane Jensen, the novelist and game designer extraordinaire. After years of suffering that silence, Jane Jensen returns to create  Gray Matter , a wondrous stand-alone adventure game with a captivating world of its own: a modern folktale.  During a hellish storm in the middle of the night, riding on an old motorbike towards London, we meet Samantha Everett. She is a brilliant young woman who's been on the road for quite a while, travelling the cities of Old World, collecting tricks and illusions, aspiring to become a great magician one day. As the fickle finger of fate turns the road sign during the storm, Samantha ends in Dread Hill House, an old mansion that resides on the south of Thames Valley, Oxford. The accursed bike gets busted, and without much hope for any other shelter for the night, Samantha rings the doorbell and introduces herself as the new 'assistant' that Dr. David Styles, world renowned neurobiologist and the master of the household's been expecting for. From that point onwards Samantha will find herself in a web of mystery, distrust and intrigue, building lies big and small to protect David, as David will become frustratingly trapped within the events of old that's been haunting him. Is there a light at the end of this tunnel for them?   Gray Matter  is a story of mystery with incredible character design and story depth, melting science and magic within the same pot as an expertise of Jane Jensen. There is a vague two-ways transition between the real and the illusory in the tale, making you question what would be mere trickery, what would be rationally explainable and what would be... actual magic, perhaps. Such masquerade is the direct subtext of the name of the game, aside a component of the central nervous system if you ask me. We have no idea what it is, or better: we have many ideas without solid answers. Such is the beauty settled in this mystery.  The display of anecdotes borrowed from folktales and mythologies of the world brought together to present a lovely environment design, illustrated with a selection of haughtily beautiful artwork. The places reimagined within the game carry real life ties and authenticity, bringing in wondrous historical details to your attention in every turn. Characters are unique, charming and quirky in their own way - and with marvelous voice acting, I must say - making you warm up to them faster than you'd realize. At the end of the first chapter, I guarantee that you'll get captivated by the story, the design and characters, pushing yourself to see more of them.  The gameplay is basically your old school adventure. You explore the environment and interact with people, locations and items. But I must warn you: there is no hand holding. You will encounter riddles, puzzles and logic tricks, expecting you to think outside of the box. When you are playing this game, keep in mind the kind of relative reality used in  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  by Lewis Carroll. The simplest answer, hidden behind a heavy curtain of misdirection will always be your friend. As Sam being a magician, you will sometimes be expected to pull of magic tricks to bend the events towards your favor. For that purpose, you'll be given a magic interface for you to plan the steps of your trick. You will also be given the opportunity to play as David from time to time, learning more about him as you play. The map is fully interactive with action indicators and there are also some bonus actions you may take in each chapter to reveal a bit more as you play.   Gray Matter  is an adventure game done right: challenging, intriguing, empathic and immersive. My only complaint would be that there are no Steam achievements yet. But there really is a suitable substructure of the game for achievements already, so I hope we can see them here around one of these days. This is a hidden gem that both adventure gamers, and anyone with an appreciation for either art or narrative building would love.   Because he's safe in arms now, what luck have I that I should see  Safe in arms now, my bloody boy returned to me  From Jericho back home to me...*    *Lyrics by The Scarlet Furies - Safe In Arms, from Gray Matter the Game soundtrack   Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

            "review_text": "I have played as many adventure / point-and-click games as I could get my hands to in this life and this is definitely one of my favorites. The truth is that it doesn't really have challenging puzzles at all; they are all pretty simple and even I could say lame. However, I loved it, for the following reasons: - The artwork. It seduced me from the very beginning. The videos seem to be a sequence of oil paintings, beautifully done, starting with the protagonist. The whole atmosphere is a work of art. - The story. It was cool and original, even though it had a couple of cheesy moments.   If I heard Dr. Styles saying 'Laura' one more time, I would have snapped, and it is my name!   - The music! I want the soundtrack! - The lack of illogical 'inventory-based puzzles', which is usual in adventure games and forces you to pixel-hunt the entire screen, looking for items that make no sense, until you need to combine a baby rattle with a crystal glass and pepper spray to open a door. Not here. Even though it could have used more challenging puzzles overall, I am glad that the usual nonsense of other games wasn't present here. - Well, I guess this is kind of a spoiler...   Including magic tricks was, for me, very cool.    Now, on the downside, besides the lack of challenging puzzles I could mention that the story, cool as I found it, has a couple of 'holes'. There were, particularly close to the end, a couple of things that didn't make any sense and that weren't explained. But, in general, I loved this game and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys artistic / story-based adventure games.",

            "review_text": "Great game for an adventure game fan. A little glitchy, but not terrible. Really good voice acting. The plot was interesting. I feel it wrapped up in a somewhat predictable manner, while leaving somewhat of a plothole or.. leap of logic in it. But that is only a minor detractor from an overall great game. Particularly the visual composure of the scenes with the thoughtfullness of the puzzles. Most of the puzzles and item combinations and stuff makes sense without being overly easy or overly difficult, it's pretty medium in that respect. Which I like, because I like to get through the story without getting bored, while having to put some thought into stuff.",

            "review_text": "So, the game is very beautiful. The characters are likeable (mostly), however I found the main character to be annoying at times because of her attitude towards certain things. The other characters and Dr. Styles are all interesting and have their own unique personalities. The story with Dr. Styles and his experiments were very interesting to me and added more of a mystery feel to the game, however I wasn't totally into Sam and her magic part of the story. For example, it takes a pretty weird turn at the end where suddenly everything is vastly different than the rest of the game... that had me confused and I was just rushing through it because I wanted out. As for the magic tricks, I thought they added a little more to the gameplay and were easy enough to do.  One thing to keep in mind: Always interact with everything in the environment. Even if it means just looking at something as sometimes even minor parts of the story can keep you from getting 100% for that part.",

            "review_text": "A tragic death. A secret society. A series of unexplained accidents. A mysterious experiment. All come together in Gray Matter, a charming adventure game that hearkens back to genre classics, namely Syberia and The Longest Journey. Like those games, Gray Matter is headlined by a compelling female protagonist, the magician Samantha, who journeys through an Oxford seeped in atmosphere and intrigue. As she adventures throughout Oxford, Sam meets a curious cast of individuals: the mysterious magic shop owner, Mephistopheles; the sultry foreign exchange student, Helena; the shy and superstitious nursing student, Angela; and the infamous neurobiologist, Dr. David Styles, just to name a few.   The game's story, while not without its loose ends, is the strongest feature of Gray Matter. Happenings begin to coincide that force the player to question: Are these events supernatural in origin? Or scientific? Are they parts to an elaborate illusion, carefully orchestrated by a puppeteer lurking in the Oxford shadows? Or some combination of all three? Suspicion is thrown onto all core characters and the solution to the mysteries in Oxford remains elusive right up to the game's closing act.   The game's visuals will likely be disappoint to some, given that the game originally released in English around 2011 and the game looks more like it was a product from the early 2000. That being said, if this is something you can look past, the game's scenes and area are still a delight to look through. Less enjoyable are the close-ups of the in-game models, displayed in the bottom left whenever a character is speaking. These close-ups make some characters appear strange and wooden and this becomes particularly jarring when the player sees depictions of the characters in short, illustrated cut scenes between game chapters, where they look much better, but also very different from their in-game models.   The game also suffers from one of the classic weaknesses of adventure games: progression is often dependent upon clicking or finding a very specific area/object, sometime multiple times. Several in-game features actually offer the player help with this, however, if needed. Pressing spacebar enables labels for clickable areas/items of interest and the game also features a 'progression bar' for everything needed to finish and complete a chapter. It's important to note that this isn't a checklist, but rather a tool that tells the player if they've done everything that needs doing for a specific task or quest line that chapter.  These quibbles aside, all in all, I would wholly recommend Gray Matter to adventure game fans, especially those who are particularly fond of certain classic games within the genre. Gameplay is fun, if simple in the traditional sense - puzzles are largely limited to collecting items and selecting which items to use or combine in specific circumstances. The graphics, while also simplistic, do not impede the true strengths of the game: the characters and the storytelling. The game truly left me clamoring for more, which is a shame, as the game, as well as its creator, has hinted towards a sequel, though any such project seems to be in limbo, at least as of now.   Happy adventuring!",

            "review_text": "I love adventure point and click games. When I bought this game, I downloaded it and I crossed my fingers that I would be able to play it on my older computer with a GeForce 9500 GS 512 MB graphics card. After several attempts and adjustments in the games settings (I turned the resolution down a bit and a adjusted a few other settings so the character wouldn't move so dreadfully slow and I double-clicked where I was going that helped speed up most of those walks) and tried over and over until I had the settings just right and I was able to start my adventure! Yay!  This game is truly a gem. This mystery story is well written, the characters voice acting was spot on, the music is relaxing and games and puzzles were fun. I had to use walkthroughs to get through some of the trickier puzzles. You have to use and learn the magic book and go shopping at the magic shop for items to solve some puzzles, and yes, it required some reading and lots of talking with other characters, but that is half the fun in these types of adventure games.  There is a map, diary, the magic book and lots of inventory to play with. I love this game and I totally recommend it! I hope you will like it too!",

            "review_text": "A Game, in of itself, has to serve several purposes, dpeending on it's design and intent. Adventure games, for me, have to provide interesting characters and a good story, and in this they are like a book or movie. Yet they also require not just interesting puzzles, but puzzles that are neither so easy as to be boring, or so hard or nonsensical as to be frustrating. No, to borrow a phrase 'Put wax lips on moose'.  Gray Matter's game play does have a few hitches. My main criticsms would be that it was initially hard to get into the interface, and too often in the game, you have to sort of muddle about, clicking on stuff to figure out what you are suppose to do. The progress meters are very helpful in this regard on occasion, as are the ways the different locations text gets different colours based on what can still be done there. Still, the game could use some refining in this regard.  However, the game gets my recommendation for the story-telling. You don't come to a game by Jensen and expect to get bad storytelling, and true to form this game had amazingly evocative sets, characters and plot. With a short cast of characters I was deeply involve in the story, and it's ending had parts that were genuinely emotional. A game that can push buttons and evoke emotions like a good movie or piece of music is worth the price of admission in my book.",

It's not perfect, and one of the game mechanics nearly broke the game. You have to click on all clickable hot spots in order to advance the story, even if the hot spot isn't really relavent or related to the story. This means if you miss one chair or vase or anything as you're going through a chapter and get to the point where the chapter should end you get stuck, you'll find yourself running around the entire game world looking for that 1 stupid thing you didn't click on. Bit annoying.   I also have a complaint about the ending, but i'll try not to give too much away. Basically there's so many subplots going on in the game and most of them are not wrapped up by the end. It feels kind of cut off. Could have added another few hours of story to explain why this happened, what happened with that, and what happened with so and so after the thing.   Overall a neeat little adventure style game with a main character a little more interesting than average and a scooby-doo type story with a little more originality.   Also there's a rabbit.",
