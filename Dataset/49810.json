The characters each have distinctive and charming personalities; they seem real, more so than many human characters in games. The rainforest is absolutely stunning, even at a lower resolution. The bioluminescence creates a soothing visual that relaxes the mind. The music adds to this soothing effect, with its mystical tone and flowing melody. The only negative point I can think of is its length; the game ends so quickly, while I want to explore more of the world presented in the game. But for this cheap price its really okay and worth it.",

            "review_text": "Not sure why this game gets such positive reviews, not because it sucks but because it's so mediocre. I'll start with the positives as always. The creatures are cute, the music and art style/atmosphere is nice, and it is fun how each creature has it's own power and you have to use them together to get things done.  Now the problems. The game is super short, around 2.5 hours. The levels are short and super repeitive, just climbing ropes and branches and trees to get to the end, on basically every level. The levels all look the same and have the same layout. There are little essences to collect but since they don't have any purpose (literally nothing, no extras, art, unlockables, powers, etc.....just so it will show up you got x/x at the end) I just found myself skipping them altogether to beat the level faster. Using those for some point would have extended playtime and made levels more interesting, but since they didn't do anything they shouldn't even be in there. The enemies are the same and super repetitive. As for the creatures, you basically use the same 2 for like 1/2 the game, until you finally unlock the 3rd, and then unlocking more happens more often. Although they are fun to try out when you first get them, they become boring and repetitive to use. Each only has one power, so thats all you will use them for, is that singular thing. Although some levels you can go through with whatever combo you want, most you have to take a singular path and use a specific one, taking out all ability to customize your loadout or improvise at all, its basically just ' use this guy for this area, this other guy for the next part, and so on'. I would have liked more freedom. Also since they only each have 1 power they can only do 1 specific sort of obstacle. so the thing you use them for when you first get them you will only use them for that thing the entire game, with no variation. There are a few boss levels that change things up and make it a little more varied, which are a nice addition, but theres only like 3 the whole game, so don't get your hopes up. The platforming is ok, if not a little floaty. Also you can get stuck on things a lot. On the flip side, grabbing ledges is very inaccurate and inconsistent, It constantly wouldn't let me when I hit right on, and same for ropes. All in all its just a rather boring and repetitive game (have I stressed the repetition enough?), which not much variety, just doing the same thing on the same looking levels with the same puzzles, for around 15 levels. It does work though and is passable. 6/10. Can't reccomend though as I didn't particularly enjoy it.",
