            "review_text": "I'm very impressed with Juju. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, full of vibrant colors. The scenery and gameplay mechanics remind me of elements of Candyland, Mousetrap, Giana Sisters, Toki Tori, and even older NES games. It's absolutely perfect for kids, but I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as well.   Degree of difficulty builds gradually throughout the game, and controls are very basic. There's no need for a tutorial here, but players will find brief 'hint bubbles' when new elements are introduced. Character abilities are obtained through normal gameplay, adding new dynamics to the game.  There are multiple worlds and areas with a lot of secret areas and hidden gems. Checkpoints are frequent, and death is in no way permanent, allowing for the player to restart from the last checkpoint. After multiple deaths, the player will also be given the option to play in easy mode if desired. There's absolutely no reason for rage fits with this game, yet there is enough of a challenge to entertain nearly any gamer with a fondness for platformers or casual games.  The controls are very responsive, and full controller support is provided with the game. While not noted in the game tags, there is also a co-op feature, allowing for a second player to join the game as a different character. Juju also sports challenging yet attainable achievements, which will appeal to gamers looking for their next 100% game.  There is definite replaybility here, as well. The hidden portals within each area work very much like a timed minigame, and finishing an area with a perfect score for all 3 portals, as well as finding all gems within the level, is a challenge for even seasoned adult gamers.  All in all, I've enjoyed it very much. While not complex, it's extremely well done and thoroughly enjoyable. It's very difficult to find a good platformer, because somewhere along the line, jumping, ducking, 'easter egg' hunting, coin/gem collecting casual platformers went by the wayside to make room for the more convoluted 'puzzle-platformers.' If you're looking for a casual platformer, or if you long for the days of a straightforward platformer, you're going to want to give Juju a look.",

            "review_text": "This game follows the story of Juju and Peyo who witness Juju's father engaged in some kind of occult ritual. When his father is distracted curiosity gets the better of the children and they interfere with the ritual unwittingly opening up portals between worlds; unleashing hoards of demonic creatures amongst them and allowing Juju's father is captured by one of these eldritch horrors. Juju and Peyo have to battle through the different worlds to retrieve parts of the talisman to rescue Juju's father whilst he is subjected to unthinkable torment… in a family friendly way.  This is a charming, colourful, casual platformer which is obviously aimed at children but still very enjoyable for adults. It looks good and the music is fun. The controls and enemies are quick to get the grips with and new concepts are introduced gradually. It is best enjoyed with a partner but the second player can drop in and out at any time. There are bonus levels hidden throughout which are a bit repetitive but completing them all unlocks some extra levels which are more challenging.  All in all this is excellent, I wish there were more local co-op games of this quality available.",
