            "review_text": "I had this epic game on PS1 when i was child... It is the reason i like horror-adventure games and i would suggest you to buy with my eyes closed.... But unfortunately Steam version is AWFUL!!! First of all, the great intro where you shoot Dracula is missing!!! Secondly, the dialogues and cinematics isn't on full screen as the original but windowed.... The graphics, the atmosphere and the sounds aren't that creepy as the old scary and full of emotions game... Also, the parts with the magnifying glass where you see some less important things of the game are missing too... But these aren't the worse! On steam version you can see exactly where there are items to grap, where you need to use items, so you have only to move your mouse and find where to use the right item, something that makes the game very very easy.... On the original game i spent many hours to find all items or where you need to use them something that here is obvious... Finally, you can see where to use an item only if the item is available to grap right now... On the original you could see that somewhere you should use an item you don't have either if you hadn't found it cause you were careless (something that can't happen now cause you see exactly where the items are!) either if you will find it later.... As you can see then you were confused if you should return back to find a lost item behind or if you will find it later so you should focus your attetion somewhere else (something that made the game more difficult)! For all these reasons i would suggest you to buy the original game on PS or PC, otherwise buy this on sale! My rate for the original game is surely 8,5-9 cause it's great but for this one will be lower....   My rate for this game is: 6,5/10",

I just wish there was a workaround to those bugs    The Notebook can't be read and the library door remains locked   .  It's dated, sure, but that shouldn't be a problem. What is a problem are the bugs which break the game.",

After the introduction videos (and a screen of how-to-play-the-game), you click around a bit until you reach the inn - and then you're stuck. There's nothing to click on, nothing to do, no way out.  Over in the discussion forums people have been complaining about this for at least four months. Still no sign of a fix.  At least I only paid $5.",

Pretty fed up with it!. 1st i wanted to tell everyone if you are interested in the story, plz buy the game on cd NOT STEAM! The cd version is a lot more better. CD version= NO HELP, MORE PUZZLES, BETTER INVENTORY SYSTEM, NO BUGS, NO MISSING SOUNDS. The steam version you get this dumb help thing which literally tells you everywhere/everything you can get. Takes away almost 70% of the puzzles along with getting rid of the cool inventory sytem, and then downgrading graphics.   Pros Nice story audio good video is good  Cons NOT LIKE CD VERSION!!! MAny bugs *doors you must go through icon sometimes never shows up, causing you to restart 70% puzzles from cd version are gone missing a lot of videos EVEN THE INTRO!!! dumbed down to a 3rd grader could beat the game!  This game should have been like it was on cd. No icon to help/tell you what to do. All of the puzzles back along with the inventory system!!",

Dusted off an old AMD Windows 7 32 bit pc and tried with that - still same isuues. Getting rid of the flicker in the games was easy (lowered the res) but I have spent a lot of time downloading drivers and changing settings.  And of course, unable to grab the oil can by the tree in Last Sanctuary. I purchased the whole set (including 4 &amp; 5) and so far 3 of them you can't play through. Guess I start at the 4&amp;5 game and ferget the first 3 ... ? (fingers crossed) Very disappointing. Don't purchase these games unless you have like an old Pentium 2 ... maybe running Windows 95 just to be on the safe side. :0)",

The intro is missing, the quality is worse than the original PC version, game save funcion/button doesn't work, a complete disaster.  On the other side, the original PC version is actually a great game. Why didn't Microids just publish that version?  I'm glad I only wasted 3,75€ getting the trilogy when it was on discount, because what I ended up doing is downloading the original version for free somewhere else, but I still feel I've been ripped off  Same goes for Dracula 2",
