It doesn't matter what defenses you've built, how your economy is better set up, etc. If you have fewer fighters, you will lose. The 'combat' system/simulator does not evenly distribute damage or focus in any way. It's completely random and can result in fights of 15v15 with one side taking no casualties, just minor damage spread across the board, while the opposing side is completely wiped.  I don't recommend. Combat has been stripped down too far resulting in a loss of player control over their own ships and a ridiculous imbalance in even close fights.",

Your ships fiering different targets, and enemy ships focusing your ships one by one. And there is no wat to microcontrol them. Too much random.  Despite this its still a great game with tense battle and mind struggle. Like strategies? Bye it!  ",

            "review_text": "Fun and addictive no-frills, casual RTS.  Simple controls, graphics and maps makes for easy navigation and play. You can attack enemies planets and/or defend your own, invade and capture new ones, or lay waste to them in order to hinder your enemies' progress.  However all is not perfect. Everything is nail-bitingly slow paced, from ship building and repairing to resource mining. There is way too much room for improvement, and sometimes it almost feels like the project was abandoned after the very basics were finished, just so it could be marketed.  Traveling between planets can be quite frustrating as once you set your path you cannot retreat half-way through: you have to reach the original destination first, meaning that sometimes you're forced to engage in battles you didn't intend to.  Also, there are no ship or colony upgrades. You cannot make your fleet more powerful, nor can you speed up production, repairing and mining, for example.  When playing solo, the AI can be pretty dumb, often favouring siege over invasion, meaning that you'll end up with a whole lot of destroyed planets long before you have the chance to reach them.  Even with all the negatives, I think it's still worth a shot, but not if you're planing to pay the Steam price of course (*cough* indie bundle websites *cough*).  And last... it's got cards, so if you can get it for a few cents then the cards should pay for most of it.",

            "review_text": "Spacecom: A Beta Review  Playing this game for at least 8 of my 9 hours, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The idea behind the game is to simply build and conquer, either destroying the enemy or invading them with the three different units in the game. Gameplay can be slow at times, going through the motions if you would, but at times of getting rushed by 3 AI on expert it gets pretty fast (and upsetting.) The artwork for this game is very simplistic. In general, most or all of the art is 2D but since the game is played through an eagle's eye view, moving around gives the game dimension.  While playing, bots/AI were either very easy after the first few times to extremely obnoxious. It took me a while to figure out the strategy of the bots in each difficulty, but after around 3-4 matches you could understand how to beat them fast.  Mulitplay was the trickier bit for me. As of now, I've played 7 matches online, but dropping out for a total of 3 of them. The 4 games that were actually played were fun considering I knew I was against another person. The only recommendation I would ask for multiplayer is some kind of reconnect timer (such as DotA 2's 5 minute until it's safe to leave or StarCraft 2's minute timer) since beta still has issues in servers.  Overall, fun game, pretty simple to grasp, PLENTY of strategies to find out.",
