            "review_text": "This game actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. No matter what way you try to put it, Emily is actually emotionally abusive. Like seriously, she guilt trips and gaslights you, both of which are forms of emotional abuse. Yet the game tries to guide you towards appeasing her and acts like she's the one in the right. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that. It makes me feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Go to the party at the beginning of the game? You get cucked by Brad. Don't go, and tell her to not talk to Brad? You get cucked by Travis anyway. Both of whom are jerks to her. You try to get into a relationship and try to be as nice as you can? She acts like you're a complete creeper and wanted nothing more than to have sex with her, she's weirded out by you. Act like just a friend? She gets all weird on you asking why you  didn't  come on to her. Call all of her friends out? She just laughs in your face. Be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ back to her? She stops talking to you. And that's what you want. You don't want her to talk to you, because she's a genuinely terrible human being. On top of that, the main character is a ♥♥♥♥ing cucklord and I hate him, he missed his chance of getting with the decent girl because of his dumb obsession with Emily. I'm not really for a game that's supposed to have moral choices but you can do nothing but wrong because the character who the choices are aimed towards is an insufferable, volatile ♥♥♥♥♥.  If your choices meant something, and Emily wasn't a completely horrible person, it'd be a neat concept. I like the whole idea of a visual novel-esque game set on an early IM chat interface. It's a neat idea. But being honest? 'dont take it personally babe it just aint your story' did a similar thing and did it better because your choices actually MEANT something. And if you complain about Emily being a more realistic character than anyone in that games, yeah it's true, but is she a likeable character? Is she someone you'd spend several years of your life talking to? I know I wouldnt.  Edit: This review got waaay more attention than I expected, so let me address something here. I am NOT mad about being friendzoned in a game. As a straight (mostly) adult woman, why would I care about some fictional woman in a video game made by, to be frank, some beta whiteknight? The game bothers me because it ensues that it is perfectly normal and exceptable to be led on and manipulated by a woman, and that a woman who does this should be given the attention she so craves. Emily is emotionally abusive and she does nothing but gaslight you. If Emily's character was instead a man, people would be outraged by how the character is portrayed. A man can't be as emotionally manipulative as Emily was, that would be seen as you know, ABUSIVE. Which is what Emily is. But instead, the game makes you feel guilty for doing anything wrong to her, because she's a woman. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social agenda. To all the people telling me that it's a reflection of what they dealt with in High School or College and therefore they could relate, jesus christ, I guess you enjoyed being walked all over and not having any self-control. If a girl was treating me like this, I'd drop her instantly. If you see this story as realistic, then that shows the kind of person you are - someone who is easily manipulated. Because to me, in no way, shape or form is this a realistic depiction of a friendship, as anyone with anything going on up there in that old brain of theirs would know to avoid people like Emily, not talk to her for what, 5 years and repeatedly get screwed over by her? tl;dr I'm not mad that I couldn't get any of Emily's roast beef sandwich, more so that the character was portrayed in a way where you were supposed to appease her, no no, respect her even, despite her actions. Because she's a woman. And women are always right, right?",

            "review_text": "This game is an experience. Not specifically a good one. Not specifically a bad one. Many people may relate to this and feel emotionally attached. Many people won't. The problem with this game is that it doesn't show you backstory of the player and the backstory of Emily. They're friends from what we gather and that's just it. Emily then goes on to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boyfriend, dump him, say we should make out, accuse you of wanting to smash, date ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boyfriend again and ditch you. The real emotion in this game comes with deeper thought. A lot of the other reviews of this game and from my friend's experiences allow me to see that they feel sad as Emily is gone. She's gone forever and you have no way of talking to her again. Even after you cared for her all of these years. That's the problem. WE shouldn't feel sad. WE shouldn't want Emily to come back. She ditched us after all we've done and she should feel bad for doing so.  Yeah, she's gone and we can't speak to her.  Yeah, all those years have gone by.  HOWEVER, when she grows older, she will feel remember us and remember how her boyfriend hurt her and she we be sad.  Only then can we speak to her again; and by this time, things would have changed.  TLDR/CONCLUSION;  This game is interesting. It may come as a sudden shock for people but over time, things will get better. There is a glitter of hope in the end of this game, just as there is one in your life. Yes, I mean you - the reader. If you feel as if you can relate to this game in any way, things will get better. Just give it some time, just as this game would and it'll all end peachy.",

We were, at least I thought we were, soulmates....  ....  I have never been more wrong.  Emily, is without a doubt, the most pathetic and cruel human on the planet. No matter what we did, and no matter what we said, somehow, in Emily's mind, we took advantage of her, even though she is quoted as saying she doesn't regret ANYTHING, nor would take ANYTHING back, we still become the bad guy,..  HOW IS THAT FAIR?!?!?!?!  We tried to rescue her, from an emotionally and possibly physically abusive relationship, with epic toolbag BRAD. Then when she finally comes to her senses and leaves him, she visits us. And that is where it all goes wrong.... NO MATTER WHAT WE DO!  Then, in her delusional mind, she is rescued by EPIC TOOLBAG....BRAD. She treats like a villain, and proclaims BRAD to be the HERO....pshhh. What a load of crap!!!!   We are given NO free will, to truly speak our mind, to let her know how we truly feel about her (aka: WE LOVE HER), and absolutely NO option to win her back. Why give us options to say something, only to take them away, right before our eyes! That is cruelty. We worked up the courage to say it, before a robot from the Matrix came and erased our answers and replaced them with awkward small-talk, made by strangers. This is not even an accurate represenation of real life. You have heartache, but you never give up. You get turned down, but you keep trying, and fighting, and no robot EVER really comes to erase, and then replace your answers.   All in all, it was fun and interesting, and did bring back memories, and left me nostalgic for times past... BUT it left me wanting more. Much, much more. More freedom is needed to make this game more realistic, so that we are at least left with the impression that we can win Emily back. Or at least that we are given the option ourselves to turn down Emily, because quite frankly, she is the worst by the end of the game!   Bye.  Kate is away",

            "review_text": "Emily is Away is a short game, where you (re)live the good old time of the instant messaging with icons, with horrible sounds. You play Emily's best friend and for 5 or 6 years, you're going to see this relationship evolve depending on your choices during the discussions. You begin at the end of high school until finishing college.  If there is something that you should know is that there is no happy ending. Well, I mean, you can be as nice as you, as much as responsible, trying to please Emily and the result will be always the same: she'll call on you. At the end, you can see that life changed you both.  You can clearly see that your character was crushing on Emily, however, you don't know if she's feeling the same. You don't have any control on outside events, like Travis's party or what happened between you and her during the week-end after she broke up with her boyfriend.  However, it's frustrating to try different routes. Each end of the discussion is Emily is away. You tell her that you can miss a group project reunion, a party with your friends, etc.. so that you can listen to her and she's rejecting this offer for example.  The fact is that Emily is Away is just a game made for nostalgic people. You just press enter to see the text you're writing (even correcting faults) and you choose your answer just before among three proposed. Some of them will not change the course of the discussion, others are important.  The only real fun thing to do is to try many usernames, to unlock new icons. I would even say that some may be not belonging to this era at all (Portal, Undertale and others). Another funny thing is to look at everyone's profile and remember when you were putting quotes or lyrics everywhere.  But it's not because it may become boring after a while that Emily is Away isn't worth a shot. It's reflecting life as it can happen, missed opportunities and relationships. It's always interesting to see that and besides, like I've said, it's also for nostalgic people, though I'm not feeling a nostalgia wave.  The graphics aren't bad at all. It's really well-chosen for what the game will want to do. As for the soundtrack, apart the infamous Windows sound and the ping, you don't have anything.  My only problem is that the cursor isn't pointing on where you want, I needed to click on the left of a button to manage to play - it has caused me a problem the first time I've played it as I thought it was stuck. I suppose it's a problem due to the a wider monitor than the game can handle.  Emily is Away is a good little game in the end and as it's free, your wallet will not cry for money.",

Everyone else has nothing (other than your character who from the dialog options is assumed to be a total beta).   The ending is supposed to be 'realistic' but all of the characters are so borring and get so little development you just don't care.   Gameplay itself was just chosing an option and mashing your keyboard until it typed it out so you could send (which got old quick).  The graphics are badly designed in that they made it pixel art for some reason instead of just trying to imitate XP.  The only 'fun' part in this 'game' was picking your avatar and name and watching how she reacts.   I don't know if you can even call this a game. I mean, at least in VNs you can have bad endings! If you want a branching story, play a VN or a telltale game. This is a waste of 40 minutes.",

Decisions you make do not matter, schools you choose do not matter. basically anything you DECIDE to do doesnt matter beacuse the next chapter you do has the same basic plots. You know its game over before its game over, and that ruins the fun. there is not a single way to WIN this game. without spoiling to much of the game, dont think this game is a dating sim, dont think for a second that Emily and [PLAYER] wind up together in a happy-go-lucky relationship.  if by reading this review spoils anything or prevents you from downloading it, then sorry, but this game is a 1 play through game. Trust me, there are no alternate endings. you got what everyone else gets..   if by chance in the last chapter you manage to get Emily to sign off before you, (which can be done, its not hard)  i would personally consider that the best win possible    if your looking for a quick nostaligic game (that actually DID accurately portray what i was like during those years) than i suppose this game is for you    in terms of everything else, i would NOT recommend.   and to the developer  Emily is Away had potential to be an actually very fun game. I know that this game was probably made with a little hard work and time, and for that I give you kudos   I know how difficult coding games are, beleive me I do I know that making alternate choices and paths are not the easiest thing in the world, as it requires more time and code.  but i also know that if you DID choose to make it more open ended, or have alternative choices, maybe even 3 more, then i would have probabaly had something better to say about it.  I know my one review means little to nothing but i just dont want other players to get the wrong impression about the game   Kyle Seeley, im sorry if this story (or something similar) happened to you in person. It happens. I know all to well what it was like back then, trying to express feelings to someone, and trying to maintain contact when two peoples lives are so busy and seperated. I hope that if something like this DID happen, that you have found someone to enjoy your life with who is ALOT better than Emily ever could be.

I do not recommend playing this mainly because of the following reasons:  1st - She says sometime during the game that she is planning to ditch her friend just for us to be alone with her = bi***,  2nd - If you don´t want to end up with her, the game is utterly pointless, just non-stop chat that leads to no conclusion at all = They make us either date and get a decent ending or try to just stay friends and get an idiotic boring ending,  3rd - Our replies are very limited and the way she talks to us - she 'hits on' us every 10 seconds - is not very original and becomes quite tedious and repetitive,  4th - *SPOILER* - Near the end she gets dumped by her douch*bag boyfriend, immediately after that she tries to hit on us and become our girlfriend. If you just want to be her friend she will go back to her douch*bag boyfriend after a while - she must really love the 'd'. What a bi***,  I do not recommend playing this, unless you want to 'date' a virtual girl (that just wants our di*k) and be bored while doing so.  Although the game is free, I am sorry to say that playing this is a waste of your time. There are better free games out there for you to spend time with.  Cheers!",

I sat through this whole game hoping to find something interesting, but this game reminded me of Micheal Jacksons 'ABC', as I found myself clicking '123' and 'ABC', whilst all the outcomes are Emily talking about some random, monotonous horse ♥♥♥♥.  What you think you are going to type is not what you are going to type. This game rarely ever types out what you wanted to stay. The character you play as always finds a way to add something completely irrelevent to the end of his sentences that have ♥♥♥♥-all to do with what you wanted to type. By the way, have you guys heard about that new Cadbury's chocolate bar that comes out next year?  To top it all of, the choices of this game are nothing short of illusions. The only thing that pressing 123 does is change the way you say what you want. You will always end the game with the same outcome, regardless of what you chose.  Here's my final verdict, which I will give you the freedom to chose.  1. ♥♥♥♥ this game 2. This game sucks balls 3. Sorry mate, your game's ♥♥♥♥  I give this game a 10/10, 'cause I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot and had no say in the matter.",

You start as a High School senior in the 00s, who uses AIM for kicks to talk with his friends, I don't know how they got away with using the AIM graphics. It is the end of your highschool life. You and your friends would like to celebrate, as any average youthful adults would. You and Emily discuss going to the party, but there is this prickly sore in your side named Brad, Brad has been flirting with Emily on the internet. Watch as you make the worst ♥♥♥♥ing descisions possible, watch as you ♥♥♥♥♥ out with certain dialogue choices. Will you end up with Emily? Will Brad sexually coerce her? Will it all end in flames? Will you kiss her? Will you choose to ♥♥♥♥ her? I won't give anything away, but the fact there is a very emotionally touching yet simple ending and we all learn that we have known girls in our youth like Emily. Overall, I say try it, It is really deep and well done for a free to plane online dating sim type game. I'd reccomend you play it just for the plot and emotional experience of it all.

You suggest coming over ONE WEEK after a break up, WHAT IN THE ♥♥♥♥ did you think was gonna happen? At least I told you NOT TO BRING ALCOHOL, so at least you can't blame beer for your poor choices, can you? Then I went back in time and told you NOT to come AT ALL, 'cause it would be bad timing.

I'm always there to listen to you yap about Brad, that ♥♥♥♥ing weirdo with a Donnie Darko obsession--I'm sure if you marry him he'll end up murdering you and the children, and committing suicide--then I was there to listen to you talk about that moron Travis, who you even agreed was a ♥♥♥♥♥ucker. God, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate Travis. No matter what decision I make, you act like a god damn child. You make everything about yourself, and then when I finally have the strength and resolve to tell you I'm not gonna be your emotional crutch anymore, you say 'I should start thinking about people other than myself.' Isn't THAT ironic? Guess what, you idiot: I graduated with a major in engineering, I'm getting myself a great job, I'm gonna move on my own while you go live with Travis in a trailer park, I'm gonna make money, I'm gonna enjoy life a little while, then I'm gonna call Emma again and get married, we're gonna have some kids, and a nice house in the suburbs, and you're gonna wish you hadn't ♥♥♥♥ed me over across the space-time continuum. Travis' hairline is gonna start receding when he's 25, just like his dad's. So ♥♥♥♥ you.

It might give people some closure/insight as to how relationships have changed over time -- is it because of something you said in your online conversations?  There's a lesson from this game, at least I took something from it. In the end, it's probably best to actually *talk* to people if you care about rather than AIM them once a year.",

Decided not to let her come over on the rebound for fear something could go down that would screw things up. Felt like crap for not 'Being there' when I promised I would and still Friendzoned.   Cried myelf to sleep that night.   8/10  Pros: It was a quick and easy game, so you feel good about yourself when you finished it quickly. It was very well put together to make it seem like it was AIM messenger, a bunch of different icons in reference to pop culture of each year, I could have inappropriate usernames and not get kicked off or banned because I used a certain five letter word that starts with P.  Cons: It isn't really a complete 'point and click' because you have to use the keyboard to 'type' the messages out. By that I mean I more or less ran my hands back and forth on the keyboard and somehow I still typed complete sentances. I got bored easily. It was REAAAALLLY easy for me to get new icons by just changing my username to 'Zelda' or something. The chapters were very short. It made it seem like the lives of these two people literally paused for an entire year until the next time they talked to each other.

I understand it could be considered a reflection of a real life story, but this is a story with no real...resolution. Is the resolution is to somehow stop yourself from being conned into these waste-of-time relationships? But you would never know it hurt until you got into one yourself and had some great experiences. So should you avoid all relationships altogether to completely eliminate that chance? Not quite...  ...I think it more or less shatters the expectation that the one you think will be with you forever is meant to be with you. There is no ONE person, and statistically there are probably several different viable candidates (even based on your picky 'ol criteria!). I mean look at the side character Emma or whoever it is you end up hanging out with at college. What the &lt;H-E -Double Hockey Sticks&gt; was wrong with her? Did she die? Seems like you had buttloads of fun with her!  Maybe when I have gone through the thick of these teen/young adult years I will come out with a better resolution, but perhaps this is what the author meant:   It is best that you go away sometimes  , that you set the pace for your life and that emotional attachments, like most other things, can be transient in this world. But don't let this get you down, it may be worth it to love after all, and we are social creatures. I wish you the best of luck with this.  4.5/5 Heart Containers",

I saw it listed on the free to play list on the steam homepage, and it definitely intrigued me. This game is great fun and can be explored more in-depth than just the main story, however even though it is a choose your own adventure style game, all paths ultimately lead to the same outcome.

First everything is happyness, its all awesome and you love her without telling her. Then shes like presuming you her new bf or friend Then she has a brokeup/badtime and you are the one who need to help her Then shes confused and doesnt know if she loves you and if you love her, but who cares, she will blame on you. Then she comes back to her exbf or gets a new friend and now you are an 'X' for her....  And the vicious circle starts again with another girl...

You can do whatever you want the devs have decided to deny a 'good' ending always. There ARE different endings possible but it's never a 'good' one. So there is really no reason to play this game again and that sucks. I wished they had more possible endings.  After all it's free2play and therefore I was glad to play this game.

Your choices don't change things in any meaningful way. If you DO try to do a playthrough of an honest, trying-to-succeed relationship with her, you'll get friend-zoned at best (it's up in the air as to whether you remain friends or not). Even if you try to just remain friends with Emily, you'll still get kicked to the 'this is weird between us, are we still friends?' curb.  so, obligatory list:  PROS: 1. it's free 2. It's easily 'completed' achievement-wise, for padding your games-completed percentage 3. it has trading cards for SHINY SHINY BADGES!!! Myyyy PRRRECIOUUUUSSSS.....  4. Interesting story mechanic and storyline, so long as you don't mind your choices never really mattering  CONS: 1. It's more of a kinetic novel than a virtual novel (a subtype of virtual novel where player does not interact with the story... referenced here because the choices don't really affect gameplay at all, and has no change in anything other than filler-fluff) 2. There is no good ending, only your choice of bad (since the game revolves around you and Emily, and it ends with your friendship in question (at best) EVERY time; Therefore, no good ending) 3. NO skip-mode, you have to hold down a button to 'type' the entire time, and remember to hit ENTER. Makes trying for multiple playthroughs very very annoying.",

This game is going to be a memorable experience for anyone who grew up during the heyday of the AOL chats (from the late 90s to the early 2000s). Our generation was one of the first where technology played a such a huge role in our socialization into young adults. This game succeeds not in its presentation, but in its ability to tap into the emotions of a simpler time; a time when we were developing our identities, and trying forge our futures with a sense of hopeful optimism.  The game consists of a series of instant message conversations over a 5 year period with a friend by the name of “Emily.” Without giving away too many details, the game’s dialogue is an emotional rollercoaster that almost any American millennial will be able to relate with. Emotions such as the the thrill of having your first “best friend” of the opposite sex, the jealousy of jilted love, and the anxiety of confessing one’s feelings are all skillfully woven into the game’s dialogue. At the end of this game, one can’t help but empathize with the protagonist, and relate the character of Emily to someone from their own past. It could be someone that you felt strongly about, but that for one reason or another, did not admit your feelings toward.  What impressed me about this game was not the mechanics or presentation of it. At the end of the day, it is simply a free-to-play game, with limited content, and a relatively basic plotline. However, it is the creative genius behind the concept itself, and the game’s ability to evoke such strong emotions in the player, that make this a memorable title. I would really like to see this developer expand upon this title, or even create other IM-based game experiences. This is an exploration into a new genre of gaming, much in the same way that Dear Esther, Gone Home, and Her Story charted new territory.  Give this game a try, and you might be pleasantly surprised. The pleasure comes not from the experience itself, but from your reflection of the experience.",

If it had more endings or routes that could change how the story went, then it would have been better. Overall its dependent on the nostalgia and feeling of hope and regret for trying to get with someone you like. In a way it shows how growing up liking someone can be and its consequences, but it would be nicer to see more options or more endings. Or maybe a different way they could conversate. It only really talked about seeing each other partying and college and drinking but not exploring other aspects of what other people do in college. I would hope going through college could be portrayed better. Also, she makes it seem like its a bad thing whether or not you take advantage of her which doesn't make sense. How can she be that stupid and be with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? There can be better girls than this. Overall it is a good free game and its appearence and sounds and references were cool, but maybe with more ideas in it it could be something more. It does make you feel something in a nostalgic, sad way though, so thats a plus I guess.",

The interface is clever and gives you a stronger vibe of talking to a real person than SmarterChild or CleverBot, even if Emily's dialogue has no real AI behind it. My only real problem is the plot; as I said, this game feels unfinished, as it's over incredibly fast and every play through feels the same in spite of making different choices. My hope is that this game is a starting point, and that an expanded version comes out later with far more choices (that have more noteworthy consequences) and that chronicles more than just a couple of years. I'd like to see this game follow Emily and the player through several decades of their lives -- or, perhaps, keep it limited to the college timespan, but allow for more interactions to give the player's choices more opportunities to change their relationship.  One other thing: The game never really announces before you play it that you're a guy that's pining away for Emily, so figuring that out while playing was a little jarring to me, as I'd been playing as a female friend. I'd either make this clearer at the onset so the player can enter with the right frame of mind, expand the conversation options so it's not trying so hard to steer the player in that direciton, or broaden the game entirely and allow the player to decide from the start who and what they are to Emily. This game is primarily about a relationship, and that can still be examined whether we assume the role of this one specific guy or not.  In any case, none of these qualms were enough to make me not play. The game is free, so give it a peek and experience it for yourself. You can literally get through the game in about 10 minutes, so anyone and everyone can find an opportunity to give it a try. It's a nice little gaming experiment.",

It's telling to me that    so many of the people who played this game have apparently walked away with the idea that Emily is a ♥♥♥♥♥ If this game was an attempt to teach players that women have lives outside of the men who want to ♥♥♥♥ them, it's a failure at that and if it was an attempt to show how Nice Guys suffer from heartbreak when a woman rejects him, then it can make players of any gender aside from male feel unsafe.

The story is about a girl named Emily. You never see her in-game other than in the chat responses (so you can think about any face you want).  Yeah, it is a text-based game, nice chat simulator, but your chat responses are not doing anything to the main story. Yes, 'Emily will remember that' appears or 'You have decided to attend on XY', but I never saw any other main story change, other than some words are replaced by something else or so.   ENDING SPOILER:    You will get friendzoned in every single ♥♥♥♥ing time, there is only one ending. I have played it 3x, once I was tryin to be 'that guy', once 'just a friend' and once 'lol I do not care bout you, ♥♥♥♥ off' guy. I know, it is story more than a game, trying to play on our feels and trying to make us sad by deleting every single last response by something ('Will things between us be ever the same?' ----&gt; 'How is your school?' ----&gt; Later everything gets replaced by 'goodbye'), but I do not really know. (I sound like 2005-2006 Emily now, holy ♥♥♥♥)    Oh, and just because 'the game' is only 15 minutes long and is free, that does not mean I HAVE TO give it 'recommended'. No.  TL;DR: - Text Based game - Your choice has no actual vaule to the story - More than text based game it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ interactive film - Brad - Friendzone  It is 15 minutes long game with a few MBs, just play it by yourself.

For those who remember socializing over the internet as a kid, and potentially getting romantically involved, it will probably strike a few buttons. Especially with the recurring themes.  The game is centred around a fictional character named Emily, depending on how you talk to her, she will respond to you and things will play out differently.  Dialogue options are almost always the same apart from pre-defined branches. Which really stops its replay value. You have to get through a lot of rubbish to get to different branches.  It's pretty stupid how it chooses to automatically put you in the shoes of an American sophomore, as an Australian I couldn't relate to that, or the college theme.  But hey, it's a free game. Free nostalgia hit. Give it a go if you're over 20 years old. If you're younger, you won't get the same rush.",

No. This game essentially proves that statements like 'I'll always be there for you', 'You'll always be my best friend', and 'We're still friends' mean absolutely nothing.   Two teenage friends talk, but you essentially watch the end of a friendship.    Your crush gets a BF, you play the jealousy game, you visit, you grow distant, and you essentially end your friendship by growing distant from one another    Sure, the game seems like an interactive where you get to choose your route, but you'll always come back to the same ending. Now, Emily does 'remember' options you choose and will bring them up later, but it doesn't change what ending you get.  I've seen similar stories played many times throughout my life and they're people I realize were never people I should have trusted. People I should have never even met. People that I feel my life would have been better if I had never heard of these people....but those are stories for another time. This simply reminds me too much of my own past, showing how little you can rely on somebody...   PROS: Achievements AIM nostalgia of Windows XP days No bugs and programmed decently Free  CONS: Boring A friend who doesn't know what she wants Death of a friendship Depressing ending as you essentially watch it all rot away   Despite it being a free game, I only recommend this for the free, easy achievements. The bonus icon achievements have some nice in-jokes, but that's about it. As far as the story itself goes, you might want to pass. Nostalgic and well-programmed text game, but not something that I enjoyed playing. Sometimes the past should stay burried.   2/10. (Emily, just go away and stay away. Best friend my *ss...

My biggest issue with this game is that it's too set path, no matter what you do the outcome is always the same. Why have options when they don't change anything? It's a story with false pretend options?  I like the idea, the graphics, but it's executed incredibly poorly with the crap story. The girl is realistic though, she comes on to you then accuses you of some how being the one to plan it :S haha I've had that happen so often, and when you turn them down thry cry! The game is realistic you cannot win with a woman.",

I still of course felt absoultely nothing for her because I really still didn't know who she was, so I continued to focus on my studies attempting to avoid prolonged discussions with this creepy girl on the internet who wont leave me alone.  I finally reach the end of the game where she finally gives up and I get to say goodbye, honestly the block button is an easier to get away from creepy internet stalkers (she even went as far as to try and meet up, what a creep!)

Oh my god, the ending is so cliche. 'Do you miss me?' Thinks the character but never says it cause hes afraid at what shell think of him.

Not just that but they talk about some music from those times.  The story it's self is not that much of a hit to me, but im sure you will find it good somehow, after all, this game has different dialog choices that shape the story.  *Spoilers Starts Here*  So you try to tell this girl Emily that you love her, and yet no matter what you do, she goes back to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag named Brad. You will never get to date her, what the ♥♥♥♥ is this? I feel like Ben Affleck in Chasing Amy! I mean come on! Brad dumped her badly, while that was happing, I was nice to her!  *Spoilers Ends Here*  TL;DR It's fun to try out, even though there's not a whole lot to it, but there is nothing wrong with it.",

This is kinda ♥♥♥♥.  EDIT: (my previous commentery below still valid): I GOT IT!!! There are no different endings! This game is a huge feminist troll! The game teaches you not to ♥♥♥♥ or else you'll end up alone and miserable like feminists want you to think of MRA guys. If you act up like a white knight then you're too of a puss to get any girl and you end up alone again like real male-feminists.

I don't understand how this is actually free too! insane right? it's like all of my wishes for a new release were rolled up into one and combined to create this.  The storyline? well I found that the NPC's that you would meet had such a variety, and the best thing? you can say up to THREE things to them, and the best thing is you can use a keyboard to type the replies out as if you're actually typing, the storyline was long and epic, many crazy things happened and the amount of plot twists was amazing, you didn't know what would come round the corner at any time, and the epic intensity of typing out a message and not knowing if the main NPC 'emerly35' would respond nicely or eternally hate you for savagely destroying her self confidence, it was honestly so insane and amazing as I was on the edge of my seat around every single turn of and unravel of this epidemic of a storyline, this game has done so much for me, it even made my mom think I actually had some sort of social life.  Pros:  Everything.  Cons: NPC 'emerly35' is sometimes away.

The game gave me the feeling that I'm just some creep who can not forget about high school and has the desire to keep stalking his high school crush throughout his college years. The game's ending is very... bland? The girl who you are talking to for the duration of this game has a typical 2000's girl attitude and is very bland, too.

It becomes cascadingly clear that, as with many (if not all) 'choices matter' titles there is actually very little deviation from plot points across playthroughs representing different choices. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, at least for a free game. Though I feel it must be pointed out - if only to throw in an objective opinion.  So why the positive review? The game does wonders in conveying emotion and even themes and morals if the player is looking for it. Standard $60 titles are picked up for their playability. Indie releases such as this are picked up for their impact on the player. Without sounding too pretentious, I enjoy a game infinitely more if it successfully incorporates meaning and intent seamlessly into it.   So yes, its worth the playthrough, but not because it's bringing new life to the 'choices matter' genre.",

Now let's review the pros and cons of Emily is Away  Pros: -Customization options allowing you to feel more like the character your controlling a simple thing but it's nice.  -Immersive and relatabe story through the awkward times most people face between highschool and college.  -feels.buckets.of.feels.  -nostalgic sounds of computers that bring you back to a simpler time.  -good charcter development on emily,brad,travis,and the protagonist.  -so many easter eggs to movies and music.  -short but well written and doesn't overstay it's welcome  -it's free and it's pretty small size wise.and if you don't enjoy it you can always just delete it but it's definitely worth a try.  Cons: -you know that game until dawn..yeah this isn't that game your choices esentially don't matter ,no matter what college you go to your going to end up meeting mike and emma,no matter how you treat emily she's not gonna date you,and no matter what the game ends with you deleting your true feelings to ask trivial ♥♥♥♥ til you can only say good bye.  -would have liked to be able to talk to some of the other people on my friends list like mike,brad,or emma to solidify the plot more and make it more in depth  - logic lapses my character doesn't seem to know brad yet brad is clearly on my characters friends list since year one was is he just there for  convienence,sake?  Same with Mike and Emma who I supposedly 'met in college'. My character also clearly no longer talks to travis but his name remains in the game infinitely and we watch as he seems to spiral downward into depression and yet we never mention this even though he was supposedly our friend back in high school.  -little to no development on mike and emma. How am I supposed to have a crush on a girl I barely know?  -The development Emma does have makes her eerily similar to Emily....Is my character a stalker am I obssessed with girl who like coldplay and snow patrol? It feels an awful lot like he's trying to replace Emily yet in most scenarios that feels really ooc.  -feels.buckets.of.feels.  -no trigger warning to protect those of a depressive nature from the feel buckets.  -protagonist automatically sabotages your final talk with emily and their is nothing you can possibly do to stop him...enjoy reliving those heart breaking moments where you to couldn't say how you really felt.  -...did i mention the feels?!?! they are for reals...seriously I need sobbing advisory for this game because that ending ;m;  - despite what you may think it has very limited replay value  All in all it was a good game ,a good way to spend an hour or so and is certainly worth the few seconds it takes to download. I daresay it's one of the better single player ftp games available on steam i'd put it in the top 20% of games of it's kind. So keep up the great work :)",

Overall, it's a one-shot experience and wasn't really meant for replayability, unless you're willing to find the easter eggs hiddened in the game.  9/10, particularly the only con was the lack of endings.",

The only thing I didnt like is where you make a choice and it erases it and puts something else. I want to know what Emily would say. It's just not in the story.  I agree with a lot of the people. This game is full of a lot of raw emotions from memories of our own past. I hope they put more out for this game. As it stands it has very little replay value when very little changes in the game and the end is always the same. Still its a great game. Its free.

            "review_text": "Emily is Away is a game about your time from High School senior year to College senior year, chronicling your once-a-year IM conversation with a girl named Emily. The game's writing is pretty poor, however, because in every instance that you talk to Emily she'll blame SOMEONE ELSE for her life's problems instead of herself, based on your dialogue choices from the previous year. No matter what, every year will be worse than the previous between you and Emily and even when you go out of your way to make things go well, it just won't. No matter what options you pick, it will end the same way in the final year. The game has no GOOD ending, it has only one ending. Perhaps the author intended for you to only play through it only once, which is why every route goes the same way in the end, so no one could correlate all the endings together like I did .. but...  What are some pros? -The game emulates AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) down to a tee, from sound effects to colours and appearance -It can seem like a nice nostalgic trip back to your years in high school (assuming you're close to 30 and actually know what AIM was) -The typing mechanic seems like a nice touch -I guess you could say the game is gender neutral in that the random button for names has both male and female names, so Emily and Emma are bisexual  So what are some cons? -The plot is a static line, no matter what, the plot is always the same -The typing mechanic wears its novelty out really quick, and there's no way to autotype -The game betrays the player's agency by changing the entire context of options you choose, changing dialogue from your intention to the all-encompassing binary choice system that in the end boils down to the same ending -you'll never succeed -for some reason both love interests have their names starting with Em which could be confusing for a listener if you're trying to explain the plot to someone  In the end, I just can't recommend this. I've played a bunch of VNs and text adventure games, but in most games your choices have SOME effect. Other than minor changes in the dialogue, the game ends the same. While typing this, I thought to myself 'maybe I just had to choose this option differently, maybe it's because I chose the tech school?' so I loaded it up just to change that, it didn't make a difference. Your character shows a lackluster approach to life where they can't even type with grammar or proper spelling, and in the end, you always end up with the same crappy ending.  Don't bother playing this unless you want to read a really lousy short story observing a character you'll grow to depise in no time at all.",

I found a meta game in trying to type the same letter he was going to type before he typed it.   But that's not the point.  Towards the very end of the game, there are plenty of opportunities that you have to tell emily your true feelings (to me they seemed a little needy, 'Do you ever miss me?') and when you select for your character to tell her the true feelings you have, the character begins typing the message you intended. However, he will then erase the message and enter his own small talk, asking how the weather is or if she's seen any good movies lately. This seems very frustrating to players because we are in a very saturated industry with games where 'Choice changes the game!!' and little decisions do change a little piece of the game, but the outcome is always the same in the end, emily leaves, and you never get your chance with her.  So why do I recommend this game? Well the way I felt during the game, was that I was my character's desires.. His mind, i suppose. I would tell him what to say, and he would type it, sometimes not even the way I worded it. That's where it gets interesting at the end of the game. I tell my character to tell Emily he misses the way they used to be, and he types it, then erases it because he's scared. I'm left thinking to myself 'You idiot! You're ruining your chance!!' But that is when I realized that the character I believed I was controlling must be thinking the exact same thing. Sometimes in life your whole being wants to do something, and yet, you just don't do it. Whether it's asking that person out on a date, taking that risk on a dream job, or whatever else.  That is why I like the game, that is why I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an interesting narrative and a new look at the art of video games.  Overall? 7/10. The game didn't blow my mind, but I really liked the direction it got my mind to take.",

You can go further than even just the scope of the average Steam user: survey Young People Who Use Computers in general, and there's probably nearly a 100% probable chance that:   1. They attended a high school with at least one, probably two Emily(s). It has literally been proven to be the most common white girl name in the world; actual scientists confirmed it.  2. They used a computer with a windows operating system that had some kind of crappy free messenger software: either MSN or AIM, probably.  3. They were - and are probably still are - bad at talking to girls.  So, honestly, it's really confusing to me how people don't understand the sort of point of the game. Maybe people are just very resistant to seeing any kind of resemblance of themselves in the black mirror (I know it's a cute metaphor for a computer screen, leave me alone.)  If anything, it's just a fun little adventure to play through a few times to explore the different reactions and responses, and then feel sad as you realise that the whole point was that you weren't really supposed to get any agency or closure anyway. The Walking Dead is basically the same thing, except that they paid a whole bunch of people to hide the basic choose-your-own-adventure engine under all the graphics and sad music and zombie gore, and even in spite of all that work you can only really play through it maybe twice.   You can probably play this maybe even three times before you get bored! At least!",

Honestly if you've read the other reviews than you don't need to read mine as almost everyone has experienced the same thing. However, just in case you want to read this. for some reason, I guess I'll go on.   This game does have a good idea. It is a game based on reliving a higher education experience which is backed up with a retro art style and older pop culture. However the new idea ends there and everything else is pretty much standard dating sim gameplay with the exception of the part where you date the person. I personally didn't mind that and at time of writting I am not sure if there are ways to earn an ending that allows that. There is dating, but not for you and emily.  There are a few problems i have with the game. For one there are several ways to play with several endings, which is a good or bad thing based on you perspective, but what annoyed me is that there are several stories; this caused Emily to have a different personality between the stories and being hypocritical in some playthroughs as well as completely unlikeable. The main problem is that having too many stories makes it unavoidable to have a few desrepancies.  Overall, dull game that just becomes frustrating the more you play it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to waste their time.",

I can see much potential with this, although perhaps any follow up would not hold qute the same level of captivation as this. As a free to play there is no real reason to not give this a go, especialy as it will likely only steal 30 minutes of your time.

Some people have said Emily is a bad or unlikable person, but I think it's more about how two people can have different perspectives on what has taken place. If you get into the mindset of her being someone you're already invested in, then everything actually works out in a very realistic way.  Normally I would say a game should make you care, but the framing device of the messenger actually really helps get you into that mindset. You mash keys as though you're actually typing, and the dialogue choices, while nothing too complex, cover enough options for you to reply in a way you would naturally. Most natural is when you see yourself delete what you really mean to put in something that will be better recieved. It's actually fairly immersive.  The writting is solid, and I think pretty much everybody can relate. You may not have had the same exact experience, but the emotions it elicites will bring back memories. The game isn't a technical masterpiece, and it doesn't have a ton of interaction with the player, but it is something different. You may want to replay and see the other options, but I opted to live with the choices I had made, just like in real life. After all, it's all about perspective; there really were no right or wrong options in the game, just messages and experiences that were different.

The only negative aspects of this game are that it's super short and that whatever choices you make will not influence the game's ending. But overall, it's free and it's fantastic.   Positives: +Screw paying, it's free +It only takes up 512mb +Emotional storyline +Simplistic and nostalgic throwback to the 2000s +Emotionally-charged ending  Negatives: -Extremely short game -Only one ending; Choices do not ultimately influence ending  SCORE: 9/11 Would go on this feels trip again.",

DO NOT watch others play this game for you will easily spoil it for yourself and just ruin the message behind it, so if you are thinking about simply playing the game then just do it. It is a free game that has a nice linking story to it with many branching paths of sorts, yet I want to warn this though that the game does have a notable limit of branching paths. You will end up choosing or facing similar choices and will simply get the same or slightly edited dialouge from the character. Overall the game is good and it's free? Yes please.

            "review_text": "**NO TL:DR, that's what my thumbs up is for* A visual novel like game with multiple choices of answers for every response of your character. Heavily inspired by the old days with AOL Instant Messanger, you follow the story of 'Yourself' and a girl named Emily. You go through 5 chapters that span 5 years (each real conversation is a chapter/year) and the tale of 2 friends from high school growing up. Interestingly enough, the player interacts by typing random characters in the keyboard with 'Yourself' typing his response. Now as the game progresses you can view certain people's profiles throughout the chapters to expand the world of friends that you live in.  Without spoiling anything as that's for the bottom because someone knows I need to release my feelings for this great title, it's definitely worth playing/reading through one time with straight up honest decisions. If you want to have some emotional or heart break type of moments or in general are an experimental type, I'd definitely re-read with a different mindset at all times.  --Finally, half-spoilerish (not really), I truly haven't made a grammar mistake in the review, even though it may seem as such--    **************SPOILERS AHEAD, STAY AWAY UNTIL YOU'VE PLAYED THE GAME ONCE*************  Such an interesting tale of 2 friends growing apart, and while in the review I may have sounded like I had alot on my mind, I really don't. The game is so interesting and mysterious, with times where you really feel that you the PLAYER not 'Yourself' is left in the dark or atleast feel something is going on behind the scenes. I'd only like to close out this review or my thoughts on this title with a very depressing or 'philisophical' sort of observation. On my third playthrough, I decided to full out try my hardest to win Emily, and in the end, as I had struggled to respond, 'Youself' kept changing it and kept readjusting it. All my attempts were futile, until in the end 'Yourself' had forced me to say goodbye, that's when I had finally realized something. You truly are looking into the eyes of somebody else, but the game gives you alot of choices at the beginning to fool you, but then as the person begins to give himself an identity he starts to change into a certain mindset. Then everything becomes futile.. Until you decide to leave, '[You] is away'. The only real reason I didn't say this observation is because it's an obvious spoiler and I truly enjoyed nicking the character as 'Yourself' because it feels like it, but it definitely isn't you...",

At its heart the game is about change, as you go year by year, chapter by chapter, you see Emily holding on to the the past, whilst she talks about everyone else changing. Although this game is extremely short, with only about 30 minutes of real gameplay and not much replayabilty, it is sweet, thought-provoking and emotional. Combine this with, what I like to call, the fake typing mechanic, it becomes an interactive experience. The only improvement I could ask for is for your choices to have more of an impact on the ending, but that is one short-coming that can be completely ignored. All in all, this is a short, sweet and powerful game, that definitely has become a must play.",

After playing this game however it was just bland and failed to invoke the slightest bit of feeling or even plain fun. It lacks depth to the writing and fails to build any attachement to the character you are speaking with and also harshly limits the actual choices available to you in a game that has very little gameplay outside of a short simulated conversation.

All you can do is sit there and watch yourself say something you don't wanna say while you're crying out on the inside wanting to tell her how you fell.

They break up and you just feel joy and happyness she asks why didn't you kiss her and you make a choice of why . Things start to go wrong in college but shes alright and you, worrying about her and care for her she vists a bit and comes over. Its all normal but brad comes back and once again makes you sad so you just have your last chat with her about life and how it's going. and at the end you can just end the chat and you go away but when you try to speak with her if things will be the same you dont because your too sad to say. and it all ends with a good old 'Goodbye' this was a excellent game but you need to make a REAL ending. The bond is still going on with the player becuase i dont suggest a 'goodbye' is a good ending. So the player dosen't feel complete and the game isn't really complete but my rate is 10/10 Such a good game.",

You just read something, choose a response, and you read the response. Is a novel with nothing to say, you are better of with a nice book.  It's a way of telling a story designed to resonate just with certain age demographic. If you didn't lived it, you'll get nothing from it. And gets tired almost instantly.  The story, is your basic teenage drama. and I REALLY mean basic. No challenge, no flavor, its just a vanilla tasting heartbreak made to resonate with as much people as possible. If you like soap operas, this is for you, and only for you.  SPOILERS from here on Everything you do is pointless and you'll end up hating your main character at the end no matter what. The main problem I see is the lack of multiple endings, a game like this really needs them. The control the player has is meningless. This portrays his as whiny and annoying, unable to move on or fight. The story just goes by without him learning, growing, or actually interacting. He is the toy of everyone but the player, and has no control over himself.  This lack of development makes him one of the most boring characters I've ever encountered. But maybe I'm just a heartless monster. Oh, and Emmily, I really couldn't care less about her.   conclusion: Has a lot of work in it, I can't deny that, but it's wasted and missplaced. 4/10",

Even the Death Cab for Cutie lyrics in emily's profile, and for that matter, the song lyrics in everyone's profiles was not only an attribute to that angsty, emo, mid 2000s era, but served as a time capsule.

This game brought back the sounds by far the most, since the visuals uh....don't really extend past 'Pixels' quality. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though; it's not important.

I think the main problem with this game is that your choices hardly change the story, all they do is change the Dialog slightly. It's a shame really, there's just one ending and it is very cliché. It would have been nice if there were around 3 endings for the game. One of the more poinless things I liked about the game were the profile pictures you could unlock with cheat codes. Basically, you would make your in-game name something specific and you would unlock a picture. Most of the profile pictures are based on popular games EG. Fallout, Borderlands, Zelda. If you use one of them on the first level, Emily will comment on the picture and will normally make a reference to the game. Overall, Emily is Gone is a decent game to try for an hour or so, though because of just having one ending it has hardly any replay value. If this was a paid game, I definitely wouldn't be so forgiving.",

Perhaps considering a download of this title if you'd like to relive a horrible relationship experience you've had in your life. There is some thought to this game, just how relationships are. How fragile those ties can be when someone is manipulating another intentionally or otherwise. Yet, I would never say put yourself through it. Unless you like pain, without love.

The premise is that you are a person using AOL Instant Messenger who has a friend named Emily that you talk to throughout the game. The game spans the years 2002-2006 as the characters go through the senior year of highschool all the way to the senior year of college. You get to choose a screen name and a buddy icon for your character and there are some nice little nostalgic references with the buddy icons and the profiles of your friends having cringey song lyrics and stuff in them. To be honest though, the game itself is really something you would play once and never touch again. There are no alternate endings or interesting branching paths from your dialogue choices. No matter what you choose the game always ends the same. This is a good thing because it really helps with the message of the game, but unfortunately it also kills any replayability. There can also be also a disconnect between the player and your character. Some of the dialogue choices I found were not something I would say. I understand the message of the game being that people grow apart and relationships change over time, but I guess I'm just not into the whole young drama thing as entertainment. But hey, it's free. I would recommend giving it a try. You might find something worthwhile and relatable about it since the premise can get pretty close to home with people that have been in similar relationships.",

If you are someone who has used an old computer from the early years of the 2000s, then you will be filled with nostalgia. The sound effects, interface, and even the subtle terminal noises will fill one with a sense of nostalgia and longing. The game was successful in capturing the true essence of life in the 'Stone Age' of computers, and for that, I was content with the game itself. Regardless, I was expecting more from this game, but I still found that game to be okay.",

Emily is an incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive girl. Your choices only affect the ways in which your character is strung along and blamed for Emily's choices. Go to that party she wants you to come to? Sorry, you didn't come onto her enough. Want to be there for her in her time of need? Too bad, she now blames you for your (supposed) advances. Want to try to talk things over? Emily is away.  If you're going for an emotional abuse simulator, this is exactly what you want.

I played it a few different times with different choices, and it wasn't at all satisfying because there was a frustrating disconnect between what I was picking, what the character was, and how everything turned out. I think this would function better as a short film rather than a game.",

That's not friendzone that's rejection; they have no physical attraction to you, so they do not see you as a potential mate in a sexual, romantic, or any other kind of way. However, This game made me see first hand that the friendzone is not only very real, but is a dangerous place. It is like being in purgatory whilst alive. I would never intentionally do that to someone, and Emily deserves to be with a guy to who treats her like crap since she treats the only guy who is nice to her like crap.

This game tells the story of your friendship with Emily, which you explore through yearly chat sessions over AIM. The story itself is pretty linear; choosing different dialogue options pretty much just changes some flavor text. But at the end, it left me silent and wondering how everything went so wrong with my real-life friendships. What happened to those friends I used to be so close to? Why did they seem to just disappear before my very eyes? Was there anything I could have done to stop it? Or were these relationships doomed to fail from the very start?  There is also references and memes, and I'm always a sucker for those. On top of that, something that so closely resembles Windows XP looks really funny (in a good way) on a Mac.

            "review_text": "TIME TO COMPLETE: 0.8 hours TIME TO COMPLETE ACHIEVEMENTS: 1 hour  Emily is Away acts as one of those free, short games which you always tell yourself you'd finish but fail to do so. At its core it's mostly a multi-choice game.  Here comes the days when there was no Facebook nor Skype but MSN with Yahoo!Messenger ruled the world. Players get to talk with a girl called Emily (just as the name suggests) and that's the main premise, but there are quite a lot of possibilities which you can brach into though it doesn't feel as many as they could be. The game unfortunately ends with you running out of questions to ask and all options being flooded with 'Goodbye'. That is unless you give up earlier than you should but that's about it.  There's also a little customization going on: you can change the avatar, text color and background. If you give yourself the right username you will be greeted with twice as many avatars, most of them easter eggs which branch into funny references at the start of each conversation but ultimately go back to normal. This is another reason why the game lacks replayability but I think it's also because there are so many choices to do it'd be painful to have multiple storylines for them all.  Among the surprises you get to experience is having your Steam friends included within the in-game friend list which is also quite funny since every profile has their own (I think random?) generated personal text. Currently I am unaware if it can use all of your friends or only those that are online during your play but nevertheless it's a lot of fun. Will generate a lot of reactions.  Overall it's a fun game which I advise everyone to try. It takes about one hour at most to finish and that is without unlocking every achievement. I also need to mention the fact that the game makes you press your keyboard whenever a choice is made as if you were typing, further adding to immersion.",

            "review_text": "This game was definitely a fun story(ies?). I enjoyed resetting and choosing different options to see how the story will change and how the choices would lead into different events. If one is into narratives and choose-your-own-adventure kind of interactive games, then this is a nice, short little adventure into the lives of two friends over the course of five years.  What I especially loved were the little buddy info pages of the various characters mentioned in the game, where you can learn little tidbits like Travis's loss, Mike's growing formality and Emma's interest in the same music as Emily.  Now, spoilers for those who haven't played the game yet and are reading reviews ahead of time, while I liked how Emily and the Player drift apart in the end no matter what you choose from a creative standpoint because of how painfully realistic it is, my emotions beg to differ. Gah, how I longed to piece back the relationship.  What's fascinating is that Emily did feel like an actual person in her dialogue and my friend, even though I didn't really know much about her, save some of her favorite music, her relationships, and that's she's an overall friendly person who holds a high opinion of the player. It actually reminded me of a friend I actually have in real life where the situation was actually quite similar, and along with the style of the game I was definitely sent down a nostalgia trip.   I do wish that the characters were a little more fleshed out, that I could also chat with Emma and Travis and Julie, that the little 'Emily will remember that' or 'You chose to go to art school' made more of a difference down the road like some of the other notes that appeared, but I understand that it's a free game. I guess you could say I enjoyed it so much I wanted more of it.  I definitely connected emotionally with this game and enjoyed exploring all the different ways the story could have gone as well as putting on different personas the options suggested. I'm certainly glad I came across it.",

Strange how many reviews are 'so sad, so friendzoned' or even getting annoyed with Emily, when the behaviour of the player character is so weak and indecisive.

This game is listed as a 'Virtual Novel', 'Dating Sim' and 'Choose your own adventure', but I'd really just list it as a 'Instant Messaging Tour' because it's actually none of those first 3.

Suggestion to make it better (slight spoilers): I felt the ending is right, it has a great punch and really makes you think however, I think you should be able to focus on you're relationship with Emma. I feel like like if you go through with ditching Emma you have chosen a future, rather than finding out what could have been with a nice fresh stable relationship. I feel the message is hurt by no matter what you do the game essentailly ending in a fail state. If you could chose Emma, sure you may have a fail state with Emily, but a prospurous relationship with Emma. If you can't end up with Emma, why would you chose to spend time with her over Emily. By allowing an ending a choice where you chose Emma, you admit that you may have at one point loved Emily, however, so much time has past and you have a good thing going, you know that spending time with this old flame could jepordize your relationship with Emma, so you have an actaul choice, do you sacrafice the thing you have now for a chance at a missed opurtunity in the past that is a wild card, or do you stay with the sure thing the girl that is in your life now and wants you now.",

The immersion is excellent, the sound effects were the icing on the cake in my perspective. Overall it is great game, and the fact that it was made for an older generation than mine, and yet the fact that it is still understandable, and that there weren't a ton of references thrown at you, although there still were all throughout for nostalgia's sake, I could still really enjoy the game. This really was an experience, I'll probably actually do multiple playthroughs of the game just to experience all of what the game still has in stock for me. 10/10 A lot of hard work and effort was put forth in making this game, thanks for the trip, can't wait to see what else is to come from this dev. :p",

The downside is that Emily herself seems quite... 'confused', or even inconsistent at times (in one year she acts like she's bitter about this thing, the next year she seems to not want/not care about it anymore, then she's sad about it), and it's a little disappointing how your choices dont have that big an impact on the outcome and you just get that bittersweet end, no matter what.  It would be interesting to see an extended version (maybe a paid version) with more endings, more choices, and in which the side-characters play a bigger part (maybe you can chat with Travis, Mike, Emma et al.)

The game is also free-to-play so you really don't have much of anything to lose in playing it.  The game takes you back to the days of instant messaging, akin to Yahoo Messenger and the like. Where you message a girl named Emily for a bit, once a year for 5 years. You talk about your lives and connect and learn each others stories and form a friendship.  There is no way to substantially alter the outcome of the story, almost all endings are the same, regardless of user input during the course of the game.  Yes, I think it would make more sense to add some other endings to the game where the player choices make more meaningful impacts on the outcome, but at the same time, this isn't something I expect out of a free-to-play game.

The really annoying thing is after you make each choice you have to type or pretend to type on your keyboard, I'm not really sure why they added that, for a more realistic feel? It was just annoying, typing jibberish on my keyboard over and over to try to progress the story.   I like to see people trying new things, but I'm glad it was free.",

I really like how the conversation between you and emily starts off as a normal conversation between friends and it the develops and there is that small window of oppurtinity that you will begin to date. Unfortunately that didnt happen and I just sat there as I had to choose an option while my character typed it out, deleted it and wrote something else, which was very sad to witness.  I think the inclusion of choosing the text option and then with eack key press it types the message was a really good design choice as it gave that added sense of that you were in control, but the game still had control over where the story was going to after you chose the initial choices.   The only downside I can really give this game is the UI. For whatever reason, the UI is a bit bugged and you need to position the mouse slighty to the right of the intended button. Although it is a minor thing, it still is a downside.  All in all, I think this was a really good game for being free. I hope you make more awesome games like this in the future.",

Though I feel like more can be done like actually giving the player a chance to further the relationship *and kick Brad in the teeth* and not just screwing him over with the delete button.   The general concept is good and really well thought of kudos for that.

The game follows a simple storyline that has slight differences due to your choices, but overall it has the same ending regardless of your choice. The storyline is really interesting. The actual gameplay is great. A good concept and art, with funny 'statuses' and good references when choosing an icon for your character throughout the years. You follow the life of a student and see his experiences through his conversation with an old friend, Emily. I really enjoyed playing this game, as I played numerous times just to see the different tweeks between the story. I'm really excited for the second game that is coming out. Overall, it's a fun, interesting, short game that fulfulls expectations.",

Previously, I had written a review with the intent of it being a joke, however playing the game again, I've decided to write an actual review. This will contain spoilers. Please be aware.   Emily is Away begins with you, the protagonist, having a dearly close comrade called Emily, as expected from the game title itself. No matter what you do, it will end with you bidding farewell to Emily. Throughout the game, the protagonist will try to express his/her love for Emily, but fails to do so as he/she is afraid (what I would assume. I'm not entirely positive).   From my own perspective, once I had finished the game, I teared up a bit. I played this back in 2015 with a friend whilst we were joking about indie games and more or less insulting it. Just to tell you the end of this little throwback, I was crying while in a Skype call with said friend.  All in all, this game just hit home, and it's simply amazing.",

This is possibly one of the best Story telling games that's FREE to play. Couldn't ask for more, after playing a couple times around you learn that there's different inputs with answers you can reply with and ALL of them will change the outcome of the story. I had the chance to play this game around 5 times through and through all of them I wanted to go back and change more.  Pros: - Game Changing choices - Great story - Nostalgia for those who are dinosaurs and lived when this version of windows was 'Up-to-date' (I wouldn't know lmao) - Nice easer eggs (Look up how to get different icons, you won't regret it)  Cons: - Emily doesn't love me :(  Download it boi, its free",
