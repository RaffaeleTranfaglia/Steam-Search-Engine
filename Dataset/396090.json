While it promises a branching option for governing in reality it is just a numbers game and lacks any real sense of weight or consequence for doing anything.",

At first i was pretty skeptical at the look of things and it seemed slightly shallow, but as i played the depth of gameplay was slowly unraveled. Its simplified, but actually very fun and rewarding. Plenty of valid playstyles by the looks of it, somewhat randomised starting conditions for assuring of the replay value, aswell as rewards for previously 'won' games.   Some thing are not clear to me, like i was never able to ' win ' a speech, even tho those were the actual things my country needed the most. There is 1 resource lacking in gameplay by the looks of it ( in one game start i didnt have anyone selling precious metals). Cant seem to interract with UN either. I probably just missed something or didnt play enough.   This genuinely feels like a pretty damn fun game for people who enjoy this kinda thing, - sitting in an office, managing the country. Im just getting started with this one but i already want to see more from these developers. There are far too few good games like this to pass this one. ",

Until that fateful day,   when tariq walk into my office. Tariq... I never know... my loyal assistant and friend... you should have told me... I know I would regret... but this is too important...... And then everything make sense. As I sit alone in the office with no one to summon and no one to talk to.    I realize I am a dictator after all. Loniness is the price I pay for power. I feel sad.",

After one playthrough of the game, I can say that the game isn't worth the asking price. Maybe 10 dollars, but 13 is steep.  The gameplay is very difficult. I got destroyed. A terrorist group executed me because the liberals got mad. It's very fun, and I recommend it.  The hardest part of this review is that I don't recommend this game for the asking price of 13 dollars, but I DO recommend it for the fun, strategic gameplay.",

The idea behind the game is rather good, but I do not think that this is a finished game.   Trade is extremely limited not about to be difficult, but being poorly prepared, not to mention that you can not make 'deals' and proposals, just accept.   Interactions with other countries (3 fictitious, US and UN only) is minimal.   The internal policies of the country appear to be unbalanced and not 'update' their situation in the game.   Do not recommend buying, I've asked my refund.",

The bad animation and mostly-text gameplay gives it a sort of retro early 90's feel to it, and the idea of growing a nation is fun, though the process doesn't seem very long. The game's pretty diverse and I just finished my first playthrough in four hours. I'll probably do a second playthrough later on, so I'd say there's at least a LITTLE replay value to this game.  7/10, dissapointed that the logo is not a corgi, even though it looks like one.",
