You start out by creating your character. You can choose your Race, Sex, Body Build, etc. Soon after that, you'll be free to explore the big city.

The story is dramatic but also really funny. You basically got a serious game with a lot of good jokes. The customization is great too, you can make yourself in this game and they also sell all kind of clothes.  The multiplayer was IMO the best part. You had different mods like Arms Race in which you played mini games but they also had Death Match modes.",

However, it doesn't mean it's less fun to play. Furthermore, I enjoyed playing the main campagin much more. So, here are my favourite things about Sants Row 2: 1. The city is constantly living - every person on the streets feels unique, with his own reactions to your actions, you can find people talking about the latest events happened in the game, there are skateboarders, street musicians, homeless people and much more. The town itself is not just a bunch of buldings put up together - every district is unique, a lot of places are playable (you can even visit the office of Volition, the developer of SR :) ). 2. The story makes sense. If you played SR: The Third/ SR 4, you know what I'm talking about ^_^ 3. Humor - unlike in the later games, SR 2 doesn't need a crazy situation to occur in order to be funny. 4. Customization. It just works, it's fun to play with, and it gives your character some sort of unique style and, well, character :)  As for the conclution I should say that the game is very atmospheric, yet doesn't have any strict and 'correct' playtrough, and altogether feels free and unobtrusive.",

            "review_text": "Saints row 2. A classical game made in 2006. This was one of my very first games I ever played, around 11-year-old, 2010. I played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I told the Cashier i want a game that has freedom and a humorous experience. He leads me to You know what. Mario cart. I'm screwing with you, he leads me to Fallout 3, which i didn't find entertaining and I wandered off. Found Saints row II and it looked god-like in a way, with the yellow logo, bright colours and guns.   Let’s be honest, the game runs awfully without 'Gentlemen of The Row', but worth buying, because it reminds you of that cartoony feel of games, freedom with no boundaries. (Part from the invisible wall, when you leave the map)  You play as 'The Boss' which you're respected as a king. You make new friends and enemies. You're your own person in this game. You can play recklessly, aggressive and charming, that kills everyone in sight. or play as a puckish rogue, that laughs at danger, with your weapons of pure delicious pain.   Use over 100 customizations of clothing, outfits that suit your blood lust. A ♥♥♥♥ ton of weapons that explode, ignite and shred enemies in an instant. Each weapon can be modified to your liking, less reload, more damage or even less recoil. This game has it all.  The story is what makes this game tick. If this game had no story, it wouldn’t be as good as it is now. i think? Wait, F@ck my opinion, don't listen to me.  It was ahead of its time. Very enjoyable. Most recommended in my behalf.",

When the port first came out the game was extremly broken and unplayable but now the game can be played with not many issues but the game can crash alot so i recommend to save alot after completing a mission or activity. Now the first thing you want to do when you buy this game is to download the Gentlemen Of The Row mod, this mod fixes alot of issues with the game and adds alot of cool features to the game. I recommend this game only if you can get past some of the issues. Some of the issues with the game are, game will crash, the game will stutter while driving, game cant stay at 60 Fps no matter how powerful your rig is. If you can get past that go ahead and buy the game and have fun.",

With the main story progression slowly wiping out the rival gangs, there are lots of smaller side missions that allow you to earn respect from your gang and the citizens of Stillwater. The hyperrealistic gameplay and humerous jokes make the game enjoyable to play, allowing to relax and zone out after a long day at the office.  I've seen many reviews complaining about this being a bad port, however I have had no issues that are really worth mentioning.  Pros: + Open world environment allowing exploration and free play + Customizable character, goons, vehicles, and cribs + Enjoyable main story, with plenty of fun and comical side misssions + Hyperrealistic gameplay adds to the humour and atmosphere of the game + Fantasic set of characters with nice dialogue and voice acting + Enjoyable cutscenes to watch  Cons: - Helicopters are so hard to control! - No achievements - Potential optimization problems (I didn't experience any though)  My Score: 7/10",

            "review_text": " In between studying and writing a review of a remake Painkiller'a, I decided to play in something, shall we say, not the first freshness. Quite unexpectedly, the choice fell on  Saints Row 2 . And I thought: why and ... yes!  A little of everything    ▶Gameplay   ●Gameplay  Saints Row 2  does not try to surprise us with what some innovations, it is - a typical sandbox in the best tradition of the series  Grand Theft Auto . The plot is supplied via cutscenes and markers with the symbols of a particular gang indicate the transition to missions. Speaking of missions, a little not clear logic of their location on the map. For example, the 'icon' of the mission may be somewhere in the suburbs of Stillwater, a cutscene will take you back to the 'den' Saints gang.  ●But this stuff, let's talk about the more unpleasant things. Namely, the authority of the protagonist. To access the missions, you need to constantly maintain its credibility, which is very quickly get bored. There are several variations of 'pumping' of authority. The easiest and most obvious - the implementation of various podrabotok. But we fatty Spaniards are not looking for the easy way and so after each mission, drive around and shoot villains from enemy gangs under the composition of such legends of hip-hop scene as  Run DMC, Nas  and  Apache.   ●Soundtrack in  Saints Row 2  is presented in the form of various radio stations broadcasting music for all tastes - from classical to 'heavy music'.   ▶Graphics and physics   ●For  Saints Row 2  was designed a special game engine, clearly requires treatment file. In the case of the physics engine decided not to show off and took  Havok.   ●Game development company engaged  Volition, Inc,  which gave us such games as  Red Faction  and  The Punisher . Regarding the latter, I would like to note the similarity of character design.  ●It is worth noting that the game slows down. Always. On any graphics settings. And this despite the fact that no high poly models or qualitative reflections or textures in  HD , it does not shine. The exceptions are the happy owners of certain (what is - you need to find out an educated bet) graphics cards from  NVIDIA . In the case of  ATI  all very badly, just like in  Saints Row: The Third.  Still consistency - not always a sign of excellence.",

Saints Row 2 is set in the fictional city of Stilwater and takes place five years after the original Saints Row, only this time you are in charge of a gang known as the Third Street Saints.  Story: The story has you trying to rebuild the Third Streets Saints gang after it has disbanded. You start off with basically nothing and through a series of varied missions, must take out the opposing gangs: the heavy metal gang Brotherhood, Haitian Sons of Samedi and the Japanese Ronin. The game has an interesting story which stars memorable antagonists such as the dumb and naive Shogo of the Ronin, to the sadistic General from the Samedi. Each character has traits which standout and are unique only to them. I found myself constantly drawn to the story and eager to see through the next mission to unravel the tale of warring gangs further.  Graphics: The graphics for Saints Row 2 are passable and nothing to write home about. The game originally came out in 2008 so the visuals are dated to be expected. Textures of characters and the environment are somewhat muddy and the colours look bland and do not pop from the screen.  Sound: All characters are voiced extremely well. You can tell what exactly their personality is through their voice and are a joy to listen to, from the always whiny Pierce to the always stoned Shaundi. Each character has their own charm.  Gameplay: I felt that Saints Row 2 was let down abit by it's gameplay. It feels awkward to control your character and sometimes he would go in the direction you had not intended. Also, the car handling is not smooth to say the least. Vehicles turn alot at the slight press of a directional button and they flip too easily as well. I hope that the clumsy controls are fixed in the sequel.  Overall, Saints Row 2 is a fun game with an interesting story about redemption, revenge and warring gangs. It has engaging characters that you care about and if you can get past the clunky controls and performance issues, you will have a good time with the game.  7.5/10",

While SR2 is quite similar to a GTA game, there are some core differences. The most obvious one is that, while GTA likes to downplay the inherent anarchy that flourishes within the game, Saint's Row embraces it, and lets you go nuts. For example, the notoriety mechanic. If, at any point, you find yourself surrounded by members of a rival gang, you can choose to begin firing randomly at civilians, by which point cops will come running and take the thugs off your hands. Another example is the cars. Saint's Row 2 completely ignores physics for these bits, and just lets you go wild, smashing through groups of pedestrians with not even a scratch on you. Maybe there's some irony in an insane game that knows that it's insane, but I can't really care. I stopped caring while running down the streets in full mime getup clubbing old ladies in the face with a sledgehammer.",

So, Saints Row 2 comes with a whole new set of issues with the upgrade to a new (to ME, anyway!) operating system, in this case, Windows 7! There's a ton of help out there, though, originating from THE go-to source for such info (AKA Idolninja and his Saints Row Mods site) for getting the game to run normally under Win7, so honestly, this wasn't even *slightly* a problem. Just a few tweaks according to instructions and the game was running perfectly.  That said, there absolutely isn't a reason I can think of to give Saints Row 2 a pass, other than maybe if you still have the (very depressing) combination of severely outdated PC hardware plus ancient operating system. A modern OS, a modern CPU and moderately speedy RAM all go REALLY far in mitigating any poor performance due to the badly-done port of this game.  Also, having finished Saints Row 4 recently (finally!), I can hands-down say that Saints Row 2 is STILL the best Saints Row of the series. Sure, the graphics aren't pretty, but did you know there are SweetFX mods out there that beautifully fix this quibble? There totally ARE, so get this game already if you haven't yet, okay? Okay!  ------- Original review below:  The PC port notoriously buggy, but if you're lucky, you might get away with not having any showstopping bugs, like me! It worked fine out of the box, and I'm on some old hardware with an ancient OS (XP). There's a veritable TON of info out there to fix or minimize the game's bugs (look up the guy named IdolNinja, he's a Saints Row magician), so even if you do have issues, with a bit of tweaking, the game may well run fine for you too.  If you started with Saints Row the Third and want to know some of the Saints' backstory, this is a must-have game. GET IT GET IT GET IT!

The Saints themselves are an amazing gang that I am more than pleased to be the leader of, with support NPCs also being very likeable.

It may not have the depth and content of a GTA game, but it's got a lot of charm and just pure fun.  The city of Stillwater is a sprawling metropolis that feels alive and filled with detail. It may be relatively small compared to the worlds of newer sandbox titles, but each area is unique and memorable.  The gameplay, as I said previously, is incredibly fun. Reckless driving and well-made combat is the essence of the game and key to what makes it what it is. It feels tight (although the handling could be a little better, but I understand in the context of the game it makes sense to be poor) and the systems are easy to get used to.  However, this basic gameplay is somewhat ruined by the Respect system, which I feel brings the game down. The Respect system basically entails that you must fill up your Respect bar to play missions. This is done by doing Activites around the city. My grudge with this is that the game forces you to play what would be considered 'side missions' or trivial activities in other games in order to enjoy the main meat of the game. There's about 10 or so of these different activities and 5 levels of them can be completed each, with a higher difficulty each time. They're relatively enjoyable at first, but as I got further in I got frustrated at the fact I was forced into doing these Activities, all of which I had done before but at a lower difficulty, just to play the main game missions and stronghold missions.  The game advertises itself as having a raft of customisation options - while there is customisation options, these are nowhere near as detailed the advertising would have you suggest. There is some nice choices, although I never really saw them as a big part of the game.  The graphics are nothing special, but you do have to remember this was released in 2008 - although it isn't really an issue to me anyway. The controls are pretty much fine too.  The story is actually quite good for a game in this genre. Sure, it has your typical violence-fuelled gang warfare, but it also has an underlying humour about it that makes you love it. On the surface, it doesn't seem that interesting, but as you move forward, you begin to really take in the cutscenes and engage in the story.  My second main criticism of this game (other than the Respect system) is that there's simply not enough interesting stuff to really do in Stillwater. After you get a few hours into the game the Activities feel like a chore rather than a fun side mission, and when you get bored of exploring Stillwater while running people over and attracting police attention there isn't actually that much else to do. This makes the game feel surprisingly linear for a sandbox game, which is obviously the opposite of what the developers were intending to achieve. The world of Stillwater is there, and it's alive, but I felt a severe lack of participation in it.  It's also worth noting this PC port has very, very bad FPS drops and it can be annoying even at the best of times.  To conclude, Sants Row 2 is a very fun game at its core. It has great gameplay mixed with an enjoyable story, and a world that feels well-designed and lively. However, the game is brought down by the Respect system and also the lack of actual content you want to do outside the missions. The FPS drops in this port can also be a general annoyance. However, Saints Row 2 is still a very good game that you'd do well to pick up for cheap sometime in order to have hours of good old-fashioned carnage and fun.",

If yes, check this out. Seriously. It's one of the best games i've ever played.  Ok bad stuff. It's a console port, and there are issues with that. The respect thing that locks you out of story missions until you are at a certain level is kinda stupid. Lastly some of the missions are a little obnoxious, like the ones where you have to chase someone in a car that moves at least as fast as yours does.  But that's really it. It's a sandbox crime game, so you know it has considerable replayability and mess-about potential. The story might have a relatively simple main thread (lets take over this city), but the smaller parts towards getting there can actually be quite good. They can also be rather dark, which is in contrast to much of the rest of a game that allows you to, for example, drive a sewage truck around spraying poo all over stuff. There is also an insane amount of character customization options, allowing you to create just about any sort of look you can imagine. Oh yes, and like any yummy PC game there's mods worth getting, such as Gentlemen of the Row (clothing, weapons, more stuff in general, etc). And so on...  Anyway, play it. It's funs. :3",

And with the following games, Volition Inc definetily showed this by making them as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as possible, with super powers, giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dubstep guns. Saints Row 2 is just funnier in a more 'subtle' way. I laughed when I had to drive around the city while a pensioner was playing hide the salami with a hooker on my backseat and saying: 'I can't pay my rent now, but it was worth it.' On the other hand, I didn't even have to smirk while i was penetrating hundreds of civilians with a monstrous steel-anal-spreader.  Just to clearify, I don't say SR3 and SR4 are bad games, I just think they (especially SR4) don't really fit in the universe SR1 and SR2 created.

There are lots of things that happen without players input airplanes take off or land, people start fights, cops beating up someone, gangs fighting eachother or cops it's just fun to watch.

If you are looking for a less serious sandbox game then SR2 &amp; 3 are both good options. Overall I think SR3 is better but they both have their fair share of issues.

It even improved on problems GTA has never even addressed at all, like letting you keep your favorite cars and having a homie fix it and deliver it to you even if you blow it up or dunk it in a lake. It made it so much more worthwhile to actually improve vehicles when you weren't afraid of damaging it or even getting out since you didn't know whether it would be there later.   On top of that, there were loads of diversions to waste time with, even improving your character through completing them. Sure some like infinite sprint and unlimited ammo would break the game a bit, but that was your reward for playing activities on the side and none were too extreme. Plus it was so much more fun to get those upgrades early and have a chance to use them instead of waiting until the end to give you everything or forcing you to use a cheat code that would penalize you.  All in all, I would still heartily recommend SR2. I'd even go so far as to say it beat GTA at being GTA.",

Bloody hilarious, with heaps of one liners, (at times very) dark humour, and full of odd references to pop culture. Story is good, and completing the missions is quite satisfying. I didn't like the necessity of repuation to complete missions, but that is attained easily enough by completing side missions that were slightly amusing and quickly over with.   Graphics were nice enough, but the view distance is poor, and so cars just 'appear' from nowhere, making driving annoying some times. It's also annoying when you look away from a car, then look back and it has also disappeared. Music was great (since I loved their selection), and the radio adverts were amusing (though there wasn't that much variety).  My only real gripe with the game was it's lack of solid controller support. Sure it worked, but the games interface and instructions didn't change to reflect that, leaving me to guess which key did what, and at times using the keyboard even. In addition, some of the chase and shoot missions were impossible, leaving me to resort to using a mouse and keyboard to complete the mission. Probably should have just stuck with that haha.  But yeah, good fun, worth the lowish price it's available for now if you're a fan of SR/GTA games and have some time to kill. I myself got 26 hours of play and 65% completion on normal, so you'll get your moneys worth out of it for sure.",

Graphics and animation updates to lessen the Way-through-the-roof-it's-breaking-my-screen framerates,  A few more options for hair.

I'd recommend downloading the 'Gentlemen of the Row' mod to get everything working ok. It sorts out a lot of the major issues with the controls, adds plenty of new custom decals, and generally makes the game much better. The modding community really pulled through with this one.  Now, onto the good. Nay, the great. I'm actually writing a review for it, so that says something.  The story, dialogue, and world building is incredible. For a franchise that grows wackier with each installment, SR2 has a way of making a scene poignant despite your character wearing nothing but nipple tassles and hooker boots. Then there's the little things, the comments that the nameless NPCs throw out when you walk past them, commenting on your characters appearance, deeds, and homies. It's something you really shouldn't notice, I mean, NPCs in a game such as this are basically cannon fodder, things to run over. But it's things like that which make you feel as though you're actually doing something that has a real impact on the world as you progress through the story.  I've briefly touched on customisation, but I really can't do it justice. You can make anyone. Literally anyone. My character is currently Emperess of the Pimps, fur coat, tiara, g-string and all. The customisation of cars and cribs isn't nearly as extensive, but it's enough to at least put your own stamp on things.   Money can be a tad easy to come accross, especially by the time your half way through the game. The only thing I've really had to save up for was a UFO  Oh, didn't I mention that? You can go around in a bloody UFO.  Basically, this game is pretty much wonderful. I prefer it to GTA IV and V without a doubt, it just has so much character!",

            "review_text": "What's to say about this?  The good: You can do a lot of crazy stuff - and get away with it. This is a sandbox game where you can tackle missions (which tell an overarching story) and activities (which are fun on their own, earn you money and respect) in the order of your choice.  The activities are rather strange and quite fun, although some of them can be difficult to complete. Those get you rewards (like certain weapons, unlimited ammo spupply for weapons, toughness etc.), so a little tenacity yields a good payback. The missions and the story are generally well made (but not epic), there are cutscenes for each one and they tell a story, so there's something to keep you entertained for roughly 40h or more, depending on how many non-essential activities you do. There's also - from what I can tell - a lot of continuity to SR3, so this is perhaps a selling point. The collectors amongst can find a lot of stuff (like hidden places, cars, planes,...) to keep you entertained - the city is huge.  The ugly: Your character is... an evil sozio-psychopathic person. You are a criminal in a city controlled by criminals, your best friend is at least as bloodthirsty as you are and you are even more vengeful and sadistic than your enemies. There are simply next to no redeeming qualities in your character. If you can't accept that, then you should not try to play this game. The fun activities range from: spilling sewage all over the city (not too bad, right?) to driving in a burning a vehicle, burning bystanders left or right for time bonuses, killing hit targets, blowing up parts of town (and its habitants) and much more. There's also a counter for the number of people you ran over. So it's that kind of humor which you can expect.  The bad: This game is not new. Still, the game runs really bad on older computers (from the era this was released...) and OK on newer (well equipped) machines, although it can still be choppy from time to time. There's a big collection of mods (Gentlemen of the Row) which eases the pain a little, and changes a lot of gameplay aspects which I recommend.  The verdict: This is a mixed bag. If you like being a really bad person in a video game and don't mind an older game with issues, then this may be for you. Otherwise - not so much.",

The humour in this game is defintely also a strong point with it not being over the top in most areas but still being able to be laughed at. The gameplay is also surprisingly good for a port and minigames like fight club, crowd control and septic avenger making this game a classic. I would highley reccommend this to any fans of GTA or Open world sandbox games. Overall this game would be a 9/10 in my books and I have not finished the game on PC yet but I finished it on PS3 a few years ago I believe you can easily get 30-40 hours out of this with the missions and minigames and even more time just causing chaos in stillwater with homies.",

And while it is true that it's alot more serious that isn't a bad thing. It makes the jokes that much better by lightening the mood while the more comedic style of the later games takes away from the feeling of the serious moments.  Yes the activites are alot more tedious, the cd's and tags are a major pain to track down even with a guide, and the respect meter is kind of annoying.

The controls are better than some say, though driving can turn very awkward at times and sometimes helicopter controls downright ignored my inputs and crashed it even if I kept hitting the ‘up’ button. The enemy IA is mediocre at best. Most of them just stand around without covering and shooting at you, though they make up for it by having insane accuracy that makes you yell ‘not fair’ if you’re suddenly surrounded. There’s an absurd amount of exploring available in Stillwater as it’s a huge city with spots where you have to graffiti on, CDs to collect and many kinds of shops sch as restaurants, clothing stores and drive-bys to take out your notoriety. hen, to diversions, those minigames you play for ‘respect’ in order to be allowed to do the main missions. Most of them are fun, others turn horrible. The escort, snatch and insurance fraud are bugged and bothering. Mostly because of the screwed up vehicle collisions and driving and how the game fails to add score if you get hit by a car without having pressed the pratfall button first. Still, the FUZZ and the septic avenger missions were insanely fun (you go around in a truck throwing poop at buildings and people), a shame they were removed in the next games. Last but not least, the main missions: most of them were fun, but involve advancing and killing people through some bosses were interesting, such as the sword battles and the monster truck rally. Still, reminding me of the two generations ago games, this game had THAT mission, insanelty hard to get through that I won't talk about.  The graphics? Eh. This game hasn’t aged well. The textures are off, the character creation would have been a lot better if the faces didn’t all look horrible (reminds me of Oblivion). Then, we hit the meat of the problem: wonky animations. They’re not exaggerated, but ridiculous to look at. The sprint animation is just like the normal running but sped up, which only makes it look weird as if you feet could take little steps very fast. The position while holding guns is the same you would take while holding a book away from you to look at the cover. Surprisingly, the facial expressions are fine and the animation suddenly improves in the cutscenes, which makes me think they mo-caped these to improve the quality.  And lastly, we get to optimization! I played the game in Windows 7, where I ran into no problems mostly because I was lucky enough to have a processor that ran exactly at Xbox360 speed, if not it'd have gotten it weirdly sped up as others have reported. Now, I have been doomed to Windows 8 and this problem curiously doesn't appear even if I'm running now at 3,6gH. Instead, I get constant, unexplainable crashing that renders me unable to play the game because I'm risking it to suddenly close in middle of a mission and you just get angry. A pity, but oh well.  It's still a recommended game if you like sandboxes or just like Saints Row.",

One peeve I have is the fact that you are restricted in what quests you can do by the respect system, forcing you to do side missions, going on rampages, or performing tricks to gain enough to do the next mission. While that may sound like fun, it becomes rather tedious when you are looking to complete a questline or clear a stronghold right away rather then in another hour of play. Love the voice acting, the story while ridiculous at times still will peak interest in seeing it to the end.",

            "review_text": "I have mixed emotions about this game, not because it's bad or anything (I've played every saints game except gat out of hell). On one hand I do recommend this game because the story is just as good as the first one if not better. If you compare this one's story to saints row 3 this one beats it in every aspect. There's just way more things to do once the campaign is over and there's Johnny Gat. This game will easily take about 8-10+ hours just to complete the campaign (mixes of missions and strongholds). Not to mention the freeroam things you can do. One example is if you have not completed one of the gang's storyline then they will try to contest the territory that you took from them (saints 3's version of this are optional repetive survival calls). If you don't show up you lose that territory.  So basically what I'm saying is:  Pros: -Good story (will take easily 8-10+ hours to beat). -Co-op is okay. -Multiplayer is fun (if you can actually get people to play it). -Lots of things to do once the story is done. -JOHNNY GAT -Saints Row 2 Shaundi (her change in SR3 can be taken both ways, for me I found the change made her too different). -A lot of fun custimizations (cribs are not copy and pasted like in Saints Row 3 and can be custimized as much as you want). - Each gang is unique.  Cons: -This is a really bad console port (even though it supports a controller it will still show the keyboard key bindings) - Driving and flying is a bit clunky - Donnie is in the game. - NO DLC MISSIONS LIKE ON CONSOLE (cooperate warfare and ultor exposed are not included) TL;DR  I recommend this game if you can put up with the fact that the port does not serve the game well. To fix this download the GENTLEMEN OF THE ROW MOD. This mod will fix a good 95% of all the issues.   ",

And I did start with Saints Row 4 instead of going from the earliest edition I could get my hands on.  That said, this game is an amazing experience. I had played GTA in the past, and I had to cheat in order to get through 30 percent of the game.  Saints Row? I didn't use a single cheat and I got through the whole thing.  How is that so? Isn't GTA the more popular franchise?  Yes, but popularity doesn't equate to personal appeal. And beating the living hell out of other gang members by ♥♥♥♥♥-slapping them and then destroying their nads with a flaming chainsaw fired out of a launcher is far more appealing to me than just using a simple pistol.  Also, you light yourself on fire and run into other people to light them on fire for money.  You also take a septic tanker and cover entire city blocks in fecal matter for even more money.  You basically do the craziest, most insane stunts across the town and make yourself rich.  Is there a problem with that? For some, maybe.  For me, ♥♥♥♥ no.  If you agree with me, get this game.

The patch adds great features, like supposed stability tweaks that didn't work for me, in-game PS3/360 button prompts, and additional clothing/walking/customization options that were already in the game but isn't available for the player to access otherwise. Sadly, what this patch does for this port is what should have done by the developers in the first place.

So, when I saw this game on Steam, I naturally bought it out of pure impulse because my mind was flooded with everything I remember from this game and why I loved it so much.  When I first played it on the Xbox 360 I completed every mission, did every job and activity at least once or twice, explored every nook and cranny of the map, searched for every CD, tagging spot and stunt jump, used cheats and spent hours on end doing nothing but killing people and destroying scenery while using my own imagination to stretch the boundaries of the game and overall having a blast and getting the most out of any video game I had ever played at the time.  When I first played it on PC, I lumbered through the menus, made my character, realize he was moving at about 2x the speed he normally should be—as well as everything else around him—and then closed the game and uninstalled it.  What the ♥♥♥♥? Who made this port and are they even human? The speed-up was one thing, but after reading about the other optimization (or lack thereof) issues with this port like the crash on launch and abysmal framerate drops (which would be completely unacceptable each on their own terms), it almost makes me wonder if they just literally copied and pasted the game from console onto PC.  One important thing to note is that there are mods online that will most likely fix these issues such as the renowned  Gentleman Of The Row  [idolninja.com] , but the fact that I need to rely on third-party modifications to make the game even playable is proof of the porters' failure and irresponsibility. While I am happy to see this game receiving mostly positive reviews on behalf of the game itself, this port job should receive no credit whatsoever.

No matter what pc have you got, the game will do its best to make you go mad cuz you won't be even able to control a car or boat properly with damned frequent fps drop and time bug (I don't call it actually a BUG but something's really wrong with in-game time, looks like your character runs faster than he would like in-X360 game)   Vehicles control. You can't control drift while turning, it's impossible. And sometimes I noticed breaks bugs like sometimes I couldn't stop at the necessary moment or the car stops very slow so anyway I'd bump into a fence or wall or something...   I thought there would be more PURPLE!!!   You can try to find some mods that 'can' fix an fps drop issue that didn't help me, anyway good luck.

I have tried, but clearly, I have failed. I must stand firm to the realisation that mere words cannot express my utmost and profound contempt and loathing for your game, your games being and your games existence. You game developers are a blight against nature.  Don't waste your money on this ♥♥♥♥. I was so hoping for a game of great, unquestionable quality, but was utterly let down.

Having really enjoyed SR3, I had wanted to know more about the Saints Row Universe and its characters backstory and while SR2 does deliver a very good story, it is however a technical mess. This is quite possibly one of the worst console ports ever made for the PC.  The first problem appears right at the main menu, where there is no mouse support. Vehicle handling feels very floaty, and it feels like you are rotating the world when doing sharp turns rather then driving a car.  Music and sound have a very muffled and low quality feel. There are some interesting selection of tunes tho, but the low sound quality is too obvious to ignore.  My computer system well exceeds the recommended requirement of SR2 and i can play SR3 very smoothly, yet SR2 somehow feels very laggy at times especially when you go high speed on a highway and have very horrible laggy vehicles pop-in.  The graphics also didn't age very well. While i can't fault it much for being an older game, but for a game released in 2009, the graphic looks 2003ish. Character and animation designs all feel very rough and rushed.  The game is also very buggy. Missions sometimes don't behave properly, cars being embedded into the road, characters dropping off the road into nothingness and quite frequent CTDs. As another tight slap to PC players everywhere, the DLCs that are enjoyed by the console crowd are not released on the PC version.  The only good thing about SR2 is the story, which is quite lengthy at 55 missions and has a much more serious and darker tone then SR3. Although at times, the story felt too GTAish and i did miss the goofy fun of SR3's story. Also, i had felt that certain characters weren't as cool as they were portrayed in SR3.  (Minor spoiler) Example: Shaundi. In SR3, she was this confident woman that didn't take crap from anyone and almost felt like she was 2nd in command. In SR2 however, she's just a drugged out hippie and just looked pathetic throughout the whole SR2 story.   I wasn't able to try out the co-op aspect of the game, as my friends didn't want to play it anymore due to it being an older game, so no comments on that whether if it had worked well.  Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10 Unless you truly enjoyed SR3 and wanted to know more backstory of the characters, steer clear of this horrible console port. Even though it excelled in the story department, it is a complete and utter technical mess. Had the game been a good port and free of its technical problems and bugs, i might have given it a 8.5 or maybe a 9.",

As it is, on my PC on standard graphics and clearly not optimized, I have less than flattering things to say about it. I'll readily admit that any missions or sequences which occur within enclosed spaces render the game far more enjoyable, yet most of the game takes place in the city, or in populated areas. I cannot even begin to describe how choppy and unplayable driving sequences can be, to say nothing of the horrendous control sensitivity- good luck trying to drive a motorcycle without hitting anything or losing control badly.  There's excellent humor, an excellent story and excellent voice-acting in this game, of that I am completely aware of- and it's a damn pain that I have to wade through such a slow and sluggish port in order to experience any of it, which certainly curbs my enthusiasm. To be fair, there are (as far as I'm aware) fixes that will allow players to optomize their games such that they can play it with far fewer errors- but these are not official bugfixes, they're input from other players who experienced similar problems.  I loathe developers who will not even move to fix their own messes, especially for ports where the console versions are far more optimized. --THIS IS UNNACCEPTABLE.--",

Cars dissapear while you follow them, the GPS is a JOKE (or so 'realistic' that its even worse than the real world counterparts). The racing markers are so useless they are more of a misdirect than a race track direction marker. The AI characters are psychic... you run towards a car and they bolt like you are mugging / jacking them. The car racing is one of the WORST parts of the game so far. You are stuck with a F%$#ed up camera that you cannot ajust to be closer or further away, or any other racing position. No nose cam etc. Seriously, did anyone even finish this piece of ♥♥♥♥ without wanting to punch someone?  Note - I really enjoyed GTA Series (except IV), and completed a bunch of them, but this game is seriously flawed to the point where its not worth wasting my time and frustration. Maybe the XBox version is better, but the developers can shove the PC version up their arses.",

So if you can get this game working well, you are in for a hell of a lot of fun, if not...unlucky. Try and get this game for a cheap price or try a demo first just in case.
