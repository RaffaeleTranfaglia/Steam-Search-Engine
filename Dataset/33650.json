            "review_text": "This game is not perfect, but it is worth having if you enjoy puzzles.  Pros: There is a good variety of puzzles (word search, crossword, link-a-pix, codeword, sudoku, spot the difference, fitword, silhouette, and some smaller 'bonus' games). There is support for multiple languages, treating British and American English as two different languages - and they should, for a game like this. I accidentally tried the British one at first and had a terrible time at the crossword. Then I switched to American and the crossword got MUCH easier. If you're not worried about full completion of the game, you can skip as far ahead as you want - all content is open right from the start of the challenge mode. And there is a lot of content - over 1200 puzzles in total.  Cons: The difficulty progression is very slow. In the beginning, the puzzles are tediously easy. Hardcore puzzlers will be a bit annoyed at having to slog through the beginning, before the puzzles get hard enough to be really interesting. The proper order of operations is not followed in the 'equate' bonus puzzles (they don't do multiplication/division before addition/subtraction like they should), but this is easy enough to get used to. The silhouette 'puzzles' are really not puzzles at all. Switching languages means you have to start the whole challenge mode over. Puzzles are not randomly generated and once you've solved one, there is no replay value. Too many hint tokens are given, removing some of the challenge from harder puzzles.  This game is particularly well-suited to younger puzzlers, since the slow increase in difficulty and ease of the starting puzzles make it very comfortable to get started and train your logic brain. However, I don't regret my purchase, despite the tedious easy beginning of the game. I've spent a few fun hours on it and I look forward to a quick crossword or link-a-pix each morning to get my brain started.",

            "review_text": "Puzzler World is a collection of over 1000 puzzles. Some of them are easier, some are harder - but you can acess half of them at any point. Second half are bonus challenges, paired with regular ones. You unlock them by completing first one from the pair.  There are 14 challenges, like crosswords, spot the diffrence, wordsearches, hangman ect. It may seem boring, but completing it is both fun, and challenge.  After each game (both regular and bonus), you pick a present. It may contain a hint, or a letter (7 of them grant you with around 100 hints). Hints are aviable only in regular challenges, and they provide a bit of help when you need it. They are divided into 3 groups: 5, 10 and 20. The more expensive the set is, the bigger is help, and effects vary in diffrent challenges. Not much more is possible to be said - it looks a bit like childs game at the beggining, but it's actually quite a nice game.  If you like achievements - this is a perfect game. It takes less than 6 hours to get all of them here, as there are only achievements for completing 10 of each challenge, and nothing for having 100% of the game. Only hint - turn off the music as soon as possible.",

            "review_text": "UKâ€™s largest puzzle supplier has someday the idea to concentrate over 1k puzzles into this game.  It contains a dozen different puzzle types like Sudoku, Fillout, Spot the difference and so on. For every puzzle chosen from a 4x4 matrix you earn coins in a 1 of 3 choice which are payable hintpoints in game. After playing a while the elements are quite repeative with small differences. At puzzle number above 100 the puzzles become a little harder. That means if you started with a 6 number Sudoku now it raises to a 9 number Sudoku (which is formally known as normal Sudoku).  There are 6 languages avaible, unfortunately sometimes with little translation errors in German for example. It's quite fun but sometimes really nerve-wracking.",

            "review_text": "The only thing this game has going for it are the actual puzzles. The interface around it, in an attempt to seem 'fun' or 'family friendly' I suspect, is extremely tedious. To get to the game you want, one must click through multiple pages of 'tips', instructions and confirmations and, at the end, reward ceremonies. All this to spend 90 seconds on an easy level game becomes extremely annoying after a while.   Start menu music cannot be turned off. Unnecessary tip screens cannot be turned off. Reward ceremonies cannot be turned off. Difficulty of the puzzles can not be easily selected. Interface of the games themselves is not intuitive, though workable.   Only recommend for children or those with extreme patience. And even then: buy on sale.",
