            "review_text": "  I'm not generally into multiplayer only games but Arkshot has had me drawn since I first picked it up.  It's a wonderfully fun and simple game which let's you jump in a match against 3 other players or host a private match against your friends.   The gamemodes are mostly fairly obvious ones like capture the flag but all of them have a small twist, like the headhunter, which has you pick up the skulls of your enemies and drop them off in a kiosk which is randomly placed in select locations on the map.  The pick-ups and are actually much different than what I've experienced in other games, such as the 'Drink me' pickup which can either make you larger or smaller based on a percent chance.  The gameplay is mostly pretty standard as far as FPS games go asides from the obvious differences, such as the need to arc your shot. (Hence the name Arkshot).",

The game has limited arrows but after you shoot them they can be picked up off the ground. There's awesome powerups! Just stupid fun!  Currently 4 players for each match but it is supposedly going to be raised to 8.  The devs even came in and played with us on May 19th!  Disclaimer: I received this code from Spoonmore's Giveaway on  www.twitch.tv/games_are_magic ",

This charming arena shooter, obviously taking inspiraton from Quake and other arena shooters, is one of my current favorite games.   Pros: free bow skins, free masks and taunts(sounds), large selection of maps and gamemodes, great gameplay.  Cons: sometimes the chat freezes up, and the bow consumes a lot of stamina.  Overall: 9/10 would recommend",

You need to keep an eye on things like stamina and arrows, remember your dodging and arrow jumping, plus learning how long to hold an arrow and where to aim for the arc to reach the target.",

The game has a good sprinkling of adult humour in the form of taunt sounds, for us less mature players.  Pros:  - The movement is smooth, the characters move fast and can jump long distances. It's rather satisfying - Customisation. Choose your taunt, weapon, mask, and wizard colour. Lots of options - The arrows make a pleasing 'thock' noise when you land a hit - Adult humour. 'Nuff said - The art style is quite sexy  Cons: - Not a lot of players as of yet, so bring friends if you want to play ",
