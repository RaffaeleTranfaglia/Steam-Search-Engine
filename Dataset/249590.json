Please replay last 10 minutes of climbing it again. Decided to investigate some place below? Enjoy your time getting back from it. Boss fight? Do repeat exactly the same motions until you perfect them (any damage kills you instantly and restarts the fun).",

            "review_text": "I almost gave this game a thumbs-down at several points while playing. I had gone into the game expecting “Braid with magnets” and Metroidvania-style exploration. Instead, I got a Super Meat Boy clone with long, frustrating, unforgiving platforming segments and annoying trial-and-error bosses. The magnets are mainly used as a means to traverse death gauntlets, often with twitch-action polarity shifting. One wrong move and you’ll either die, or fall down a long way and be forced to climb back up. The magnet puzzles themselves are pretty bland and uninspired physics puzzles, and ultimately pointless. The level design is about as linear as a Super Mario Bros. level, and all four of the important powerups are placed directly in your path. Backtracking is only required for 100% completion (or if you happened to not find at least 15 of the 36 collectables to unlock the door to the final boss). Overall, it failed to meet just about all of the expectations I had for it.  What redeems this game is the atmosphere, art style, and storytelling. There are no words or dialogue at all; this game tells quite a fascinating and unexpected story through the environments, characters, and pictures alone. The hand-drawn art and backgrounds are all beautiful to look at, and there’s no shortage of good music, both of the catchy and atmospheric variety. Perhaps it's style over substance, but for me it really worked.  Once I attained 100% completion and reached the best ending, I looked back upon the game and realized I was glad to have played it. It was a real emotional journey. There’s nothing at all awful about the game, it’s just average in a lot of ways. The difficulty isn’t actually all that hard, it’s just frustratingly out-of-place, and skill eventually did take over and help make the experience more enjoyable. And despite the lackluster puzzle design, there were some instances of great ideas in there; the secret scrolls were highly satisfying to find and collect. With minimal hints and hundreds of mistakes, I got 100% completion in less than 10 hours.  So, after much deliberation, this gets a thumbs-up from me. If you can get it on sale for half price, and if you can put up with the stupid platforming sections and the death gauntlets, you might also find there’s a lot to enjoy here.",

The problem is that most of your time in this game is going to be spent re-doing long, tedious platforming sections which you've already proven you can do, to get back to an obstacle that's going to kill you 80% of the time.  It's not the kind of hard game that makes you want to rise to the challenge. It's the kind of hard game that just makes you frustrated you have to do all this ♥♥♥♥ AGAIN.",

            "review_text": "It's a dreary night, and a disheveled man carries a bundle close to his chest. Through the pouring rain, a face can be seen peeking from the bundle; it's a young child. The man leaves the boy with a woman,  his mother? , and leaves for parts unknown. Time passes, the boy grows, he is still but a child. Men come. They come for him. They force their way in, but the boy has already leapt through his bedroom window, onto the rain slicked rooftops. He runs. They chase.   The opening moments of Teslagrad set a tantalizing stage for what is to come. Dark and alone, silence from all but the storm and the racing footsteps of your pursuers. Upon reaching the tower, the promise of a grandiose adventure is all but assured. for all of its visual splendor, and the mystery surrounding the world, in the end, Teslagrad emerges as a beast only slightly greater than the sum of its often lacking parts.   The tower you will explore is filled with wondrous architecture, artwork and snippets of a tale of partnership, a burgeoning lust for power, and betrayal that followed. You'll discover more of the story of Teslagrad as you climb the tower, solving increasingly complex puzzles. Unfortunately, this complexity often comes more from the mechanics, than from the puzzle's ability to test your wit. The theme of Teslagrad is magnetism, and you soon earn greater abilities in pursuit of its control. Puzzles typically consist of moving blocks or repelling your way higher. Issues arise in that everything has its own physics, and pieces that you may need to move a specific way can be difficult to place, and not for lack of trying. Later puzzles even rely on your ability to repel yourself off of moving objects. Now while this sort of thing is of no real concern in a title such as Portal, in Teslagrad, the danger is far more apparent, and being hit even once will kill you and reset the portion of level that you're in.   In the majority of cases, this isn't a serious problem, as there are often checkpoints near more difficult segments, and even the most frustrating puzzles shouldn't occupy your time for more than twenty minutes. The real trouble occurs during any of the number of boss battles in the game, all of which suffer the dreaded  three hits to kill motif . Should any of these bosses' attacks hit you, it's back to the very beginning of each fight, leading to frustrating exercises of trial and error. The bosses can take up an unhealthy portion of your time in Teslagrad, and this is especially true one of the last bunch, who fails to exhibit a truly discernible pattern, due to the game giving physics to every moveable object.   Even with the frustrating boss encounters, and sometimes irritating puzzle design, the sheer beauty of the scenery often manages to quell the rising feelings of annoyance. As you progress, you will be treated to story elements in the form of short puppet plays, all of which lack dialogue, but are arguably stronger without, anyway. The mystery of your predicament is the greatest driving force in Teslagrad, as without it, I imagine many would quit at one of several specific points I can recall.  Lastly, as I feel it should be mentioned, the metroidvania aspect, and how much it pertains to the gameplay as a whole. You can go back and explore any room you've been previously, and there are indeed hidden pathways and secrets. These secrets come in the form of collectible cards, of which you will need to find 15 to even complete the game. And when I say 'complete', I mean reach the credits, because to find the true ending, you must collect all 36 missing cards hidden all throughout the map. This sounds fun, and in most Vania style games, it is. But in Teslagrad, many poorly designed puzzles are not meant to be run backwards, and this can make exploration difficult.  Even as I complain of the gameplay elements, I still look fondly on Teslagrad for its story, visuals and unique attempt at magnetic manipulation, as flawed as some of it may be. And while I've beaten the game and seen the vanilla ending, I'm sure I will spend an equal amount of time gathering the remaining cards to see what secrets might be waiting for me at the end. I wholeheartedly recommend Teslagrad, flaws and all, for its incredible visual design and world that is far too grandiose and exciting to be brought down by the occasional, but potent, frustration.",

            "review_text": "Teslagrad is a 2D puzzle platformer with some metroidvania elements. I can only reccomend that people get and play this game. I whole-heartedly enjoyed everything about the game. The artwork is excellent and creates a very nice aesthetic style. The attention to detail in the art makes it a joy to take in. The music complements the game very well, often having a somber melancholic tone. The game also does an excellent job of telling it's story through the environment and is surprisingly emotional for having no voice acting. The game controls tightly, and magnetic puzzles are a nice change from the moving around boxes puzzles you see in too many games. The progression of puzzles is excellent and the game does a great job of teaching you. The combat works surprisingly well and the bosses, while hard, feel like a natural extension of the game using all the puzzle mechanics you've gotten used to. Teslagrad is oozing with polish and it's a real shame it hasn't gotten more publicity. I'd rank it up there with Fez and Super Meatboy as one of best modern indie platformers.",

            "review_text": "Quite a neat game. I'm not a big fan of platformers, but Teslagrad had just the right amount of puzzle, challenge, and story. I picked up Teslagrad in a recent Humble Monthly Bundle and have enjoyed playing through it the last couple of days.  The puzzles and rooms themselves are fairly clever with beautiful artwork and pleasant music to match. The storytelling is stylish and subtle; in fact, there really is no parts of the story you're forced into following. Instead, the game offers interesting backdrop with artwork and puppet shows that are just enough to pique one's curiosity.   The platforming has some flaws. In particular the character doesn't feel as responsive as it should, and for some reason the controls aren't auto-mapped. I can see how some people could be frustrated with one-hit deaths, especially since the boss fights can be unforgiving and tedious until the mechanics are learned. Aside from those little tid-bits, I have no complaints whatsoever with the game.   If you're looking for a metroidvania puzzle-platformer with quality visuals, I definitely recommend Teslagrad.",

            "review_text": "Teslagrad is a puzzle platformer with the main mechanic being magnetism. So this mostly consists of objects getting magnetically attracted to or repelled from each other. The game has many varied puzzles and endbosses with the magnetism mechanic. Many times in Teslagrad I encountered an endboss or obstacle and I was like; 'This has to be impossible! I probably have to travel back to get better unlockables.'But, in those moments, I would finally see how you have to do it. This makes you feel smart and satisfied. And made me say; 'Wow, this is really well thought out!' I should also say that there are parts where the gameplay blends in well with the music and the story. To be fair, I didn't really care about the story. So the little animations in the background were just nice looking images, for me. The only parts of gameplay I didn't really like were at the beginning, where you were unable change the magnetism. Those parts felt forced. The game has a nice handdrawn style which reminds me of the game  Braid . In my opinion, the game is good until the end. The only thing that annoyed me is that you have to find 15 collectables for the final endboss. So I used a community guide map to find the last ones to reach 15. Shame on me. Overall, the game really well polished. The only bug I encountered was at the final boss of the game. Even if you would encounter bugs it is not a problem because like in metroid/megaman the game reloads the room.   In short: A well thought out platformer, with the main mechanics centred around magnetism.",

            "review_text": "A nod to the olden days of pixel perfect gaming. Immediately upon starting Teslagrad evokes a notion of nostalgia. The controls are simple, but robust. You never blame the game for dying. The art is magnificent and full of little gems. The puzzles never out stay their welcome, and the game itself feels long enough for the price.   Some points of critique, I had a hard time loving the bosses... Although I got a feeling of satisfaction when i finally beat them, they ended up feeling too repetetive in the long run. Especially since some of their cues were a bit hard to read at times and the different phases of each boss came pretty abruptly, which made it hard to adapt and evade on the first try.   The story is sparse, but cute. If you dont pay attention to it, it seems non existant. However what is there, is very well made, very clear and very enjoyable.   All in all, Telsagrad is an incredibly good first title from Rain Games. If you love games like super meat boy, portal, and long for a return to the olden days of platforming, this is definitely a title worth picking up. It only costs like 8$ anyway.",

            "review_text": "Teslagrad is a metroidvania style game in which you have to overcome hard puzzles and neat mechanics which reflect how magnets or electrons and protons work with each other.   You have the ability to use a gauntlet that you get at the beginning and the cloak later on to manipulate your or environments state. You can change your or a props colour into blue or red, which affects how you or the latter acts. If for example you toggle red cloak, you either get attracted to blue props or pushed away from red ones. Just like magnets. This has other, more complicated uses and plays a major role in solving puzzles and traveling around the tower. You also get boots that you can blink with, which adds more depth to the game, since you can blink into cages, through fences and it's even used on bosses as part of a puzzle.  The puzzles themselves are pretty hard. They have that feeling, where you solve them for hours and when you finally find out how to do it, you think for yourself that the answer was in front of you all along. There aren't too many of them in the game, although, a single puzzle can take to around half an hour to complete.  The game puts you in the body of a child, so, naturally, you don't have the ability to fight the beings of the game. You also die in a single hit, which translates into a pretty hard experiance, to a level of something like Dark Souls. It isn't a problem though, since the checkpoints in this game work very well, after death, most of the time teleporting you either to the start of the room or after some major point of a room, like a big, difficult puzzle. With enemies, comes bosses. And bosses in this game are very imaginative and interesting. As I said, the protagonist doesn't have the ability to fight, so the bosses are 'puzzles' in and of themselves.  There are no cutscenes and the story is not huge, although it is interestingly provided by giving the player a chance to visit rooms with a cardboard theater and watching a small performance. It is also somewhat vague, which means that most of what is seen can be interpreted differently and everyone can have a different take into the whole idea behind the game.  The game isn't long, packing only 5 hours of gameplay, which is not bad, because you wouldn't suffer from fatigue or boredom after completing the game, Also, the game being short also makes it worthwhile to speedrun.  The way the game looks has a touch of a clockwork artstyle. The game is atmospheric, well drawn.The music is nice, but nothing too impressive. That's also a good thing, because you won't get too distracted while going around doing puzzles.  Teslagrad is a hidden gem that everyone should experiance and I feel bad that it was out of my radar for so long. Although, as I follow the rule of 1 dollar=1 hour, I would just wait for it to go down to at least 5 euros, other than that, the game is totally worth getting.",

I haven't ever beaten Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie cause of how bad I am at platformers. While playing this I did encounter some ragey monments Mostly with one of the late bosses but thats good in my option.   The main Machanic of this game is how magnets work, You coolect items through out the game that can change the polarity of certain mobs or platforms. You can ether repel by making your self and the object the same color, or attract by turning yourself and the object into opposite colors. I personally have never seen a machanic used in a game and it worked amazingly well then what I was expecting. The developers did an amazing job to get the physics realistic and plausable.  The story is easy to follow even though there is no voice acting. You are a boy that is escaping from bad men and you make it to a tower and you have to make it to the top. But what makes the story telling interesting is through out the journy you encounr puppet theater that begin playing the backstory through paper puppets. It was a very interesting and well designed way of telling the story with out words but with the music and art.  Going on to the music and art. Honestly the music and art have got to be my favorite part of the game, as I stated I am not good at platformers so I can get easly angry at a level. The music kept bringing me back honestly, each level had its own sound that matched the stage perfectly. For example there is a stage tht is simular to a boiler room there was a metal sound incoperated into the song to make it feel like it was being played in a room filled with pipes. Then a sage that had many plants in it I belive it was the level with a large tree had a more upbeat tune that reminded me of legend of zelda with the lost woods. It was very well orcistrated.  The art is simple yet had massive amount of detail. The charater and objects had a simpler design compared to the backgrounds but that made them pop out alot more then having both extremely detailed or had the charater detailed and the background plain. It was pleasent to the eyes as well. I have sensitive eyes so bright lights and very white bacgrounds make me sick or give me a headache and i encounted none of that while playing.   I highly recomend you play this game. I belive its on steam and on psvita. I played the steam version and used a controler. I highly recomend you play with a controler as well.

You will not be disappointed with this title.  It does have it's flaws. For example, the character you play as dies by one hit of any enemy or lethal obstacle. During Platforming Segments, everytime you die, you end up in one of the games (thankfully plentiful) checkpoints. During Boss Segments however, if you die, you have to start the whole fight from the very beginning. This is a pretty regular thing in platformers, but the thing is, one hit from literally any attack of the boss, will cause your character to die. Meaning bosses take a bit longer than they should until you get their patterns just right. This does become a bit tedious with a certain boss.  Then there's some physic shenanigans, but those are actually part of what makes some of the puzzles in the game genuinly difficult, but not impossible to solve.  The thing I loved about this game is that it tells it's story with no dialogue, what so ever. All the story is told through the actions of the characters, as well as some charming puppet shows you will see through out your venture inside the tower. As a bonus, the game even tells you the lore of the world through it's collectible scrolls, with just simple illustrations.  Pros: -Difficult but well designed physics based platformer -Unique setting and use of the magnetic mechanics -Good Presentation -Good Music -Decent Length  Cons: -The physics might make some puzzles a bit harder for some folks. -You're going to have to repeat certain boss battles a lot. (Luckily, there's only a handful of them.) -No dialogue. (A con if you're someone who can't appreciate a story told through images rather than text.)",

While playing through I felt that the creators drew inspiration heavily from Metroid and Mega Man, a feeling which is actually confirmed in-game via some background objects and animations.  The artwork in this game is gorgeous. It's Rockman platforming with Metroid atmosphere. Lots of lonely and anxious jumping with some upgrade collection in a giant maze.  The plot is unveiled mostly through static and dynamic imagery. Text is almost non-existent.  There are not many enemies to defeat. The majority of fighting is done against a few difficult bosses. There is no health, ammo, or lives to worry about and you respawn in the last room you entered so the game is very forgiving of mistakes.  Controls are a bit slippery at times and could use some tightening up but it's never frustrating. The control scheme is a bit strange on keyboard. Switching between tools mid-action requires moderate dexterity at times.  Overall I enjoyed everything and can't complain about anything.  ",

Beyond this, I had no opinion or thoughts. Really, it just seemed like a cool idea to me at the time. Then I got the opportunity to buy and play the game. Initially, I was disappointed. Even after I lowered by childishly-set standards to some more realistic ones, the game seemed clunky and unnecessarily unforgiving. The mechanics start bare-bone--far more than the average game--and this was a little off-putting. However, despite the lackluster first looks, the story possesses a bit of charm and reveals itself to be (possibly) much larger and deeper than what it tells you, and this successfully keeps me interested. After playing the game for an extended amount of time, the mechanics changed for the better (as games usually do) and the storytelling changed for the worse (as games usually don't). More options to solving problems become available the farther the player gets through the game, and although the variation of problems to solve is a bit dry, it holds its own for a game of its size and scope. Unfortunately, especially in the middle 75% of the game, the story is practically non-existent, only being available through collectible scrolls (which, I might add, are somewhat difficult to collect). Tidbits of the overall plot can be inferred by curious landmarks and etchings throughout the journey, but these provide only a slight amount of the story. In the end, Teslagrad allows itself the lee-way of scarce storytelling due to its eccentric nature, and again thanks to its nature it thrives as a tenant of the indie genre. In this review, I did not mention the art nor the story because neither are outstanding or poor. just regular.

            "review_text": "I beat the game several months ago, but I felt like I wanted to share my review I had posted elsewhere of the game now, since I still highly recommend this game and sharing my review I hope is one way to help this game get more attention.   'Teslagrad was a game I had never heard of until a friend bought it for me for Christmas, and I thoroughly recommend it! I found many of the puzzles to be very clever, and the abilities to be overall very fun to play around with, and the method of storytelling to be interesting (although perhaps the story to be pretty predictable, nothing necessarily new…although it did catch me completely by surprise at one point!). Plus, Mages with Tesla-inspired powers/weapons, who wouldn’t want that?  The Steam page doesn’t lie though that some of it’s puzzles are keyboard-smashing frustrating, although it shouldn’t be so proud about that—they were frustrating not because I couldn’t figure out the solution, but rather because the solution was difficult to put into action, being either so tedious or requiring more precision than at least my controller afforded me. I think all of these puzzles were towards the very end of the game for the most part, and didn’t occupy the majority of my experience (the vast majority of puzzles were really fun to think through). One last frustrating thing is the ‘one hit, you’re dead.’ For the most part this isn’t too much of an issue, and you always start at a safe point (typically the beginning of a room) when you die, but let’s just say there are very specific points in the game where starting over again and again is really annoying (spoiler:   the last two boss fights  ), and it’s be a lot nicer if there was a ‘three strike’ system or something like that.'   Looking back probably five months after I beat the game, I'm still excited for learning more about the world in future installments (which I believe the dev team has mentioned they have in store). It's one of those games that went in knowing nothing and having no expectations and came out loving it.",

This fun magnetic puzzler set in a fantastic medival steampunk world does the metrovania genra justice, as you progress you collect old-world weapons of steampunky-ness, making the small but vary capable kid you control look more and more like a science wielding wizard of that past. As well as granting you new areas you could not get to before, the tools you'll aquire also add puzzle complexity, without removing the fun.  Pros:     Very nice visuals, manages to merge steampunk, and medival together in a unique way.     Good Music, that fits the game well, I found myselve humming the tracks while playing.     The hand drawn art and the dynamic lighting fit well together, not much artistic style clash.     Most of the puzzles are pretty clever and fair, they give you a good feeling of accomplishment.     Jaw dropping background moments that you might not expect from such a simple game.    Cons:     Later puzzles start to lean towards reaction and timing, which in most cases works out, but can be annoying at times.     The cooldown on the dash boots is consistant, but ever so slight to long. I found myself trying to dash away from a bosses attack only to die from the cooldown still -- well -- cooling down.     The game is short, there is a secret I have yet to discover, because it requires you to collect all of an hidden item. Which is fair, its not a large amount.     The story is interesting, but only to the extent of maybe a childrens book. Not to say the game is childish, not at all. I'm refering to the depth and complexity of the plot and narrative.   Overall, I am very glad I bought this. If you enjoy the metrovania genra, then I'd assume you'd enjoy this.",

            "review_text": "It is a pity this game hasn't received any recognition. I suppose unless you release on the consoles today, you’ll be forgotten. This is a PC exclusive title as of this writing. I'll be the first to admit it’s easy to pass over yet another Indie puzzle platformer, but Teslagrad stands out from the crowd. The game looks so good I can barely believe it was made by a studio this size. It’s hard to not praise the visuals when they’re as good or even better than something straight from Ubisoft’s UbiArt Framework games, (Rayman Origins, Valiant Hearts, Child of Light)  Even more impressive is the depth to every visual you see. Teslagrad follows the old adage of, “Show, Don’t Tell”. In fact there’s not a single word of dialogue throughout the entire game, yet you’ll uncover the history and story entirely through its artwork. Artifacts and paintings adorn all the rooms and help you paint your own picture of who you are, and why you’re here. Broken equipment, and death still lingers in the tower, from a battle not too long ago.  Right away you’ll be thrown into the deep end and forced to survive a series of difficult platforming sections. You will soon be complimented by an assortment of gear which you’ll use to manipulate the world around you. Puzzles take the form of Red vs Blue magnetic fields, and you’ll often be forced into interweave the puzzles with precision platforming. I was stumped more than once throughout the game, and have had quite a few sections with 30+ deaths. While it’s not another Super Meat Boy, this can certainly be a challenging game at times, which will test your patience.   Chances are if you ever read my review it’s because Teslagrad will be on sale at 85% on some Steam sale long down the road. It’s honestly too cheap. They could have released it at $15 or even $20 for the amount of work and polish put into it. Definitely an underrated gem.",

At its core, this is a platformer that never forgets the fact, and never waters down the platforming to deliver story or test mechanics, but rather inegrates it fluidly and masterfully. The levels are non-linear, you walk where you want to and discover secret parts of the map as you please. The mechanics are very tight, and on the whole the experience feels reminiscent of 2-d metroid games. The boss fights are unique and challenging in the best possible way, testing your reactions and skills as much as they test your wits. I urge you to give this a try if you have any inclination towards 2-d platformers- you will fall in love with it, and if you aren't normally inclined I urge you to give this one a try as an example of a current-day platformer done ever-so right.",

It's here that the games principle mechanics of Positive (+) &amp; Negative (-) charged platforms, electric barriers, and magical equipment that allow you to manipulate and control the oposing forces - begin to slowly unfold.  As you acquire new abilities like the Swift Shoes, which let you quickly zap forwards several spaces - the platforming very gradually becomes more and more elaborate &amp; complex - with challenging puzzles that see you climbing your way to the top of Tesla Tower.  Along the way, the story is told using clever stage-play-like rooms and of course - the incredible artwork &amp; paintings that make up the visual end of the game. The music, which is more atmospheric at most times - is equally remarkable, and the combination fueled my quest to reach the top of the tower.  The game does have it's share of difficult sections - including the few Boss encounters scattered about, which require memorization of attack patterns, and the skill to actually preform whats necessary to defeat them - but I never found them so hard as I couldn't beat them, or at least further my attempts to do so.  For the completionist, there are 36 hidden scrolls to collect in Teslagrad which reward you with more of the backstory (and a hidden ending) - but you'll have to go out of your way to explore, and collect them - which may push your total time playing well over the 5hrs it should average to simply make your way through in one go.   Teslagrad offers an engaging story, wonderful visuals, and challenging puzzles - well worth the average asking price.   FINAL SCORE: 7/10",

What ruined the game for me was the complete lack of any sense of difficulty curve with puzzles varying from difficult to insanely easy and back again, one example was the puzzle which made me uninstall the game as it was the final straw where you need to use the field-cloak and diagonally placed field generators to repel you up to the top of a room. If you miss you easily fall and have to start all over again. What makes it worse is that this is the first puzzle of its kind and the momentum needed to achieve the require velocity feels more like luck than actually being in control.

Unlike in most platformers where you complete one section after another in a linear fashion and you never go backwards, here you have one giant platform network which you have to explore. New areas are cut off by electric barriers which will kill you if you touch them (eg try to jump a gap and land on it) but death is irrelevant as you respawn nearby. You'll often find yourself going back the way you came to search for a route to new areas. You can check your general whereabouts with the Map button which shows you not the whole map but just a few local sections so you can get your bearings.  You play as a young boy who, at the start of the game, has to outrun a scary-looking man chasing him into a big tower. Early in the game you pick up a blue and red glove. These are used to punch blocks and barriers which gives them +/- magnetic polarity to attract them or release them to open passages, crush enemies etc. A bit later you acquire the 'blink' ability which teleports you a short distance, allowing you to get past electric barriers and jump gaps which would normally be too far. There is a lot of jump+blink necessary to traverse high+wide gaps. Later still there is a red/blue cloak to be acquired, I know this because there's a controller option for it, but I haven't reached that stage yet.  There are what you could describe as cutscenes occasionally. As you pass a theatrical stage the camera zooms in to view a medieval play performed by cardboard cutouts featuring kings, knights and princesses. They don't give any clues to the puzzles but they are very charming and entertaining. As I understand it, they depict the storyline of the game and how the boy is involved, but you don't find this out until the end (which I'm nowhere near so far).  Now and then you run into a boss. There's no shooting weapon so the first time I met one I was a bit baffled. I just ran and dodged and punched some boxes which launched up into his mouth and he eventually died. Strange (in a good way) to fight a boss without shooting.  Hidden throughout the game in hard-to-reach areas are 36 scrolls to be collected, each unlocking a Steam achievement. You can progress without collecting them, and to all intents and purposes they don't seem to have any use at all. However, having done a bit of research I discovered (before I started playing, yay!) that you need 19 of them to fight a boss towards the end of the game. There are many complaints about people not realising this and having to go all the way back to collect scrolls.  It's possible to play with keyboard but a controller is an absolute must. The character drifts a tiny fraction on landing at the end of a jump and this does cause some frustration at first, but after a while you get used to it and apart from that the controls are natural and responsive.

The cloak mechanic is downright inconsistent and unreliable in it's behavior for anything more than basic attraction/repelling. Later level design just feels like the designer wanted to throw a bunch of really impossible stuff in just because it was the end of the game. The parts that are impossible just make the game downright boring. Sure, throw in the hard stuff; but learn to balance it. The trial-and-error/rinse-and-repeat method is terrible. These developers clearly have no idea about balancing gameplay with challenge, and the number of people frustrated with the end game shows it. In addition, there are too many places where I got stuck permanently (sometimes without even the ability to escape by death), which mostly occured because direction in the game was sorely lacking. If you get stuck, you either have to die, or replay from whatever arbitrary point you may have last auto-saved, which could be 5 minutes or 15 minutes back. All this points to a game that looks cool, but who's developers obviously lack skill and experience in good game design. If you're looking for a puzzle platformer that's satisfying to play through in all aspects, this isn't the one.  EDIT: I was reading some other reviews that described better what I meant. The mechanics are too sluggish for the sort of action required in the puzzles. The response time and tightness of movement just isn't there, and I'm playing with a controller, not even a keyboard. It makes the game way more frustrating than it needs to be.",

Some of the cape puzzles are so finnicky that they will get you nothing but frustration and when you finally get through you don't feel any satisfaction but just a relief that mechanics of the game finally did what they are supposed to.  Have hours of time to master the unresponsive mechanics of the cape? You might enjoy this game very much.",

            "review_text": "Honestly one of the best Puzzle + Platformer games I've ever played. I got into it because the video on the store page made it look like a Super-Metroid-esque game, and that turned out to be true. Epic bossfights, a world which describes itself to you as you explore. Power-ups in the form of gear that allows you to interact with the world in new ways. Secrets to find. Rewarding and challenging bosses and every room felt unique and interesting.  Very few times was I confused or unable to progress, but this is definitely a skill game; you won't complete every room on your first try. There's a learning curve, but - at least for me - that's part of the charm.  As a closing note, I tend to not like platformers. The old-school Metroid/Castlevania games were what I grew up playing and loved them. Very few things can scratch that itch. I enjoyed this game immensely, and it was a very pleasant surprise.",

            "review_text": "Teslagrad is a great puzzle platformer. The mechanics and pace of the game are great. One thing many modern platformers lack is a good, steady pace, and this game nails it. The story is also presented in a subtle but effective way. The story was very enjoyable.   I got 100% in about 5 hours, so if you're looking for a game that is dozens of hours long, this may not be for you. I don't have time to dump into a very deep game like Crusader Kings II, so I'm glad there are games like Teslagrad around. The only thing I didn't like about this game was the cool down on the **spoilers teleport move**. If I could see the cool down or it was somehow conveyed visually, that would also be acceptable. Other than that, literally every other aspect of this game was on point.   I don't leave many reviews, but I saw Teslagrad had mixed recent reviews. I would give it a 8.5/10. If Teslagrad looks remotely up your alley, pick it up. You won't regret it.",
