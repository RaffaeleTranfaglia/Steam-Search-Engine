Saying that I very much enjoyed the new challenges, though I've had no crashes of the game. Also I do not feel it warrents its full price. Unless of course you don't own Democracy 3. But certainly worth buying whilst on sale.  If you haven't played Democracy 3. This game is simply put; About making a choice or several depending on political power etc you have for that turn. Then ending the turn and doing it again. Sounds simple and maybe boring. But those choices have an effect. Some choices take longer than others for those effects to come about. This is a game of cause &amp; effect. Can you rescue the country, run it better, get rid of its problems etc. If you like that sort of thing then it's a decent version of that type of game play. If it's not your type of game then you will find it boring and why did you read to the end of this review :)",

After I couldn't get a refund I decided to suck it up, and sit down and play the game a little bit more. I did pay for it, afterall. After putting a few more hours into it I actually found myself enjoying the game through roleplay and deep immersion. The game is enjoyable if you give a little bit of time. There are a few problems that I do have with the game. I wish that a few more policies would be implemented or maybe a few more mechanics in future patches, I just feel like the game is missing something but I don't know what. Secondly I still think that the price should be reduced a little bit. I feel like $15 is a bit too much for this game.",

To me, that's what this game is all about: building from rubble into excelence, and that's why I may like this even more than I like D3 (as much as it pains me to do so).",

Having no prior experience with Democracy 3, to all those who are wondering if this is a good place to start, yes, it sure is. There is various ways to influence the social structure of your nation.   Gameplay: Take a look at the screenshots, what do you see? Bubbles, arrows, icons, stats? Yes, this game is heavy on icons and stats. Update: Everything you see in the screenshots is more than that, you can literally implement new policies that will then show up on the screen once you implement them, and there is a lot of policies to fiddle around with. Simulating all that data in the form of sliders telling the game engine what you want, and what you don't want. In Democracy 3 Africa, you are essentially giving a some data about that countries particular problems. You are going to be making some changes around these parts, and that ultra status quo (which is everyone) won't like it. In Democracy 3 Africa GDP is everything, did you ever hear the expression, 'Money makes the world go-round.' Well, it's true, if you got a crippling debt, your interest rates are going to ruin your country. You are given two primary ways to fix your country. You can either do it democractically, or you can be a totaliarian-warlord, like um, Adolf, and basically put a gun to someone's head until they do what you want. They have their ups and downs, but whatever floats your boat right?  Replayability: I've own played through two nations, Mauritius, and Kenya. In both playthroughs, I was assassinated, and I didn't even get through one term. There is so much to experiement with. You are going to die, and you are going to die a lot. However, there is plenty of options before starting the nation like turning assinations off, and whether the votes are compulsory or how liberal or socialist the country is at the start. Personally, I find it fun, slowly correcting my mistakes and experienting with new policies, the flexibility to modify your start and try out new policies is what makes me come back for more. There is a lot of different scenarios presented with each nation. Mods for democracy 3 will not work for Democracy 3 Africa, so new mods would have to be created with the D3A engine.   Final verdict: Democracy 3 Africa strikes me fairly well. I've spent almost half the day prior to picking this game up reading reviews and all sorts of bizzare steam forum posts (I'm talking about all you radicals in the forums.) Still, one claim that will still remain true, alt-tabbing seems to have some problems so keep the game in maximized border screen mode if you wish to be alt-tabbing. I have done my best to cover as much as the game as possible, if I missed anything, leave it in the comments.",

            "review_text": "Extremely similar to Democracy 3, obviously. This game is chart simulator the chartening. The entire game is enacting policies so some bubbles in your country go away and others have better effects, that's it. It's not a bad game by any stretch, but know what you're getting into!  As a highly abstracted political simulator and you have to be into that before you can find something here. Being the autocratic leader of your country, you enact policies that will throw your country into debt and ♥♥♥♥ off various constituencies while desperately trying to fix the problems your predecessor left you with.   If you're of an especially politically liberal (known in the USA as Libertarian) bent, this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off. It turns out that a government that restricts services to the bare minimum and provides easy access to firearms, alcohol, recreational drugs and doesn't pay for education causes a country to go freaking nuts in this game. (I know I checked.)  But if you believe that the careful management of an economy, forcing people to learn to live without certain benefits is the way of the future... this game will teach you that your character didn't invest in enough bullet proof vests.   The game is hard, brutal even. Unforgiving but at least it's easy to pick up and play. You learn over the course of multiple games what various policies do and how to spend your political capital to best effect.   I can't really reconmend this game at the full price of 14.99 unless you're a serious poltical policy wonk, but if you are you already own it. BUT if you can find it on sale or any sort of discount and you're into anything other than twitch shooters, give it a chance! It can be a soothing change of pace.  (Oh yeah, they rccently had a bug introduced that makes the game crash on some systems sometimes, I was affected by that bug and couldn't play the game for a month. For me at least, the bug is patched now, everything seems to be sunshine and roses.)",
