            "review_text": "There has been very little time and resources spent developing this and it shows.  You are given a mountain village in a valley this is always the same scenario, there are no other landscapes to build on. The camera cannot be moved around freely, it is in a fixed spot, and no zoom. When building the infrastructure in your ski resort you chose from a list of particular attractions, which builds these things in designated spots; you have no choice where you locate, ski runs, restraunts, hotels ect. There is no budgeting to know if your making or losing money, and no way to tell your income/expenditure. Only the money you have to spend.  There so no gameplay value. For example, I simply built the first lift and ski run, carged the maximum price and people still came. I then proceded to click the 'next day' button continuously and made a fortune.  There is also a component of the game involving maintaining your resort, such as using oversnow vehicals to clear roads, groom runs ect. This is simply boring, and hard to control.  In conclusion this game if very poor, no effort has gone into making this game fun or playable. Do not waste you money on this like I have done!",
