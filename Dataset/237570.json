This is the final game in the series. This world is quite different than the previous game, and features the ability to find secret characters and hidden treasures.This game really shines in the RPG role than it's predecessor, as the way it is presented is much more of rpg than the previous game in the series...anyways. It has alot of dark humour in it and sillyness like the rest of the series. I suggest playing the previous games to get the whole storyline of the game. Recommended!",

This series seems to thrive on wacked out endings. Wish there was more to add but the game is just simple rpg funnness. I wouldn't say the humor was that great here but still an enjoyable game.",

The humor is basically the main reason to get this. It's kind of a retro fantasy game, this along with PA3 and Cuthulu Saves the World are all pretty good. If you like PA's humor it's a bonus, the writing is all done by Tycho. The devs are pretty great people as well. It's a pretty simple JRPG, doesn't bring much new to the table, the battle system is mostly the same as PA3 and CSTW. If you wanted more content for PA3 this is a good buy, but it won't bring many people who hate JRPGs a reason to play. 8/10.",

            "review_text": "To be perfectly honest? This game is sadly the worst of their 4 games so far. The New Monster system just didn't seem to work out, but also their Final Fantasy 3/6 [Depending on how you wanna see it] group switches always disrupted my game experience. In the end I grew accustomed to a group of monsters, and then readjustet again to another one, by itself no problem. But from basically Level 1. Jump, finally getting stronger - jump back yay this again. The Story is very good.   The Battles? Jokes. If I have to think about how to defeat a group of monsters effectively, I have run into the problem of the HP. The HP grows for your enemies is gigantic. The battles in the end felt like a drag I had to do. If that happens in an RPG with Fighting as a focus? Ouch.I don't mind beating the hell out of mighty creatures that outdo me if I don't think and just act, but that was the story of every Battle. SMT Persona 3&amp;4 keep me more entertained on Maniac/Very Hard [Respective for the game] and even though I sometimes just wanna throw my PS/P/VITA around, it's still fun. This game does the exact opposite for me. I've seen this as a problem in the Precipice of Darkness 3. The Battles are dynamic yes, the Waiting bar system has been done well and offers strategical insight to when to use Delay attacks or when to leave that alone. I don't want a game where I can beat up a monster in One Turn [Makes battles redundant] but if I have to fight Battles with monsters on a Boss LVL HP all the time, for basic rewards and this continously and all the time it's bad. The Boss battles were just a sign for me that I get closer to the finish of this game. I had a blast with it when the Fish Force song came up, I even enjoyed the first two Character Group jumps, but... the 'Master' system where they gain extra stats for level ups and skill based on which Pokémon trainer - woops, slip of tongue - you use seems to be mysterious. The Badge system where you could swap your Class on the fly in the PoD 3 is better. By a lot. Experiment every fight! Here... not so much. 'Catching' new pokédudes [a Grotesque reference] seems like it's hardly worth the time. This sums it up for the Battle segment.  The Map looks Beautiful and by far the best overworld they have ever produced. If only Cthulu could've looked this good, that would've been a delicious experience Visual wise. The Character models look good. The Music blows, and earlier mentioned Fish Force track took the cake. The Battle Theme is so-so. The other themes were fitting and good. But going back to the Themes - if you know the Cthulu Battle theme, everything just pales in comparison, so this is biased.  Extending the Item system by new senseful things ; Great Job 10/10 Please do that again. It was cool in 3, and even better in 4.   All in all it's a very funny game, but as you can see the negative section weighs a lot heavier. BoD7/Cthulu/PoD 3 were all better by a big margin. I recommend playing the earlier mentioned games in succession to see how they evolved and then compare it to this. Otherwise I can't recommend it. *Prays for the well being of Cosmic*",

Training monsters is actually quite deep as they learn different techniques depending on which character is training them. Music is great, and the graphics are a great step up from PA3. Fan of classic JRPGs? Pick this up. It's inexpensive, and has a lot of fun to offer for the price of admission.",

            "review_text": "Summary: The fourth installment vastly improves over every element from episode three, with a much more coherent and identifiable plot, a battle system revamped with much more input from the player, a soundtrack that is decently done, and a greater emphasis on the adventure and roleplaying aspects of the game. It spends less time trying to serve itself up as a novelty of the 16-bit era RPGs many of us grew up with and instead craft its' own identity. Granted, some may quickly feel alientated from the approach it took for its' battle system (similar to Pokemon), but it's much more solid experience than previous installments. On its' own merits I'm recommending the game, I think most people will have a good experience and enjoy it. 3.5/5  So surprisingly, most of the faults I identified in the previous review for PAOtRSPoD 3 have actually been changed for the better in four. It's still a world full of 2D sprites, still a battle system more akin to Final Fantasy than anything else, and still full of the same humor and writing style from the previous installments. The biggest change you'll find is that the characters you were previously using, Moira, Tycho, Gabe, are all now 'trainers' and will be in charge of a host of different monsters to control. Now this will sound amazingly like Pokemon, even the ability to change out monsters with another mid-battle makes it seem ever more so, but the game fully recognizes this. There is even one satirical approach to a reocurring Jesse-and-James (from the Pokemon show)-type nemesis throughout the episode. It was minimal to the story, didn't really affect the pace of the game, and really is a sidenote, but still it shows that the developers were aware of the similarities. Besides this, the items are all fairly the same, spells and effects unchanged, and the WAIT-CMD-ACT phases of battle identical to the last installment.  Now the plot from three is summed up in the first few minutes of the game and that was actually very helpful. Three was incoherent and made little-to-no-sense, but the synopsis wrapped things up and put everything into focus. It's kind of ironic that things just seem to make more sense in this new world filled with monsters, demon trains, and flying daewhales than the city of Arcadia, but it does. I feel that the ending was a bit incomplete and may have just opened a window for succeeding episodes, but still there was a set objective, a defined mission that made the game easier to follow. There is still a limited amount of character development, not to mention there is virtually none for all the monsters you capture, but it is still a marked improvement.  The game is still fairly linear, but the ability to explore and more importantly the reward factor in doing so has greatly improved. You will find items, chests, and new monsters to 'train' as you scour for every alternate pathway and random cave on the overworld. I've felt that in the previous games that the reward-to-time ratio was vastly low and in many cases not worth it, but spending the extra time walking around for hidden chests can be rewarding. There are now shops and towns, NPCs, and random dungeons to explore, which adds a greater depth to the world and although the effects of this is superficial, it does add some variety to the monoity of just dungeon-crawling all game.  In alot of ways, I feel that this should've been the type of game that was done for #3. I think that there was more effort put into this title and that the last game was kind of written off and pushed out. By no means is this game a masterpiece though with all the praise I've poured over it, it's just a vast improvement on everything that series failed on previously. There are still much better games out and the game can easily be covered in about 8-9 hours. It's not life-changing or particularly deep, but I found it enjoyable. There is limited replayability, the battle system could honestly have been just revamped instead of swapped with the monster trainer approach, and I feel that the game is still linear and falls short of being on par with the gems of the 16-bit era. One part of the game that blew me away was the soundtrack. The music is a hundred times better and I'll probably end up keeping a few of the songs for casual listening. The Airship and Tycho themes in particular were well done.  With these points in mind, I'm recommending this game for the masses, it's a game I might recommend to certain gamer friends and in general you'll probably find something worthwhile along the way. 3.5/5  ",
