            "review_text": "If you're looking for a game where you build whole cities and then crush them in your iron grip... then that's exactly what you do in this game! Only.. not at all.   You're a game developer with a small bit of money and have to build a team up from nothing basically. It's a time management and adventure type game.   You have to increase the skill of your workers in various specialties like Sound, Coding, Writing, etc.  Your workers can get good enough at a specific skill to actually specialize in it and start learning new skills by learning new programs on training kiosks (that you build) As their skills increase, so does the viability of your product.  Picking genres that directly support your team's skill is definitely a cool part of the game. Especially when you are in the midst if training to new skills and/or have new folks on your team.  I really liked being given access to new training techniques and even the ability to 'enhance' members of your team to get rid of bad habits like overeating or arriving late. Later in the game you can also ADD enhancements to them to help them work harder and be more efficient with their time.  All in all, this game was a pleasant surprise and definitely worth your time.",

            "review_text": "Load of hours with fun for very cheap price.  Probably one of the best or maybe the best Economy-Management Game Dev Simulation ever so far. I used to play Game Dev Tycoon few months ago, it was the last good game dev simulation game.    After few months Game Corp DX came out. It was in early acces, I stayed away cuz of bugs and some negative reviews. Just added it to my wishlist and got it on my birthday as a gift. LOL, I am lucky cause this game is totally awesome.    There is three difficulty mode ; Hard, Normal and Easy. Easy is really easy. You can learn the game basics as like as it's a tutorial. Then you can play normal or hard without getting bored easily.   The game mechanics are basic. You can build workplaces, training stuffs into your office/studio. You can recolate your studio from X to Y. You can hire new people with pros and cons. You can speciliaze your employees, remove their negative effects.   There is four specialities. Sound and Art Designer, Writer, Coder. You can specialize your employees with one of them.     There is four game sizes. Micro, Small, Medium, Large. Earning money is a bit hard after a time. When you get f.cked up, request loan from the bank. Making micro or small games always worth to get a shot. Well, the magazines like VGN and Kotokoo or whatever... are sonuva♥♥♥♥♥. Your employees have to work hard and train themselves to make a better game.    At last it feels more simulation and complicated than Game Dev Tycoon or any other else. You can earn awards in game festivals. Stats are (your own stats and global stats) verQy well designed. You can expand your capacity and studio. You can see that your studio is grow up with your very own eyes.   I give my thanks to special dev/devs behind this game.   The only one con is making game projects are easy and not very complicated. So it means you can beat the game without getting tired. There is a lot of special thing in build mode, employee hire and management but not game projects. They could be similar or upgraded version of Game Dev Tycoon.  Also there is some framerate drops in studio with a lot of workers.   Please don't ask me as like 'Why are you comparing Game Dev Tycoon and Game Corp Dx' cuz Game Dev Tycoon is another succesful game dev management game for a long time.  PS : There is dozens of funny easter eggs and achievements. You can hire Tim Schaffer, Sid Meier, Gabe Newell and you can make Half-Life 3 ! My dream come true!   Some easter egg examples : DVD Projekt RED, VGN, Kotakoo, Telltail Games, Double Pine, Electronic Poptarts etc.    SCORE : 79/100",

            "review_text": "Really I want to leave a 'middling' review but Steam makes me choose thumbs up or thumbs down so there you have it,  The tutorial to start with is very good, and the first couple of hours while you learn the mechanics and try to find the right balance. However, once you get past the early game you find that you want to specialise all of your workers to get the best quality games. Then it just becomes a game of throwing as close to the right number of each skill at each project and sitting there with time on the fastest setting until it's done. Some of the later game mechanics aren't covered in the tutorial though, and you can only find them by going into build mode and placing down items you don't know anything about to see what they do.  You have to lay out your studio, but the space you have to build it in is so small, you pretty much end up with every square having something on it by the time you max out your team. This doesn't leave you with many options for being creative with your layouts.  I've not played the challenge mode yet, the campaign mode that you play to unlock it is essentially a massive tutorial. It might hold my interest for another few hours, but in all likelihood I'm just going to play another game, this one has lost it's appeal for me.  If you're going to buy this game, buy it in a sale for a price where you think it's worth buying something which will only really keep you entertained for an afternoon.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: While in early access this game was very nice, stable and worked out and worth the money. Updates come rapidly and really add something to the game. It has been released now and is more finished than I could image, this is a great game and tends to steal your time away.  At the time of writing I played about one hour and is in early access. This game is quite OK and was well worth the money. It tends to get a little repetitive after a while but quite challenging none the less. Sometimes the game feels a bit empty, and I hope the devs can work that out. For example, the amount of stuff you can place and the way information is revealed.  When beginning a new project, the player has no clue about the number of available workers (and there skills!). So it is hard to pick a game that is more adaptive to the available skillset, I would like to see that changed.  Every year there are awards and it isn't easy to get more than 2 or 3 of them. You really have to put effort (strategy) into each minute of playing to get the most awards and revenue out of your business.  UPDATE: There have been some tweaks to the game and I like them very much. For example, you can now put the game on pause without showing the menu. When paused you can also publish games and create projects. The latter one can take quite some time, so I'll use the pause button a lot.  @devs: - What I'm still waiting for is a list of employees who have nothing to do BEFORE creating a new project. It is just weird that you create a new project for 10 people, click on next to find out there are only 3 available. (This has been fixed!) - Also there is a minor bug where you post-produce a large project where it tells you there aren't any free Master-workplaces though I have 2 available (which are then used by that project). No breaker, but still quite annoying. (This has been fixed!)  9.5/10",

The challenges are cool. But first you need to go to San Francisco. As this is a game that is so simply i must give my Pros/Cons too.  So here are the      Pros: The game has building instead of expanding like in game dev tycoon. Much more freedom. What i mean is that you could build your own office and be a billonaire like Gaben Make any game u want. Self explaining   Here are the  Cons: No indepth game making. You can make a multi platform or make it an Action/RPG The game is not overall Complicated.   Overall this game is fun for a first playthrough which is roughly 2 hours or something in that way.

At 3AM I was still playing fully obsessed with the cycle of producing games of varying scale with increasingly silly names. My FPS based on the book Flowers for Algernon was the biggest hit of the year.  Game Corp DX is very simple. It isn't the flashiest looking game int he world. Its mechanics are not the most deep. But it is easy to pick up, involves a decent level of strategy and is a lot of fun. There's a Theme Hospital vibe I get from it with its sense of humour and the general feeling of it all. A lot of the strategy comes from space management and timing the launches of projects and completion of training. It's all about spinning a lot of plates to get the best game made that you can.

I played it once for like 5 hours straight right after I got it, tried on and off to get the very last achievement (The achievements are super easy, you will get 95% of them from just playing the game normally and the last 5% are just special names you need to give games).  The game rating system is rather... Well, unfortunate. In fact its the only thing that really let me down about the game. It relies almost 100% on how much money you put into the game. So what you will find at first is that you are coming up with noting but misses, and late game you can literally get nothing but 5 star ratings with little to no effort. Literally, literally no effort at all. Chose a topic and name, chose the people to work on it, and chose the programs you want to use to work on it. I had 2 seperate teams in game working on 2 projects at a time over, and over, and over again and it was nothing but 5 star ratings across the board. Ultamatly that was what stopped me from playing the game. Once you reach the final office it becomes far too repetive.  Other then that, its just small little things that will bug you... Like how during the planning phase planning cannot continue unless everyone developing the game is at the table at once, WHICH WOULD BE FINE, but early game most of your workers will have the 'hungry quickly' or 'thirsty quickly' effect, which means simply getting started on the game may take 2 or 3 ingame monthes.   Im guessing things like that will be worked out at some point... Overall, the time I spent on the game I found fun enough. So would I suggest it? Yes. For the price the game currently has great entertainment value.",

I played on easy mode, so I'm not sure about the other difficulties. But the characters you could get, and the ability to control the project even if in the end all the project really does is get you fans and money, the game really made you feel like you were the lead in the videogame company.

Build your office/feng shui your way to success, send your employees into the Enhancement station to make them better humans and train them up to be master coders, writers, artists and sound designers. The better you are, the more awards you win in the bizarre end-of-year awards, where companies are judged on how many games they've released and how big the team is.  The first time I played this game I'd lost about seven hours in the blink of an eye and it was 3am, which is a good indication of how this game draws you in. Simple to pick up and learn, and not that hard to master either, it can get a little samey but is kept alive by a Challenge Mode and the game setting you other goals to hit in the normal mode itself.

Game Corp DX instead asks you to focus on worker management and ensure the right people for the job are working on the right teams.  The game feels a bit clunky in spots -- not being able to rotate items when building is a huge oversight. And there's not as much going on concurrently as there is in Game Dev Tycoon. This is still a solid way to spend a couple of hours. I blew through the campaign in about 2.5 hours, though I'd imagine it's possible to do it much quicker if you're not a perfectionist.

Though I have played a large number of these games, so I'm comparing to what I've experienced but don't take my word as fact as I am human and I am biased in some aspects.  TL;DR at the bottom, because I'm long winded.   The game itself is a simple game creation simulator where you hire people then specialise them into either Code, Art, Sound or Writing and get them to make games for you. The workers gain experience and get better at their jobs, to a point, and eventually this allows you to move into bigger studios and make bigger games. Until you complete everything there is to do and then you pretty much unlock free mode.  My first opinion of the game was that it was simple, this is by no means a negative, a bit of a half and half at times though. It gives the game it's own place within a genre of games that is full of innovative ideas and different ways of doing things. I would, from what I've experienced, call this game an intro into Management Simulation games. I say this because It's not a hard game to learn or master (In my opinion) and I found myself breezing through the game in 3 hours without even a hitch in the money department. But people that are newer to this genre would find this game to have a very plesent learning curve.  It doesn't have the thing a lot of other similar games have where genres are locked off until you research them or a job tree for workers to evolve within. Which was nice to me, I usually find those sorts of activities tend to bore me as they can take a long time to do or reduce the quality of your games until things get back on track. In Game Corp DX you'll have all the Genres unlocked for you instantly (I don't know why some games have you research them for months in the first place) and your workers will take the specialistation you give them and stick with it (unless you want to change them later).  The music isn't bad, though it's repetiveness could get annoying to some though but I found it plesent. No sound errors or noises that were unecessarily loud too which is a plus.  Only things i found that could be looked at in a very slightly negative way is the difficulity level, though I said above I played only on Normal and have yet to look at the challenge and hard modes to get a comparison. The achievements also weren't very hard to get but as I played on normal, that had a hand in it.  For cons I found the bar at the top to be too small, I could read it, but at times it was difficult. The rooms are very small with not much room to do things, half the time you'll spend playing will be organising the furniture to fit everything in. Not a big variety in the objects to put in, decorations especially.  ----Bug/Glitch---- Only Bug I found was a progress bug, and though annoying it's exploitable from what I could see. I finished all the storyline quests, closed the game and re-opened it to see if it saved it, it did but it reset all the story quests and their rewards. I'm not sure if this always happens or if it was just because I finished everything in one sitting but it happened. -------------------  Overall, I'm glad to have played Game Corp DX, it is a good game for the price that's being asked and it's simple enough to just sit down and go for people who are experienced right down to people who are brand new to the genre.   ------TL;DR------  Pros+ - Easy to pick up and play - Simple for beginners - Not a bad price tag for what it delivers  Pros with a little Con, or Cons with a little Pro - Music was nice, though some people won't like the repetivness of it - Art was simple but some people have a problem with simple art - Progress bug but it's exploitable for the benefit of the player (money) - Not very long if you know what you're doing  Cons - Can be boring for those who ae used to all the things other, bigger games do - Small top HUD bar - Small rooms/Hard to fit everything at times - Not many decoration options  Overview - Updates will improve this immensly - If you're on the fence about buying it, it's not much and it's a fun game to play, so buy it :P",

I've been training all my workers and the hints/tutorials really aren't that in depth. I guess I'm just looking for a quicker, more fast paced 'Game Dev Tycoon' feel. However, I do like the concept, just not for me.",

I've finish the game and it was fun competing on other companies and yet easy to learn, although there were not much contents at least i enjoyed the game throughout when i was progressing in my games that my company produced. The game is very fun and i do recommend this game allowing you to think of games of your own. I would also personally add copy right reasons. It doesnt give any creativity into the game at all. So again this was a great experience on playing this game. This game was just absolutely good.",

I especially enjoyed the 8 years I spent brainwashing all 40 'employees' into the perfect little almost workbots. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!  I would have loved to see a more flushed out building system, but I liked how the limitations made me organise everything top down into the most efficient layout I could muster. Didn't like how I couldn't expand my office after San Francisco but oh well, guess my different categories of slave workers cant have rooms to themselves and neither can the pre production crews have seperate rooms.  I would have loved to have different music for the game play every now and then. One song after several hours gets extremely annoying. And at the end it can get a bit tedious manually assigning every slave *err* 'employee' to the project and it would have been nice to see an assign highest skilled button somewhere.  But overall and at 2 bucks it was a really fun game that entertained me for a few hours and I don't regret the purchase. Now, where's the upgrade that turns my 'employees' into worker drones that never eat drink sleep or ♥♥♥♥?",

How to expand and move to '***' could be explained a bit in the beginning though I had to google it :/  And I can't see any female characters unless I download them from the page which most people don't know is a thing anyways.

It's nice to have 40+ workers after an hour or two, it's nice to rebuild your office every few minutes and enhance it with flowers and statues... But is this what game development is about? I don't think so...  Do you want to know all your developers by name? Well, they just become numbers in few minutes. Do you want to create fantasy games? Sci-fi? History? Sorry, not here. Do you want to develop sequels, DLCs, expansions? MMO or MOBA maybe? Nothing like this here.  After few attempts, game development shrinks to looking at numbers and bars - genre does not matter, people don't matter, even game name does not matter, since the randomly generated one is fine and you wanna go for quantity anyway.  Campaign is done for in 3 hours (and doesn't tell you it's over, just goes on without any endgame), and 'challenge' game is just a sandbox game with more achievements.  I guess it just makes a good EA GAMES simulator - horde of anonymous workers, developing games which are all the same, dubious work, big profits, but almost no fun.  If you want to really play game developer, go buy Game Dev Tycoon instead, or buy this in sale, the dollar or two of price just may be ok for few hours of gameplay.",
