Such as maybe single use power ups you can purchase with coins as, now that I have unlocked the crown, I am just collecting coins for nothing which feels a bit useless.  The jump is also a bit buggy/laggy for me at times causing me to die but overall the game is decent, good for a casual play.  edit: gonna change it to not reccomended until the jump lag is fixed because it's annoying and frustrating when you keep dying because of it",
