            "review_text": "Full disclosure: obtained a key to the game via the #GamesMatter initiative, with the only requirement that I comment about the game, good and bad opinions alike.  Short version:  Get it. It has rough edges at times, no it is not perfect, but I've played so much stuff in the last 30 years that I love stuff that is DIFFERENT, and this is cool, different and fun. Some will tag it 'metroidvania' but really it is its own thing. Is adventure sleuthing a genre ? Now it is.  Longer version:  I pondered a while if I should click YES or NO at 'do you recommend this game'.. As mentionned in the short version, the game does have rough edges, even outright bugs (being worked on, dev is really neat for that and so accessible both here and on twitter) but it has soul and it has style.. It is NOT a copy cat (heh) of anything, and I love it for that. It has a bit of a problem of meshing looking for clues/advancing the story and the platforming puzzles.. My mind would be in one of the two mode but rarely engaged in both at the same time. Part of this is that level stretch for too long for nothing, and that the camera is too zoomed in to be able to easily map out the universe in my head without an in-game map.  Dev has stated that a 2D map isn't easily done (since levels curve around here and there) and that a 3D one is totally out of the question (ressource wise, and with the excellent point that this was attempted and failed by the big N in Metroid Prime). Maybe street signs or just crude drawings of maps on the walls in game would have helped.. or maybe some type of fudged teleport systems to get to the underground city of Remington or in and out of dump.. So navigation was annoying, but you do get used to it after a while, especially when you have all the gadgets. If you have a problem with spatial orientation, getting around and exploring nooks and cranies could be an issue.  Writing is fun and witty, even if the overall plot got a bit convoluted at times to me because chunks will arrive after long periods of platforming. Game could have done the classic adventure game 'characters on each side of the screen zoomed in' type of discussion maybe, at times it all felt tiny to read the speech bubbles, giving me the impression of chitchat even if important clues and infos were dropped.  I've played the whole thing with a controller, and the platforming works just fine. The clue interface is annoyjing at times and for that I'd reach for the mouse for a second to go quicker. Most reviews will explain the gun ammo/reloading system and while it annoyed me for a while it wasn't that big of a deal in the end, but it'd be a lot better to clearly explain the quick reload option ! Thinking of other game with different ammo with the controller it could have been nice to skip the reload and switch ammo type with shoulder buttons, but the current system feel more thematic to the noir tone of course. On the puzzle side, having a fixed slot order could have helped in some spot where I wanted certain different type in a specific order. Nitpicking really.  More nitpicking: the clue interface and the options/save/quit panels should have been separate. Broke the immersion. Also list the timestamp on the save slot, since there's no indication if one is used at all or not..  Still reading ? Tiny warts and all this is still good fun, plus is has cats with ties and guns that shoot bubbles to reveal secrets. And rocket jumping. You could do a whole lot worse in your gaming choices! I had played the dev's Jones On Fire (Android) and will most definitely look forward to their eventual next project.",

It's actually a pretty fun mash-up between point-and-click mystery games and metroidvania platformers. You explore a bit, get some neat new items, and explore further. Clean-cut simple, and it don't get better than that.",
