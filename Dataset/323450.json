            "review_text": "~Cleared on 09/28/2016~  Okay now about for the Review.. Pros : - Got Trading cards - Casual old JRPG good to have fun like the PSX era - Interactive characters interaction for JRPG - Achievements seems possible to complete (oh the Treasure Achievement is kinda hard I only got 205/220 treasure *sigh)   Cons : - Voice over is too little (usually only for few sentences even on main event) - Unclear status buff or debuff in this game(Thereis no clue if the buff is spd/atk/mnd) they just put the number ^1 or v1... - No keyboard remapping (kind of lack shortcut if this game target on PC)  In short..   But not too short I think   Well Kemco main selling area is on Smartphone, but now they try to grab more customers on Steam. I appreciate they want to increase their selling area but I think they could do better job if re-Master or add another feature/voice over on the game before porting to PC, so it will attract more customers.   For this one I think they just porting from Smartphone version to PC (with no difference)  Overall score : 7/10 Still worth it if you grab one on Sale~",

            "review_text": "I'll start by saying I do recommend it overall but ONLY on sale. It's not worth the $10 price tag, especially since it's a port of a mobile game that only costs $4 on the android market. True, the steam version does not have microtransactions like the mobile version does but that alone does not justify doubling the price. The in game shop is still there but instead of buying the points to spend in it you can find them hidden in various places through the game. I also have to kinda question Kemco's decision to have this game as their first PC port not only because this is the 6th entry in a series, but also because it has other games that would have been a better choice.  With that out of the way.....it's a decent JRPG. The story is ok, not the best ever but it's better than most of the RPG maker games that are starting to flood steam. The combat makes up for it though, the PC market is a bit lacking in decent retro style turn based RPGs (I will highlight 'decent', there's no shortage of retro turn based RPGs but unfortunately a lot of them are terrible) and since that's basically all Kemco does hopefully they start porting more of their games over. Hopefully they also price them to make them worth purchasing outside of a sale.",

            "review_text": "+ The story isnt some stupid ♥♥♥♥ like Final Fantasy XIII + The music is good  + The turn based fight have a good animation  - Some monster use the same model with only slight change in color - No gamepad support yet but it can be solved with 3rd party program  Conclusion: After playing this game, I felt dirty because i bought it while it was on sale. Absolutely must have if u loved some classic turn based rpg like 'Breath of fire'.",
