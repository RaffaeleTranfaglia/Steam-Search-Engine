How do you rule over gods, creatures, and men who refuse to obey you? How do you build a landscape of villages when bandits and mythology are conspiring to tear it down?",

            "review_text": "Skyward Collapse is a game that requires some dedication and time investment to really learn it. You have to forgive the fact that there is no animation at all - characters slide around the world like pieces on a board game. And I'm going to say right up front to buy this game with the Nihon no Mura expansion. It's only a little extra for it, and you won't want to be without the Super Smite ability that comes with it.  As a god-like being, you command two factions of human civilization, which can be either Greek, Norse, or (with the expansion) Japanese. Each has unique skills, monsters, and gods whose powers can be used against one another by building up their towns and earning supplies.  Here's the catch: you're on both teams. You can't allow one to completely destroy the other. And you can't just not let them fight, because you need to earn points to make score requirements every so many rounds. So, you have to find ways to keep them balanced - if one side starts overwhelming the other, you'll have to concoct strategies to even the odds. This can get quite hectic, especially considering all the random elements the game tosses at you - such as the woes that create game-changing conditions, the rogue bandits that pop up every so often, and what to do if a character attains such high stats that they become practically unstoppable.  Once you get the hang of it, you will likely never be in any real danger of losing. But the game is fully-customizable. You can change any number of elements to make it as hard or as easy as you'd like. Going for the achievements is a good way to learn the game's rules and mechanics and to give you concrete goals to shoot for.  Rating: 3.5/5",

Edit: Just nominated this game for 'The 'I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award' Award' so lets improve this review a little bit.  It's a great innovative take on strategy games (and that is saying something after at least 25 years of development in the genre!). It does have it flaws, but I really enjoyed playing it.  The game is about managing two rival factions, ensuring they fight eachother - however, you must bring BALANCE to the battle and avoiding that one of them gets wiped, which becomes increasingly difficult as the turns goes on.  It does have a boardgame feeling to it when you expand the world with new tiles [looking at you, Carcassone] but have the automation that only video games can bring to you.  All in all, a great game for everyone - there are multiple handcaps settings. So no matter how hardcore or casual you are, you'll be able to enjoy a few sessions.",

This can be fun, but you end up having to build the entire game and create everything becuse they won't build a single hut on thier own. I would enjoy the game alot more, if they showed a little bit of autonomy.",

It's a intriguing challenge building up the two factions while trying to avoid one becoming too strong. But as the game progresses, it just starts to feel more like a chore. You keep nudging here and there, on a game-bord that becomes more and more chaotic as woes and god-actions come in to play. Combined with the basic graphics, it's just kinda hard to tell what's going on at times.  In the end, when I feel like I'm finishing the last turns not because it's fun, but rather to just finish the game, it's not really a game I'd recommend. A shame really.",

I really like the way it sets up and how you build things and gather resources, as well as the concept of adding more tiles to the edge of the board. However, the overall concept is just awful. Basically, you aren't trying to win, you are trying to get the 2 factions to be equal to each other. Which, while it may sound interesting, ultimately results in extremely boring gameplay. This game would have so much potential if you could just pick a side and play as it and try to beat the other faction. But you are not able to do this. After the very beginning of the game, it becomes unplayably boring. I don't think I've ever actually been able to keep playing to the end. Like I said really cool idea at first, but then the god and balance perspective just ruins it. Would not recommend to anyone 3/10.",

An interesting gameplay mechanic that fits well, with a few problems:  The AI's decision within a faction is completely random, so there is no feedback or indication of what an AI would do. The only game mode you can do is a normal game and sandbox which is basically game that never ends. If there is a game mode where you can choose a side, that would be nice.   6/10 After 1 game victory I got bored afterwards. Would grab this if it is like one dollar, else pass on this.",
