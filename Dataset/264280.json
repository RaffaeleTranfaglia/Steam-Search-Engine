            "review_text": "This game is seriously just horrible. You wonder 'hey a rogue-like dungeon crawler side-scroller based on hell, that sounds awesome!' Let me tell you this game is not what it seems like. They shouldn't even be allowed to advertise this as a rogue-like game. This game is like Spelunky's mentally challenged cousin. Lets go through the pros and cons.  PROS: - Its only 5 dollars.  Alright moving on to the cons.  CONS: - Lack of music. Through out the levels all you get is 'eerie' ambience sounds. No real music. When you're running out of time or fighting bosses, you get really cool metal music. But that's the only time you get cool music.  - Enemies. They look like they were done in MS paint by a 5 year old.   - Lack of variety. This is NOT a rogue-like game. You'll notice you're in the same exact rooms over and over again. Even in later levels, its the same exact room just looks different. You'd swear there's only like 10 unique rooms, and out of 100 total rooms? That's just sad.  - Not many items. Seriously, I've only collected maybe like 5 items total from all the time I've spent playing. All you come across in abundance is gold, but you'll be lucky to even afford something as small as a heart from the shops. You get barely around 10 to 20 pieces of gold per room, but all the items in the shop are like 500 and 600. You're only hope is to gamble it and try to get more gold from it. There are simply not enough items in this game to make it seem fun and refreshing with each play through, let alone on your first play through.  - Bosses are a joke. Seriously, usually the bosses just move from side to side summoning enemies. They literally don't attack half the time. I'm stuck on the level 60 boss right now. Why? All the boss does is fly from left to right but it summons so many enemies you can't even hit the boss. There's like 30 flying little robots on the room and still spawning, it becomes impossible to hit the boss let alone survive.  - Only 2 types of enemies every 10 levels. Yeah, and they're usually just reskins of older enemies. Just like the level layouts. They don't do sh*t either, they usually just fly around in random patterns and, well, thats it.  - Hit boxes are garbage. You get hit whenever your character feels like getting hit.  - Developers seem to have abandoned this game. Same goes for the community. Nobody is really playing this nor talking about it in the discussions anymore. I can't imagine the developers are still polishing this up anyways...  Seriously, save yourself 5 dollars and go get some food or something. This game sucks...",

            "review_text": "Rating 7/10  Overview: 2d Sidescroller Action Rogue   The Good: + 2d sidescrolling action through 99 levels and 10 bosses. Levels have a time limit, spend too long in the level and multiple ghosts start to come into the level. Levels can have shops, elevators that can either send you further down or back up, slots for gambling gold you find, and portals.  + Multiple characters that start out with their own weapons, however you can always switch weapons later on. You can only carry one weapon at a time so choose carefully.   +Different items and upgrade for weapons that can either be found or bought in shops.   +Cool Boss battles  +items are randomized in each level  +Easy achievements except for 1 (100 hours in dungeon)  The Bad: - Their are a handful of levels that get re-used over and over again. After playing the game for a few hours you generally get a good sense of each level. Item randomization in the levels help to a degree but not by much  -Every 10 levels the game switches up the environment, this is good except its just a reskin of the textures, it adds some variety however the novelty wears off pretty quickly when you realize you are playing the same level that you played 6 floors up.   -Enemies change every 10 levels as well and most of them act exactly the same as the previous levels removing some of the challenge from the game. Essentially enemies are just reskined from previously levels.   -Some enemies are hard to see and blend too well in the background. I'm not sure if this was by design or by accident but it gets very frustrating when you loose health and you have no idea what hit you. Even worse, sometimes you will loose health exiting shops or other areas instantly because an enemy was right there and their is little you could do about it.   Conclusion  Despite its many faults I still had fun playing the game. The game has all the core elements of a good rogue like game albeit a bit on the easy side. Their is no denying that this feels like a poor mans spelunky but if you like rogue games then this is a good game to waste a few hours on.  ",

It's one of the best PC platformers I've ever played (we're talking 'the Binding of Isaac' -level quality here guys). With a playtime of 2 hrs. I've only begun to scrape the surface of what the game has to offer, which is the best thing about this game too. There's an absolutely batshi7 crazy amount of content packed into this little gem of a game and it makes for a HUGE replay value. You never know what to expect for each run, and every single descend into hell will very much feel and play differently. It'll easily become one of my top 10 most played games on Steam.  And for the current price of only 5 euros the game is practically a steal. I promise you this; Should you decide to go pick up this game - and you should - you'll ABSOLUTELY get your money's worth of entertainment. Forget your Diablo III, this is where the shi7's going down. And oh, did I mention the badass soundtrack? Yea, theres a soundtrack made from 100 % pure badassery in this game aswell!  I would absolutely recommend this game to any person calling themself a gamer. 8/10 - Awesome!",
