            "review_text": "First of all, for those who are arguing this is supposed to be a horror game, it's not. The basic storyline is 'you come home and nobody is there, find out why' and not 'zombies have taken over the house and lurk in the basement'.  Yes, 'Gone Home' is short, once you know where to find the information and the keys, you can play it in a little over 10 minutes ... but that means only going through the house and triggering the ending sequence, that kind of playing will not give you the complete story. The story, however, is not just about Sam (the sister). You can also find out about your father's troubles with writing, about his weird uncle, who owned the house before the family moved in, and other stuff. Basically, the game lets you catch up with the family history during the time you were in Europe.  It's an everyday story, not something great or heroic or scary. It's just the unease everyone would feel alone in a house they've never been in before, at after 1 a.m. on a night with a thunderstorm, not atmospheric horror like in 'Amnesia.'  $20 might indeed be a little much for the game... and 'game' a little too much of a word for 'Gone Home' but it does not deserve all the bad reviews it has gotten. If you want an action game, this is not for you... but that should be obvious from the description. If you like uncovering a story for yourself, you might want to give it a chance.",

If you're expecting a traditional adventure or horror game, you'll not find it here. Instead the game manages to capture the essence of the nineties while keeping you in a constant state of psychological tension as you explore a mysteriously abandoned home (with more than a few uncomfortable secrets to discover). As someone who grew up in the 90s, listened to riot grrrl, played bass in a riot grrrl band and experienced a very similar coming of age as the invisible protagonist, Sam... I can perhaps relate to the themes conveyed more than the average gamer demographic. Perhaps because of that, I consider this to be one of my favourite games of the year. It's an experience which rewards slow-paced exploration and the ability to soak in the atmosphere of the era. It's also very short, I finished it in about four hours despite taking my time in piecing together the subtle threads of the story and exploring the manor obsessively. I don't consider this to be a bad thing, as it suits the game's purpose of telling the story of a slightly dysfunctional family and their history. There is no need to pad it out with unnecessary content. By the end, I was deeply moved and pleasantly surprised... in my opinion, there need to be more games like this in the world. Period.",

            "review_text": "This isn't the easiest game to describe, let alone review. Some nitpicky people will even try to tell you it's not a game at all, since there's no way to die/fail/lose. There's only one level, only one thing you work towards, and then it's over. A mere 3 hours in (for me personally).  That can't be good, can it? It is. It so is.  The player controls Kaitlin Greenbriar who, after a year of travelling abroad, has Gone Home. Her homecoming isn't quite as she'd planned it though, since nobody appears to be there to greet her. What follows is an exploration of a large house, its history, what your family has been up to in the year that you weren't there, and why nobody is there.  This exploration is done very literally, you roam through the house in a first person perspective and look at things that you find. Almost everything can be picked up and analysed, most of it won't progress the game along (should you choose you can spend half an hour looking at a pack of toilet paper from all angles). What this accomplishes is that the house you wander around in feels very real. It's not laid out like a videogame level (mostly anyway), it actually feels like a home.  Some objects spark memories, either Kaitlin's or those of her younger sister, Samantha. The protagonist's are displayed along the bottom of the screen, but Samantha's are fully voiced, generally taking the form of diary entries. The voice acting is believable, emotional, endearing.  The game tells you a story, primarily Samantha's, of how Kaitlin being away has impacted her life, what she's been up to, how she handled moving to a new house, how she's making new friends. Endearing is a word I've used already in this review, several times maybe even, but that's what the game makes you do. You care about Samantha, and every diary excerpt you uncover makes you care a little bit more.  By the time you've finally made your way to the last room to explore (game progress is generally non-linear except for two or three segments where you have to know a trick that is only explained in Samantha's diary entries to gain entry to a new part of the house) you'll be hooked and want to know the conclusion.  And I  loved  the conclusion. The entire game builds up to it so well, both foreshadowing and alluding, and it's amazing feat of storytelling. Treat yourself and play this game, but expect to be told a story and explore a house, not to have your reflexes challenged. Definitely, passionately and endearingly recommended.",

            "review_text": "You are not the protagonist, and Gone Home is not your story.   In most games, the players write their own stories: their actions and struggles define the game plot. Not so in Gone Home: this game asks you to explore the stories of other people (your family, mostly, including the psycho great-uncle Oscar). Your impact on these people is zero, because during the game, they're not home. Also, their stories are hidden: you need to find it in odds and ends strewn around the house, and even if you find them all, there'll be a lot left to the imagination (provided you have any).  If you're a narcisstic person with no emotional intelligence, this game will leave you cold because it won't be about you, but about other poeple's feelings. If you aren't, you'll enjoy a good teenie 'chick-flick' story told from a very different angle. If you're a child of the nineties, it's worth it for amount of love and detail that went into the whole house alone. Rarely have I wandered through a game and felt so immersed.",

            "review_text": "To experience a story just by discovery and reading with no violence or other characters actually around can be amazing if done right. Gone Home is one of those experiences. I wasn’t sure what to expect when starting up Gone Home. I didn’t read much on it before getting it just thought it looked cool and said why not.  You are Katie Greenbriar who has just arrived home after been abroad for a year. Unfortunately no one is home to greet you but it’s not really a bad thing either. The story is told through exploration and discovery. Letters scattered throughout the house written and narrated by your sister are spoken with such emotion and feeling that just sucks you in. It was wonderful hearing her talk about how she falls in love with a girl who is her best friend and the issues that came along with that and just growing up.  You can also discover the stories of you mom, dad, and an uncle who is deceased by things you pick up through the house. Dad getting some success as a writer and losing it. Mom seeming to be lonely and maybe having an affair. Uncle supposedly haunting the house you live in. It really makes you feel like you’re really there doing it in real life.  Almost everything in the game is interactive to deepen the immersion. Turn lights on and off, open and close drawers, and listen to music from cassette tapes you find. Find secret passages through the house to expand on the stories. Sound in the game is fantastic with the sound of rain and thunder outside while you wander around the house. I could have sworn I even heard other sounds at times which may have been a ghost.   There’s no violence or interaction with other characters, just some wonderful stories to discover all while having a nice relaxing time. Only problem I have is there’s not lots more to discover and keep me sucked into this world. So try it out when you have a few hours to spare and see if you have an experience to remember.

Her sister is supposed to be there as their parents are away but with a home in the dark, with the sister missing.... What happened? Which are the mysteries? Are you ready for the scare of your life?  Well, it's just a point and click game, visiting rooms, finding the story of your sister, the music she likes, her rebellion against the society in the nineties, her friends, her hobby....  The graphics are correct but the ambiance... I was really on my toes and watching my back, expecting a paranormal entity to get me.... until the end.  *cough* Well, I managed to scare myself for nothing anyway *cough*  The soundtrack is pretty good too. And discovering the struggling of the young woman is interesting. Because her story is still lived by millions. And that's interesting.  I think I wouldn't have enjoyed Gone Home so much if I hadn't set in my mind that something will appear out of the blue and scares me. But in your house, with nobody, with locked rooms, in the dark, what do you expect? Horrible things.  True, the game is overpriced: 20$ is perhaps a little much. So wait until there is a good deal, like today (-88%).",

            "review_text": "I lie not, there's multiple factors that influenced me to like this game. I bought it when it is on sale, so around 4$ for a 2-hour adventure; I naturally am drawn to story-heavy games, so this game's genre just fits my preference; I often relate this game to Life is Strange, which is a fantastic game influenced by Gone Home itself. So I admit that I am quite biased in my opinion.  But here's the biggest bang for the buck, in my opinion: the context. If one can relate what's happening in the story(  immigration, adolescent problems, homosexuality  ) to the society in the 1990s, one can easily see the struggles of the characters.  So in the end, I think to enjoy this game, you need to have a peculiar taste to storytelling, and a little empathy. But of course, by the time you read this, this game is gonna be back to 20$; at this point, I would recommend to just watch some let's play on youtube.",

The storyline is incredible. You're Katie. You come home from Europe to find an empty house and a letter pinned to the door from your sister saying 'Don't come find me'. This starts an immersive investigative journey through the house. It takes place in the 90s, so the VHS tapes and cassettes are there!. A lot of throwbacks to those days as well, so I would recommend being old enough to 'get' that time. The main story focuses on your sister Sam and her whereabouts. Although side-stories and plotlines involving your mother and father run concurrent to the main story as well. There are no objectives or waypoints. Progression in the game relies on human curiousity. I personally just went exploring in the house and the game subtlely guides you to the next location, you never quite feel guided but you are. Being thorough and anal in searching each rooms turns up interesting tid-bits on the occupants of the house, both past and present so search everything.   Atmospherically the game does well, it's taking place in the middle of a massive thunderstorm, so rain, thunder and lightning blanket the house, there are creaks and eerie sounds throughout, and some interesting moments with lights. Playing this at night, the atmosphere of uncertainty and the fear of basements comes into play(lights!).   All in all it was an exciting journey. I enjoyed it. It's not for people with low attention spans, and if you aren't enthralled by gameplay lacking action and gunplay, this isn't for you. But the story, and the very subtle ways you develop bonds with the characters you are trying to find makes for an emotional trip in trying to find them. You should all play this game at least once.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is an interactive exploration game that is set in 1995. You play as a girl named Kaitlin 'Katie' Greenbriar, who has just returned home from a year-trip to Europe to find her family 'missing,' and your main objective is to figure out where they've gone. You play by walking around an enormous mansion examing objects by clicking on them, which I did really enjoy. As you click on objects, you'll begin to learn more about your family and where they are. The developers did a fantastic job of recreating a nostalgic 90s era house. There are many pop-culture references throughout the game, including the X-Flies, Super Nintendo, Street Fighter, Pulf Fiction, etc. The main focal point is on your sister, Sam, and as you advance through the house, you'll learn about her rebellious attitude and where she has gone. You learn of her and her lesbian lover/girlfriend, Lonnie. It's a decent story and I was actually really excited to see how things ended with them. I won't spoil it, but I was kind of disappointed in the ending and its abrupt finish.   Before giving my review of it, I want to say that this is not a game for everyone.  After playing through Gone Home, I can honestly say, I don't see what all the hype is about. Critics praise this game for it's story and many have even gone as far as giving it the title of 'Game of the Year.' Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my playthrough of this game, but I don't believe it comes close to deserving that title. Many people complain about its length. It can be completed in roughly 2-3 hours, if you take your time and look at everything there is to see. I beat it in 1 hour and 10 minutes. I don't really have a problem with that, I did rush myself a bit. The game gives you a very eerie atmosphere. You learn of a story about your 'psycho' uncle and how his ghost is still living in the house. There's even a hidden room where Sam and Lonnie were performing a seance/exorcism. The entire time, I thought something was going to jump out at me at any moment. I was very wrong. Aside from random light flickers and lightning outside, there are no jump scares. There are no twists. I was a little disappointed by that, honestly. The house is pretty big and fun to explore. There's all kinds of secret passageways hidden behind bookcases/walls. You can definitely tell it's an indie game, just by the graphics. Not that I have a problem with that, I actually thought it looked quite nice. There's all sorts of objects to pick up and look at. One mechanic I really enjoyed was the ability to fully rotate each object to see it from every angle.  All-in-all, I did enjoy Gone Home, but I don't think it deserves all the praise it gets. It is a nice game to play and to enjoy an interesting story. Exploring the house itself and viewing all the objects was quite enjoyable. The narration is also done very well. One thing I don't really like about the game is the price tag; $20. It is nowhere near worth that. Thankfully, I was able to play it through Steam Family Sharing, so I didn't have to pay a dime. If you like interactive exlporation games such as Dear Esther or Dream, then this game is for you. If you go in expecting this to be something like Bioshock Infinite, then you're going to be hugely disappointed. It was on sale for about $3 earlier this week. If it goes on sale again, I would recommend picking it up and giving it a chance.  7/10",

Gone Home is about a girl by the name of Kaitlin Greenbriar as she arrives home from a trip in Amsterdam only to arrive home and find the house completely empty. It's up to you to find out why.   There isn't much to the gameplay per se, this, like Dear Esther, is a game you 'experience' rather than play. You go around the house picking up on clues (much like an adventure game) to progress on the story. These 'clues' are in the form of journals that you encounter through the game that explains the overall story through the eyes of Kaitlin's sister, Samantha. You do, however, have to pay close attention the cues all around the house to find out what was going on with the entire family as well in addition to Sam's story.   The game has a multitude of items that you can pick up and even view up close. The devs for the game went all out on the graphics, a lot of the items you can pick up have very minute details to them which I really enjoyed seeing as well as them looking really authentic - from books you can pick up, to memos, to notices, etc, it's all presented in fine detail bar a few minor inconsistencies here and there with some texture work, but nothing that really detracts from the authenticity of the house. At the beginning, when there's nothing lit up, you have the option of turning on all the lights on every room to track the progress you've made within the house, as well as pick up cassettes and leave em playing music while you go explore or sit and listen to them, it's also very truthful to the times it takes place in aswell, giving nods to old idols like Kurt Cobain and even games like Street Fighter 2 (This includes Mock up SNES cartridges found in the game). I was impressed how much attention to detail the devs paid to the game.   The story itself is a very sad and dreary one that deserves to be experienced atleast once. It's about very realistic issues that take place in real life and are seen pretty commonplace and it's very sad to come home from a trip to what you find out in this game.    Now the game itself, admitedly, is hard to recommend due to the fact that, yes it is, at max a 3 hour game that's honestly not worth a second playthru unless you're looking to see how authentic an experience it really is and to find every speck of detail the developers poured their heart and soul into, very much like Dear Esther. It's not a game in the traditional sense because there's no real way you can fail, and the game itself is fairly linear (you find this to do this to find this and do that, etc) it's an experience. One that I personally am willing to recommend if you enjoy games like Dear Esther, Journey, The Stanley Parable and so forth.",

Gone Home is one of the best displays we've seen of what games have the potential to be, not pretty visual effects but poignant stories as they could only be told through this medium. Not to be missed, though I'd recommend grabbing it on sale. Even for all my praise, $20 is overpricing for a game that lasts about three hours.",

            "review_text": "Combat? No. Puzzles? No. Intrigue? Yes. Interesting characters? Yes. Great story? Technically, yes.  Gone Home puts you in the shoes of Katie Greenbriar, who has at the beginning of the game freshly arrived home from a long trip across Europe. She finds her family's home empty, inhabited only by the shadows cast by furniture as well as fleeting shadows of the family whose lives have changed greatly since she last saw them. From the moment you, as Katie, step through the front door, the time spent inside the Greenbriar's home is dedicated to learning about your family, usually via picking up various little objects and observing the myriad notes and paper scraps littered about. You learn a lot about the people who live in this house just by observing the things they own, the things they created, and the things that are attached between and among each of them. Gone Home is part adventure title, part visual novel, and probably the purest method by which a video game can achieve in relaying a story to the player, without the need for traditional cutscenes or dialogue. Also very unorthodox is the story this game tells, which attempts to explore certain aspects of the human experience during significant stages of life, represented by each member of the Greenbriar family.  Gone Home is a true gem among video game stories, and it's sort of an odd ball, at least in regards to the means by which it tries to tell its story.   In regards to gameplay, it all unfolds in a fairly pedestrian pace. You look at stuff, you listen to stuff, you understand stuff. That's all there really is in terms of mechanics. In this sense, Gone Home has less going on than you average point n click adventure title, fps exploration game, or weird non-genre stuff like Ico.  It's short as well, at about 2-3 hours long. Pretty much the length of a feature film.   Don't come for the gameplay, come home for the ambiance and story. Well worth it.",

It may be criticized for it's lack of 'gameplay' (whatever that means), but it's another one of those games that sacrifices traditional puzzle gameplay for something much more organic and straight-forward, similiar to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and to a lesser extent, Dear Esther (Dear Esther however does not have much interactivity at all). It simply uses a bit of interactivity to tell a story without unnecessary filler content.   I think what's important to consider before playing this game is that: You have to play it in one sitting, and you have to pay attention to everything you encounter and read in order to reconstruct the narrative space, to understand the characters, their background and interests, to nourish empathy with these characters.   It's not exactly a game for gamers. It's something that you have to make an effort to play (granted, not much effort at all), it's not a game that will entertain you after work. It's a game that contains a heartwarming message with many underlying themes. A tad of social criticism here, a tad of 90s nostalgia there. It's something that you should play when you have nothing else to do, and are feeling particularly adventurous,   There really isn't much to say about the game, objectively. I can tell you that the graphics are just completely utilitarian, it has everything it needs to have and has a great 90's atmosphere that is likely to resonate well with anyone who grew up in the US in the 90s or even early 00's. And the game is just about 2 hours long. Which is ok, considering the price.   Definitely recommend it for anyone who is patient and remotely open minded.    ",

You play as a girl who has come home after backpacking in Europe to find her house empty, and notes and clues scattered about explaining where your sister has disappeared to. People seem to be in a huff because they were expecting some creepy horror game or something, which is not what this game is meant to be at all. It's a point and click story-heavy game about your sister and her girlfriend. The story was extremely interesting to me and it's one that you rarely hear discussed in video games, which was part of why I loved it (not to mention the awesome 90's riot grrl and pop culture references). My best advice is don't go into this game thinking it's going to be scary or that there's more to the gameplay than just picking things up and reading and looking at stuff. Expect a good, interesting story and leave it at that and you'll walk away satisfied.  Especially now with the summer sale going on and this game being up on flash sale pretty frequently, I strongly suggest buying it. But again, the game only lasts about 2 hours on your first run through, so I probably wouldn't suggest paying the full pricetag.",

Play this game more as a heritage than a new experience, since as far as 'walking simulators' go, this one is not particularly amazing. 'The Beginner's Guide' is a much better example, in my opinion.  If you're a fan of story-based games with minimal gameplay, this one'll be a treat for sure, but there are definitely beter options nowadays.  One last thing about the story, though. I have a rule where 'If a movie, book, game, etc. tells about something which I could experience myself, I won't support it' and Gone Home only barely clears the threshold.

This game is not very long, yet it tells a unique story. The game builds upon a setting and a set or circumstances that connect you to a cast of characters which you may only catch a glimpse of, yet you feel attached to them all somehow. Harnessing the creativity of the writers, this game has the power to envoke emotions which may be entirely familiar and nostalgic to you, or perhaps those which you may have never known. This is a tale of exploration and wonder. With my hair standing on end, I entered the next room to learn of its curiosity. Most of all this is a tale of love. A special kind of love that doesn't come around too often. It is innocent, yet dark and exciting. Special indeed. This game was a real treat to play. The story is not long, and may leave you wondering about a few details, however you will come away filled with a new feeling, which is very rich and satifying. I suggest this game for the ones who seek a change of pace and desire a new adventure.",

While it's game mechanic is not conventional it still has a distanct objective, interactivity and end state that is relaxing to play. Great main story and interesting side arcs which work well with the sound design and art style to make the game dripping with atmosphere and bring on the feels hard at moments.   My gripes with this game are that I feel it is a little too pricy for the gametime but as I got it on sale i'll overlook this a bit and the main lead can come off as a bit superficial but otherwise a great way to tell a story of a 90's family through exploration.

It essentially boils down to a fairly mindless 'walk forward and be bombarded by exposition' experience. While the presented story is captivating, I would have like to see this realized in a way that involves the player more and presents some actual challenges.

Little did I know how far that would expand once I'd begun playing the game, but to avoid any spoilers I'll leave it at that.   One thing to note is that the game is very, very short -- only a few hours at most and that's if you scour everything like I did. However, I prefer the feeling of wanting more than finding myself wondering when it's going to end.  -Gameplay- I enjoyed the remarkably simple and straightforward gameplay and controls. I feel as if this game was made just for me, since I'm one of those who have to explore every nook and cranny before I consider a room complete and can move onto the next one. There were a few moments where the atmosphere of the game almost transgressed to 'horror', but it was mostly due to my own over-reactive imagination and the game's superb story-telling. This is definitely a puzzle/hide-and-seek game, as there's no action whatsoever beyond you forcefully tossing objects around.  -Music- I feel like this game was a love letter in many different ways; music being only one of them. Although definitely not the music I normally find myself listening to (very punk), the soft and melodic sound playing under Sam's letters to me definitely hiked up the emotional reaction. There were also multiple music players around the house with plenty of casettes and a record to pop in and listen to. Since I was still under the impression that some crazy ♥♥♥♥ was going to pop out and kill me, I only listened to a few of them for about 30 seconds apiece before turning it off and continuing.  -Story- The story is where this game really shines through. It touches on subjects I've never encountered in a video game, and delivers them through multiple 'artifacts' in believable and easy-to-digest methods. Although I do question why some particular letters seem very out in the open, I found that when I triggered an event that prompted the vocal recording of Sam, I almost completely stopped what I was doing in the game to listen. The voice acting is superb! I also found that a lot of the school notes passed between Sam and her classmate feel as if they've actually been written by high-schoolers. I really enjoyed reading them, as they gave me a small sense of nostalgia as I recalled the notes I used to write with my friends and the weird, dumb stuff we used to talk about.",

            "review_text": "What can be said about Gone Home without giving too much away?  Basically, it's a first-person adventure ('adventure' in the terms of old point-n-click games like King's Quest or Monkey Island) that for all intents and purposes feels closer tonally and gameplay-wise to modern horror faire like Penumbra or Amnesia than anything else I can think of. You're set to explore all the nooks and crannies of your family's rather large new home, after coming back from an extensive stay abroad, in the middle of the night and when no one else is home. That's the whole premise.  It may seem like a fairly drab and uninteresting concept of a game but from the moment you begin you're enveloped in a thick robe of atmosphere, and the less I describe things beyond that, the better. To put it one way, you're going to feel a surprising range of things that will become swayed in ways you wouldn't initially expect as you explore more and more of this house and learn more about your family than most young adults may find comfortable. But it's okay, because it's a fictional character's family, not yours! ...plus, it's interesting in a way most game's narratives fail to capture -- in fact, most media I've explerienced has failed to capture -- as you get to know these characters, their stories, their personalities, their trials and their secrets through simply poking around their house. The experience is unique and fresh, and this strong character writing plus the subtle yet powerful tonal shifts throughout the game make it feel quite unlike anything I've played before, or perhaps watched, or read. It's NEAT.  There are but two complaints I have for this gem of a game; first of all, and the most obvious one, is its rather short length, only a handful of hours even if you absolutely scour every square inch like I personally love to do, and maybe as short as a couple if you're just rushing through and going through the obvious stuff. The second would be something that's a bit difficult to describe, but basically it feels like, as many interesting things as there are to find and read and listen to, it feels like there could have been *more* -- I feel that there are many stretches of emptiness or rooms/closets/sections altogether that have only one real item of any interest, too many opportunities where extermely interesting little tidbits could have been hidden in especially hard-to-find places for the truly scrutinous.. it just seems, well, not quite 'barebones' by any means but a bit.. less-flowing a cornucopia of NEAT LITTLE THINGS as I feel it could *easily* have been for some of us. But at the same time, once you've finished this game, it may make sense, in some ways, that things weren't as.. saturated as they could have been? Either way, I feel it's a valid point to bring up, if only perhaps as a grasp to justify my own good two hours or so of wastefully exploring every teensy weensy corner, move around every single object in the 3D-held-item-view mode looking for clues that weren't there or looking down every single roll of toilet paper's hole in hopes of finding some kind of mystical bauble from some fantasy world as if I were playing a game that Gone Home, decidedly, is not.  What Gone Home is, however, is a wonderful experience that, despite its brevity, is absolutely worth your time. So, like, get it n' stuff.",

When I first began the game, I was partly excited to try it out finally and worried that the massive amounts of hype would ruin my experience. Well, it lived up to my expectations. I'm not ashamed to say that I shed some tears during a few segments of the game. Sam is a very interesting character, as is Lonnie.   The game is a bit short, but it didn't overstay its welcome. As much as I would have loved to learn more about Oscar and Sam and Katie's parents (as what I did get to learn made me want to know more), I think it was right to have the content focus on Sam as Gone Home is very much her story.",

Anyway, this is a fantastic game, some may not like it, but if you love a really emotional story with a bit of a twist behind it. There is things some may find boring such as very little action, barely any except picking stuff up and listening. The game has a relaxing feel to it aswell from the stormy weather outside.

But that's not important, because as you walk through the house you are told the story in a very natural and quite subtle way. Not all is spelled out to you, but  you definitely have to have the patience to read a lot .

It makes you feel a bit like a spy (what a wonderful opportunity to satisfy your inner stalker!).  I absolutely adore Lonnie's drawings! As well as Terrance's incredibly cheesy books. But most of all i am impressed by the epical novel, dedicated to the mysteries of menstrual cycle.  The main storyline is very sweet.

The reveal piece by piece to the truth to that mystery is in itself hauting but also rewarding. And this game is just that.

That out of the way, this is story-driven exploration game with you coming home after a year away in Europe to your house being totally empty, and you simply explore it to find out why through collecting notes. Some give narration from your younger sister, a punky late-teen trying to find her place in a new school without her older sister.   This game is well made overall. The house is put together in a realistic way, the voice acting is genuinely without being cheesy, and the music is pretty good (if 90's grrrl punk is your thing). I think most people would agree on these point. The main issues of contention come from 2 things: price/time, and appeal.   Price per hour of gameplay is pretty poor, unforgivably so at full price. It takes 1.5-2 hours to play - wait for an appropriate sale for that playtime if you're interested. It'll allow for a much more genuine experience.   Appeal is more complicated. This game achieves a certain atmosphere that many simply cannot or do not wish to connect with, and that's fine.   Do you like the mid-90's? Do you like punk music? Do you like stories about high school girls learning about their values and what's important to them? Do you enjoy 'showing-not-telling' narrative style and piecing a story together yourself? Do you like teen romance? Do you like exploration games?  If you answered 'no' to many of the above, probably give this a pass. I enjoy this game, and I have a lot of affection for the story, but it isn't so good that it'll convert someone who dislikes the concepts it's built upon. That being said, for those who are exploration game fans with an interest in the mid 90's vibe and coming-of-age stories, pick this up if you see if for a good price. It's a neat story with straightforward gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Whilst people are obviously entitled to their opinions and call this game a walking simulator, I would have to firmly disagree with them on this one. Personally I really enjoyed the creepy house and the 90's settings, the way it set up a sense of foreboding that was perfectly apt in subverting expectations for the personal and moving story you eventually unravel.  My main criticism if I had to give one, would be that I wish there was more interactivity in the way you piece together the puzzle of what had happened and I appreciate that if the story didn't grab you then you may be disappointed. For me however I felt like a detective creeping around an old mansion, trying to solve the mystery of its past (much like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, as referenced in the X-Files videos found in one of the rooms). I liked the way it didn't always give you all the information, for all the stories, but just enough to read between the lines and work out the truths for yourself.  I feel that whilst the game and its story might not be for everyone, it is certainly a refreshing look at gaming. It shows us the possibilities gaming has to expand the types of themes and ideas that it can offer insight and discussion on; the rational man with gun, things go boom approach (that we all still embrace and love) can only take us so far after all. Whilst I would not want every game to be like this, I feel that we can only gain by broadening the gaming medium to try different game play styles, embrace new (more complex) themes and appeal to new audiences, as only by doing this can our hobby develop a more nuanced world view that has legitimate things to say about the world we live in and the nature of the human condition and in doing so be considered art at more than a superficial level.

            "review_text": "You come home at 1:15 AM after a year away to a new family house you do not recognize. Of the three family members you expect to see, you find none. Doors are closed and lights are off. You begin your cautious search of this alien place. Among your first pieces of evidence are journal entries from your sister: apparently, your family has moved into this town's 'psycho house.' Your mind races to dark fantasies of poltergeists and serial killers. All of the clichés apply; it is a dark and stormy night.  Gone Home gives us constant hints that, at any time, it's going to lay it on thick. However, The Fullbright Company's inaugural game is more interested in dismantling and repurposing these horror tropes than reveling in them. We expect a 'video game,' broad and sensational; what we get is an emotional drama, affecting, sensitive, and satisfying – not to mention quietly ground-breaking for the medium of video games.  Nestled within a familiar framework of extreme fiction is an intimate story focused instead on the dramatic of the everyday. You are Kaitlin Greenbriar, coming home from a year abroad to a house you find unfamiliar. Your family isn't there. Gone Home will have you asking, in the most common yet resonant sense, if they are OK.  Gone Home pushes aside the exaggerated in favor of the real. It is not a game of thrills or reflexes, but that doesn't make it any less of an engrossing story experience. You will only experience as much as you find, but that is not to say that the story is hidden away – most of your family's things and thoughts are left in plain sight, though puzzle adventure game instincts will drive you to eventually leave no corner unexplored. However, as your thoroughness uncovers more guarded secrets and insecurities, you may come to feel that your roving eyes are piling on multiple counts of casual voyeurism. You may also feel ever more unable to rein in your curiosity. The various feelings you find laid bare in each successive tidbit, from humor to heartbreak, spur you on to find the next. The stories and characters are the driving force here, falling into place in a way that is nothing short of impressive. If you think of yourself as particularly empathetic, these emotional beats might make you feel as if you were discovering your own family.  Throughout the game, you are never sure if you'll see another person in this empty house, but you will discover a full sense of the characters nevertheless. They are presences absent and missing from the house: not just 'offscreen.' You'll find your father's discarded drafts and the regular distractions he used to dispel his writer's block. You'll find your mother's attempts at artistic appreciation and creation that took her mind off of what she sees as a happy marriage becoming less so. But most of all, you'll find your sister – every aspect of her – as growing up a teenager tends to leave behind many rambling thoughts. It is clear that she questions who she is and what she's doing with her life, but amid the uncertainty is the core of a wonderful little sister who has grown a lot in the year you were away. Her mixtapes of cathartic and immediate riot grrrl singles are my absolute favorite of the family's artifacts.  Human connection comes at a premium. The disconnected lives of our average, nuclear, suburban family have led to the conception of many modern horror stories and the clichés they represent. In a medium so commonly used as a delivery system for escapist fiction, it means very much that this small game has opted instead to tell us a down-to-earth story of love and its byproducts. Gone Home is about connection over separation, and the wonderful contradiction that is extraordinary love from ordinary circumstances. One can only hope that there will be more such stories to follow.",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell:  Gone Home is an ambitious indie title, most easily characterized by its use of interactive gameplay and immersive (if not predictable) environment.  A bit of forewarning: If you are not comfortable with, and/or you do not enjoy the idea of a story-driven walking simulator, this game is guaranteed to prompt a big ol' thumbs down 4 u. Most of this game is-- reduced to its core-- walking... and looking at stuff... and walking to another place... and looking at more stuff. Sometimes, when walking, you can click on the stuff and! things happen! but there are no strict 'game play elements' to speak of... if you're one of those people who hate contemporary art or music without words, you're in for a not-treat. Me, I like walkin and clickin, so I can't say that I personally discount the experience in that respect, but I know that many people will.  So, for S and G's, let's say you're cool with all that. Let us move right into the dichotomy between the marketing of this game, and what ACTUALLY transpires.  What I perceived based on blurb and a few short spoiler-less videos:  -spoopy scary??? -mysteries -must piece together clues to solve said mysteries - ?!  What I received based on 2 hours of slow-paced and after much observational gameplay: -creepy environment -familial problems -riot grrrls -must piece together clues to ascertain said familial problems -mysteries -no solving of said mysteries  I laud this game's effort in its ability to create an in-depth and captivating 90's nostalgic mood-- a success owed to the music, scenery and repeated pop-culture references-- but this... setting, this is what really makes the foundation for your entire game, and there are a bounty of other inconsistencies in this environment that break the atmosphere. Without divulging too much, there are simply too many seemingly relevant storylines that pull you away from the main drag and back into the 50's and 60's... with little to no explanation or story progression through the varying arcs, barring the tidbits you might care enough to piece together on your own. To sum it up, this experience was like the one time I got in a cab expecting to get to my house and somehow ended with a cabdriver that took me 15 miles from my destination; neither of us knew how we got there, and no one said anything on the ride down, but both of us knew we were going the wrong way hoping the other would say something first.  Once you get past the old storyline switcheroo, the story in and of itself is endearing and captures your interest enough to effortlessly move you from room to room, collecting clues and building a deeply emotional teenage narrative. Pacing is not an issue, for what I thought would be confusing in a more-or-less open turf (you're just in one house-- but a large one, with free reign). The clues point you in the right direction, without making you feel like an absolute idiot. (Of course, if you do feel like an absolute idiot, you can always consult your map.) I can't say that I felt like I was ever mind-boggled by this short little game, but I wouldn't say it held my hand from beginning to end, either. This is a nice, easy balance for something a bit more casual and observation-based, best suited to people who like to take their time and scrutinize the most minute details of every game before they move on to the next part.  The soundtrack was pretty sweet, I personally wouldn't buy this game for its musical offerings, but I enjoyed the flavor it contributed to the plot.   I would recommend this game to: -people who like to interact heavily with their surroundings in games (a lot of detail is paid to looking closely, down to newspaper listings and full lists of ingredients on food packages) -people who appreciate the artistic approach to these types of games (unique soundtrack, personalized handwriting, and a well-delivered narrative -people who like walkin and clickin  I would not recommend this game to: -people who are looking for a long-term investment or fully-immersive experience over time. (This game is SHORT) -people who approach games with duration:money paid ratio ($19.99 is expensive for this experience, catch it on sale. I picked up my copy for 5 bucks) -people who are looking for horror or mysteries to solve  Overall-- I'd rate this game somewhere in the ballpark of 6.8-7 out of ten. Recommended, with some caveats, and definitely on sale.",

But, there are graphic novels and such on the market that people seem to love and are even LESS of a game. I don't see anyone bashing those - but whatever. Personally, I like games where you find clues that lead you to new clues and, thus, unravelling the mystery.  The game (or story) is great. Nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the 90's (references to pop culture, SNES, riot grrrl punk, etc.) But, let's get down to it. As you play, you'll realize that it's a love story. I ain't one for love stories, but this one is damn touching. I'll admit that I cried. I'm a sappy ♥♥♥♥ for certain things deep inside.  Basically, you go around the house picking up objects finding clues that lead you to the next - all for the sake of trying to find out what happened to your sister. There's no combat or anything. Just walking and picking up/moving/reading objects. If you go into this game thinking anything else, you're going to be disappointed. You have to go in knowing you're playing an interactive story.  The atmosphere is pretty great. Being alone in a huge dark house on a stormy night leaves a really earie feeling on the player. I loved it. Especially for the fact that there is litterally nothing to be afraid of. I feel that it taps into our little selves and how we used to be (or still somewhat are) afraid of the dark and being alone, say, in the basement of our house.

For me it was all about the puzzles and the story.  However, do mind that Gone Home is a pretty short game and not something you can play for days.  If you are going to play this game, have fun and try only to give up if you really don't like it.  In short terms, I enjoyed it!",

This is a wonderful love story, told entirely through the scraps of paper and journals left behind by an absent protagonist. It's a testament to how brilliantly written and brilliantly designed this game is that it elicits such powerful emotions without ever presenting you with a character to interact with. This game transcends the medium and demands serious attention be paid to it, as a landmark for the future of interactive entertainment. My only regret, after having completed it, is that it has made me question just why the hell I'm not making games exactly like this. This game is a must-play.",

The Greenbriar’s should pay me for the cleanup because all I got at the end from the developers was their credits and no special achievement or bonus unlock for the effort.  The gameplay can be anywhere from 1.5 to 3 hours long depending on how fast you decide to pace it. It’s similar to Dear Esther except you are exploring a house reading all sorts of notes that cleverly illustrates a story as you progress discovering each room. I didn’t like the hand written notes, they were a pain in the buttocks to read. I also didn’t like the 90’s punk rock music cassette tapes.  I think this game is geared towards girls in terms of target audience. I’m not sure if it’ll even click with guys that are homo, it might. But hey, it’s a big step up like going from Hanna Montana to Wrecking Ball. Overall I prefer the mature poetic-like feel of Dear Esther instead.  Gone Home runs on the Unity game engine. I reckon it was a good choice (but not the best) for what needed to be accomplished. Music and 3D models set the atmosphere more than the story imho.  I would not give this game over 90/100 like many official critics have done. I feel it’s more like a 66/100 type of game. Which according to my classic database of games played is in the same league as Need for Speed: Undercover, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy.",

It's worth it to reserve 2 hours and turn off all distractions while you experience this game. We pay upwards of $10 for a movie ticket these days, I'd say an interesting movie-length game is worth the current 50% off price of $9.99, especially if it encourages more content that is longer from this developer.  The most important thing about this game is that it demands you care about its characters and piece together their stories from the objects you find. You have to be willing to stop and read. There is definitely some fun to be had exploring this game and listening to the story, more fun than I had with Dear Esther (at least in this game you can inspect objects in the environment like Amnesia, this is far better than Dear Esther which I only played because of a Humble Bundle, although Dear Esther certainly wasn't bad).  As for the story, I got sucked in right away. I have a sister, I grew up in the 90s, and I even studied abroad for several months. So it was easy to put myself in the shoes of the girl arriving home to a creepy empty house. At the end there's a message in the game I wasn't expecting, but I liked the emotional impact of it all. I applaud the developers for taking this risk in both the direction of the storyline and the gameplay, and I hope we see more from them soon.  Now, if you don't like story-driven games, you're going to have a bad time. The gameplay involves exploring, inspecting, reading and listening. I'm sure there are details that I missed so I would probably play it again, and perhaps even a third time to listen to the Developer Commentary, but it's not heavy on the replayability (your playthrough will probably only last 90 minutes or so).   Granted, I bought this game for $6 and I might not have felt as positive about it if I had paid $20. But I'm sure the price will go down or it will end up on a Humble Bundle at some point, so it's definitely worth adding to your wishlist for later play.  In short, if you like exploration and an intriguing story, you will like this. If you have a sibling, and/or you grew up in the 90s, you will appreciate the nostalgia of it all. And if you want to play a game that has good emotional impact and a unique story, all without a lot of time investment, you'll like Gone Home.",

This is a walking simulator rich in story and very real characters even though you don't actually ever get to see them.   The story is absolutely supurb and if you are considering purchasing this, it should be purely for the story. It's rare to find a game that is so human and so believable. The great voice acting used through journal logs, as well as the notes found all around the house make up a well rounded story that doesn't hold your hand.   This is a game without the game. A subgenre in gaming that isn't for everyone.

Of course the gameplay is nothing except walk around and mess around with ♥♥♥♥ you pick up, so yeah you could say there is no actual gameplay here, but even then as a naturally curious person I figured why not I'll keep going despit the controls being fairly crap. Now somewhat spoilers here (and by here I mean littered in this and the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid that skip as you feel necessary), I would say they do an interesting job of covering sams story, but I would have liked if they extended the 'game' with maybe getting some closure on the mothers infidelity or an actual story really covering it, or going through the fathers story of a failing author, or even the story about oscar or whatever his name was. Hell, I would have taken a story on sams childhood friend whose name escapes me, I mean sure 2 hours with clunky controls and not so good performance on my crap machine is plenty, but I was just getting interested in the rest of the family and really trying to see how they are and how they think or feel in this matter.   Really I just see this as a non-game with a cutesy story about young love at this point, and that is okay, it isn't the worst game out there and far from the best for sure, but it has it's merits, the spooky atmosphere really doesn't help, I mean I got jumpscared by a chair at one point cause the door opened funny and it was dark and I peeked part of it off the corner of my screen, and don't get me started on how creepy those secret passeges are or even the damn basement, and speaking about everywhere in the damn house, given how much of sams secret notes and ♥♥♥♥ were left strewn about the house I'm surprised her parents didn't know she was batting for the other team, hell she even mentions how it should have been obvious to them at one point.  In any case I found this 'game' surprisingly enjoyable despite all the negative reviews, It's not the best thing I've played but it's very far from the worst thing, that title stays with 'One Day for Ched'.   I will say this game is nowhere near worth full price but I still reccomend you give it a try some time, you might find parts compelling, or get spooked by a chair, really it's up to you in the end, I mean I played it like I came home and my house was in shambles I basically went around cleaning up and turning off lights to save power, but of course that makes no sense and really just sets me up to spook myself cause you end up doubling back here and there, so popping up in a pitch black hallway is not the best thing.  If you couldn't bother reading all that, well to sum up,   it's an alright 'game', give it a shot if you're interested and find it reduced in price by a lot.  Overall: 6/10",

This is not a videogame for videogamers. It is something greater, albeit much simpler: a cozy, awkward self-discovery.  Sarah Grayson's performance as Sam's voice is so good it could make the whole thing work as an audiobook. Did you read 'Catcher in the Rye' and felt you totally got a teenager's world in 1940's New York? 'Gone Home' does that on — no kidding — the same level. Man, I'm a 20-year-old dude that grew in Brazil and they had me completely invested in 1990's Oregon-US girlhood — how big an accomplishment can that be?   I agree my investment (emotional as well) is also due to you, the player, being the one piecing clues together. Some well-placed clues, I must add. Expect zero spoon-fed information and get used to working as in the following: Bookmark inscription + Concert tickets = Affair. I see why this game can be classified as a mystery...   As the homecoming Kaitlin, you are indeed playing a detective. But instead of uncovering a muder, you discover your father's cult-followed work, your mother's frustation, and, at the core of all, your sister's candid, amusing and touching coming-of-age story. With that in a weirdly tense atmosphere, I confess me some subtle changes in pulse rate, throughout the board.  You know what?

There are no characters to see, they don't exist in a physical sense, but you will be immersed in a world that is so very vivid, one fleshed out for you by small notes, cassette tapes, and Sam's commentary. I got wrapped up into Sam's story, into her life and her love, her struggles and her successes, and the ways I found myself relating to her. You won't regret becoming invested in her.  The atmosphere of this game screams 'survival horror' in a sense. Massive, old house with secret passages, a house that is vaguely implied to be the scene of some sort of horrific occurrence; exploring, alone, on a dark, violent stormy night. In fact, I was worried most of the game of some sort of cheap jump scare, a ghost or a bloody scene, but it never came. That's, of course, not the point of the story, but my exploration was punctuated by the tenseness I felt, and the quiet, unsure fear of what each room held. There's something to be said about a game that creates an intense atmosphere, fills the world with details (labelled videotapes and Super Nintendo games? Nostalgia) and tiny things to discover, and just...lets you roam free.   Let's just say, for the second hour of the game, I was near tears. By the end of the game, I was crying. This game constricted itself around my heart in a way no other game ever has, especially one this short. It actively blurs the lines of narrative, of the ways to tell a story, and it succeeds - many games have, but this one holds a place for me because of the simplicity of the story and the masterful execution of telling it.

Sound is where this title shines. Nice suiting music coupled with superb voice-acting bring the main protagonist to life in a very believable and emotive way.  Graphics are nice, boosting a good work in textures but -unfortunately- they don't always seem to blend properly. Occasionally proportions looked off to me, specially at default FOV. The 90's theme the game is set is very well done, so expect some nostalgia. Gameplay wise, there are some annoyances which forced me to disable some options in favour of immersion.  Its weakest point, as already stated by many, is its price tag. We have seen similar products with much more duration and replay value for much less. With almost no replayability, $20 is simply too much. In-game developer commentary has been added, but due to quality issues I wasn't too kin on listening to all of them.

Never did I expect a few hours exploring an empty house to turn into the raw, emotional and utterly breathtaking experience.

It is about exploring the home of a family and gleaning a very realistic and personal understanding of the various members of that family: who they are, what they love, what problems they are facing. No, there are no monsters to fight in it. Yes, if you want to finish it as fast as you can, you could probably get to the end in 20 minutes on your first try and get absolutely nothing out of it. This is not a game about running through as fast as you can. If you enjoy taking your time and examining rich environments in depth, then you will enjoy this game. If an emotive, personal, and down-to-earth story sounds appealing to you, than you will probably enjoy this game also.  I finished the game in about an hour and a half. Yes, it is short, and no, it has no replay value. Once you've heard the story, found all the hidden crannies, read all the papers, and thrown all the toilet paper on the floor, that's really about it. However, I am hesitant to say that it doesn't have much CONTENT. It has a lot of content; each scene is packed with tons of detail, and brings the never-on-screen characters to life to an incredible degree. The writing and voice acting is all also quite good.  I've been reading a lot of really good, detailed negative reviews of this game, and I want to say that many of those people have really good points! I agree that the game seems to go out of it's way to include creepy elements that tease you into expecting it to turn horror at any moment, but then that never goes anywhere. I think this is a symptom of the game's biggest flaw, which is a lack of unity (also maybe a tad bit of misleading advertising). While it includes lots of rich detail, several elements of the story start to feel incidental by the end, when you start to realize they're not all going to tie together after all.  However, at the end of the day, I think this game was emotive and believable, and it told it's story elegantly and eloquently. I would recommend it, although I would not say the game is for everyone. -- 7/10",

Discovery is the gameplay, much as it is part of Resident Evil. Uncovering the mysteries is the gameplay, as seen in everything from Myst to Bioshock to Heavy Rain.

The brilliant music and voice-acting complement this nostalgic joyride wonderfully, and I believe it makes a strong argument in favor of videogames being the superior mode of story-telling. The pace at which information is revealed to you allows for plenty of time to ponder the many mysteries of the plotline and form your own theories while searching for the next clue. When reading a book or watching a movie, such contemplation is best achieved by interruption (i.e. setting down the book or pausing the movie,) but this is not necessary when enjoying this medium of interactive narrative. If you are homophobic, I suppose the storyline would put you off a bit, but personally, this game resonated beautifully with my soul, simple though it may be.

I probably wouldn't buy this at full price because of how short it is but it is a good game and well worth the time and money if it happens to be on sale. There are no puzzles or combat in the game. The only goal is searching for clues about the lives of the mother, father, sister, and great uncle of the protagonist. It's a light mystery about a teen romance and a troubled marriage. While there are a few times when the player may be startled by thunder or power outages it's definitely not a horror game. It's a story driven game about people and how they change over time.   The largest part of the story is about Sam, the protagonist's sister, discovering herself and coming into her own. Which wouldn't be half so compelling if the romance in the game was a conventional one. The writers did a lot of things right with the romance. They gave the characters time to develop as friends so they had chemistry and put a little twist on things which made it more interesting. Over all the story is well written.  Most of the story is communicated through text documents found throughout the game many of which are private things written by the protagonist's family. This gives the story an intimately personal air. It's wrong, and rude, and awkward to be going through someone else's things but at the same time it brings the player closer to them because the player is learning about their lives and what matters to them. Because the story is communicated largely through text there is a lot of reading. Fortunately, there is a feature which can be switched on and off that puts easy to read bold text over documents. For anyone who is dyslexic, can't read cursive, doesn't have the best eyesight, or is just not good with hand writing this could be very helpful. This feature does have a tendency to glitch out after a while but restarting the game seems to fix it.  This game does push a lot of nostalgia buttons for the 90s but also just for being a kid which probably doesn't changed much. For the right audience this can be a very compelling game like it was for me but that's not going to be the case for everyone. It's not a must play, its audience is too narrow for that, but if it sparks you interest it's worth a try.

No zombies, no horror, no parapsychological, no hero's journey, no fantasy, scifi or aliens. Just a story of humans, told in a convincing, non-pretentious way.  You really have to take a quiet evening to enjoy this game. It hardly develops its story in hurry. It's not for the average gamer expecting to be entertained or logically challenged. Are you a sorta voyeuristic discoverer? Do you like to go through other people's stuff? Do you enjoy drama novels? Do you have a quirk for the 90ies? Is reading several pages of various style no problem for you? Are you a girl? If you can answer several of those questions with 'yes', you might like this game.  Then again: Is it worth 20 bucks? No. It's seriously too short to be priced that way. Is it the revelation the critics make it? No either. It's a well crafted story experience, not more.

At first the game had me questioning as to what genere this game was going to be but as I uncovered more and more I just aimed to try and find out what was going on. The story is this game is something close to a work of art. I dont think I have ever been touched this way in terms of how a Game interacts with the individual.   I found that this game got the story line down to every correct letter and im surprised that we havent had something as powerfull as this before. If people are contemplating getting this Game i would recommend you to get in a hearbeat if you find overwhelming storylines your thing. Theres no action jut some good old investigation work that is required throughout. I mean as i got to the end of this game I my mind had started to peice together this relavtivly simple but powerfull story. I wanted to run to where I needed to go just to hope is was not as i thought it to be.   After all this I would recommend this Game 10/10 I do hope these indie dev's do make another one.",

The exploration mechanics are neat (would love to see the same thing in a larger project) and there's been a lot of detail put into the house and subtle little jokes thrown in that I giggled at. There's not so much of a story unfolding in the game, you're just unraveling details about what has happened previously. It's cute at times and quite serious also. I think the game handles the topic very well and makes it seem realistic or at least believable.   Puzzles... are dreadfully easy. If you can call them that. It's really just looking through drawers and stuff finding codes and clues. Seeing how short the game is (I think I was quite thorough in my reading of the back of chips packages and still only clocked in 1,5 hours) this really isn't something you should get this game for. It tells a story and does so pretty well, but it offers little else. Replay value is pretty close to zero, but there is dev commentary and some other minor options to change.  But then there is the issue of pricing which a lot of other people have brought up. I picked this game up in a bundle with other games for a price I can't remember - but had I picked this up for the 20€ the steam store is asking for I would have been horribly disappointed. I would again stress that I don't find the game really bad in any aspect, but in the grand scheme of things the attention to detail doesn't excuse the poor length and lack of replay value. I don't want to spoil things for anyone else, but I enjoyed the game the most early on when you didn't know what to expect from it. Looking back... it's ok.  So to sum up, great exploration with much detail put into even small objects. Super short. Great atmosphere, but doesn't do much with it. Probably horribly disappointing if you were expecting more of a... well, game.   I really wish you could do neutral reviews on steam.",

            "review_text": "It's been over 15 hours since I finished Gone Home, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.  Gone Home is a small indie title published earlier this year by the Fullbright Company, but no-one has really discovered it until about a week ago. That's when everyone started buying it, playing it, and loving it.  But, firstly, let me talk about the fact that you either love this game, or you hate it. It all depends on what kind of person you are. If you are one of those guys who religiously plays Call of Duty for ten hours every single day, and only thinks a game is good if it has blood, explosions and swearing, and sex; you probably won't enjoy this game. At all. People like these can be described as 'Action Junkies'. Now, I'm not saying that all Call of Duty players are Action Junkies; not at all. But, there are some of those people out there, and the majority of them do play Call of Duty. However, I'm going to call these people Action Junkies simply because most of them don't appreciate games that don't focus on killing ♥♥♥♥, but focus on telling a more emotional story, or focus on telling a story that's designed to make the player think.   All of the Action Junkies can stop reading right now, because Gone Home has none of that. It has no gore, no blood, no shooting, swearing, explosions, ect, but It's still one of my favorite games of this year. Let me explain why.  Gone Home is a beautiful indie game that has conveyed the most believable and incredible emotional experience I have ever had. It blends story with design in a way that I simply can't describe. It tells a story that feels real, and true. And it all takes place in a little house for about two hours.  In Gone Home, you play a young college girl called Katie who has returned home after a year abroad. However, your family has moved while you were away, and you find yourself in a brand new house. However, when you arrive, the house is empty, and riddled with clues and secrets to uncover. This is genius. Because your Katie's family has moved, Katie has never been in this house before, and the character that you're playing is just as unfamiliar with the house as the player. But, even if you're unfamiliar with the house, you're still familiar with the characters, and you still feel part of the story, because you are the other main character's sister.  As gamers, we have these instincts and assumptions about games that we don't even realize. Gone Home takes all that and flips it upside-down. For example, near the beginning of the game, you walk down a dark corridor. Bam. I instantly thought that something was going to leap out at me from the shadows... But it never did. This game is NOT a horror game. However, it still has this keen sense of nervousness and uncomfort to it. Just the feeling of walking around a house, at night, while a storm rages outside, when no-one else is home, kept me on the edge the entire way through the game, especially when I had headphones on. Gone Home also places brilliant hints to scenarios, and you instantly suspect things are something they're not. For example, you eventually come across a bathtub stained with blood. However, as you explore the room a little more, you find out that it's actually not blood, but red hair dye. That then triggers an audio diary that explains the situation. It's a great way to tell a story, and I fear that it's some thing that we, as gamers, are seeing less and less of these days.  As you walk through the house, you find secrets and pick up clues (Key story clues/secrets are accompanied by brilliant audio diarys). And as everything starts to add up, as everything starts to piece together, and as you start to understand what happenned in that house, you finally understand what an amazing and beautiful story has taken place while you were gone, and you finally understand what a brilliant design feat that this game is.  If you ever get the chance to play Gone Home, trust me. Do it. You'll come out of it with a completely different mindset and outlook on life, and you won't get it's beautiful story out of your head for weeks. Playing Gone Home is like watching the most sad/tragic/emotional/uplifting movie ever made, but you're part of it. You are in the same place, where the other characters once were, discovering everything that has taken place in that little house.  I just hope that when people play Gone Home, they play it with the right mindset and attitude. Like I said, If you play it with an attitude of an Action Junkie, you probably won't even spend the time to finish the game. But if you jump into Gone Home ready for a great story, great design, and a great game, you won't be disappointed.  10/10.     - Chris Walsh.",

Aside from offering the ability to stack and unstack household objects for literally hours, the game does provide a realistic, moderately gripping love story revealed by, obviously, displacing more objects.   The voice acting is believable and definitely an integral strength, and the inclusion of playable feminist punk tapes throughout the home gives the game some needed spice. Additionally, both Sam and Lonnie are likable characters with a tendency to be cute and clever in their notes to each other.   Despite the enjoyment I derived from playing this, I wouldn't recommend paying full price.

In some ways it is similar to Dear Esther where the objective is simply to explore and let the story unfold through the environment. But where as Dear Esther gave the player an entire island filled with large outdoor areas and caves, Gone Home's explorable area is a single house. It's a very large and unoccupied house (it's a mansion in fact) and each room is filled with objects that can be picked up and examined, many of which will give you insight into the those who live in the house and some will tell further parts of the story.  The game has somewhat of a creepy atmosphere simply because you're exploring an empty house at night in the middle of a thunderstorm, but it's not a horror game. There are no monsters or ghosts of monster closet scares. It's just you, the house an the countless objects inside. There is a genuine appeal about this game and exploring the ins and out of the house. And if you remember being alive in 1995 there is some nostalgia to some of the objects and writings contained within. The actual story of the game is admittedly very appealing and sincere.  The major downfall of this game is that the experience is really short. If you rush through the game you can complete it very quickly and even if you take your time the experience may seem over before you know it. This is made especially so because there is no puzzle solving. So while I really enjoyed playing Gone Home, I cannot really justify buying the game at its base price.

While I heard plenty of good press about the game (which isn't really a surprise... most games get good reviews nowadays) I heard bad criticism over and over about the game from individuals all over the internet. 'Gone Home isn't a game. Stupid artsy crap. etc. etc.'   And those individuals have a point. The game is artsy. Honestly, it isn't really much of a game at all. There aren't any real puzzles or gameplay, and the game is fairly linear. While you can explore all of the different rooms, there is a clear progression and path that you 'should' follow to finish the game.  The game is also very, very short. I completed it in about an hour and a half. But this isn't a negative. The game is as long as it needs to be. The player learns the story, gets to explore the house, and wraps up the plot before the game gets tiring.  I loved this game. I'm a sucker for a good story and this game delivered. If you're looking for a short but immersive and calming experience you should buy this game. 5/5.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home, an adventure game that the critics love due to one clever trick. You play the older sister of a teen girl who's just fallen in love, and you arrive home after a year abroad to an empty house. You point and click to read notes and examine objects to find out what's going on. As you play a GIRL who is looking out for HER SISTER and the game's plot is PITCHED AT FEMALES, you can't possibly criticise or badmouth this game without looking like a MISOGYNIST. That's the game's clever trick.  It's set in the mid 90's, a time of teen angst and grungy music. So instantly it appeals to us old folk, who grew up in the 90's and are up for a bit of nostalgia. And it's appealing to teens today who can relate to the themes of love, misfits and rebellion. However it somehow manages to be both banal and overly dramatic, like a cheesy 90's show... so you never really do engage. Just more overwrought stuff that happens to somebody else.  The story is well written and well told, and it does hit impressive highs, but the game as a whole isn't all that. If you liked the art of storytelling in 'To The Moon', the slice-of-life world building of 'Photopia' by Adam Cadre, or the whole games-as-art tightness of 'Braid', then you'll like this. It's not as good as any of those games however. And it's over in 2 hours. But they're worthwhile hours.  Recommendation: buy, but only with a hefty discount, 'cos 2 hours man.  N.B. I picked up Gone Home the same night as Sniper Elite V2. One a slow methodical game of even pacing broken up by unimaginable Nazi gore and violence. The other was Sniper Elite V2.",

Thankfully I took the plunge, because this is one of the best. The story really grabbed me and moved me, I felt so involved in it. Also I was super excited to keep finding tapes I could play with songs by Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy as I love both of those bands and I had no idea they were in it.

The game is very short, i finished it in 3 hours and I was running around, picking every item I saw, reading everything, getting to know the characters on the way, but nothing happened with most of this information at the end.  However, I decided I would recommend the game because even though I expected more, It was an interesting, different game, not something you play everyday. Being part of the story unfolding in front of you is special, and at the end, though it could have been much more than it was, I still felt some connection to the characters and I was glad to be part of their lives, even for only couple of hours. I think that for a game that is very short, if you want to try something different, do so, but wait for the game to be on sale first.",

It seems like the setup for a horror story--and in some ways, it is--but Gone Home is deeper than that, forming a connection between the player and their virtual persona that I haven't seen equaled.  You see, when Kate returns home there is nobody to greet her. The door is locked. The lights flicker amidst a storm, haunting messages are balled up and tossed into wastebaskets; mixtapes are lying in boxes; meaningful correspondence is hidden in sock drawers--the house in Gone Home is full of secrets. In uncovering those truths the player--and through them, Kate--will discover just how much can change in people's lives over the course of a year.  Gone Home is not for everyone. But for those who can brave the uncertainty and heartache, it's well worth the journey.",

If you like exploration games and a decent story, this is a nice peek into a believable family.

The plot is somehwat predictable; you'll probably figure out the mid-game twist fairly quickly, and once you do, there won't be much left to surprise. However, there is a lot of great background details that are easy to miss and shed new light on characters you might have otherwise thought were unimportant. If nothing else, it's nice to see a game dealing with subject matter that many are still afraid to deal with.",

There is a constant storm going on that lends to the atmoshere with the house creaking and occasional music to compliment it. Listening to the cassette tapes while reading the journals gives you a sense that we all had growing up trying to figure everything out. With her voice acting the journals they give it that emotional weight and help illustrate her growing feelings and how she is dealing with them. It's all about searching for clues for what happened to her. Looking through each room as you progress through is very satisfying if you read and listen to everything. Definetly a headphones kind of game. You find keys and combinations to cabinets and lockers but it's never really to difficult. I like this because the story and atmosphere are front and center here and having it be to hard would take away from it I think. After all of the journals and newspaper clippings and receipts etc. In around 2 hours I think. Not sure I was to into the game to be timing myself. It unfolds an ending that leaves no loose ends and made it a very well spent couple hours or so.",

The creators do a good job of including items and pop culture that are true to the time period (Such as the Nintendo/Super Nintendo references). All of the small details make the exploration that much more enjoyable.   The only true gripe I have with the game was how short it was for the suggested price. The game only took me under 2 hours to complete (though I enjoyed every minute of it). For the asking price of $19.99 the game might seem too steep for some who enjoy getting multiple hours out of their purchase. Luckily, for myself, I got this game during the Autumn Sale for only $4.99 and with that price the game was well worth it.

First, I have to ask... why are there people hating on this game? Do they have some beef against it that I completely missed?  In Gone Home, you play as Katie, a girl who's returned home from her trip around the world, only to find the house seemingly abandoned, and left with (voiced) entries from her sister Sam's diary to piece together a story about Sam and her relationship with her friend, Lanna.  Admittidly, it is a little short (You can get from start to finish in one sitting), but I don't care. I love it.  EDIT: Perhaps the biggest problem here is that the story is Gone Home's only draw. If you already know the whole story going in, then you've pretty much just wasted $20.  FUN FACT: I'm actually part of a Game Design program in college, and one of our assignments was to play through this game. The only problem I had? I got around to playing this game only a few... months... late.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a relatively short narrative game where you play as Kaitlin Greenbriar, who returns home after a trip throughout Europe. Upon arriving, you see a note from your younger sister taped to the front door telling you not to go digging around for answers and that she'll see you again someday. Upon entering the house, it appears that nobody is home and you begin your journey to uncover what happened while you were away.  What really got me first in this game is the atmosphere. It's not a horror game but it certainly can feel that way sometimes with the thunderstorm booming outside, the darkness that envelopes entire rooms, and the creaking of an old house settling. The unease as you explore the mystery surrounding your family works well in tandem with the overall story. As you progress along, you'll turn on lights to combat the darkness and both figuratively and literally, shine light on the mystery your pursuing.  The story in Gone Home is certainly one that I think many of us can relate to on several different levels. Almost everyone has gone through the turbulent, confusing, and emotional teenage years and regardless of your age, I believe those memories still resonate with people on some level or another. I think that is where the charm of this story truly comes to fruition as you navigate through your sisters personal thoughts and conflicts; the innate understanding of what being a teenager entails. While your sisters' story is the main driving plot, there are other stories to be discovered not only about yourself, but your parents as well. All of this combined makes for a very compelling fictionalized family.  Gone Home takes place is the mid 90's and the recreation of common household items are calls back to that era, with CRT TV's, VHS cassette tapes, audio cassettes, etc. I was amazed by how authentic I felt this place to be and the little details placed throughout certainly drives that point home. The random notes, pictures, print-outs, etc also feel very authentic and further develop the idea that you're in a real place inhabited by real people.  Personally, I recommend this game to anyone curious. It may be short, but the authenticity of its characters and world is incredible. For me it was somewhat of an emotional roller-coaster as you discover what has happened to your family and compelled me to pick it up again after several months to experience it once more. The second time through, knowing the story, I opted to enable the commentary which gives you insight into the creation and ideology behind the game. ",

I’m going to summarize it without spoiling anything. You start out by listening to your character leaving a message to her mom saying she’s coming home from her trip. The thing is, when you arrive it’s around 12AM. Nobody is home, so you have to find out what happened by finding clues and journals that your sister Sam leaves for you. As you go along is like you’re unraveling a story about your sister Sam and what has been going on in the family while you were gone.  The thing is that the game has a very creepy atmosphere so you expect something to jump out at you at any second, but it doesn’t. The setting really adds to the mystery of the whole thing. I personally love games that has an interesting story to it. If you are the type of person that loves action games and is looking for a good scare this game is not for you. If you’re a person looking for a game that has a sentimental story and with a bit of mystery than here’s your game. So if I were to Rate this game based on 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest I rate this game a 3 ½ stars. My reason for the rating is that I believe it was too quick to beat and it really had potential for more. So if you have a free day and would like to play a story game then I suggest adding this game to your library.  Have any more game suggestions? Know about a game that is so great that you have to yell it to world? Hit me up and I’ll play it.",

            "review_text": "Summary: It is a strange, sad, happy game and you have to be open to new things in order to enjoy the experience.  First off:  I bought the game cheap and under the impression that it was horror, which it is not, at least in the traditional sense. After I learned that it was not a survival horror game (10 seconds internet research), I started it again, this time not defaulting to the 'Scared Victim' style of playing, instead playing the role I was intended to play, that of a teenager coming home.  Story: Without spoiling the game, it is a very nice story. in the end I was emotionally exhausted and thought to myself 'totally worth it.' while rather short it made that up in intensity. Soaps are usually extremely dense in story development, the same goes for movies. In the game you experience one year worth of family drama in about 4 hours. The events are not Soap dense as in 'more stuff happens' but more 'let's ignore the unimportant stuff', even though the story itself is only about 2 hours i would guess (in game) long, you experience all the things that happened to your family in the last year.  It feels not like a soap because the events in the game did play out over a long time, you just get the abrdged version.  Gameplay (Played on Linux laptop): It is your regular first person experience, walking picking stuff up, interacting nothing new to which I can point and say 'that'. The graphics I can't really judge, because i had to turn the quality all the way down and it still wasn't smooth. Audio was great quality, i liked that it was only ambient noise, no music, unless it made sense (you turned something on). Playing it immersive is and advice as close to a 'must do' as I can give without being part of the creation team and immersive doesn't mean 'headphones and emulate lighting levels of game'. I mean willingness to play the part of someone who was gone a year and finds an empty home. Not with friends not let's playing it or watching a let's play. Immersive does not mean ambient lighting and super hedphones, immersive is becoming the character in mind. I still recommend headphones and a dark room, though.  Rant: So many people say this game is 'deep' and I would tell them in their face 'No, other games are just shallow' A game is usually described as deep the second characters become humans. When a game charakter says 'let's poke things with sticks because yay!' noone bats an eye, when in a game strangers approach you and ask you to join their adventure the answer 'Yes' because that is expected from the player. But when someone approaches you in real live holds out their hand and says 'The world is great and interesting, take my hand and we will see it together.' many think 'what is wrong with that guy?' (Some said that to my face) Why is that? Because making adventures for humans is hard, for characters it is not. I am a gamemaster and I know the problems one has when trying to create a world that breathes, so I blame noone for taking the 'easy route', because sometimes you have to do that to create a fun experience. A 'deep' game is one where you have to think for yourself. Where the way is not that straightforward, where the answer is not what is expected. Being 'deep' is being human. And being human is hard, many play games to stop being humans, in a sense. But sometimes we want to be someone else, not just a hero, and that is when deep is what you want.  *ATTENTION HERE THERE BE FOLLOWING MINOR MASSIVE SPOILERS*  As you have read above I said minor massive, if you read on because of that, I meant, what I talk about is only a minor thing that is easily, early deduced when you are in the right mindset, but if you know it before playing the game, it might ruin your experience. Now that I utterly failed at making it clear that you shouldn't continue if you ever plan to play this game, by setting you in that mindset, I give the warning again, the remainder of the post is spoiler heavy, read it after you played it. or at your own risk  last chance to not get spoiled.  okay, here I go.  Coming of Age: The journal entries show you the story of what Sam goes through after meeting Lonnie and falling in love with her. Her whole journey down Parents disapproval lane. Many people go through something like that and mostly because of reasons beyond their own power. The way people turn out is because of 50% nurture, 50% nature. Things like diseases, gender and sexuality, some of the more common parent hate things, are nature and thus out of parents control, but militant, demanding or very tradition bound people don't care, whatever they are so obsessed about is more important than the child to them. Something similar goes for Sams father, who authored two books, his father (Sam's granddad) sending him a 'You Suck' letter after reading them.  The game itself helps experiencing such a feeling of unwantedness without the fallout. If you are something your parents don't wan't you to be, is it being the wrong gender, sexuality or having an illness, mental or physical, having or learning a profession your parents disapprove of, changing your religion or stopping with religion alltogether, you might have experienced what sam had gone through and it hits to close to home for comfort. If not, see this as a learning experience. Be open to other people Be open to new ideas and maybe humanity will be a little less hatefull and more loving",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is, first and foremost, different to any other game I've played before. In fact, it's debatable over whether or not it classifies as a game. While most games have a central mechanic (shooters have blowing stuff up and killing people, AsCreed has stabbing people, puzzle games have... puzzles) Gone Home's central mechanic is picking things up and looking at them. I know, thrilling. Strangley, though, it is one of the best games I've played in a long time.  You are Kaitlin Greenbriar, who's just back from her year of galavanting around Europe (because that's what all Americans do, right?), and during her time abroad her family moved house. She comes home to this new house, but there's nobody around - just this note on the door saying that your sister, Sam, is sorry that she can't meet you. Then your aim is to wander about the house, trying to work out what happened to your family.  It is basically interactive storytelling, with the game being you walking around the house examining things that sometimes give you more glimpses into the story of what happened. The story is not about Kaitlin, though, it is about her teenage sister Sam. And the story is incredibly human, and real. Sometimes, when you pick up certain items, you hear Sam talking to you via journals that she left for Kaitlin. The voice acting is absolutely superb, and I found myself constantly trying to find the next document because I was so enraptured by the story. It mostly involves Sam's relationship with her friend Lonnie, and also the emotional stresses of her age.  You can get incredibly attached to the characters, despite never seeing them, and I was so involved with the family that by the end I was almost in tears. Sam's struggle is just so... I don't know how to put it, but it really speaks to the player (a lot of this is because of the voice acting).  Gone Home has it's serious moments, especially when Lonnie is involved. However, this is not all it has to offer - it's not simply a story about teen angst. It has it's funny moments, with a lot of the bits of paper you find involving funny drawings; or the hidden stack of, erm, gentleman magazines in the dad's study. It has a slightly creepy gothic undertone to it as well, what with the storm outside and the flickering lights. Not to mention how Uncle Albert's ghost (supposedly) still walks the halls...  A lot of people seemed annoyed that Gone Home has those horror element to it but nothing else is in the house with you, but I liked this. In real life when you're alone in a house and it's stormy outside you tend to feel scared, even though you know there's nothing there. It's the same with Gone Home, and it just makes it feel even more real.  The house is incredibly realistic, with amazing attention to detail. It genuinely seems like you're in a real house. The graphics are nice too, with only a few textures looking rough up close.  Of course, whether or not you like Gone Home depends on what kind of gamer you are. I tend to enjoy games that are slower-paced and more story-centric, but if you only care about fun, fast-paced gameplay, then Gone Home is not going to go down well.  Another downside is the price. Considering that it only took me three hours to finish, bearing in mind that I searched the entire house and read everything that could be read, it is wildly overpriced at £15. I actually got it in a Humble Bundle, so it averaged at only about 80 pence! If, during a sale, it comes down to £5 or below, I thoroughly recommend buying it.",

            "review_text": "This is another one of those games that is probably not for the typical gamer. Gone Home is very much a story driven game. There's no actual gameplay other than wandering through an empty house, and progressing the story through 'audio log' type events. One question a lot of people ask is 'Is this game scary?' Well...sort of. Gone Home is definately not a survival horror game, but it manages to establish a good amount of suspence. Your in an empty house while it's storming outside, and you're trying to find out what happened to your family. Oh and the house is hinted to be haunted, but like I said it's only hinted. The only supernatural thing in the game is the light turning off by itself when I was trying to look at something.  I can't give away too much of the story because it's so great. But I'll give you the gist of it. You play as a girl who comes home after a year studying abroad, only instead of her family waiting there for her to greet her with open arms, they're no where to be found in the house. As you progress through the house you uncover a story narrated by your sister, revealing everything that happened in the year you've been gone. The story is really good, but really sad. The ending is especially bitter-sweet. This game is a great example of storytelling at it's best.  Like I said this game is not what people would consider a 'normal' game, in fact there are several discusions on the community forum for this game on whether or not it is in fact a 'game.' Well I think it is a game, and a damn good one at that. It's all about how broad your spectrum is.  If you're expecting a lengthy game with in depth gameplay you're going to be disappointed. I almost forgot to mention this game is only about two hours long. But if you're just expecting a short little gem with excellent storytelling. But personally I think it's worth at least one playthrough. But to be fair as much as I've praised this game, it's not worth it's regular $20 price tag. If your interested get it at, at most, $10. Just make sure you know what you're buying. Like I said it's a good game, but not everyone will be able to appreciate it.",

Although the story itself does not particularly suit me ,like a lot of other guys here , I still liked cause it is delivered fantastically. You slowly get to know all of the characters. Their emotions ,feelings, what drives them, social background and thoughts are revealed as if you were meeting and getting to know a real person. As far as a video game can. And that is the point, why I personally like and recommend this game, It is showing how a video game can create real emotions. This game can and will get you to a point of emotional connection to the characters, if you let it. I would love to see such a depth and creativity in storytelling in every other game (with storys even a 21 year old guy can immerge into ,cause !!!!SPOILER!!! a lesbian teen story !!!! SPOILER!!!! is just not what I am usually into).

The story-telling in Gone Home is absolutely fantastic, and the atmosphere inside the house is incredibly eerie. The main storyline is almost wholly narrated, and the voice acting is really believable. There's a decent amount of exploration, especially given that you don't  really  need to go hunting too much for the primary stuff, but when you do spend some time looking around and opening drawers and reading little snippets of paper, you end up uncovering several side stories that are only progressed by finding further objects.  The issue I have with this game is it's length/price value. As a completionist kinda guy, I managed to get a good 90 minutes of playtime out of Gone Home, but I can imagine that anyone not interested in reading the entirety of scraps of newspapers would easily finish the game in less than an hour. That said, I don't really know what the developers could have done to expand on the game. The story is very well told, the house is reasonably big (only very slightly bordering 'unrealistic') and the setting is great.  My gut instinct still says to give this a thumbs up, but at full price I would  only  recommend this to fans of slow-paced, heavily dialogue-based indie titles. Anyone else would feel it was an absolute waste of £15.",

Due to this reason, if you so desire to explore every crook and nanny of the house, you may find yourself entranced by the occassional narration of the notes and letters you find. Approach this game as if it were an interactive movie as that is its essential purpose.  This game is not for everybody, but those who are fascinated by story-driven games, especially with a heartwarming and relatable story as presented within this game, will be thoroughly entertained in playing the game through to the end. Definitely a one-of-a-kind game, and the nostalgia it produces is enough for anyone insightful of 90's pop culture to enjoy. *yes, there is a reference to Pulp Fiction in this game* I would recommend this game to anyone in need of a casual gaming experience, albeit heavy on story.

But, consider the cost of going to the movies. New releases cost ~$11 here, and if you think of Gone Home *sorta* like an interactive story and less quite like a game, that price feels about right. I grabbed it from the holiday sale, and don't regret it.  I don't think I've played something quite like it, and that's worth the price of admission that I paid to me.

As you explore your family home, bits and pieces of infomation will be revealed to you as you explore its' depths and nosey around in people's stuff.  The core story itself is not particularly amazing nor inspiring, however the delivery and excution made an otherwise unspectacular story seem particularly moving and touching.  If you liked interactive storytelling games like Heavy Rain, you should definitely give this a try.  TL:DR - Good storytelling through exploration. Play for the feels. Instant gratification buffs walk away now.",

This is a beautiful work of art that captures a specific time period. I found it to be a profoundly emotional experience and would equate it with watching a really good movie or reading a really good book. The sound design is incredible, definitely needs to be played with headphones. The lighting effects and the house in general really set a suspenseful mood.  Also, kudos to the developers for it's female lead and storylines. We need more of this in the gaming industry.  I look forward to more interactive storytelling in the future.",

It's really very short, took me about 3 hours or so to complete, but man, I will NEVER forget those 3 hours for the rest of my life. And some might say it's not really a game, and they are right: this is a piece of art. Think of it as the gaming equivalent of a short story, a poem or a short movie. This is as good as it gets, the developers of this masterpiece should be instantly declared gods of storytelling. If you don't want to pay the 20 bucks for it, fine, wait for a steam sale and grab it there, but definitely give it a try. It just blew my mind.",

I approached this game with quite an open mind, and am glad I did because, even though gameplay is quite short (it took me 4.5 hours to finish the game and find all 24 journals) the quality of narrative and voice acting really helped make the game for me. It's difficult to write anything else about it that won't spoil it, save to say that during your investigations a picture builds up of what happened, not just recently, but over the years. Storyline aside, the graphics are good enough, the controls are straightforward (don't expect any 'change weapon' or 'jump' keys!), although there wasn't really much need for an inventory key. I can understand a large group of people not liking this type of game at all, especially those that paid a two-figure sum for the download, however if you're a fan of an independent, moving, graphical story then you can't go wrong with Gone Home. It'll be on my mind for a long time, and for all the right reasons!",

The story is touching, the environment is wonderfully detailed, the voice-acting spot-on and it has game-play mechanics that actually works great with the story.  The story: You are the older sister in a family of four living in the States in the mid 90s. You have been on a trip to Europe for a year and while away your family has moved to a new home (a large mansion). The night you return home you find the house apparently empty, and it seems that something is amiss.  It is a game about exploring an environment and learning about the people living there, particulary your younger sister. The clues are subtle, but not obscure. For this is not a puzzle game; you won't likely fail as long as you take your time and pay attention. Still, it is very much rewarding assembling the story this way, bit by bit, in your own pace; something I attribute largely to the diligently crafted environment. Also, the characters are very well written. (One example that comes to mind is Lonnie's postcard from the school field-trip. Love that one.)  So, to sum up, this is a very unique gaming experience.

Most of the objects you interact with have no real effect on the game nor are there any actual puzzles to solve. Being someone who grew up in the 90's, this was a great nostalgic trip back in time and much of the voice acting felt truly genuine to the times. I agree with many of the reviewers that the game is pretty short, only a few hours long and that's IF you obsessively checked everything like I did. Also the price tag is a bit steep at $20, but I got it during the steam sale for about $6 and for that price I thought it was fair. It's a refreshing break from much of the games out there and Indie games have had an amazing run in 2013. I think it's a worthy pickup if you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "The game isn't for everyone and, at $20, can be a bit expensive for what it is, an interactive story. There's little to no replay value but there is something here that is hard to describe. More of a visual novel, Gone Home is a game where every player takes away something different. But if you allow it, Gone Home is a good example of how games can teach something through play.  Reminiscent of Dear Esther, Gone Home is a simple, narrative-focused game whose themes of loneliness, turmoil, and confusion subtlely creates an atmosphere of tension that doesn't let go until the credits roll.   Gone Home is a treasure hunt. One clue leads to another as you explore the mansion and try to piece together just why it's so quiet.  Items strewn around the house are the only things the players can interact with besides doors and light switches. There are a few items that are inconsequential like mugs, drawers, and faucets that exist with no other purpose other than to be picked up. That said, most of the items give insight into who the characters are and the issues they face. The one character that doesn't get much elaboration is the one the player controls.  There is one weird aspect in the game. You play in first-person and when you move your camera normally, everything is as you'd expect. However, if you mouse over an item or a door, the camera slows as if your mouse suddenly jumped into a bowl of molasses. And this isn't something that the player can control either. As you're moving your mouse around to survey your surroundings, you'll hit a closet door or some other item that causes the player-camera to abrubtly slow down only returning to normal once you've moused past the 'hit box' so to speak. It's a bit jarring but it isn't gamebreaking by any means. Just something to consider/get used to.  If you're looking for a game with deep, rewarding game mechanics/gameplay, Gone Home isn't it. But if you're looking for an interactive story about the human condition and what it does, Gone Home is a fantastic example of what video games can do outside of rewarding gameplay. It causes you to think about being human.",

While neither a long game nor a large game world, it is ultimately a deep, emotional, and rich experience. The great genius of Gone Home is ultimately its use of its setting: A Family Home in the mid-1990s. It quickly becomes apparent to the player that to explore the Greenbriar House is a highly interactive experience. A huge number of objects in the game-world can be picked up and examined. Most of these objects are small, average things, such as badges and cassettes, which are a real throwback to anyone who was young in the 90s. What Gone Home does skillfully, however, is showing the sentimental aspects to these objects. Even objects such as ring-binders are shown to have attached memories. This emotional investment in such inanimate objects ultimately turns the House into a Home. Some negative comments have been made about the length of the game in relation to its price. However Gone Home's length ultimately relates to how much the player wants to explore. A high level of exploration is the ultimate reward for the player, as they gain a deeper understanding of the family members, their own trials and developments. One will find oneself truly engrossed in these characters, if they are willing to devote the time to uncover more about them. It's difficult to discuss the game's story without spoiling too much. The story is Gone Home's most central and greatest aspect. The player takes the role of Kaitlin Greenbriar, the eldest daughter of Terry and Jan Greenbriar, as she returns from a year backpacking in Europe. She finds the house her family moved into during that year empty. As the player searches the house, they discover what happened with the family during Kaitlin's year away, and why her parents and younger sister Sam are gone. The story the player uncovers ultimately debates such themes as love, acceptance, and maturity, with many of the character's stories mirroring each other in some way. Gone Home is an eye-opening experience. It pushes the boundaries of what a game can be. It will make you laugh and cry, and hopefully make you think a little. 10/10",

The main plot unfolds through a series of narrated diary entries, while the details are in the details around the house. If you don't like to read, I hope you reconsider. There are a number of things you can piece together through little snippets of text.  Take the tour around the house. Find out what happened. Be the creepy sister/daughter opening every cabinet or drawer that does not belong to you, leaving no stone unturned.",

Your sister, Sam, has left you a series of notes that you find by exploring your large mansion home. The atmosphere immediately makes you think you are about to walk into a horror game but there actually isnt any kind of combat or scares. The goal in the game is simply to explore and find clues.  Let's get on to the more critical things. The graphics are pretty good and I didn't experience any bugs or glitches in the game which was nice. The story sucked me in from the beginning and I found myself trying to put the pieces together and wanting to know more about this family. The characters are deep and all have something about them to be discovered. I didn't find any characters that didn't serve a purpose.  The only negatives that I found is that the game is incredibly short. I finished in under 2 hours and I explored all of the mansion and I am assuming I found all of the letters because the story progressed in a way that made sense. The ending leaves you wanting more which wouldn't be bad if this were the type of game that you could get DLC for and keep playing from where you left off but there isn't any replay value to this game at all.  Overall for the price I payed which was 3 dollars the game delivered what I would expect from a game so cheap. During sales I would recommend this game because it is a nice break from the stressful games that require strategy and good timing. It is as I said simple exploration which a good story. However, if it is much more than 5 bucks I can't say you are gettting your moneys worth out of it.",

            "review_text": "Just finished 'playing' Gone Home. The reason for the quotes is because it's not really a game as much as a guided interactive narrative story. You are a 21-year-old girl who's gone home (heh) in June 1995 from a lengthy trip across Europe to find the huge family home empty with a note on the door to not look for your younger sister.   As you walk around you can pick up objects (most are irrelevant) and read many, many notes and letters; listen to cassettes; hear what seem to be audio diaries from your sister as she tells a tale of her falling in love. As you discover secret passages and learn about supposed ghosts, the tension builds and the 'game' frequently gets spooky.  While game critics have fallen all over themselves to shower Gone Home with effusive praise, a LOT of gamers are hating on it pretty hard. Part of it is because many gamers are caveman mookheads who are used to shouting profanities at their Madden Warfare peeps and a story where you aren't the real protagonist that deals with grunge-era riot grrrls and middle-aged marital and life troubles doesn't interest them.  A greater part though is that it is an extremely short experience, taking no more than 2-3 hours to complete. For a game that retails for $20 - it's currently $5 on Steam; I got it for $3 on a Flash Sale - that doesn't really have you do much more than walk around looking at stuff, that's a hard sell. (The excellent Spec Ops: The Line is another example. It takes about 6 hours to beat and at $60, that's a terrible deal, regardless how good the story is. However for the $6 I paid on sale, it's a must-play.) Other than a couple of locked areas that need combinations to open, there's almost no 'gaming' in Gone Home.  I was fascinated by how they laid out the story and understand why screenwriters I've heard talk about it enjoyed it. While it sets out a clear trail for you to follow, it relies on you to pick up the crumbs and understand the loaf they fell from. (OK, that's a yellow card for terrible metaphors there.) I think I missed a few things judging from the reviews and videos I looked at elsewhere; I never found one safe's combo. The way some things are scattered around are clearly for storytelling than logic's sake and the way the sister's journals are presented doesn't make sense until the very end and even then doesn't make total sense.  That said, if you can pick it up for cheap (like $3) and you understand what you're signing on for (i.e. not a GAME game) and you want to hear some Bratmobile, then you might want to give Gone Home a home in your home's game collection.

I felt like I took a trip back to the mid-90's and got lost into a time-wrap of some kind. Everything is pretty much not nailed down here. So - it can be picked up, locked at, examined, and moved around.  And the way the story unfolds, is just great - whether by narration, from through the actual objects themselves, finding certain areas, solving some puzzles, or whatever the case might be. You basically return to an empty house and you're to find out where everyone is + why you're actually there, as everything feels up close + personal in the first-person experience. I won't go much further than that, as that could actually ruin the experience itself.  Do yourself a favor: don't spent full price on this. I certainly didn't. It's a very, very short game. B/c it is so short - that could be a worthwhile reason to replay it, in case you missed something in the game, want to check the Commentary out, to know the game inside + out, want to re-explore the game, or whatever the case might be.  Compared to most games on the market - Gone Home is a very different + interesting adventure game focused on exploration, loaded with a unique + ordinary 1990's atmosphere for a game that will make people that were alive in the 90's - especially those who were teens or children, during that era - relate to very easily. It will feel like you've....Gone Home, naturally.

There are two conflicting parts in it for me that really make recommending this game hard for me:  THE GOOD: The gameplay is probably one of the greatest representation of how a walking simulator should play. There's a huge mansion to walk around to your heart's content and interact with the objects in every room. The mansion feels lived-in and pretty detailed in all aspects. The graphics aren't TOO realistic but so much thought has been put in little details scattered throughout the house that it felt truly unique and rewarding to explore.   Once you start exploring, you'll come across the story of the empty house and slowly but surely work your way up to the reasons why the house is empty when you arrive from your trip. This leads to the only negative aspect of the game.  THE BAD: I swear I've read better lesbian fan fiction written by my 14-year-old niece than the stuff represented in here. The main character which is the primary focus of the story (who is also the main character's younger sister) is Sam. A punk-rock loving teen rebel who doesn't know the difference between the stains in her panties and the strawberry jam on her toast ....and thinks she's a lesbian because her parents probably didn't give her enough attention and the new highschool she's moved to doesn't regard her as a royal princess.   So she does what most teens do when they feel they're under pressure: going gay (well, to give credit to some of the more creative ones, they could go bisexual).  I don't know if this was a dark cautionary tale written by parents for parents with rebelious teens or by actual horny, shallow teens who want to express the diversity in probably the most woefully controversial and important subjects on the western youth's general mindset: sexuality... because that's the only freedom they feel they have.... I guess? I don't know whether to take the story seriously especially when it turns out to be a faulty, shallow and unexciting romance without a solid basis for a good story.   To be honest, I don't care after Gone Home's ending because I feel exhausted after tagging along with the game which promises mysterious twists and turns and puts me in a very interesting environment for around 3 hours just to keep slapping me left and right with its ovaries and finally unload its full load of estrogen on my face.  On the other hand, if you're into walking simulators or want to experience the interactive bliss which can be achieved through this genre, by all means check Gone Home out. The detailed environments and the general atmosphere was what pulled me towards finishing it.  MARGINAL THUMBS UP  Overrated.",

            "review_text": "Let me begin by making a few things very clear;  This isn't really a game, it's more a piece of Interactive Fiction such as Dear Esther or if you're old enough to remember them, the classic Infocom text adventure games of the 80s. Most of the game is spent exploring, reading many notes left behind and listening to a narrative which is triggered by finding certain items scattered throughout the home. There's no jumping, fighting, or really any action sequences at all.   Secondly, this isn't a horror story. It can feel creepy at times. There were a several instances where I felt as if I was being watched as I wandered through the home and a few times I expected to turn around to find someone or something behind me, but that never happened. The only scares in this game come from incorrect expectations going in or the ones that a person may create themselves if they're spooked out by being alone in a large home alone at night.   Lastly, this is a somewhat short game. I just finished 'playing' it for the first time and it took be about three hours total. There isn't a whole lot of replay value since neither the story or surroundings change but you may come across a few items here and there that you may have missed the first time around. On the other hand, I'm sure that those who loved this game will no doubt play it through many times.   I'm not going to spoil any details about the story itself since the story is really what the entire experience is all about but if you go in aware of the information above and an open mind you'll probably enjoy the experience.",

There is no combat, no puzzles, no conversations. You basically explore the big house of your family in 1995 that seemingly seems abandonned. There's a storm outside, all the lights are turned off. Gameplay consists mostly of turning on those lights, opening whatever can be opened (drawers, cabinets, etc), picking up stuff to examine it (3d object you can move) and reading various writings. It seems boring, but it isn't really. It's all done through a decent-looking first-person 3d engine.  The fact it's dark until you find the switch in each room, the storm raging, outside and the weird, yet could be normal, sounds of the old house makes for a creepy experience. I was even kind of scared by moments, but it's not an horror game per say. The story is told through writings and from 'audio' diaries by your younger sister popping up from time to time. Those are acted very convincingly and even though the game is short, you'll learn to like her and care about her potential fate. Overall, it felt like breaking, entering and exploring a 1995 house. It's atmospheric and a very good story told indirectly.",

But let's discuss the big thing, length. The length of this game is perfect for what it's design, but probably not for it's price tag. Okay, be honest, definitely not for the price tag. See, Gone Home is clearly designed to be completed in one sitting, and as such the roughly 90 minute play-time is perfect. But, obviously, $20 (£15 for UK residents) is quite a lot of money for an hour and-a-half worth of entertainment. So it just comes down to getting it on sale if that doesn't sound like it's worth it, because that's what Steam is for. :P",

There are no puzzles (other than rooting around looking for hidden gems), no monsters and no direct interaction with others.  I guess it's best described as an interactive story about Sam, the sister of Katie (whose perspective you take on). By the end of the game I felt like I had gotten to know Sam quite well. The voice acting was good, and the story interesting enough that I wanted to see it through to the end.  (My pregnant wife would like me to add that watching me play the game made her feel very dizzy. This may or may not improve the game in your estimation.)  I'd say the game was definitely worth the price (free for me!), but I'd say it would be worth buying on special. At 3h of gameplay it's a bit short for $20 in my opinion.",

The player is placed in a visually unexceptional, but thematically rich domain. As the player becomes immersed in their surroundings they engage with themes surrounding the third wave feminist movement of the 1990s, homosexuality, religion, adultery and writer's block. In the space of an hour (or two), the player has become invested in the live's of the Greenbriar family, akin to the empathy a reader will feel with the characters of a well-loved book. There is no great difficulty in this game, and no skill required - however an investigative and quizzical disposition is a must. While there are many reviewers in the steam community who have been sorely disappointed by promises that Gone Home is 'the game of the year' - the game will not disappoint those who are open to story-driven gameplay that involves no interaction with other characters. This game goes well and truly beyond its mark when considering the depth and detail it has devoted to providing a nuanced landscape that is coloured only by its relation to the importance of particular items, written material and sound devices. The attention to these details in Gone Home should inspire other progressive game developers to enhance the role of story in their own video games.",

It means that the narrative that you discover and experience isn't dragged on unnecessarily. Some might complete it faster than others, but I found that I didn't want to. I wanted to just look in every nook and cranny, and piece together the lives of the people that lived inside the home, to pick up on the elements of their lives that they kept hidden from each other.

In fact you don't have a jump button, or sprint button for that matter. Your reflexes won't be tested here, though a keen eye might serve you well.   Only buy Going Home if you feel like experiencing a delicately woven story.

It's about finding out who you are. And it's about families - warm and loving families - cold and distant families.   Going Home is short. A couple of hours, maybe three. I recommend you take your time. Piece together the story of the Greenbriars, like a detective gathering clues. Each character has an arc.

The play time is roughly 2 hours, so it's extremely short... don't expect more than that or you'll be disappointed. As far as the actual gameplay goes, though, it's extremely immersive. The game does a perfect job of leading you down the right path as it's very linear. You aren't left wandering about or confused about where to go next. This isn't really as 'interactive' as I was expecting and there are little to no puzzles to be had other than a couple combination locks to figure out (which are easy). Basically what it comes down to is panning around the interior of a an extremely large house and snooping into a family's business. You pick up and examine various objects and in doing so, you discover the secrets of your own family.  The atmosphere is very alluring, spooky, and I will admit - I jumped a few times. Overall, I loved it.. the story was relatable and as I said before it's very immersive. I would recommend this game, though if you can catch it for less than retail, do so. If I would have paid full price, I would have been slightly disappointed in the AMOUNT of playtime I received for retail price.

Not even Quantic Dream bothers to be quite this thorough with interactivity. It is a worthy novelty and takes dedication to pull it off to this extent.  - Combine that with the eerie mansion exploration mystery of the 7th Guest.  - Add a rich population of cultural perephernalia, hidden items and somewhat believable clutter all over the house to bring a story to life, strung together by diaries and conversational notes not unlike the scribbles on the walls in Left 4 Dead.    The floorplan of the house is pretty interesting and they did a great job of making you feel that you're really rummaging through someone's life in constant suspense. Everything was pulled off at a decent quality and there was never really anything jarringly out of place.  Though the game only has one ending, depending on how comprehensive and contemplative you were about your discoveries you may have very different theories or perspectives on what really happened.  It's unlikely to blow your mind either way, but it's a very short game that only takes 3-4 hours to complete if you read everything and search everywhere thoroughly, so there's no need to rush yourself.

The amazing sense of humanity in the game's world is strengthened by its temporary nature; the game's story exists in one evening and as such I find it appropriate that it can be completed in one evening. There is no glitz and glam, DLC gaps, hinted sequels or tacked on multiplayer. This is a game designed for an evening alone at home with a pair of headphones. I don't want to talk about the story to a huge extent: I'd rather note how the game's wonderful narrative mechanisms made for a far more consuming and involving process of play than I have experienced with any recent high budget 'story driven' games. The soundtrack never quite feels nostaliga-exploitative though I can't help but feel that this game is perhaps for a certain generation; the generation on the border of a digitisation of life itself. We who sit at our laptops now, but in flipping from Side A to Side B of the cassette in Gone Home are brought back to that sense of unknowing and possibility.

Once you enter in that home, you will find yourself in an extremely immersive place, which seems to be inhabited by real and believable people. Your surroundings seem to be alive and in every corner you will find something interesting to look at. And as you look into those details you will unfold an outstanding story that puts you right back into the 90s. Some people may complain about how short can it be, but those two hours I spent in that house were fulfilled with a kind of narrative that you rarely see in games.  You must play if: - you like games with an artistically approach;  - you like a touching and human narrative; - you do not care about a short experience and simple gameplay mechanics. _________________________________________________  “Gone Home” é, definitivamente, um dos melhores jogos indies de 2013. A partir do momento em que você entrar nessa casa, você se encontrará em um local extremamente imersivo, que parece ser habitado por pessoas reais e críveis. O ambiente que te cerca parece estar vivo e em cada canto você encontrará algo interessante para vislumbrar. Na medida em que você observa esses detalhes, você revelará uma história marcante que te levará de volta aos anos 90. Algumas pessoas podem se incomodar com sua curta duração, mas as duas horas que eu passei naquela casa foram preenchidas com um tipo de narrativa que raramente é vista nos jogos.  Você deve jogar se: - você gostar de jogos com uma abordagem mais artística; - você apreciar uma narrativa tocante e humana; - você não se importar com uma experiência curta e mecânicas de jogo simples.",

The devs have put you into a character and you learn everything about the game/story through her eyes, but it really goes beyond that. As much as I loved Mass Effect, The Last of Us, and Bioshock, I never really felt like I was taking on that character, like I wasn't ever actually that character, just an invisible god making arbitrary decisions to see what would happen or where I wanted this character to end up. I wanted to see these characters react to certain situations I put them it, but this game is different. This game is all about me as the character. I'm putting myself in situations, not some character that always knows what to do or to say. Instead of making decisions for the character, I was making choices for myself. Never has a game actually put you into the shoes of a character where you really feel like you are this young woman unravelling the mystery as to what has happened to your family. Male or female, straight or gay, you really come to be this young woman. You feel attachment to your sister in such a profound way it’s emotionally draining. I can't recommend this game enough. This was such an amazing experience and a breath of fresh air amidst all these 'AAA Blockbusters'. This game is worth the money, but don't be looking for a time sink. This game is relatively short, but so good that it really doesn't matter. Quality always and forever over Quantity.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a game about storytelling, which is to say it's not so much about the destination as the journey. As I experienced the development of characters' relationships, and saw some of the hidden dynamics in this family's 'stuff,' I became emotionally invested in how things would play out. Not only that, but thanks to the writing, the excellent voice acting, and the authentic feel of the various bits laying about the house, I was able to get inside the headspace of the central character in a way that's seldom done. Indeed, it evoked the emotional experience of young love like I've never felt from any other piece of media; somehow, they absolutely nailed it, and that's very difficult. It was a great way to frame the story, one that isn't common in games, and I absolutely felt it was worth my time. It also reminded me of the value of my own family, in the wake of the experience I'd just witnessed.  I know a lot of people will balk at the price, given the approximate two-hour time to completion, but I've always found the dollar-per-hour ratio we use to value games a bit bizarre. Lots of games are too bloated, and don't respect our time, so when a game accomplishes what it needs to in two hours and then lets you move on, I think that's worthy of celebration, not condemnation. While we may have certain expectations from our past history, the medium is changing, and so is the typical gamer. With many of us now having more money than time, I think there's absolutely room for a well-executed, 'premium' experience that is short on time but long on value.  I believe this is a game that's absolutely worth that perceived 'premium' price. Fullbright, who previously were part of the Minerva's Den team at 2K Marin, have shown that they're adept at telling affecting, personal stories in this medium, and I'm interested to see what they do next.",

Example: peeling stickers on the main character's desk, messy rooms, etc. Gone Home does an outstanding job with creating a rich atmosphere that I personally can relate to. The game is kind of eerie, reminding me of when I was a kid being home alone kind of eerie.   Growing up in the 90's, Gone Home struck a very peculiar chord with me, but might not do so for others. This game is often criticized for not being very 'gamey', but I personally didn't really care or see why they (Fullbright) would need to make it like that, Gone Home is more of an experience rather than a game, and it's an experience I think is worth someone's time.",

I feel the game will strike a nostalgic chord with anyway who grew up in the mid 90's, so if you like the genre it can be good for a bit of a nostlagic trip. The game was paced well, which allowed you to develop the families timeline and distinguish the defining events throughout, which overall made the game more interesting, which is good becasue it really is just a walking simulator. Overall, I cant reccomend this game at $20, as I dont feel it has enough replay value. If you can get it under $5, then I'd say give it a shot.

I guessed what the twist of the story would be as soon as I watched a trailer for the game (and I got it confirmed by a spoiler before I ever owned the game) so I did find a few of the red herrings in the game sort of silly.  That being said, I did think that they did a fantastic job of creating atmosphere in the game, and the story, while simple, was told in an effecting way. (The fantastic voice acting from Sam's actress is probably part of that.) I don't think it's quite as unique as reviewers thought (the gameplay strikes me as being similar to Amnesia), but I also wouldn't call this just a 'walking simulator' since exploring the house is interesting and tells the story in a different way than, say, a movie could. It's certainly a really interesting experience and I'm really glad I played it, so if you're interested in story-driven games (or 'interactive experiences' or whatever you want to call this) I definitely recommend picking this up when it's on sale.  That being said, is this Game of the Year material? No, not in my opinion. It's a well done experience but there were better written, more effecting experiences than this that came out in 2013, even among indie games (Stanley Parable, while not as an emotional story, engaged me more, and while I've only played the beta version of Papers, Please so far I'm pretty confident that game has a story as emotional and interesting as Gone Home with much more solid gameplay).  tl;dr - great example of storytelling in gaming, great atmosphere, recommended if you can get it on sale.

Hardcore gamers will appreciate the change of pace. Newbies to gaming in general will be sucked into this world, just comfortable enough to press on.  It has some near-perfect pacing as a result of rewarding thorough exploration, providing compelling tidbits with almost every discovery, or confirming or denying something you may have been wondering about it. It's immersive, authentic, and honest.  It's also scary at times.

We start off coming home. Empty house (btw the whole thing is a walking simulator through a house with notes and what not to find and discover). We are reminded of the 90's. Hell 90% of what I found and saw in game were things I had around and kept in my pre-teen and teenage years.  The story is finding out why you came home to an empty house and why your sister left.  *Spoiler*  She left because she was gay. Lesbian.  This sends a message to players that we drive our homosexuals away. That we aren't tolerant enough of their existance. I even read comments in the Gone Home game hub that we should buy these sort of games to support Gays all over the world... really?  When we accept the Gay community into our news media, our movies, tv shows, news papers, we have openly gay politicians as leaders of our cities, of our states, we passed the point, several decades ago, that being gay is NOT a social set back.  People will always not like you because you are too fat, too skinny, too bald, too hairy, too rich, too poor, dislike you because of your position in life, because you have something they just don't. People will not like you because of the color of your skin or the fact you wear glasses or have your own sense of humor or fashion. It is a part of human nature. People will have their own opinions about gays and if a family is too weak that they can't accept a homosexual in their family then that homosexual is BETTER off without the hate from those certain members of their family.  But to guilt trip players into thinking we don't do enough? When other countries stone to death homosexuals and force them to either never display their affections or die? Or worse commit suicide?   Come on... good game, great nestalgia factor, but supporting this game soley because it has a guilt trip factor about gays is not worthy of it's meta score or praise.  We are not the 1950s.

            "review_text": "There is some important info you need to know before buying 'Gone Home' 1. It is not a game. 'Game' implies that there is gameplay and some kind of goal. This is an interactive story. There are no boss battles, no power ups to collect, and no end goal besides having the story told to you. If you thought 'Dear Esther' was boring, DO NOT BUY THIS.  2. Gone Home is short. You can easily finish it in 90 minutes. If you think 20 dollars is too much for a 90 minute experience, DO NOT BUY THIS. (I know I have spent 20 dollars on 90 minute movies that were much worse than this)  3. Story, story, story. Gone Home is about the story. The story is a drama. If you are not someone who pays attention to detail, you will miss a lot in this game. Everything in the environment is meant to service the story. If you are not a fan of serious drama, DO NOT BUY THIS.  If you are still reading then this game may be for you. Mild spoilers ahead. If you do not want to read spoilers I will just say that this story is amazingly well crafted. The characters are more real and believible than any other game I have ever played. And you should buy it right now.       MILD SPOILERS HEREAFTER: In Gone Home you play a girl who has just spent a year abroad on vacation. You come home from your red eye flight expecting your parents and little sister to welcome you home. Only to find a note on the front door from your sister saying she has run away for reasons unknown and your parents are nowhere to be found.  What follows is your exploration of their new house (they moved into this house while you were away) trying to figure out where everyone is.  The story is told through the environment and also through journal entries from your sister. These are recited to you by an excellent voice actress. Your exploration uncovers the trappings of a standard upper middle class life.  The story is engaging, and very moving. By the end you may shed tears of sadness and of joy. (The story is very bittersweet.)  Gone Home is an incredible example of video games as Art. This story could not have been told in any other medium and because of the way it is told it becomes even more emotionally powerful.  There is a twist in the story, that is fairly obvious to spot for anyone paying attention, but that does not detract from the quality of the narrative.   If you like Dear Esther buy this immediately. If you are on the fence wait for it to be on sale.  There is an aspect to the story that warrants discussion but to give it away in a review would be a disservice to the game. I'll just say there are some mature themes in the game. And by mature I mean emotionally mature not porno mature.  If you like your games to be full of explosions and awesome action, this is not for you.  If you want a thought provoking and amazingly well told narrative Gone Home is highly recommended.",

The investigation elements are fun, and the writing is top notch, so you will feel for the progression of the characters who are battling through personal demons (in a way I won't spoil).  My only criticism would be that the game (nay, experience) is quite short, so users may feel unhappy with the $19.99 price tag at time of writing, but for the relative cost of a movie ticket where I live, this 2-4 hour trip was well worth the money spent.  The ending, without spoiling anything, is an immersive, dread-filled exploration, which never quite goes where you think it will. Go home and give it a go.",

Impressions: Wow, what a great ride. Very impressed by the writing and execution that played out perfectly as I explored and all made logical sense while apparently giving you semi-open world freedom it's actually guiding you. there are easter eggs in almost every location if you look for them and none are necessary or over explained you just have to be observant. Nothing jarred me out of the game and finding a cereal box with the puzzle completed on the side in pen just shows the level of detail that goes into making this house feel lived in.  Be aware this is an interactive story and 2 hours is all it takes to complete. There are adult themes that are handled cleverly and that reading and thought is needed to get the most out of the experience as the game allows you to join the dots yourself for the broad themes and side stories.  Recommended for: 90's music lovers, those with a literary passion and point n click explorers.  Conclusion: 7/10. A pitch perfect story, expertly delivered in every way but beware the length and how much you want to pay.",

You will find no challenges on it, no enemies at all, no battle or any form of the contents that made any adventure or action games good (despite the plot, but of course). If you're a player that think it is worth it for playing a game with none of those things but yet one of the best stories and character development maybe ever made in a video game, condider yourself able to click on read more.  The game is short ? yes. Should it have been longer ? Definitely not !  The game as you should read or heard before has only one character appearing on itself for the entire show: yourself. There is no npc, no interactive characters, no enemies, no nobody. Just you, yourself and thy !  Now thats one of the amazing things. The game is actually settled in one huge house, really huge, and there was a psycho living in there (not spoilers, you get that in five mins of gameplay). There is a wheeping voice recording on your voicemail calling for your sister, that left a letter asking you to not contact any of your parents or to say what she have done.  I said it was one of the amazing things, wasn't lying. IT IS NOT A HORROR GAME. You are throwed in this whole enviroment with a badass storm on the background and you go on and discover that the house has eletricity problems, so then and then the lights of a really long hallway just start blinking. Also the sound of the game is really amazing, so you hear the wood in your feet make a lot ( a lot !!!!) of noise. But again, it is not a horror game. I'm saying that because i ♥♥♥♥ in my pants for some few hours and even searched on the steam community just to make sure that i wasnt, and it isn't. But allong the gameplay you really find yourself splitted in a thriling crazy mansion and a really great story (that was actually awesome) Again, no horror game !  But finally, the story: The story is actually told in a very peculiar way. You are a hitchhiker and was in trip for some time that i don't remember. But enough time to your family ( parents and sister) move in to another house. You find the whole house in the moving mood, so sometimes it is sometimes not full of life like a normal house, and again making it better for the scary feeling. You discover about your parents story through doccuments and letters and find a lot about their lives, fears, objectives and commitments to. While about your sister, you follow the story by notes, bottoms, cassette tapes, and a lot of things; allong with a journal that was written by her for you, while you were in that great trip. She writes because you were really close and she don't want you to miss about her life that she always shared with you.  The game is actually settled in the 90's, so no internet as you thought ! This ambientalization is made in a very good and with a lot of nostalgia feeling. Just like the cassette tapes, SNES games , the shocking death of kurt kobain, the letter exchanging and of course the good'ol journal  The game is very touching and very grown up, despite its simplicity. The story of your sister and her friend in the new school escalates in a very exciting way, and this is totally a story that you won't forget. I am really afraid of giving spoilers in here. Just know that it is a real crying-maker, beautiful, touchy and pure piece of art inserted in a awesome story and development. To this gem 10/10",

Pros: - Great 90's flashback of pop culture and somewhat relatable for the children of the 80's and 90's. - Decent Enviromental original soundtrack laced with 90's Punk/Grunge. - (IMO) Interesting story  Cons:  - Short - Dear Ester Style of Gameplay...(I'm personally fine with it) - High Entry Point (19.99)  I'm very much looking forward to The Fullbright Company's next title 'Tacoma'.

The atmosphere was taut, also keeping me slightly on edge for no apparent reason, in such a way that you can really tell this has its roots in an Amnesia mod. The music was subtle yet effective, especially in contrast to the occasional cassettes you can put on around the house.  However, the game is way overpriced. Many people have complained about the game being so short (I finished it in 81 minutes) but I think the length was just right for it. Nevertheless, you cannot seriously charge any more than £3 for something so short. So wait until the game is on sale before picking it up.  Overall, this was a really enjoyable experience, and I hope that people will be open-minded when they try it, rather than saying it's not a 'real' game.",

I will tell you this...if I paid 20 bucks for it, I'd probably be upset. Being that it was under 10, I was more than entertained. It was fantastic.  The premise is that you are a girl that returns to a large, spooky home after an overseas trip where you studied abroad. No one is home. It's a dark and stormy night. You hear cracks of thunder. Occasionally a lightbulb might go out on you. And you are aaaaaall alone. Except for bits and pieces of journey entries you get from your sister Susan who is voice acted.   There are rumors that the house is haunted. And so the premise builds that something wrong happened to your family.  But did it?  And that's the whole gist of the story. You playing inspector detector to try to gain insight on what happened while you were gone. Oh and it takes place in the 90s. Which oddly enough...I grew up in the 90s so I remembered a crap ton of the references.  This game is not a Slender Man game. You're not running around with your heart pounding afraid of what might jump and gobble you up from behind. It's a story about discovery and understanding. It tugs on the emotional heart strings. It's not going to be a game for everyone. But it's fascinating in that it focuses on story and that is literally all there is. And a few minor puzzles.

Gone Home offers you a fully-interactable enviorment, a masterpiece story telling experience, and a very interesting story alongside with a perfect ambiance. There are no words to describe the game, it is not even a game in traditional sense. Go and grab it, if you want a very interesting story. 10/10",

It also has a series of cassette tapes containing music you can listen to it. Cool little detail that helps you get into the head space of one of the characters.  The main component of the story is the younger sister but it also focuses on the entire family and their lives over the last year. You get to know these characters, their relationships, and their struggles without ever meeting them. It's an emotional journey with some real gut punches and a very satisfying finale. I cried a little bit. Then a little bit more.   If the idea of walking around reading and pouring over every room for clues doesn't do it for you then this game isn't for you.

I don't fault others for calling this game 'bland' or 'uninteresting'; certainly, there isn't anything in the way of 'action' or 'adventure'. What it does have, however, is a lot to say about family -- the one you're born into and the one you create for yourself.  Take your time. Read the letters. Listen to your sister's story.

A very unique experience that I highly recommend. Don't read too much into it or you might spoil it for yourself. Took about 2 hours to fully explore the house from beginning to end. Gone Home kept me intrigued for the entire playthrough, but by the end left me expecting and wanting more.

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a polarizing work. Its closest kin are visual novels and games like Dear Esther; but whereas Dear Esther was opaque and obscure, Gone Home wears its story on its sleeve.  You play as Katie, returning home from a trip abroad to find your family home empty, the only explanation at the start a letter from your younger sister, and a strange message on the answering machine leaves bad implications. Just where has everyone gone to? Unwinding that narrative is the focus of your journey through the house. A sense of dread and the unknown permeates the atmosphere, but eventually you start to uncover what's been going on since Katie left for Europe. And always you hear the rain pelting on the house all around you.  Gone Home is a love story told out of order. There are few if any real puzzles to solve, mostly of the 'put key combination in x lock' type. You can pick up and examine everything in the house, turning on lights and finding clues in objects. There is nothing to solve, apart from the satisfaction of learning what happened. You could easily speed run the game to the end but that would miss the point. The game isn't about speedruns as it is about setting a mood and getting under your skin. The voice acting for Sam is amazing; she comes across as a vulnerable character you come to care about as you learn who she is. Her struggles can break your heart if you let them.  As a story, it's not without its problems; you're never privy to how the stories for Katie's mother and father ended, and the ending itself feels consequence free, like what you'd find in a romance novel. Real life, which the game adheres to for the most part, feels painted over by the end. The game does its best to be optimistic, but who knows how this will all really end?  As for exploring the house, it's huge. It feels lived in, and since this is supposed to be set in the 90's there is a lot of nostalgia on display. Video tapes with old movies and X-Files episodes litter the house, punk band cassettes that you can listen to, and numerous other small details make it a treat for explorers. Sam even has SNES cartridges and is a professed Street Fighter fan, although the system itself is conspicuously absent. Often times you feel like Cole Phelps in L.A. Noire, picking up objects and going, 'Not relevant,' but this game is about exploration rather than pixel hunting.  Gone Home has many detractors. Games are traditionally about choices, but here you're given a different kind of choice that really comes down to the type of game you want to play. Outlast or Amnesia this is not. You don't order a salad when you wanted a steak sandwich. Do you want to instead play a game where you get to explore a house and pick up on the threads of a touching story? If so, Gone Home might be up your alley.   A final note on the price: as of this writing it's $19.99 which can be very pricy for what amounts to a short 2-3 hour experience. You can't replay it unless you wait a few months so items and events aren't as fresh in your memory. Even with the developer commentary ala Valve's games, this price is a little high for gamers on a budget. If you don't want to spend that much, you can always wait for a sale to get the most bang for your buck. It all depends on how much an experience like this is worth to you.",

The game is pretty much 'on rails' , as in, you don't find out anything before you are 'supposed' to. Linearity is often necessary to tell a good story when the story is pre-defined. A good linear game makes you feel like you're in charge. Gone Home succeeds at this quite well. Get it if you like interactive stories of the non 'Zork' variety.

The story is not a Stephen King novelle, eventhough it's obvious that the writer of the game have taken some inspiration. But it is good, charming and doesn't overstay its welcome.  The music also really help setting the mood, but some of it was actually somewhat of an annoyance, but it did fit in the story, so I guess I can't complain.

I understand many people have an issue calling Gone Home a game. This is something that I cannot agree with. Gone Home is as much a game as any other point and click mystery game. This is not just a mystery game but an emotionally charged experience that everyone should feel.   Gone Home makes bold statements about the places we inhabit and the marks we leave on those places that leave clues to who we are and what we believe in. Gone Home was something special too me because of the many emotions it evoked from me throughout the relatively short experience. The atmosphere in the game is surprisingly chilling even though you will never find anything scary. What makes Gone Home something so captivating is the attention to detail put into the house you explore.   The story is also something worth mentioning as I personally found it to be a touching and eye-opening statement about the relationships we have with other people. After playing the game some many months ago I still think about the game and all the things it has made me reflect upon. This is the only game I have played that has stuck with me for such a long period of time after finishing it. Gone Home is the game that will leave you reflecting inwards on what your house might be able to tell a stranger about you and how we affect the different people in our lives.",

The thing is that it got me interested in how it possibly couldn't be one, and now that I've played it I'm even a little bit more boggled how some one might think that it isn't a video game. The play here isn't in complicated game mechanics. The game is in the player's imagination, and this game is very good at playing with the imagination.  I loved this game and plan to play through it many more times. I find myself wanting to pick up every item in a room. I read every page that I found. I smiled at the details. Things like how a young kid would put stickers on their story and spell the word 'liar' as 'lier'. Or things like how tempting it was to crawl into the couch fort and listen to the severe storm warning.  The game plays well off of other parts of the imagination. Namely in how the game is set-up. I don't want to give too much away because this is really the type of game that people should just jump into and play. The lighting in the game sets such a great mood, and since the player is dropped into such an odd circumstance it feels like a ghost or a murderer could be around a corner at any time. The game feels like that moment when you walk into your house, all the lights are off, and no one is home.  I'm sure this game isn't for everyone. It's on the short side of things at about two and a half hours if you really explore. There really isn't any action to the game either. The enjoyment is in searching around and piecing together your own stories from all the scattered clues. If searching every nook and cranny is something that you love to do in games this one is right up your alley.",

This game is fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the two hours I spent with it BUT I have to admit it's not a game for everyone (in fact I'd say it's for a minority quite possibly). I know, I know... it sounds so typical, yet it really is the truth. It's a short game with almost no gameplay whatsoever, and the plot is nothing to write home about (pun intended). The story is a whole different animal, however, even if I'd argue that it's not so much a story as it is perhaps a portrait. A picture of a family in just a few strokes. It's not quite original, and as far as plots go, it's mostly predictable. What really makes it stand out is the way you experience it, bit by bit, peeking at things you probably shouldn't be seeing.  *(Extremely light SPOILERS)*  In a way, you're getting to know the family, as if you really had been away for a long time. You learn what's changed in the last months, and you get some insight into what each of the family members feels deep inside. As said, it's done with brevity and somewhat vaguely. Not very subtly at times, but in the end, it really gives you a strong sense of where is everyone at in their lives.  *(And we're out of spoiler territory).*  Wether you'd like it or not is hugely dependent on your taste and interests. One could draw a useful comparison to films. If you enjoy emotional, introspective films, very light on plot and action, you might find this game interesting and possibly even enjoy it quite a bit. If you'd rather watch a more traditional film (and I mean no disrespect, I do enjoy traditional films too!) you might want to pass.  At any rate, I do agree with most other reviewers in that the price seems a bit too steep. The cinema comparison is again relevant here, for the experience is not only similar, but it also lasts for about the same time and has comparable 'replay' value. Fortunately, I did get it on sale, and for 6-7€ or less it's certainly worth picking up.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home tells the most personal narrative I've ever experienced in a video game. The ease with which it manages to make its characters relatable and the situations they find themselves in resonate on an emotional level, as well as its wonderfully heartfelt and earnest delivery, left me with the impression that with Gone Home, developer The Fullbright Company was telling somebody's story. But this small, intimate tale of family, adolescence and self-realization is told with all the confidence of a grand epic.  Set during a dark and stormy summers night of the mid-nineties, Gone Home casts you as Katie, a young woman who has just returned to her parents suburban home in Oregon after a yearlong trip across Europe. Much like the player, Katie is a stranger to her parents' new house. However, instead of a warm welcome, Katie finds the ominous building dark and empty, with a mysterious note from her younger sister on the front door.  Of course the mansion itself holds the answer to many of the questions this set-up evokes. Piecing together just what exactly happened while you were gone and figuring out where your family is consists largely of exploring Gone Home's many rooms, with the house acting as both a well designed puzzle for the player to work through, and an essential narrative device.  Gone Home's setting is filled to the brim with interactive objects, revealing notes and high-resolution artwork. It's a masterpiece of environmental story-telling, with every small detail adding to your understanding of the people that make up Katie's family.  Its intricate recreation of a suburban home of the nineties is almost uncanny: it's the furniture, the wallpapers and the many small touches like scattered VHS tapes and cassettes, complete with labeled sheaths. In fact, my only criticism of Gone Home is that, at times, the recreation feels almost too perfect, too meticulously designed.  The main narrative thread revolves around Katie's younger sister Sam, as she guides you through the past year of her life and acts as a narrator of sorts with journal-entries scattered around the house. Smart, witty, rebellious and lively, she's the type of person that I wish I could have been at her age. Her growth into womanhood is a captivating story and marks Gone Home's emotional core. It's brought to life with some fantastic writing and exceptional voice-work.  Katie herself never really plays an integral role in Gone Home's story. Instead, she serves as a vessel and emotional anchor for the player. This slight disconnect actually works to the story's favour, as it allows the player to come in without any pre-conceived notions on the family and yet still have some connection to the world and characters.  However for all the touching moments and heartfelt emotions that Gone Home so deftly portrays, one other emotion dominated a large part of Gone Home for me: fear. For the majority of my time with it, I played Gone Home like I would a horror game: clinging to the lights, avoiding the shadows, getting startled by every little sound and taking short brakes to catch my breath. The dark hallways of the house are deeply unsettling at first. I almost expected a monster to jump out of the closet, or to catch a glimpse of a ghost out of the corner of my eye. But there is no monster, and no ghost. Gone Home evoked the same fear in me, that I get when I walk around in a dark and lonely house -- the fear of that which does not exist.  But my relationship with Gone Home's setting gradually evolved. As I started turning on more lights and familiarizing myself with the layout of the house, my fears began to vanish. What I at first perceived to be a gloomy and uninviting mansion, now felt like a cozy and warm place, a treasure trove of human stories and emotions -- a home.  In the span of a mere two hours, Gone Home took me through an emotional roller-coaster that few games have been able to match, starting with the suspenseful unease of a super-natural mystery and ending with a beautiful emotional pay-off. By the end, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, so I did both. Even thinking about it now makes my heart swell with a rush of emotion.  Final Words:  In many ways, Gone Home is very mundane -- a slice of life, captured in a quaint suburban home. But it's ultimately this mundanity that sets Gone Home apart. Through it, the Fullbright Company explores a set of human emotions that games rarely deal with -- and rarer still so well. Players who grew up in the 90's will undoubtedly appreciate all the small particularities of the era, but Gone Home's narrative themes are universal. There's something for everyone to relate to in this understated, introspective masterpiece and anyone with even the slightest interest in the possibilities of narrative in games should play Gone Home.",

The characters (only 2 are important) have genuine personality told through the letters and objects you find as you explore the house. Important items and clues play voice tapes, which reveal more story. In the end I genuinely connected with them, and they felt real.  There's no real sense of gameplay, the interface is minimal and as far as the investigation elements go you'll tend to keep all the clues in short term memory. With Gone Home It's all about the story, and the story is only meant to be played once. If you get it on sale, like I did, you won't feel ripped off. If investigation and exploration (i.e. Games As Art) aren't your area then this won't be for you.",

I adore simple interaction that you wouldn't see in a lot of games today such as rotating and looking for nuances at the back of each book or cassette tape cover.   If you don't care for the story at all or if the premise of walking around a seemingly mundane mansion isn't that exciting for you, don't bother playing this game at all. At least the storytelling is integrated with the game mechanics and rarely relies on cutscenes which is a sign of decent narrative gameplay  Narrative wise and mild spoilers ahead...

If you were looking for a first-person shooter with limbs flying everywhere... This is not a game for you, which I am sure you would know that probably because you have seen a trailer or two of the game. Gone Home is a story based adventure-ish? game that ttakes you back to the mid-1990's. Although you play a different character in the game, it is a story about your sister Sam, who narrates about the few adventures that she had while you were away on your trip. But the one main adventure that runs through the rest is her friendship with a girl named, Lonnie. It is quite a lovely story, some parts happy and funny, some are drenched in sorrow and sadness. I wish I could go more into detail with the story line, but I am not a spoiler. Throughout the exploration of your house (A big house I might add) you find many neat things around every corner. Letters, (Which you will see a ton of) cool items that most 90's kids would understand, (Recommened for 90's kids!) and tons of soda cans. Some items that you pickup push the storyline forward. I wanted to get to each key item as fast as possible to see what the next part was going to be about (Gripping story if you ask me!). A lot of the things you think you can't interact with, you actually can, so search every part of each room. Also, a few of these items are pretty funny. Plus, the kick ♥♥♥ cassette tapes rock! Mainly the only thing that I thought was bad, was the shortness of the game. If you have read more reviews about Gone Home, one of the things you will hear is, 'Its too short!' or 'Very short game!'. I have no problem with the game being short, maybe if they could just put an extra 20 (30?) minutes into it. If you dont like short games... Dont play it. I reccomend buying it when it is on sale (Holiday sale, Summer sale, etc.). Overall, it was a touching game. I loved the story that was pulled you in with curiosity and adventure. It was heart-warming, wishing that something like this could happen to me as well, seeing that this storyline very much relates to many people who have been in Sam's shoes.   Pros:  -Graphics -Interaction -Storyline (Loved it!) -The secrets... 0.0 -Everything else!  Con (Thats right, only one!):  -Wish it was a little longer   Recommendation to:  -People who love a good story -Exploration -People who enjoy non-violent games -90's kids!",

The game manages to give characters depth without actually having any visible characters outside of pictures here and there.  The entire house is a time capsule with the game leading the player gently at first and by the nose with a shotgun in the other hand towards the end. The pacing is a bit jarring.  The story is well told however the big revelations may not have their intended impact in this day and age though many of the topics brought up are infinitely relatable.  If it's a light and enjoyable experience you're looking for, Gone Home fits the bill. Those wanting a heartier bite should look elsewhere.",

Then I read the discussion sites and was very very amused.  You can have all that for 2,39 right now! Buy it, play it, get amused. And by buying the game you are destroying all of the games and you participate in the LGBT-Machtergreifung. Who possibly can't want that?  Nah, seriously. Gone Home doesn’t reinvent the wheel. The gameplay is a very basic first person point and click: Look for keys to unlock new rooms where you have to look for new hints or new keys to unlock further areas. There are no difficult puzzles in any way. The Gameplay is much more the vehicle to transport the story which is also not so ground-breaking although there are some details that make it a bit more creepier / deeper (check the forums after you played it). It is not at all about the character you play but of her sister and the personal changes she goes through and the conflicts with her parents that come as consequence. Minor Spoiler:    She doesn’t like a girl the way her parents would like her to.    Anyway: It isn’t not a revolutionary story but it is nonetheless a story worth reading (and you will do some decent amount of reading).  The graphics are basically good I guess. Gone home doesn’t have a special art style but it looks good.   Conclusion: Gone Home is nothing special, neither in the good nor in the bad way. But it is worth giving it a try and exploring it at least when it is on sale (you can “beat” the game without any problem in under two hours when you don’t search for every detail in the story). ",

So games like 'Vanishing of Ethan Carter' and 'Gone Home' really speak to me. I really appreciate the story delving into experiences that aren't often included in North American overculture, particularly ones that feature female leading characters. If you are seeking a different kind of gaming experience, one that focuses more on story, mystery, and discovery, this game is for you. This is a game for indie fans.   Only draw backs are the puzzle elements aren't too much of a challenege, and the game is short. I completed it in about 2 hours, and I thought I was 'taking my time' really exploring everything.   There were some creepy moments, especially when you enter dark rooms and can't find the light switches, the TV's are playing looping messages, and other subtle but effective 'jumpy' experiences. The voice acting, art, and stories were very well crafted and believable. This is truly a story that could have happened, and most likely has, representing a well produced piece of historical fiction.   As I was also a teenager in the mid-1990's, it was very nostalgic to see references to homemade 'casette tapes' and references to Kurt Cobain, 'zines, and punk/grunge bands of that area. The game creators captured the ambience of that area well.",

It is filled with shuffling through papers and exploring a home that doesn't have danger around every corner. This being my first professional review of a game I felt that when I scrolled through the comment sections of this game I felt the overwhelming response against this game almost discouraged me from giving it a try. I do understand those whom paid $20 for a three hour game feel a little shafted, I also completed it under 3 hours and may only have a few notes and things to collect totally up a possible 4hours.  What this story has is Nostalgia for anyone who remember the nineties and the endless excitement of digging dirt up on your in game parents and little sister which progressively pushes the mystery forward. I was truly moved by the voice acting as well, their emotions were felt and forced me to finish the game to a joyous conclusion. So as a lone recommendation in a sea of negativity please give this game a shot if the price is affordable, there are so many unique rewarding eperiences that your run of the mill game will not provide.  Pros Flawless gameplay Moving love story (Nothing too new but, modernized) 1994 nuff said That feeling you get rummaging through a strangers private stuff  Cons You spent your last dollar on a game and having nothing left to do but comment on how its too short and too expensive and too much walking for a walking simulation game then run home, sit in a dark ignorant corner and blame everyone else for your problems.

If you grew up in that era, it's hard not find yourself lost in thought as you wade through reminders of your childhood. Between this cascade of memories, however, Gone Home is really a story about affect and belonging; how love shapes the contours of 'home' far more than any physical location.

Well, I'd have to respond to that: 'as far as games go it is very good and the plot really has not been done before'. See, there is a particular twist to the story, I sadly got spoiled for me, but is what the game ultimately revolves around. So better not look too much up on it. And the pure plot wouldn't make for a very good TV episode.

            "review_text": "I’m not one to shy away from games that focus on exploration and discovery, like your Minecraft’s or your Terraria’s or your action games, but in these cases, said exploration brings you rewards like treasure or upgrades; rewards that improve your character and gives you reason to go out of your way to locate them. When it comes to finding rewards that merely give you plot or story points however, my drive begins to wane since your character or your player abilities aren’t improved. You’re merely learning lore or backstory which, unless I’m invested in the game’s world or characters, doesn’t hold my interest for very long. Whether this is the fault of myself or the game’s storytelling I don’t know, but it’s often the reason why point n’ click, adventure or dialogue driven games often go right over my head. Not because they’re at all bad, but my investment in them was already checked at the door. Gone Home however is entirely story-driven, and I found myself wanting to see its tale to the end (and not just because I was doing a recorded playthrough of it!).  Gone Home requires you to hunt down and discover story elements, since when you first arrive at the Greenbriar home you find it vacant and must discover why, having no knowledge of the family starting off. This information is revealed slowly by discovering various clues around the house, a majority of them in the form of notes or memos, often attached to things for further emphasis. Some clues however will trigger an audio file by Samantha (she’s referred to as Sam in the game so the same will be done for this review), the player character’s younger sister, who reads aloud from her journal about things going on in her life, around the house or with the family. The more clues I discovered and the more audio excerpts from Sam’s journal I unlocked, I began to put the pieces together that this wasn’t exactly a happy family, and soon an unconscious switch was tripped in my brain that suddenly made me want to ‘solve’ the mystery behind the empty house and why the Greenbriar’s were divided across all fronts.  What’s genius about actively looking for these clues or audio pieces is that paths through the house are locked, so keeping an eye out for keys results in peeking into drawers, rummaging through waste baskets and generally investigating each room of the house carefully which, like it or not, means you’ll find more story elements that could be minor, major, or are not relevant but breathe in a few welcome sighs of realism, like a pillow fort in the TV room with a pizza box and discarded soda cans nearby. Soon you’ll discover some smaller side stories within the family, like Janice (the mother) and a new colleague, Terrance (the father) and his struggling hobby. These don’t add very much to the overall plot, but I viewed them as side-quests more than anything else. You can’t just rip through the house like a bat out of hell without natural curiosity taking hold, and for someone with a slight completionist streak in me, I felt like I had to 100% the game mentally by finding everything I could. The satisfaction of knowing everything about the main story and side plots hasn’t tingled the back of my brain since playing the first Pheonix Wright game.  And then there’s Sarah Grayson, the voice actress for Sam. The occasional mistake of breathing a bit too closely into the microphone or popping of breath aside, Grayson brings an eerie level of comfort in her performance, since she’s the only voice you’ll be hearing in this spooky, big house. Her performance brought out sympathy in me when Sam talked about her hardships, and despite my desire to want to learn everything about the empty house, I wanted to find out what happened next to the troubled teen. Perhaps growing up in the same time span as her garnered a higher relation to Sam, but I’m not afraid to admit that I had to swallow my heart a few times during some of the more emotional confessionals. The game only benefits from such an honest, respectable performance, since when you’re listening to only one voice throughout the game, it’s best that such a fine job is done.  Gone Home doesn’t try to do anything out of its element, and that’s both its biggest strength and weakness. It’s here simply to tell a larger story and a few smaller ones; no shoe-horned garbage minigames, no fluff to purposely distract the player and alienate them, no quick-time-events, just explore a house for story elements. Obviously if one lacks the drive and interest to do only that for the entirety of the game, or if story-driven games don’t interest you at all, then this game is a natural pass. However, for those with the patience to wander around an empty house while a rainstorm rages outside, then Gone Home will be worth your quiet time.",

This made me walk around corners slowly, and turn on the lights, but eventually you realise what is actually going on.  If you're looking for a heartwarming story, then this game is for you. You get attached to Sam, and you begin to get curious about what piece of information you'll discover next. You make assumptions about what your family has been doing, and where they must be (SPOILER: I thought the Dad had killed Sam because she was a better writer or something brutal like that).

I also want to disclose I picked up this game in a Humble Bundle.  Is Gone Home a good game? Is it a game at all? Well, yes and no.  Mechanically, Gone Home is a lesson in interactive environments. Pretty much everything can be picked up, examined and thrown around. There's lots to read and see and a large, well-designed house to wander around. The audio is atmospheric and the distribution of objects gievs impressive realism to an empty home recently bought.  The game runs into some problems in the narrative department though. Multiple small narratives litter the environment, absorbable at your leisure. Your character, Katie Greenbriar, has recent;y returned from Europe to an empty house. By reading the myriad of notes and letters around the house, you establish who the Greenbriar family are, what they all do, their passions and interests. You also figure out why none of them are around. Katie herself is more of a player vessel than anything, having no voice and only expressing her feelings through the occasional item description.  The issue is that only one of the narratives actually turns out to be important and it's not necessarily the one you're most interested in. There are hints towards difficulties with Katie's parents and a dark past involving her great uncle but neither of these narrative paths seem to lead anywhere. The one that does hinges on Katie's sister, Sam, and is told through various objects found around the house that trigger voice-overs.  To be fair, this story is compelling, endearing and well-written. It charts Sam's transition through high school and her relationship with a girl named Lonnie. Letters, tapes, buttons and notes scattered around give more insight into this relationship and as it develops, the boldness and confidence of the writing becomes clearer. I won't spoil it but safe to say it's original, at least in terms of common videogame narrative.  I can't help but feel Gone Home would have benefitted from a tighter focus on this one important narrative. The other trails, red herrings and false starts just made me feel like I wasted a bunch of time. I would even go so far as to say they felt like filler, put in to keep me playing for longer.  For it's current price, £14.99, I would say Gone Home is overpriced. Even rejecting the currently-popular 'dollar per hour' measure, I still feel it's too much for the experience. There's also little replayability, as once you've completed the game it's abundantly clear the other narratives have no importance and the core narrative is so short and simple it's hardly worth playing through a second time.  I would recommend you find some way of playing Gone Home, be it at a friends house, through game-sharing or by picking it up in a sale. It's well worth 3-4 hours of your time; just probably not worth 15 of your hard earned pounds.",

Here's the basic gist: This is an atmospheric storytelling horror game. No, this is not a cheap ♥♥♥ jump scare generator. You will also not be gleefully crushing your way through hundreds of generic zombie-like-monsters. It's about a 2 hour experience, and yeah, no more replay than a short story or movie. I'd agree that I wouldn't spend $20 on it, but it is worth $10, or at least $5. You explore and read through a story, in a scary environment. I'll explain further, but if you want my advice, just grab this game and go through it without preconceptions. I had no idea what I was getting into, and I thoroughly loved the experience.  First, the story. There are a lot of people that can't be bothered to slow down and take in an environment when they play a game; people that will slam through a Bethesda game running from one quest marker to the next, completely ignoring any piece of in-game text that doesn't grant a skill point, then say the game had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story. If that's you, if you just don't have patience to dig around a desk and look for clues, or if you can't immerse yourself in a game, you won't enjoy this game. The key to enjoying this game is letting yourself be absorbed into the environment. There are no cutscenes, it's not that kind of game. Get into it, you'll enjoy it.  Regarding the horror aspect: I guess 'Horror' games are pretty popular. There's a formula, right? Oh no, it's dark. Creepy noise, gore, monster, maybe jumpscare, reload - some interactive iteration of a tired B-grade horror genre. I don't know, I'm not a professional horror-game-consumer. I consider this a spoiler, so if you want the best experience, please don't read on, but I'm pretty sure there's nothing in this game that will kill you. There's no monster, or ghost, or headshot-fodder. It's just the atmosphere and your mind.   What terrifies kids about the dark in their closet or under their bed? Not actual monsters (sorry, spoilers), just hundreds of thousands of years of evolved instinct. Don't go into this game thinking that there's only one way to do horror in a video game. The atmosphere of this house will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you if you let it. Such is the nature of fear, the real monsters are inside your head. The best horror stories know that and will play on it, and the developers did a great job of that here.  This game is sufficiently well designed and written to be both a spookfest and a moving story. I highly recommend it.",

As far as the video game aspect of Gone Home, you explore a house examining objects by rotating them and reading various notes. Occasionally you can find tapes of music to play if you so choose and when you find something important an audiolog plays. That's it. And it's relatively short. And I guess that's not for everyone judging by the negative reviews on the front page of the steam store page.  The medium allows for some super interesting storytelling. The objects you find all matter and correlate. It really is like exploring someone's home and finding out about the lives of this family through what they've chosen to keep, what they've chosen to throw away and what's been lost in the darkness of closets and under beds. You do have to be quite thorough in your searching to make the most of this idea though.  I won't go into any detail about the story itself for fear of spoilers, but I will say that if you have a softer more sensitive side then you will probably appreciate it, and if you also happened to be a teenager in the 90s you may appreciate it that bit more.

Unortunately, the publisher, Fullbright, pulled the game from PAX (a trade show or Indie game developers) because they didn't agree with the PAX organizers' political views--the PAX people don't cowtow to political correctness or feminist dogma, which I applaud them for. So I think that's a stupid reason for pulling a game--at the very least, Fullbright should recognize the importance of freedom of speech.  But as for the game, I recommend it. As long as the ♥♥♥ theme doesn't upset you, the game is basically a benign puzzle game with a sad ending.",

But much to my satisfaction, the story unfolds in a way where it is substantial on it's own. Everything ties into itself, and wraps around itself more and more in a very pleasing way. The game is short, but in that sweetspot of just the right length for what it is (the benifit of which cannot be understated). Exceedingly well done script and voice acting by the main character the story is about. A quite good interactive story.",

I could not wait to play, turned off all the lights, put on my headphones and started up the game. The atmosphere in this game is really creepy and well done. There were so many times I felt someone was right next to me and I really started getting spooked out. Sadly, that ends what I enjoyed from the game. There are so few times I don't enjoy a video game story, but this was one of them. From the very beginning it was obvious what the big twist was going to be. I thought because of that, it had to be something else so I was excited to continue. When I found out I was right all along, I was quite disappointed.   I can see why this has been getting mixed reviews, and I commend Full Bright for trying something different. Sadly in this case, the game just fell flat for me. I was really hoping I would fall on the 10/10 side of the discussion, for I hate being negative about video games. The game is hit or miss in my mind, so even though I don't recommend it, you may still enjoy it! Just know there is also the chance it will end up like it did for me =/",

Firstly, calling this a game, at least in the traditional sense, is doing it a great disservice, as a lot of people will expect more out of it than it delivers, it should rather be described as a digital short story (and, short as in two hours, give or take, even when you're really trying to prolong the experience) than a game.  Gameplay can be described as walking into a room, meticulously going over every nook, cranny and crevice until you find a piece of information (almost always on a piece of paper), and then either listening to a short audioclip that furthers the telling of the overall story, or reading a tiny bit of information about one of the sub-plots.  The main story is ok-ish, albeit very clichéed, and more or less all of the sub-plots are uninteristing and will leave you without closure, and you'll just have to speculate about the whats and whys. I must give credit for the great voiceacting, though, the actress who voiced Sam did a pretty fantastic job throughout.  Furthermore, it annoyed me immensely that a lot of the clues are found in highly illogical places, it complete breaks immersion for me to think that someone would leave information of a certain nature in a highly visible place, or that notes that are decades old would still be found where they would surely have either been destroyed, or removed by the persons living in the house.  This is even more compounded by the fact that the developers have done a pretty good job of making the house seem very real, more or less all drawers, closets, microwaves etc. can be opened to search for clues, but then again, this was most probably done to further the longevity of the game, you spend a lot of time opening stuff that have no items of interest in them.  All in all, I can't really recommend this game, its an interesting way to tell a story, and if the story had been better, it could really have been an experience, but as it is, this game should in no way be a contender for a GotY title.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a fairly straightforward game. Through a standard first person control scheme, you are Kaitlin Greenbriar, eldest sister in the Greenbriar family, back from an extended European holiday only to find the Greenbriar family home utterly empty. The crux of the game is uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of Kaitlin's family.  SPOILERS BELOW. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED. IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING GROUNDBREAKING OR WORTH KEEPING A SECRET, THOUGH.  Gone Home's story is innately personal, which is why it ultimately feels hollow to witness it through the weird, voyeuristic second-hand experience of sorting through notes, filtering for meaningful information. Occasionally uncovering a milestone piece of information results in a narrated excerpt from Sam's diary, which frankly feels a little bit like cheating since the vast majority of Sam's story arc unfolds through these excerpts, rather than the notes.  Sam and Lonnie's relationship is the primary story arc of the game. It evolves from a subtext-laden friendship to a romance around the half-way point. I am nothing but sympathetic for this kind of thing; and it did hit me hardest when Sam described her mother, Janice Greenbriar, insisting that Sam was going through a 'phase', 'did not know what she wanted', and 'just needed to meet the right guy', but this isn't a story about runaway lesbian teenagers, it's a story about an observer finding out about runaway lesbian teenagers after the fact.  This also isn't to mention the story arcs for the other characters--Terry's writing career, his obsession with the JFK assassination, his dead-end job as a hi-fi hardware reviewer, his alcoholism, and his wife's unfaithfulness--are more interesting than the relationship between Sam and Lonnie.  Gone Home's limited interactivity and 90s culture nostalgia aesthetic don't quite fill the gaps in a story loaded with cliches. In another medium, Gone Home wouldn't be considered anything remarkable. It also suffers from outdated visuals and poor engine optimization (pretty much the entire house is loaded into memory, physics objects and all).  It's important that as the video game industry reaches a larger audience and matures, we must also understand where mature criticism is necessary, where not to lump blind praise, and where to hold a game to the same standards that everyone else receives. I do not think Gone Home's praise is deserved, but I do not think its hate is either.  Gone Home is an interesting experiment in taking the kind of environmental storytelling dating all the way back to System Shock to its furthest conclusion, but not much more than that (and I feel a little insulted that the first number code in the game is 0451).",

Recently, though, a lot of game journalists and critics have started to talk about the need for less violent, less action-heavy, and more original games focusing on things we've never seen in games. As a result, games like Gone Home were created to fill the niche people have been looking for. What should have been (and would have been) bottom-of-the-bin indie story games have since become critically acclaimed classics. I'm not one to bash any game, since the creation of more unique games is never a bad thing, but to praise this game among others in the same genre who did it better, is ridiculous.  This game was basically the almagamation of the perfect parts to create a game that appeals to exactly everything critics were looking for at the time; 2 parts visual novel, 1 part taboo story, and 99 parts contrived. The phrase 'oscar-bait' really comes to mind when I think of Gone Home, almost as if it were a paint-by-numbers on how to create a game critics will love for that year. It delivers nothing we haven't seen already, while delivering it in a way that we've seen more than a handful of times, but it was released at just the right time and played by just the right people to get it major acclaim from journalists and critics, something alot of the other games in this genre didn't get.

Just because a game is controversial and nostalgic doesn't make it stand on its own. If it was released as a free project, then I would think this was an achievement. So many people praise games and movies when they do something out of the 'norm' in the story or otherwise. But why do people consistently do it. Its like people who claim they listen only to indie music because it makes them special. But really all they do is hang out with other 'indie' people and hate on those who don't understand them. So much for being independant.  This game has great voice recordings, the texturing and the modeling are also good. I found my self smiling and almost giggling with memories as I went through the house for the first 5 minutes. But after that, I lost it. I found my self just needing to complete the predictable game just becuase I had heard it was short and I figured I might as well see the whole thing.   One thing that really bothered me is that even though it is supposed to be an open exploration game, it is extremely linear, so much so that it takes away from the whole point. How am I supposed to feel like I am exploring a house, when I have to unlock sections of the house by completing certain 'find the key' sections of the game. And to explain why this was such a bother was because so many of the plot developments (notes) about the family progress in a chronological manner over a year, in notes that are already in the correct order as you find them. Why are notes that are more recent near the end of the game, and notes that start at the beggining of the chronology are found at the beggining sections of the house? Did the mom live in the closet during the 6 month mark and then move a month later to the kitchen so she could leave behind another piece of paper. I know there needs to be a fine line of guiding the player, but I felt the devs missed it. I understand why to an extent, but at the same time It didn't take me long before I figured out I was being spoon fed a story in a faux-exploration manner.  All though this game was short, it was a time consuming very short story that overstayed its welcome.  I would say go though this game once because some of the few 90s references are great for anyone who grew up during that time. But it is not as great as people say it is. The house is huge, but just feels empty, and I don't mean devoid of people, just that it feels lifeless by itself. Everything feels structured in its layout and there are not that many props, just a few striking 90s references, and then a bunch of light switches, toilet paper, towels, and coffee cups. In so many ways this 'coming home' experience could have felt more powerful. This game can't survive on the narration of a journal for the whole 15min total of narration for almost 2 hours of walking from lifeless room to lifeless room.   Maybe I'm spoiled, I just finished the Vanishing of Ethan Carter and I had my self pouring over every item I found, all the while being emotionally touched by the way the story actually came together in my mind alongside the actual plot, and not just as the naration dictated. In this game I got tired of hearing the whiny sister talk and explain while I looked at glass coasters with a fern on it. Thing was I never felt like I was involved in this game, and the character you play seems just as distant. There are so many better ways to tell a story and create a depth of feelings the player can sense in the visual medium of video games, other than to just put a bunch of objects in front of me and then tell me about the objects as I chronologically come across them.  Nostalgia: + (for about 5 minutes but somethings are really cool, like the inclusion of magic eye papers)  Voice Recording: + (even though the subject annoyed me like someone elses slowly released fart in a small room, to me it was still very tenderly and emotionally delivered)  Atmosphere and Sounds: ~ (okay, but mostly bad, good lighting, the house is lifeless though and doesn't feel like anyone could ever be home even if the game put them in there, and the thunder claps seemed really off and badly recorded.)  Story: - (bland, slightly intriging for a second, and then it turns into, walk here, unlock this, walk there, while narration complains and explains)  Gameplay: - (It's hard to have an exploration game where exploration really matters if I have to go through the story in chronological sections anyways, I never felt like I was figuring anything out)  The only thing that made this game worth it to me was flipping the cassete case around, and around, and around, and around. It's mesmerizing. But not worth it enough to gain a thumbs up. Give it a shot, but do not under any circumstances pay any more than 2 bucks for it. Try and get it in a bundle.",

Sadly I felt like I was strung along waiting for a plot twist that never happened. I mean... in this game they talk about ghosts and hauntings for the first chunk of it, the family leaving on various trips, the 'psycho brother' losing all contact with the sister he loved and locking everything away, a grandfather who showed two-faced approval for his author son... and yet the entire time none of this was relevent to the story at all. You find out that the house is apparently haunted but that doesn't mean anything... YOU EVEN FIND A PENTAGRAM THAT MEANS NOTHING.  I will deem this game 'teenage angst simulator' or 'no one understands me: The Game'",

            "review_text": "Caution: spoilers below  Much like the other reviews have stated, this game isn't really so much a game as an interactive story. And even that's stretching it some - you're not really interacting with the story itself, you're just finding bits of paper and such that trigger audio clips. I bought it, on sale, without checking the reviews (I read that it was originally an Amnesia mod, thought it would be scary, and bought it as a blind 'let's play' sort of thing) and was sorely disappointed. I'd expected something...frightening, or upsetting at the very least.  Even disregarding my own mistake, it was still a disappointing experience. The atmosphere is lonely and tense and foreboding, and for what? So I can walk around the house, keyed up, and find notes from my teenaged sister?  For that matter - the main story merely made me mildly nauseated. Kudos, that the developers made it a lesbian romance, but while some might find it cute or touching...To be honest, I just found it frustratingly cliche. Of course our sister's name is Sam (yes, I know, it's a nickname), lesbians are all named something masculine. Of course she doesn't fit in at school. Of course she's all gurrrl power.  Of course she does the incredibly stupid thing of running away from home to be with her girlfriend.  It's like I'm reading a textbook romance, in lesbian flavor. There are a few sweet moments, but overall I merely wanted to slap the hell out of my sister for being an idiotic teenager. I was more interested in my parents' stories, although that's not saying much.  So, to recap: This is a 'game' that wastes its potential atmosphere in favor of a boring romance between two teenage girls. Not recommended unless you have a serious need for 90's nostalgia or happen to identify strongly with Sam.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a first person interactive story, developed by The Full Bright Company. Being released on PC in August 2013, before a planned release on PS4 and Xbox One in early 2016.   I wouldn’t say Gone Home is a game, because there is the only thing you do in this game is walk from room to room interacting with notes and books, that’s it. This game has often been marked as being a walking simulator, and to be honest, people aren’t far wrong with that notion. From start to finish there the only sort of action or puzzle, or anything really worthy of being called gameplay, would be a short puzzle involving finding hidden cupboards. I was quite honestly bored after five minutes of starting the game.   Graphically, the game is quite nice though. There are some really nicely done lighting mechanics in the game, and textures are all really high quality as well. Even items that you pick up have really nicely made graphics and textures on, such as bottles in the kitchen or bathroom. There isn’t any animation to be found in the game though; you come into contact with no moveable objects throughout the game. Gone Home is narrated well too, the voice acting is done really well, and there is from memory no sound effects that standout, just a lot of ambiance sounds of the storm going on outside.   The only really shining light to come out of Gone Home is that it has a fairly compelling story. As a mid-twenties male though, I couldn’t relate to anything that was happening. You are basically reading a ton of notes, letters, diaries and posters. I was quite interested to follow the story until completion but I can’t say that I really enjoyed it all that much. It’s a very slow paced story which only really gathers paced towards the end of the game. You can get even more lore and plot from the game by searching high and low for more notes and letters if you want to.   A complete run through Gone Home will take you less than an hour to finish. This is with finding most of the extra notes for more stories as well. There is no replay ability, because to be quite honest, it’s a stretch to even get one run through out of it.   Technically I didn’t run into any problems. The game runs smooth and there are no glitches or bugs. Although there isn’t really anything that complicated going off on screen anyway…  To sum up, I am not going to recommend Gone Home. How this “game” is priced at £14, 99 are is astounding. I picked this up when it was on sale for £1, 79 a while ago, and even now I think I have been ripped off. There is a string of pretentious reviews on this “game” that quite honestly make me cringe whilst reading. Gone Home is quite literally one of the most boring and unexciting “games” I have played this year and cannot recommend it to anyone. Fully expecting a wave of flame and hatred from this review, so bring it on! :)     Tom's Score Card     1) Stay away   2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play          YouTube™ Video:  TeamTom Plays Gone Home Part 1&nbsp;",

Alternatively, I imagine that this game is similar to young adult novels that deal with all those confusing feelings pre-teens and young teens have about themselves. So if you like those, do the same.  If you don't want to act like a shallow elitest, or you don't enjoy young adult fiction I recommend against wasting your money. You would do better finding a copy of any 90's TV show featuring a teenage female lead and get the same experience for what is probably a fraction of the price.  The suspension of disbelief wasn't there, the themes were confusing, and the story itself was paper thin.   I spent half the game waiting for it to be a different game, and it never accomplished that. Instead it was just a casual walk through a house on a rainy night while reading your little sister's diary like a nosey sibling and rummaging through your parent's personal business. It is the most boring plotline ever.  In the end? You're the the most intrusively obnoxious sister/child ever.",

            "review_text": "There is a decent amount to like about Gone Home, but at the end of it all I can’t exactly recommend this game without explaining my gripes with it first-- from there you can form your own opinion. The concept is simplistic and surprisingly engrossing. The atmosphere is great, it’s a very interesting period piece, and a lot of the story is pretty engaging; however, the main problem with the game is that everything ends up feeling artificial. For those unfamiliar, you play as a young adult returning home a little past midnight and finding out that no one is home. As such, you let yourself into the house and begin exploring. Through your exploration you will slowly unravel the mysteries of where everyone is, the house, etc.   Honestly, it is a very interesting game and pretty well done. There is a sense of wonder exploring a relatively deserted and unfamiliar house—one your family calls home. The biggest gripe, though, is that the house doesn’t actually feel like a house at all. The layout and floor plan of the home you are exploring doesn’t really make much sense. I assume the home was designed in such a way as to guide players in the ‘correct’ direction, but honestly the house doesn’t really feel like a house. It feels more like a series of rooms that are connected by a maze of hallways. The room locations do not seem to make much sense, the hallways are incredibly long and winding, and honestly it just doesn’t feel like a home so much as it feels like a couple rooms held together by a thing wire.   Further detracting from the immersion is the fact that apparently every single member of the home has left incredibly personal papers, letters, and memos all over the house. For a family with so many secrets, you’d expect the mom to hide letters from her friend hinting at something sinister in a better place than any random cupboard in the house. Likewise, a note that isn’t exactly hidden at all saying ‘let’s do it at this location and this time’ more or less in plain sight makes little sense. This is pretty frustrating, particularly because there seems to have been a lot of effort put into the many different family storylines.  Perhaps most annoying is the character that is your sister. The letters she writes back and forth between her classmates and love interest are incredibly juvenile. Instead of presenting her as a highschool student graduating relatively soon—which she is--- the notes and slips of paper she has written read as though a third grader just found out that you can write an pass notes in class. It’s incredibly ridiculous and, for lack of a better word, lame. What really is disappointing is that your sister isn’t even the most interesting part of the story. What’s going on with your mom and dad is much more interesting, better paced, and frankly more believable. This is not to say that the story involving your sister is bad. The problem is that you can’t help but feel disillusioned by the juvenile and amateur writing of a supposed highschooler with aspirations of attending a college for creative writing.   Gone Home could have been a really great game. Instead, it’s an okay game with a really interesting idea. In general I guess I recommend the game just to try it out and form your own opinion. There is a good deal to like. I just wouldn’t expect too much.",

The description of the game states, 'No Combat, No Puzzles: Gone Home is a nonviolent and puzzle-free experience, inviting you to play at your own pace without getting attacked, stuck, or frustrated.' And I am usually OK with games of that sort IF they can hold my attention and are somewhat engaging. Gone Home was neither attention holding nor was it engaging. Walk around, read notes, listen to a story that clearly has an agenda to it, and that's all. The story line felt rather forced and unnatural and perhaps even a bit silly.

            "review_text": "'I have Gone Home and I have gone home but I am not home.' - Robert Yang from PC Gamer  I was slightly interested in Gone Home. It looked like some sort of creepy exploration game, that slowly builds the tension as you discover more and more. However my interest disappeared more or less when I learned it was hardly a two hour experience for the price of 20 dollars. I watched a video of the first few minutes of the game, it seemed to have that atmosphere I liked yet I still just lost complete interest. No way I was gonna buy that for 20 dollars for such a short amount of time. Of course, I, like everyone else saw the sharp difference between critics and players. Which more often than not, I agree with the players. I know how current video game critics are, and I have disagreed with most of them and their rave reviews of the latest innovative indie game or the latest flashy AAA game. Regardless, I went in with an open mind, I could easily enjoy the game. I didn't expect much, I suppose that gives the game a better chance to impress me.  The story was lacking, it didn't surpass my already nonexistant expectations of the game. The story just happens as you collect the various items, you slowly find out about how your sister was shunned by everyone at school and eventually found love with another girl. That's really it. Sure, you get some more detail about how her family denies her love for another woman, and some nice tidbits about the activities they do together and the ideas of their future, yet it all fell flat. It happened, and I felt no substance. Nothing truly interesting, nothing that made me enjoy each journal entry. It felt bare, maybe even forced; each journal entry is quick and useless. I'm not one for love stories, yet I have enjoyed love stories in various non-romance genres; this is just a story of your young sister falling in love with another girl and then running off with her. I saw the twist coming, which shouldn't impact the quality of the story but yet the story had nothing going for it anyway. The characters aren't bad, the setting isn't bad, their struggles aren't bad, it just wasn't interesting; it had not a single thing going for it. It just happened, and then it was over. Story is certainly the primary focus of the game, the experience finishes before it even starts; Full Bright's narrative will leave a lackluster taste in your mouth, it's clear that the story wants to be meaningful yet never works for it.   The game's atmosphere is one of the few things I think game does fairly well with. It's a nice flashback to the mid-90s. From Street Fighter to Pulp fiction, every little reference fits perfectly. It was nice seeing the details over the CD/LP player. Even the cover art of the textbooks scream 90s. They nailed making the house feel like it belongs in the 90s. The house itself feels creepy, not a soul in the home that seems both alive with knit-knacks everywhere while dead with some barren rooms filled only with boxes. The few places that feel they have life to them are both refreshing and creepy. The darkness certainly adds another edge to the creepiness yet all this creepiness and potiental terror soon washes away when you realize the game only cares about the light exploration; adding no depth to the atmosphere. While the game has an eye for detail of the era, it lacks detail in everything else. The house is lifeless in the wrong way possible, there were no extra details provided to the experience. Add some occasional random ambient noise, some creepy squeeking of the boards, a more complex engine that gives some realism to the world instead of everything you grab feeling like the lifeless assets that they are, etc. Hell, in the game you find your sister's book that goes on about her hunting ghosts, that could of been a really nice trigger to have some more creepy things happen in the house. Perhaps some creepy noises as said before, or an object making a strange shadow in a room. Yet all that potiental isn't used at all. The game's details begins and ends at the recontruction of a 90s home. The house provides no other purpose other than a lifeless realm to find some details about the family, with the sound of the thunder storm outside looping again and again. For such a short game that the developers pride in an immerisve experience, I expected the home to be leagues more complex.  Graphics weren't anything impressive. In fact, the most impressive thing visually is the background of the main menu; I would of vastly prefered the game used that style instead of this vaguely realisitic style. The characters in the photos look strange and unintentionally hilarious with the aesthetic. These photos even clash with the celebrity photos that were obviously ripped from real pictures instead of applying the style used with the family photos. The textures letters, books, and anything else with text are impressive; it's nice that you can read the words even without selecting the pictures when most games would have them be a pixel mess until you select them.  Sound design is minimal and lacking. I didn't expect some amazing audio but I expected something leagues more immersive. Again, the atmosphere could of been built up much better with the right use of sound design. Even some footsteps would have been nice.  Voice acting is nice. I wouldn't say it was anything amazing, it was simple and nice. I got no feeling that the actresses were trying too hard, they fit their roles nicely.  Level design isn't terrible nor is it good, it's always interesting to discover little short cuts or areas you didn't notice before. Gone's Home length ultimately hurts the level design for its only meant to be gone through once. The game is straightforward, if you go from room to room properly, there is no need to visit a room twice. You can just finish the game within 30 seconds if you remember a specific hidden room. The level design offers a possible 'oh wow' moment that only works once. There is no lasting appeal for the level design because of the limited style of its content. The house is small for length and content standards, ruining all lasting appeal.  The gameplay has you explore the house and read messages and sometimes listening to them. That's it. Point and click games have mastered with variety in the gameplay way before Gone Home was in development yet Gone Home didn't even try this. Exploration is limited and utlimately wasted in such level design.  Ultimately Gone Home feels like a prototype of a game, meant to wow potiental investors with a basic guideline of the game compressed into a lengthy demo. While in reality, Gone Home is a complete game sold for 20 dollars filled with potiental yet is outdone by any other point and click game that has come decade before it. Full bright prides Gone Home as a immersive, engaging tale told by the exploration in a seemingly dead home while in reality it is a game with a empty storyline that wants to engage you but never does, a house designed to immerse you yet gives up five minutes in, and gameplay that doesn't attempt anything new after the first room.   This game feels like critic bait, critics went crazy over it apparantly because it offers a meaningful story. It instead feels like they are going crazy over it because it's a minimal game in a industry filled with complex games, a minimal game that concerns a plot about two girls falling in love. The story has no substance but the fact it concerns a story about characters that are not in the forefront in games, it gets rave reviews. Or even more simply, reviewers being paid off or pushing an agenda, as video game journalism has frequently been subject to. Love stories have been done better in games that don't concern love stories, hell I find KotOR II did a better lovestory with Handmaiden and that's completely optional.   Don't believe people that say Gone Home isn't a game, it certainly is a game, it's a bad game.",

I completely *get* what they were trying to do with this game, and it works for what it is, but the entire experience fell flat on it's face by the end.  Know going in that what the game touts itself to be on the store page, is not what you get in the game. There is no real mystery, intrique, or anything worth noting in the plot that makes it fit the description other than, 'you get home from a year abroad, and no one is home - find out why!' and that is literally it. This game was no different than a 'find the hidden object' style of game, with the difference being that you are in a 3d world.",

The game is probably better if you start off with an expectation like that because you'll either A) decide then to never play Gone Home, or B) play it while keeping your hopes low. The story is okay, you find clues and then the game usually confirms your suspicions with sporadic pieces of monologue. Sound and music-- there isn't much. There is mostly silence and the occassional thunder and I liked that. When the game's music does come up it's because you triggered it and it has these warm tones that make you feel kinda good. Then there's the punk cassettes. The songs fit the game, although I found them to be annoying, barely tolerable at best. There isn't much to the gameplay. Not a whole lot of purpose to your inventory. You can interact with almost any object but there usually isn't any significance to it. Overall my expectations were too high going into this game. I kept thinking something scary was going to happen or something hugely serious, like finding your sister hanging from a noose in the next room, walking in on your parent's beating one another, your Uncle's ghost chasing you, or stumbling upon your old neighbor who came back for his Street Fighter game and is now going insane chopping up your whole family while you were away relaxing across the world for a whole f*cking year. Seriously, how well off are you that you can go on vacation for an entire year? Anyway, at one point the game basically tells you straightforward that you're going to walk in on your sister banging. And you're like wow! This game is nuts! This could be hilarious and interesting! Then the story turns and it doesn't happen. Like I said, nothing ever happens. Gone Home is really just a waste of a few hours. It's like reading a fairly dull short book that you can move around in.  I originally bought this game because a friend and I thought it looked hilarious, yet people were saying that it was good. Ya know how sometimes you just want to watch a movie or play a game that seems like it might be so corny that it becomes entertaining? At worst, I figured even if it's not funny apparently it should still be a good game based on people's reviews. I got it on sale. Thought we'd have a few light beers and a lighthearted time, but the game's funny-but-not-supposed-to-be parts are too few and far between and the serious parts are too frequent that you can't even enjoy the game in that cheap way either.  So if you can't enjoy Gone Home in a serious way, and you can't enjoy it in a ridiculous way, then I have no idea why you'd still want to try to play this game.",

            "review_text": "Gone Home is a first-person walking simulator from the same team that brought you the Minerva's Den DLC for Bioshock 2. You play as a girl who just got back from Europe. She enters her parents house at the dead of night only to find it completely abandoned. The only clue of your family's whereabouts is a note on the door from your sister asking you not to look for her.  First off, let's get the positives out of the way. The house looks pretty good. There's tons of clues, little notes to read, objects to interact with etc.It looks very believable, almost as if people actually live there unlike most video game mansions you find. I almost felt nostalgic while exploring it. It reminded me of the times when you were kid home alone at night and you were so scared of your own house, then you turn on the lights and wonder why you were even afraid to begin with. It's very silly to think about, but that's what I thought about the first few minutes of the game. There's plenty to just mess around like inserting casette tapes in a radio. So much to discover in your first playthrough. In fact, this sole element was what made me really get into the game for a while. There's a lot to discover about the family which sadly takes the backseat from the main plot. It's almost a flaw seeing better plot points being almost completely dismissed in favor for an average love story that really has nothing interesting about it.   Unfortunately, those are the only aspects I can give this game credit for. Gone Home has very little gameplay to it. You need find three specific codes which is pretty much the only thing you need to make progress. Alternatively, you can skip it and beat the game in 47 seconds. I even find it hard to classify this as a point and click as even though it somewhat resembles the genre, it doesn't involve the brainteasers and puzzles its known for. There's no depth to be found here. If you know what you're doing and with the right settings, you can easily beat the game in seconds. It's not that I have anything against the so-called 'walking simulator' type of games as I love The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but even then Gone Home just feels empty and shallow. I understand that the game wants to tell a story. Fair enough, but if there's nothing interesting going on and I discover everything that needs to be discovered on my first playthrough then what's the point? The note on the door you find within seconds of starting up the game has all the answers you really need. A normal playthrough will only take you one hour. It's almost insultingly short compared to any other visual novel or walking simulator I've ever played.  So if there's no real gameplay, Gone Home needs to fall back on its story. That aspect is obviously the focus so I'll cut it some slack and say that if the story was good, this game would have gotten a pass. The way it depicts said story is awful though. Once again, I have to remind you that it's a mystery game with no mystery. You find out through voice recordings which is basically an excuse to have the game take place in 90's so the whole thing can be narrated that your sister is in love with another woman. First off, this begs the question, why couldn't this narrative be told through environmental storytelling? That's what the game seems to be designed for and the development team even succeeded in certain area's with their previous project on Bioshock. It would certainly make me think more highly of this game, but that's not how it's done and as a result, it feels more like an audiobook than anything else. The story itself isn't anything to write home about either. Some argue how earthshattering it is to feature a lovestory between two women and how it breaks norms, barriers or something. While it's true that this is mostly uncharted territories for video games (not that lesbians are never depicted in video games), there are millions of books and made for TV movies structured exactly the same way. Replace a few names here and there and you've got Gone Home Part Deux. There's nothing new here at all. Not to mention that the characters are so bland that they might as well have been anything else. They could have been a straight couple in a different decade and the story honestly wouldn't have made a difference. At first, I thought the timeperiod was going to be used to show how homosexuals were treated back then, but it does not take that direction. The prejudice from the parents isn't serious enough to make me feel anything about these characters which creates a second problem. Their romance is so perfect and happy that you have to wonder what the conflict was supposed to be or why they even bothered telling this story, because as it is, it did nothing for me and considering how it doesn't tackle a lot of problems LGBT-people deal with on a daily basis like prejudice or maybe show us flashes from how much worse it was back then from a historical point of view, it probably won't do a lot for them either.  If the developers didn't think that Gone Home was worth the 20 dollars asking price and it was free to play, then I would just deem the game a failure and move on, but this is not the case. They certainly must have thought highly about this game when I can find books or even films for less than half the price with the exact same story. Did I mention it took me one hour to beat this game? That's why I advise you not to buy it. Please understand this. I'm not complaining that it is not a 'real video game'. Some of my favorite games are essentially visual novels though admitedly still more of a reliance on knowledge and skill. I'm also not saying that it is bad to have women and/or LGBT-characters as your main characters in games nor am I saying that it has to feature combat or something, but this is not the way to do it. Writers take note: when you write a character who is homosexual, don't make that their only personality trait as if that even counts for a personality trait. Most people are you know, people with a developed character. There are much better story driven games on many platforms including Steam.",

If you really want something different and quick (1.5 hrs) then this is for you, but if you want something thats more of a traditional game then this ain't gonna cut it.   They advertise the game as being a story exploration video game and thats exactly what it is. You come home from a long trip and you walk around the house finding clues to your family's whereabouts. You move room to room finding notes and getting a feel for what this family is like until you reach the end of the story. There are no puzzles to solve so the story kind of just tells itself as you enter each area of the house and the story is as simple as the gameplay.  The game of the year awards aren't too surprising because the game should be recognized but don't expect anythng stellar.

However, in the end I use the word 'play' more in the sense of 'I played a DVD' rather than 'I played a game'.  I did enjoy the journey that this game offers, but the whole experience left me wanting. The story wasn't enough to make up for the lack of meaningful interaction, and the 'gameplay' was non-existent. As far as I can tell, nobody has spent more than 3 hours in this game, and there is no replay value at all.  Some would argue that approaching this as a game is a mistake, but no matter how I view it I just feel ripped-off. As a story, I deduced the plot from the trailer; as a game...well...there isn't one.  My disappointment can be summarized by one moment (hopefully spoiler free): In your sisters room is a locker with a 4-digit code. So I searched her room for clues to what it might be: Kurt Cobain's birthday and death day, the serial number from a motorbike, and similar 4 digit combinations. I later found that the code was written on a bit of paper split in two and left in random locations. It was at this point I realized no brain-work was required for this game. It's just follow the crumbs until the end.  On a technical level, the physics is totally bonkers, which really detracts from the immersion. Pillows act like they are made from dense rubber. And there is a massive problem with the junk-to-clue ratio...by the end of the game I was actively trying to break plates in the kitchen, just to give the interaction some kind of purpose, but they just give a dull bounce as if made from the same dense rubber as everything else.  Essentially this game is an interesting exploration of the medium, and some people love it, but for me it simply isn't worth the money. Exploration isn't enjoyable, and the plot is too short and predictable. It is worth playing, but not worth buying.",

Every corner of the empty ominous house filled me with dread, only to find those feelings in the end were for absolutely nothing; it's just an empty house.  This game is getting appraise from indie gamers and hipster game critics alike for its subject matter and off-the-beaten-path (read: explore and examine items) gameplay style. Disregard this. If you want this sort of game, go buy Dear Esther immediately and get a much spookier, better written, more beautiful and engaging game. People seem to go nuts about Gone Home for the way it approaches story, but as a long time adventure gamer, I came out of this very disappointed I even spent $10 on it. You spend a little under two hours going through a deserted house reading scrawled notes and throwing every item out of drawers, making a mess of the place. If you really want to see what the fuss is about, wait til it drops to $2.50 or less. Otherwise, get a Telltale game, Dear Esther, or virtually any other adventure game on Steam for a better experience. Stay away from this one or proceed with caution. 5.5/10.",

It’s unfortunate because the rooms in the house were beautifully made, and it really did make you feel like you were exploring a real family’s house, with lots of backstory and substance. There were some cool mechanics (like ‘put back’), and the sound and interaction did really immerse you. But the actual story felt severely lacking and, frankly, quite mediocre. All of the atmosphere that had been built up lead nowhere, and I was left with many unanswered questions and devoid of any accomplishment by the end.  It took me a mere 70 minutes to complete, and I didn’t feel that I was rushing through it. Fortunately, I had purchased the game for just $4.99 on Humble Bundle, but if I had paid the full price of £14.99, I would feel really ripped off.

The fact that this game exists when there are so many better horror games and yuri visual novels out there and the fact that this got so many awards is basically a big middle finger to both, fresh from the ♥♥♥♥ of the feminazi agenda.

            "review_text": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW (Unless you don't want it to be :D)** So, where to begin with Gone Home? In a nutshell, Gone Home is another entry in the 'visual novel' genre of games comprised by other titles like Dear Esther, The Writer, and so on and so forth. Despite the greatness of other such games, Gone Home is terrible and not worth an ounce of your time. So here's why:   Plot Strength   Without spoiling anything, the basis of Gone Home's plot is that you are Katie Greenbriar; a girl just returning from a semester abroad in Europe only to find her home in Oregon, which her family recently moved into, 'mysteriously' empty. Subsequently, it is your job to snoop around the house like Sherlock Homes and uncover clues as to what is happening. Then (still no spoilers) the backstory behind why the house is 'abandoned' has to do with your sister Sam who is in 11th grade and experiencing her first love interest. I will not delve any further into the story just in case I can't persuade you to not buy this abhorrent piece of trash, but all I can tell you is that within 45 minutes of playing the game (about half way through in my case, and yes i did pick up every item and explore every room) you will know EXACTLY how the game will end. I kid you not; Gone Home's 'surprise ending' is about as remarkable as watching an episode of Dora the Explorer (that is to say not much at all). Now, moving on, let me adress why this game is so critically aclaimed. As you can see on metacritic, Gone Home has an absurdly high (imo) average critic rating of 86, while the user rating is 5.4. The reasoning behind this is because Gone Home is one of those games that might as well say in the description (and pardon my french) 'DEAR GAME CRITICS, if you do not hail me as one of the greatest games of all time and the most moving game you've every played, you will be pigeon-holed by the rest of the game-critics community and seen as an unsophisticated, uneducated, arrogant f**ktard.' Let me elaborate further: Since Gone Home is protrayed by the Fullbright Company as a 'moving', 'artistic', and 'expressive' story, game critics want to also seem 'sophisticated' and 'artistic' in that same respect by waxing lyrical about Gone Home and 'how personally it spoke to them'. Moreover, Gone Home has many (forced and annoying) references to the '90's in it and seeing as A LOT of game reviewers today were born in the late '80's and early '90's they eat that stuff up. To finish off this section, let's examine why Gone Home is in no way whatsoever 'artistic', 'moving', or 'sophisticated'. The story is probably the most pathetic and lame thing I have ever witnesses in any medium. The writing is down right melodramatic (which is about the only thing that matches up with the '90's :-/) and fake; as if they had a 14 year old girl at The Gap pick up the nearest pencil she could find, take a napkin from the foodcourt, and write out the first love story that came to her head. There is nothing unique whatsoever about Sam's lovestory and it fully embraces every 'budding relationship' cliche known to man. Moreover, despite some people who don't recommend this game saying the voice acting is exceptional, I beg to differ. The voices sound flat and fail to convey little emotion. In short, every journal, story, and note you read that has to do with Sam's love story (pretty much all of them) adds up to a pile of bad writing not even fit for a live action Nickelodeon show.    Game Structure   Gone home's gamplay is flat out bad; there's no other word for it, it's just bad. Before I start ranting again, here is THE ONLY thing I will commend Gone Home for, and that is how it manages to make the house feel lived in; it's a very large house, but there's just enough furniture, books, belongings, etc. to make the house feel real and the decorating is quite realistic which probably helped cloud-headed pretentious reviewers feel more 'immersed' in the game. Now, back to the bad aspects which, you guessed it, is literally everything else! The ONLY interaction you will ever have in Gone Home is picking up miscellaneous objects which sometimes trigger Sam's 'journal entries/notes for Katie', opening doors, and entering lock combonations. Believe me you, I've played many adventure games in my time so I'm very used to this type of gameplay; hell, my favorite game of all time is The Walking Dead The Game (which I played on my PS Vita so please do not respond 'You don't have The Walking Dead a**hole :-/'). However, Gone Home is, simply put, boring when you are not progressing the story (that is if you even like the story which, obviously, I do not); all you do is pick up poorly textured objects, and fumble around with '90's memorabailia; rotating them around like a whirlgig (Katie would make a great chemist due to her exceptional rotating skills which you'll be doing every god-damn 10 seconds only to find that you will never find any hidden messages, images, or compartments on these objects in the entire game). In fact, taking out the ability to pick up and examine objects in Gone Home would vastly improve it seeing as the inclusion of it in the first place is a failed attempt at adding 'some' interaction/gameplay to keep the player interested, but in actuallity, this ability makes the game even more drawn out than my grandpa's undies since almost every player, including myself, will take the time to pick up EVERY....FREAKIN'...OBJECT. Moreover, this would streamline the story and allow the game to do what it truly intends: rip off it's players with a truly terrible story. Other games, like Dear Esther, already realized that literally no interaction whatsoever is better than some so that the player can realize what the true nature of the game is and not be confused by being able to pick up more objects than there are milk containers in Half Life 2.   Value   Go ahead and look at Gone Home's store page and look for it's price. You will find it is 20 U.S. dollars, thus leading you to believe it must have a significant amount of content. I mean, by that logic, Gone Home should offer as much content as games like CS GO, FTL, Spelunky, The Walking Dead, Rust, Skyrim, Dark Souls 1 and other games that are at very similar price points on steam. Moreover, for literally under a dollar, you could buy a humle bundle with amazing games like Bioshock and Xcom: UFO Defense from the 2k Humble Bundle or Thief Gold and Hitman from the Square Enix Humble Bundle that's on sale at this point in time. Well, jokes on you if you thought anything even close to that was true, because what if I told you that you can beat Gone Home in less than a minute when you know what to do? What's more, what if I told you I've actually read forum posts/stories of people accidently finding the hidden room that holds the key which you need to finish the game within minutes of their first play through, then proceeding to finish the game when they think they're merely doing what they're supposed to, only to find out they already beat the piece of trash? Well, whether you believe these things or not, they (much like Robert Ripley's stories) are horrifyingly true. Gone Home isn't worth $20, or $3, or even $1 since that same amount of money would be better spent on ANYTHING else, hell go buy a chicken burger at McDonald's! In conclusion, Gone Home is a bad game, made by bad writers, for pretentious people, and you should NEVER buy it. Also, for those brave enough, here's the spoiler of THE WHOLE GAME (yes, it's that short),     Sam is a lesbian (which her parents dissaprove of her being) and she falls in love with a girl named Lonnie. Unfortunately, Lonnie entered the military and they must now separate. However, Sam and Lonnie decide they must be together, so Lonnie deserts the military and they run off together. Also, the only reason the parents are gone is because they are on vacation for their anniversary.   ",

But for me: a short single playthrough with a decent story isn't really worth the money, even with all the exploration and cool environments .",

It's the gaming equivalent of one of those oddball 'powerful studies of human emotion' that always end up in the Critic's top 10 lists that no-one ever has ever heard of.  I'm not going to add or subtract points based on the game's genre - this game is upfront and honest about what it is and if that's not your cup of tea, you likely would be aware of this before you hit the buy button.  I guess my biggest problem is that it's, oddly, all style and no substance. The atmosphere it evokes is first class - the audio is fantastic, the voice acting is excellent, and the soundtrack is great. The devs obviously went to great lengths to create an image of a 1990s house, with dozens of nostalgic references for us old farts who were growing up back then. And on top of this, it creates a genuine unease in the player from the get go. Straight away you read a note on the door that is downright ominous, and the answerphone has messages from a sobbing unknown girl desperate to speak to your sister. The place is empty... apparently, the thunderstorm outside and creaking floorboards start to play tricks with your awareness. Was that just a shadow or is someone else in the house? What the hell is going on?  If it had stuck like this then it would have been great, but at the risk of spoiling it, the storyline goes nowhere (my initial guess as to what might have happened turned out to be 90% accurate, and that was after 10 mins), and as time goes on your initial belief that there is more to this story then meets the eye is is proven false and you're left with a, frankly, mundane tale that raises questions about what the point behind the game was.  Therein lies the problem. A lack of combat and a lack of puzzles are quite acceptable in this genre, what isn't is a lack of interesting story.   It's a hard game to review. On some level I can see why it got such a reception amongst the critics - as I say, it's atmosphere is fantastic. Unfortunately, the storyline just isn't up the atmosphere it generates, and the fact that it's totally 100% linear mean it has little replayability. £15 for this game is far too much - I bought it for about £5 back in a sale and err on the side of 'yes' as to whether it's worth that.  If you see it going cheap, then by all means, get this. While it lasts, it's great - it's just not a game to play if you're hoping for an interesting story to go with it's interesting premise.",

The description states that you enter the house to find the answer to where your family is. You DON'T GET an answer to where your parents are. That makes absolutely no sense. What is the purpose of the game, then? A lot of walking, tipping over random objects for no reason, just to further an extremely cliche lesbian love plot. If the love interest had been a man, it would have been the most basic story ever told in a video game. I guess switching it with a female made the game edgey and inventive and brave instead of just being absolute non-effort rubbish.  To be fair I enjoyed walking around and turning all of the lights on in the house. There weren't puzzles so much as simply scouring every room until you find the item that opens the next area, unlocks the door, or contains a code for a lock. The game falls very short of delivering a worthwhile story and manages to give the story it DOES have in such a slow and stilted manner as to hold no emotional value whatsoever. A large majority of the text could simply be skipped as it has no bearing on the story whatsoever.  All in all, not worth even near $20. If you can get it on sale for $1.99 or such, it may be worth checking out. I wish it had been better, because a game that actually expanded on this story and had more substance in general would have been a great asset to sexual/gender equality in gaming.",

Your parents are not around and your sister well, you have no idea where she has gone.   You'll find yourself throughout the majorty of the game just walking around a 90's style house picking up items and placing them back where you found them, whilst picking up random items and notes that are relevant to the story. It's more of an interactive story / walking simulator. You won't run from monsters, you won't feel scared or uneasy within the game. Although for myself I did feel very uneasy as the story progressed, it made me uncomfortable but almost predictable as to what was next. I felt as if the story was slapping me in the face with a message but not in a good way, not in a way I could walk away with a clear message of enjoyment, that's not to say that the story is not enjoyable for most. It is enjoyable to quest on throughout to find out what happens next as the parts of dialogue are constant little cliffhangers and encourage you to progress. The effects in the game are good as it brings atmosphere and life to what is going on and the ambient style sounds blend well and give off a relaxed feel.   Based on personal play, I cannot recommend Gone Home as it doesn't grasp your attention as if you want more, the story isn't interesting enough to want to play on although when finishing it you'll be left with a face of 'Is that it?'. An easy way to put it is that the game is boring, although if the game is on sale and you want a quick story maybe I could recommend this game but for a full price it is not worth it.",

But it's not.  You turn on the lights and that's it, it stops being dark. You never meet anyone and nothing really happens except from you gathering notes around the house to figure out where everyone is.  You can pick up and interact with almost every objects in the game. So when I started, I went around to pick up and inspect every single thing I could find. The thing is, it's useless. There's nothing to it. There's no real 'puzzle' or anything in the game, there's only very few objects that you do need to look at.  The game can easily be finished under two hours. Probably half that or even less if you're not like me an inspect every single corners of the place. The story is... Okay. I kinda liked the narrative and I was really curious to know how the story would unravel. Except there wasn't really much to, I was pretty let down in the end. I figure out the 'plot' about halfway through the game then just felt like it dragged on until the 'big reveal' where I was like 'Oh okay yeah that makes sense... That's it?'.  The game's description makes it sound like something paranormal is going on but I wouldn't ever describe what happened as a 'mystery'. This 'mystery' was mildly interesting at best.  Now don't get me wrong. It's not like I cringed listening to the dialogue, it wasn't badly written. The story is not BAD. It's just that it's so minor on its own. It does touch subjects that some people might be less comfortable or open with or that some people could relate more to. But the things this game discussed were pretty obvious to me.  Clearly, a consirable amount of work went into this. But this game is in no way, shape or form worth 22$. I feel bad because of the work that went into this but it just wasn't all that entertaining. You can buy all 5 episode of Life is Strange for the exact same price and these two games which are story-based are on astronomically different levels. I got Gone Home (and the soundtrack, so the 28$ edition) as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 15 which I spent 10$ on. ...Let's just pretend that those 10$ were for all the other games and not this one. I would buy 10 copies of all 5 episodes of Life is Strange before I would spend 1$ on this game, I mean it.  But... Considering I essentially got this game for free... It was okay. If you did get it for free, play through it but don't search around too much, there's not much to find. Finish the game and don't play it again. It's better in your memories than it is while you play it.  If you really want to play an overpriced walking simulator though, go buy Dear Esther instead. It looks better, sounds better, the narration is better, the story is actually interesting, the plot is a actually a plot and it's half the price (yet still too expensive for a 1h game).",

I guess I should've picked up the hint when in the trailer the narrator says something about 'a girl named Lonnie.' Other than that, I loved listening to the punk music and exploring the house, for the most part.",

            "review_text": "Kinda sad the amount of people who love this boring story. You're bored pretty much the entire time, by the way.  The graphics are quite nice, the voice acting is good, and the house you're in is very well done, sadly that's about all that's good.  A very annoying gameplay problem is the mouse movement. When you move your mouse it moves a certain amount of the camera, when because you move your mouse a good bit it will look like your mouse is moving the camera slowly. Kinda like in 2D games how far your character moves from a quick tap of the W. In this game the camera movement distance is very noticeable and annoying. It is very choppy and turning down your sensitivity won't help, nor will any settings.  Another gameplay issue is ALL YOU DO IS WALK AROUND, OPEN DOORS AND CLICK ON THINGS. That is THE ENTIRE game.   They threw in a really bad and predictable lesbian story mentioning but hardly continuing to explain other family members. You won't connect with your player at all and you can complete the game in literally an hour if you know what you're doing, counting all the hidden things (which aren't much and are pretty lame.) If you get lost you'll be spending a good long time clicking on every door until you find one that unlocks.  This is what you'd expect out of a free game. The only thing showing a hint of interest is when you get a creepy vibe like something going to jump scare you or is watching you, but that never happens. I'd say Passing Pineview Forrest is a bigger game than this, and that's also a flipping walking simulator (did I mention all you do in this game is walk around and click on things?)  Seriously, how are 74% of these people satisfied with spending their money on a game that has less content than most other horror/walking simulator free games made by 15 year olds, and has the story you'd have figured out ten minutes into the game, with the most hilariously bad ending. You find a bloody book saying she's run away with her lover. OOHHH WOW, HOW ORIGINAL. I NEVER SAW THAT COMING.  Seriously, this may be cheap, but it is a game you'd download for free then uninstall five minutes in when you realized how boring it was. Don't waste your money on this, go buy a much more interesting walking simulator like Stanley(s?) Parables (I hope I said that right,) not this less than an hour long garbage.",

But even I found this one underwhelming.

Unlike some walking simulators this one has about the depth of a pop song, there is no great mystery, no plot twist, no deeper meaning, just two    female    kids falling in love.

            "review_text": "First off, It's not a game. It's an interactive short story. When I say short I mean 1-2 hours depending on if you go threw everything.   Possible Spoilers Below! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!  The Good:  Story is a decent one. Even though it was dragged on for way longer than it should have been. (Yes I know, the 'Game' is short as hell, but honestly the story could of been told in 30 seconds on one piece of paper from your sister as soon as you walked into the house)  Nostalgia: if you grew up in the 90's you probably can connect to somethings that were laying around the house.  Emotion: I guess if you have experienced some of the things that your 'Game' sister when through. In example: being a teenager who is stuggling with personal things and school, being bullied or growing up gay you may have felt a little more emotional than I have while playing. I however felt happy with how things turned out in the end, even though I felt cheated by the endless rollercoaster the 'Game' made me ride even though I didn't have to, to come to the ultimate ending.   The Bad:  Gameplay: It's not a game. If walking around a virtual world and picking things up counts as a game then I guess you can call it a game. However my idea of game involves a little more interaction than just walking around a house picking up pieces of paper.   Length: Short, not short enough? I guess I'm torn because I feel as if the story could be wrapped up in the first 5 minutes but then it wouldn't be much of a 'Game'. Still all in all its very short for the price tag.  Price: Way to much for the length. If this game was less than 5 dollars I wouldn't have a problem with it. However I paid almost $7 and it was 66% off. $20 full price is something you pay for a game that lasts 10+ hours and has some replay value.  Summary:  The only redeming value I got from buying this game is the story kind of sticks with you. I'm happy the way it ended. I felt good for most of the characters and how they ended up. I wish there was more of a story, maybe shedding more light on Oscar even though seems there's a pretty obvious assumption of why he was the way he was.

You could probably stretch that out to 2 hours if you obsessively listen to every cassette tape, I guess.  I can also see the game having perhaps a larger appeal if you were a teenager in the early 90s. Although I will say that even as a teenager in the late 80s, I'm surprised at the use of cassette tapes throughout the game vs. CDs.  One final thing I forgot to mention - the Mac port appears to have technical issues. I saw black blobs throughout the game play.

This describes Gone Home perfectly. The store page in Steam looks great. It looks like a mystery game with a 90's flashback kind of twist.  Then you start playing. The game environment is gorgeous to say the least. The way the lights and shadows look, the sound of the raging thunderstorm outside, your footsteps on the old wooden floorboards. The ambiance is beautiful. The developers did a great job of sucking you into the game world. But that's sadly where the praise stops.  When they said it's a short game, they aren't kidding. You can finish the game in an hour or two, depending on how thorough you are in your exploration. The story is rather vague to start out, which I suppose is good for a mystery game. But halfway through all the pieces just suddenly and abruptly fall into place, and you know the answer to all your questions at once. There are still a few things left to do before the game is 'done', but you already know how it all ends.  As for the story plot, the word cliche comes to mind, and the little side story (I won't tell you what it is should you still want to play) abruptly ends in a trail of loose ends. This is sad because it was actually more interesting than the main plot.  Oh well. At least there was the nostalgia.",

The story is your generic highschool love story, the game's graphics are bland, and the engine loves to jutter for no reason.

The story is about going through the personal belongings of your parents and sister to figure out why they are not home, which is a bit weird TBH, and involves a lot of teenaged angst.

            "review_text": "The only reason I own this is because it was part of an indie bundle that contained some good games I liked the look of. £15 for what amounts to a short novella is a ridiculous price really so even though I am the sort of person who wants to give everything a fair go that initial price barrier is what stopped me.  So I finally got around to seeing what the fuss was about and while I wouldn't call it terrible at all, it's certainly not GOTY material. I started off looking at everything I could (highly recommended to lower mouse sensitivity). Even though I had known about the hidden room with the key to the attic I left it til last since I felt I was going to explore this as intended. Interaction isn't heavy, you can pick up things like cups and specifically placed books but not everything else. There was a letter that lampshaded the whole 'spooky flickering lights' trope that could lead you into thinking this is a horror game. It is not. It is much like exploring the ruins of a building in Fallout as you read old notes, follow along the corridors and come across the remains of the people and what happened to them. However since there is no combat, travelling outside the house or interacting with other people they had to ramp up the effort they put into the story and 'level design'.  The game is teenage lesbian love story with a heavy dose of rebelion. Girl meets girl, girl ends up becoming punk and rebelious like other girl, parents don't like what is going on, other girl has to leave, ect. While the summary may make it seem rather tripe, it's not that bad, it's just not that amazing either. The short story format probably hinders the kind of story they are trying to tell here since you don't get to know the characters long enough for what you find out about them to have much of an impact. While there are a few members of the family the story doesn't touch much on anyone else besides the youngest daughter. In fact you may forget you are playing as the eldest due to how little use of this character is taken. Despite this I actually was disappointed that I heard so little about the mother and father compared to the daughter. Pretty much everything in Gone Hom revolves around the youngest daughter and her girlfriend.  Set design is pretty good for the most part. There are places where thought is put into why certain objects are where they are, you can tell what happened there as a result. There's the rejection letter close to the alchohol, the pillow fort in the TV room, the opened clothes drawers in the parents room and the bottle of hair dye in the bathroom.  The last of which brings me to my next point, the journal entries. As you explore the house you will come across various letters and items. When you pick up certain ones a narrated journal entry of the star of the game is played. I assume that these are all from the book you pick up at the end. Of course the problem with telling the meat of the story through this journal is if you don't tear the pages out and spread them across the house then you have to leave them intact and the player spends most of their time wandering around not knowing much until the end where they spend 5 minutes reading up on a large percentage of the story.  So instead you get this story fed to you though intangible 'audiologs' that are attached to what appear to be normal items at first glance until you put them down and cue the narrator. This isn't bad per se but it's clear that the developers had more focus on this being a story told through traditional means than they would have liked. They wanted the story to be told through exploring the house and picking up bits and pieces but they ended up relying a bit too heavily on the audio logs.  I smiled a bit at some points where nostalgia was used for audience hooks. There's a bunch of nostalgia spread around which seems to be one of the things that got critics hooked. The other is the lesbian romance.  Had the star of the show been a boy or the girlfriend switched with a boy then I'm sure people wouldn't have given this anywhere as much praise as it has gotten. While the VA for the star of the story delivered her lines brilliantly and with emotion, she was still voicing an average short story. The story was too short for the characters to properly hook you at all and the plot of it was rather standard life. I wouldn't be surprised if critics praised this because anything less would have possibly risked them being labeled as homophobes.  A book I read, The Lovely Bones, is somewhat similar to this in ways. Besides dealing with mature subjects it essentially features an outsider viewing their family unseen and how they live their lives. However the differences are plentiful. Besides being a written novel it benefits from it's medium and allows you to connect to the characters in the way that Gone Home didn't manage to do. The Lovely Bones also focuses on various family members including that of the outsider rather than mostly on a single one. You get a better sense of relationships as a result too.  Had Gone Home instead had the main character be a ghost viewing their family it could have really told a far more immersive story. You could have the family members actually be in the house interacting with each other rather than reading letters in an empty house. The story could have gone on a lot longer as a result allowing you to connect with the characters more. Why you could even affect at least the progression of the story by interacting with objects to influence the family members to do certain things. Though this would require far more writing, modeling and even animation to do this.  -----  Gone Home is an average story where the focus is clearly on one character and the others just serve support roles. Exploration is looking around a room, finding objects and letters that trigger story points and finding hidden rooms and passages because spooky inherited house reasons. There is a little thinking at some points to find and uncover certain points of the story but not much else.  All in all it's a risky buy even at 75% off. Not at all deserving of it's praise but it tries some interesting things that will hopefully inspire better people to have a crack at something great. Ask yourself, 'Am I the kind of person that is drawn to cheap pandering that it can make me like an average story more than I ever would rather than feel somewhat insulted at the attempt'. If Yes you might like Gone Home, if no then think about it before trying this because that teenage lesbian romance and rebellion story is the selling point here, not the exploration aspect.",

In some ways it was like seeing my own life personified as someone else, and there were quite a few things that really hit home with me. That being said, when I played the game I felt an intense craving for something that just wasn’t there. I was expecting to be challenged, to have to fill-in-the-blanks myself, to care about the characters for who they were and not just because I could relate to  one  of them….and I didn’t really find any of this in Gone Home. It was a little different and kind of fun, but it wasn’t particularly satisfying and the story didn’t leave any lasting impression on me.  As for recommending it, I can’t really recommend it as a  game . As an interactive story  YES , but not as a game, or for its gameplay.  (If this sounds like something you’d be into make sure to wait for a sale and pay no more than a couple bucks for it! Peace! ^o^ ❤ )",

Gone home however has seemed to miss the biggest part those click-and-point adventure games had; a compelling story and actual interaction. Rather than focusing on characters that were interacting with each other, the player instead plays the cameraman. You as kaitlyn have no point in the story because you didn't have any interaction when the game starts. The game instead should have focused on the father coming home, only to realize his daughters gone and discover an entire world he really didn't know about. That would have been interesting because the father could have commented on his opinions and views of what happened, and we would have actually seen character development as the father realizes he'd done something wrong.  Instead, what they did is focus on a character who didn't have any major interaction and instead acts like the cameraman. It would have made more sense story wise if you weren't even in the game. The parents would have been interesting cameramen because they would have had revelations about their daughters world they largely ignored or pretended didn't exist, you as kaitlyn don't have that option because you weren't their to have those original interactions. Instead, the story entirely focuses on the wrong characters and the WRONG interactions.

There are some minor puzzles but for the most part the game is simply find clue, listen to narration, find next clue, listen to next narration... Gone Home is not so much a game but a story with complicated pace control, not that there is anything wrong with that but its not something I am interested in from a video game.",

First and foremost I should point out that, as far as games go, this one wasn't bad, I'd even call it good, but where it fell apart was telling an orignal story set in an orignal enviorment. From the very start of the game I was able to predict every single twist and turn in the plot from a mile away, while at the same time hoping that the story wasn't going in the direction it was (now mind you this has nothing to do with the romance plot, I'm actually a sucker for those, my problem lay in how they executed said plot). By the end I saw hope for what I thought could have been a decent, if cliched ending to what I would call an above average game, but then the ending came around and exactly what I thought would happen, and I feared would happen happened, creating an ending that just felt sappy and unrealsitc. There were several moments throughout the game where I thought from a writting persepctive 'Hell, I could do better than this'.   But of course the story isn't everything this game has to offer, there's also the walking......which is exactly as it sounds, though I did feel the walking speed was just a bit too slow, but nothing too bothersome. There was one thing that this game got perfect, and that was the performance of the actress who played Sam. When I mean this was an absolutley increadible performance worthy of, not only any AAA title, but also any film, I mean it. There were times where, despite the lack-luster story, I felt emotional soley from this girls performance.  In the end I would like to give this game my recommendation, just from the great voice work alone, but the rest of the game just isn't fun enough, and the story interesting enough for me to recommend the moments including Sam's dialogue.  Rating: Acting performance: 9/10- fantastic Gameplay: 4/10- this one is more subjective, but I just found it boring. Story: 5/10- Painfully average Graphics 5/10- They get the job done",

It sets itself up as a mystery horror, with a Resident Evil-style mansion you stroll around, but instead of zombies you have notes giving backstory. All well and good. Problem is the mansion itself, as other reviews say, is portrayed as a supernatural place, with artifacts about the occult strewn all over the place and footsteps heard around you which aren't from you.  But it isn't any of these.  It's just a walking simular you collect notes on and piece together one of the most pointless stories I've ever 'read' - there wasn't even any payout, no revelation, no final surprise or any twist - it was absolutely banal.  It presents itself as a horror mystery, but it's just a rather vacuous story which leads to nothing.  This game will not satisfy you and I've no idea why the reviews are mostly positive.  Yes, the story itself is reasonably engaging, but you're in a mystery 'horror' abandoned house and you expect more at the end than what you get.  This really is just a bit of a waste of time.

I say that because I'm not really a big fan of linear games. I can tolerate them, but only to a point. Gone Home has advertisted itself as a 'Story Exploration Video Game' and it just that. You explore your environment while they take you on a ride. It's vaguely similar to theme park attractions where they shuffle you along room to room to tell you a story. Such as the peculiarly perfect placement of breadcrumb notes to lead you along the story.  The problem is, the part of the thrill of theme park attraction is buying into the experience and thrill of the environment. Gone Home tries to capture but doesn't quite reach it, at least for me. Perhaps with Oculus and some additional VR gear, it might bring the experience more to life, but until then it is nothing more than a movie you could simply watch.  Being a kid who grew up in the 90s in the suburbs with one sibling, I can say that this did tickle my nostalgia. It gave me fond memories of my own childhood. Of my friends and classmates who have I grew up with come out of the closet. Of a time where acceptance was only starting to become the popular belief. And I have a odd fondness to narrative storytelling, but even with all that Gone Home doesn't have the full experience it needs to make me want to play it again.  Gone Home is a growth in the lines of experimental narrative walking games, such as Dear Ester and Stanley Parable, and is worth a look.   ...But what you might hear as a large complaint is the full price tag of $20 USD Gone Home, while the original Dear Ester and Stanley Parable were both free game mods. I can't fully dismiss that the price tag was a deterrent since I didn't jump to grab it at full price. I've grabbed this in a Humble Weekly Bundle Leading Ladies for $15 USD, which included a pile of other games I wanted to play. However, price tag isn't something you're really reading the review for anyways, since each individual already have an idea of how much they are willing to spend on a particular game.",

That part doesn't matter to me anyway, aside from it being very banal while pretending to be very edgy. I might have giving this game a positive recommendation, except that none of the characters are particularly likeable. We're meant to sympathize and/or empathize with Sam, but Sam is such an obnoxious person; other personality traits aside; that I can't bring myself to care what happens. I suppose that could count as edgy, since characters of Sam's type are rarely shown as anything less than saintly in most popular media. So maybe the game is actually subversive after all, though I doubt it's for the reason that it thinks it is.  Anyway, I got it for 50% off, and was still unhappy with the experience.

It had great atmosphere and exploring the house was spooky and fun. Unfortunately, about a quarter of the way through your realize that there is nothing interesting happening and the payoff is a story with the emotional depth and sophistication of a young adult novel.   I probably would have been pretty into this if I played it when I was in high school, but, to avoid such spoilers as there are, I will just say, there are better ways to spend two hours exploring the game's real themes.    Gone Home is actually a game about the protagonist's sister slowly discovering that she is gay. It is done in a nice, nostalgia-driven way that has you discovering clues and recordings from her around your parents house. The game semi-successfully juxtaposes the childhood fear of isolation (home alone in a big scary house) with a quasi-adult fear of isolation (I am different from everyone else).   Knowing this going in would spoil much of the effect, as it would undercut the initial 'spooky house' section, but having not known it I feel like I kind of fell victim to a bait and switch. I came for a creepy exploration game and ended up getting a diary entry from a kid confused about growing up.  That sort of story is fine, it is just not what I signed on for and I am kind of getting tired of every plot about a gay character being a coming out story. It is like watching super hero origin movies over and over again. Surely there are interesting things that can happen to gay characters after coming out?   ",

You assume it would contain the same amount of content as a movie, but I completed it in a little more than an hour without skipping over   anything  . I looked at everything in the game. It invokes a creepy atmosphere that amounts to absolutely nothing. The one good thing the game has is its soundtrack, and you can accomplish the same thing by listening to punk and riot grrl music from the 90s.  Of course, you don't have to find out whether the game is worth purchasing or not from reviews. As I stated, the game took me less than two hours to beat, and I did   everything  . Purchase the game, set a timer when you start playing it for 1:55. If the timer goes off and you're already done with it, you can just refund it. If you aren't done with it, you can decide whether to return it then, but I'm willing to bet you'll already be done with it.",

It's another attempt at 'progressiveness' being shoe-horned into videogames.  I'm not so annoyed by the creators of this game (despite them being bona-fide tumblrfeminists) as I am the gaming media for collectively agreeing this turd was not only a good idea but in recommending it for purchase.

The story is intriguing and immersive. It feels real. But the story is not worth the asking price. 20 USD for this? You smoking crack, FullBright? I have played better games with better story and storytelling...'Brothers: A Story of Two Sons', 'Among the Sleep', 'Metal Gear Solid', 'The Last of Us', Just to name a few. Its good, but not that good. It certainly isn't worth all the hype and attention this title got from various big names in the game industry. It certainly isn't worthy of getting GOTY awards. I feel like the only reason this game got any attention is because the critics desperately wanted to pander to the LGBT crowd, during a time period that the game industry is under fire from feminists and other special interest groups. Pandering.   I recommend giving the game a spin. BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PICK IT UP FOR &lt;$2 (Steam Sale)",
