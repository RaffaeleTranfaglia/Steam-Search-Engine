Added Some many months later ....................................  I did beat this game..I did have to use a trainer..so as not to die every few metres..I did have to use cheat-engine to slow the game down so I could get all of the head shots near the end of game..no I did not use the sniper rifle do it..sorry but I had to cheat...",

            "review_text": "Provided you can actually get the game to run for more than 5 minutes at a time, you'll soon find out that it wasn't worth the time or money required to do that. Gameplay's your standard third person cover shooter type deal minus a sprint ability that would make crossing the game's dull gray facility environments even more of a bore. Guns sound decent, nothing special but certainly not terrible, voice acting's pretty awful, you hear the same things from the enemies over and over again, with drawn out and rather hilarious death screams, and the script in general is up there with the likes of Global Ops: Commando Libya and Rogue Warrior, only with less profanity. The underwater sections are alright, giving you a third dimension to worry about, but the enemy AI is so simplistic and these areas are so few and far between that they don't change much.  Speaking of enemies, you've got your standard assault rilfe guy, shotgun guy, rocket guy, the commando that carries the gun of the same name, snipers, and all sorts of robots and turrets that are tedious as hell to kill. Tedious is pretty much the defining word of this game. When you die during one of the too-lengthy boss fights, you redo the section right before which often has you walking down a corridor or pressing a couple buttons and getting to hear the terrible dialogue again and again. And the icing on the cake is that it crashed and deleted all my save data in the final act of the game. GG.",

This game is fundamently broken, It will not start and claims the download is corrupt. 'Strategy First' do not even allow you to raise a bug report on their website. They know it is broken. Steam knows it is broken. There is a work around that in many instances gives only seconds of game play. I am very suprised and dissapointed that Steam considers a price reduction compensation for providing an unusable product. Very strange marketing.",
