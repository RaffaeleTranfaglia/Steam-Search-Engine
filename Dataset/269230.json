This is the child that would result  Aces Wild solves the age old problem of arial combat in most brawlers being subpar by making it the focus of the entire game. The result is that you have a frankly insane amount of things to dodge with an i-frame loaded dodge before using meter-utilizing launchers to deal stupid amounts of damage to enemies in large groups by knocking them into each other.  Be aware the game is hard as balls, however, so if you think this will be an easy romp and treat it as such you'll get proper screwed. Thankfully the entire game is unlocked in both standard and boss rush format, with five difficulty settings and a God Hand style adaptive difficulty system, so you won't suffer too much without an option of simply moving on with shame.  Buy this game. It's a taste of what a genre can do if we actually push boundaries and blend and build on others instead of spend our time catering to people who don't belong in it in the first place.",

Pros:  + Easy to learn battle controls, difficult to master scenarios. + Spectacular particle effects when using Crash Attacks to slam enemies bouncing around the screen into obstacles and each other. + You can jump forever! In theory, you could complete the game without ever touching the ground again after the first jump in any given level. + Silly sense of humor. + Energetic catchy soundtrack which brings to mind the likes of Mega Man. + Arcade-style Score Attack setup minimizes the time to get back in the brawl after a failed attempt to clear a room. + Boss Rush included and available from the start! + GIANT ROBOT THAT SHOOTS MINI ROBOTS. YES.  Cons:  - Brief tutorial. It's easy to skip a portion while experimenting with controls and miss important details. And the weaker up/down Crash attacks are not mentioned. - Wild mechanic is a bit counter-intuitive - Repetitive. Especially if you have trouble figuring out how to deal with any specific room of enemies.  MANIC BRAWLING ACTION. A very apt description of the gameplay.  Casual Tumblr Note from the first time I beat the game: 'This game. &lt;3 I had fun. Took me a bit to learn how the Wild gauge worked though. Wild boosts YOUR damage of all attacks significantly, but ALSO boosts the damage you take. Crash is the best way to break through shields, but charging it drains Wild. So it’s often more advantageous to NOT charge it at all. And Panic restores HP and reduces the damage you take, but it does not clear the enemies already on screen. And you lose ALL Wild, so most of your damage potential is out the door. A lot less intuitive than Fairy Bloom Freesia, but similar gameplay at the core. Though Freesia’s quite a bit more technical.'",

But be prepared for the most intense action of the game after the first 10 minutes into this game. The difficulty is a nice balance of when to kick pass 11 and when to keep it at 10 once the player use panic, it's difficulty scaling matches that of God Hand. Most of attacks are telegraphed and if you are not careful or on point with reflexes, you will get smashed throughout the game. Best of all, two players can play this game locally so you can brawl with a friend. This game is worth getting if you are a fan of heavy action games like Devil May Cry.",

It may remind you of games like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, River City Ransom, Comix Zone, Double Dragon, Battletoads.......  This is a very satisfying game if you let yourself get to know it. It's a simple design with a detailed gameplay experience. The controls are simple and so is your goal. The experience, however, WILL challenge you. It demands all of your skill... anything less and you will be punished. This is a high paced action game that throws a lot of obstacles in your face (and all at once in some cases). It will intimidate you, frustrate you, and mock you... but in the end you may feel a sense of proudness and badass-ery when you clear that stage and/or boss, even after dying numerous times. Even after beating it, which I honestly wasn't sure I was going to be able to do, I still find myself coming back to it because even after becoming better at the game I'm still challenged by it (in a mostly fun way). There's even a few more masochistic difficulty levels for the die hards out there. The gameplay feels fresh every time I play it because I try to play better than last time for the sake of personal achievement. To me this equals a game that was well done. This game also has an awesome soundtrack to go with smashing up your enemies. Can't really say more than that.  8/10 is what I'd say. Buy it.  It doesn't get a 9 because the stage 6 boss is designed poorly for the overall game experience, I think it ruins the game a little, it doesn't match the skill pace. Plus the final boss felt like a joke compared to the other 6.",

            "review_text": "A good game that could have been a fantastic game.   If you ever wanted to play a 2d version of a game like DMC or Bayonetta, this is probably the exact game you’re looking for, but have never heard of. Aces wild is an interesting mix up between crazy action beat um up, and old school side scrolling beat um up, That does the former much better than it does the latter.     It’s crazy to think that an Indy made game like this, could have out classed so many games made by major publishers, if it weren’t for a few key features missing from it’s incredibly fluid, over the top play style. The games basic controls consist of two main attacks, a dash, and a guard, The light attack button is your standard combo attack, and the other is the heavy crash attack button. The game also has an extremely interesting mechanic that holds it all together, called wild meter. The wild meter fills up as you preform combos. The fun thing about it is that it has a large variety of uses, wild can be used for preforming crash attacks, for charging crash attacks, crash counters, extended dashing, and activating “panic”. Not only this, but the more wild you have the more base damage your combos do, which constantly keeps you thinking about how much wild you spend as opposed to keeping it in to do more combo damage to your enemy’s. Also unlike a lot of other games, all of these skills are essential to master, and none of them feel pointless. The game has a great deal of enemy variety, all of which demand a different way of fighting. The weaker foes in the game can be mowed down with basic combos, but it gets really tricky when you have to fight enemies who are not affected by hit stun because of their shields, or enemy’s that spam projectiles, and others that counter. The game makes you think about what enemy’s you want to prioritize, as well as what you want to use your wild on. Sometimes it will be more beneficial to fight a good long fight while dogging all incoming attacks mixing up your basic, and crash attacks to gain wild faster. Or sometimes it will be better rolling into the part of the level, and destroying everything with one fully charged crash attack, causing all your enemy’s to knock into each other at full force. Or you just might want to play it safe till you get enough wild to use a panic, which restores a great deal of health depending on how much wild you have.    Another huge part of the games great combat, is how the dashing and dogging work so well, it never gets old watching your enemy’s fly to the other side of the screen, and catching right up to them, in a split second just to keep the beat down going, then sending the body whirling into the rest of the enemy’s. It also serves as a great tool to catch, and pummel many of the bosses before they are able to perform an attack, if they don’t have a guard up. It’s also nice to see that dogging has an extended window of invincibility which makes it easier to preform counters which comes in handy to beating most of the games earlier foes. The game does a fantastic job at keeping the action going even at some of its more chaotic points, dashing around preforming a combo, finishing a guy of and diving right into the rest of the group with a fully charged crash attack is satisfying. The game is a complete joy to play, and delivers on making the player feel like a badass, as the action never breaks, till the last few stages.    Unfortunately as much as I want to gush about the games combat it has some extremely large draw backs as the game moves on. Now it should be said that these games are difficult by nature, but towards the end of the game, you can be punished with death for the slightest mistakes. It’s all fun and games till you have around one hundred enemies on screen, and twenty of them are throwing projectiles at you, making it look more like a smup than a beat um up. At this stage one missed dodge will open you up to a fifty or more hit combo taking half your life away, only to wind up in the same position less than a second later because you failed to take out any enemies, because they were too busy styling all over your face. It’s also not fun to run into twenty or so enemy’s that all have shields, and aren’t affected by hit stun, and are essentially invulnerable, while they mercilessly hack away at you. In fights like these, the games mechanics begin to break down. Counters become worthless; with only limited invincibility leaving you open to punishment after only killing a few guys. And crash attacks become almost unusable, as you may never get even the one second it takes to charge them up to guard break. And even if you do, it’s easy to wiff, and wastes your entire wild meter on noting, while you put your controller down, and get styled on into oblivion. Just whiffing a crash attack at certain times can spell instant death, because you may not get a good chance to gain enough wild back to guard break. The games main problem is that it doesn’t include any kind of upgrade system that is seen in any of the games 3d counter parts. The game makes itself into a perfect example of, why such things are needed in a manic brawler. Being able to customize how you fight keeps it so you can keep playing the game the way you want to play, instead of the game playing you, as you are forced to conform to enemy patterns, or die. It would have been fantastic to put points into the counter mechanic so that you could remain invincible while you perform a crash counter, so you know you’re not going to burn your entire wild meter for nothing. Being able to upgrade key mechanics is a must for games like this, 3d or 2d. It just can’t stay true to its old school arcade street brawler roots, where you don’t get any kind of upgrades, and you have to rely on basic mechanics. If things stay to basic, the enemy verity begins to cap out at a point, and you end up with a game that just poor’s on the hurt to artificially extend its length.    Another one of the games sore spots is its presentation it’s environments are clean, but dull, character animation’s outside of aces, are very poor, and aces are very lacking, and enemy designs are very hit or miss. You only get two playable characters with only minor differences. The game is only about seven to eight hours long, and the game has no reliability, or online play at all. However the music is pretty good for the most part. Over all it’s an amazing game at its core, I’ve never played a 2d game as fast nor as furious as this one, but its un polished no matter where you look at it. 7/10",
