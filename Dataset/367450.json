EDIT: An actual Review (As of 7/14/15)  Poly Bridge is one of the best Bridge-building simulators (idk if it's a simulator or not) I've ever played so far. I bought this game in early access and although there's some bugs and whatnot, it's playable from start to finish. The graphics and art style are simple, yet nice. I am a fan of the music. It's so relaxing that I literally slept because of this. The levels, although easy at first, are quite challenging and requires your brain to think further. Pretty much you can build anything! From regular bridges, to ramp jumps or even overly complicated tilting bridges or something like that. Still not fun w/ the existing levels? Try the workshop where over thousands of player-made levels. And finally, the developers of this game are quite responsive to the community fanbase which overall improved the experience of playing this game.  Overall I still gave this game 10/10. Would recommend to friends, family, construction workers, architects, civil engineers, anyone i can think of.",

There is a ton of user created content for more fun than just whats in the base game. But with that comes a certain type of thinking. When building bridges you have to think outside the box, in plainer terms, you have to think of a better way of making bridges then just the basic straight line with supports. You can use ropes and metal bars to make the strongest bridge.    In short, Poly Bridge is a great and indepth bridge builder then some of the other ones out there. You have much more control over the bridges you're building and the strongest parts of it to make it take whatever truck your thinking to drive across.  Verdict:  95/100",

Then the game turns into a MAKE THIS SWEET JUMP BRO DO A BARREL ROLL BRO CHECK OUT THIS FLIP ISN'T THIS GREAT simulator. Half of the levels past the first two lands are stunt jump levels, a quarter are hydraulics-abuse levels to make variable stunt jumps, and the rest are tedious fox/goose/beans puzzles using hydraulics abuse. There's maybe 5 or 6 levels that involve actually building bridges past the second world. So, 100+ levels? I guess so. Technically. In practicality there's under 40.  I had fun with this game. It has great potential. I just can't recommend it, not when an overwhelming majority of the levels aren't actually about building bridges.",

Then he goes on to work through a few examples which seem pretty trivial. Then you move on to trying to do some of the book problems by yourself (ex: Alpine Meadow). It's a bit of a challenge, but after a few cups of coffee you figure it out. By that point you're thinking to yourself 'I'm going to be a freaking God at this'. And then comes the final exam where they ask you to create an elevator catapult which has to withstand the stress of an incoming boat. And just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, you also have to design a few Evil Knievel jumps which seem completely impractical and a public safety menace.   Basically, if you like physic based puzzles this game is for you. It may give you PTSD like my Fluid Dynamics class did to me back in the day, but in the end you get the satisfaction of having worked out the problem (or looked online for the answer, whichever I ain't judging). Oh and yes 'triangles are your friend'...",

Really simple to play, but also deep enough to experiment with more advanced bridge designs. It's so satifying to see your creation work out well when you test it out, and you can't help but go back and tweak the design to shave a few more bucks off the overall budget of the build. There's different worlds to advance through, split into many levels. Leaderboards add a great bit of competition, and also spur you to go back and refine your designs. The graphics are really easy on the eye, and the music is great and relaxing too! And lastly, the controls are spread over the keyboard and mouse, so you can use just the mouse for everything, or a combination of both together.",
