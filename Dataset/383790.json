            "review_text": "I'm a huge fan of the original. I liked the graphics in this game, but I'm not bothered by the graphics in the original. The game play and fairness of online play are more important to me. I played the single player version and the bot magically transported from a long distance to kill me. And, when I went online, the strategy is to run at full speed to avoid your hunter. You never run out of breath. Instead, you get sleepy and are often surprised by how often you have to sleep and the sleep cycle lasts longer than the original. It's very hard to track your quarry without a compass and without being able to peak at your map while moving forward. Then when I finally was able to track down my quarry, the target took about 8 direct hits from the axe. This is not a polished game that should be out of early access. The elevators don't work, there's no water in the pool, I have problems getting weapons from dead players. It's not worth playing for me. Especially, when the original works so much better. Do not recommend.",

            "review_text": "I can't give a completely unbiased review because the game crashed every 5 seconds for me making it completely unplayable. However, I'll say what I can about it.  The Ship seems like a cool idea. Not completely original, but interesting. You have a target that you're supposed to kill called a Quarry. (Which is all I got to see of the game in my 9 minutes of playing before I gave up because of the rediculous crashing.) You find weapons in containers along with what seemed to be costumes but I wasn't able to tell because the server I was on was too absurdly laggy to open up containers even with 40-50 ping.  I never managed to kill anyone due to being completely unable to bring out weapons that I had equipped and instead got killed by the person that spawned 2 feet away from me. Having to sleep constantly is another huge negative in my opinion. Sure, it adds a bit of challenge and suspense knowing that you could be murdered at any time during your slumber. For me it seemed like my character got tired from waking up therefore requiring me to sleep again and again in an endless cycle.  My short experience with this game was a very poor one. From the crashes that seemed to happen at random and the broken gameplay, I can't say I enjoyed the game at all. I can't honestly recommend this game, at least not in its current state. Maybe I'll change my review once the game is made playable.  4/10, neat concept and has potential, but broken and crashes way too often to be playable.",
