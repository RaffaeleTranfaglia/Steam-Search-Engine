            "review_text": "The story didn't make much sense at all. My character drew a conclusion about who was guilty and I barely even knew who the person was.   The HOG part was fine, standard. I found sometimes the items I clicked on wouldn't register.   The puzzles were pretty typical, although some were buggy. There is one puzzle where you have to draw lines between a peg and a hole using the mouse and it would constantly reset for unknown reasons as soon as I got close to the end. Very frustrating.   There are definitely much better games available.",

In a city of Pennsylvania, a Magistrate is murdered in a suspected way. You are called in to investigate this murder and discover the secret of this little city. I recommend this game if you are looking for a fun relaxed puzzle game with a nice mystery.",
