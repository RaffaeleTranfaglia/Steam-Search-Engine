            "review_text": "Woah Dave is an single screen arcade game along the lines of the original Mario Bros. It is just Dave vs aliens. The game randomly drops one of two things from the top of the screen. Either an egg or a skull 'block.' You can pick up either one just by running into them and then throwing them with the throw button. There's a catch though. Both objects have timers. When the skull block flashes, that means it'll explode soon. When the egg flashes, that means it will hatch. Both mean death for Dave if he's holding either one.  You can throw the skull blocks into the eggs to smash them revealing a coin for you to collect. You can throw eggs into aliens to defeat them and leave a coin. While you're combating these aliens, the bottom platform is melting away with lava. Once the floor is gone, the lava slowly rises! If a green hatchling alien falls into the lava, it gets wooshed up to the top of the screen and turns red. Making it a fast alien. When the red aliens hit the lava they get thrown back to the top of the screen again. Then they are blue and can jump from platform to platform. If the blue aliens hit the lava again, they turn into Dave seeking eyeballs that can float through platforms. In a way it feels like Super Crate Box, without the guns, extra levels or extra characters.  Every once in a while a POW block will drop from the sky. When you smash it against anything but lava, it destroys everything, leaving a coin behind. What are these coins for? A high score of course! Its an arcade game! No points, just coins, which seems like a wasted opportunity. If you get $1.50 in coins, you unlock the bonkers difficulty level. Once you gather a certain amount of coins, the UFO will appear for you to defeat.  The controls are simple, jump and throw. The weird thing with this game is its gravity. It just feels like there is super gravity or something odd with how fast things fall back down. It doesn't play as well as other 80s arcade games.  There are no phases, its just one long level. You're in it until you use up all 3 of your lives. The real downside to the game is once you've played it for three lives, you've seen all there is to see. Except maybe the UFO. The level changes color, but there's nothing to unlock like new classic arcade games. It feels one dimensional. Mario Bros had bonus levels and a variety of different enemies instead of an evolution of one enemy.  If you can keep killing eggs as they spawn from the sky, it makes for a slow, tedious game. If you have a lot of enemies on screen, then it can make for some frantic fun. Then cap it off with a POW block to clear them out and go back to spawn killing them. There is only one song in Woah Dave, and its a great new wave sort of 80s clappy sort of beat.  There is a local two player mode where two of you on a single screen fight for to collect the most coins before time runs out. There are online leader boards showing the top 10 globally and your friends. For such fierce competition, the scores are far apart. Not just that, but some people have the 10,000 coin achievement, but no one on the global leader board to back it up.  I grew up in the arcade days where every three lives cost you a quarter, so the $5 seems about right. I can't imagine this fitting in shoulder to shoulder with the old classics or even the new ones. It feels like a hastily made cash in that needs some depth and extras. Also, for a game that tries so hard to pattern itself after arcade cabinet games, why do they recommend a 360 or PS controller and not an arcade style joystick?",

            "review_text": "Woah Dave! is a tiny arcade game from Minivisions, the one-man offshoot of Choice Provisions (previously known as Gaijin Games) manned by Jason Cirillo. I’ve been a longtime fan of Choice’s BIT.TRIP series, and seeing how this is their first non-BIT.TRIP game since lilt line back on WiiWare, I was really interested in checking it out.  The gameplay is super-simple: eggs and skulls fall from the sky. The eggs eventually hatch into aliens, and the skulls eventually explode. Throw skulls and eggs at aliens to collect coins. Don’t touch aliens or explosions. Collect as many coins as possible.  With really simple, elegant gameplay like that, it’s perfect to play just for a few minutes. I tend to find myself playing for a lot longer, though… I dig it a lot.  Don't go in expecting a ton of modes--there's only one mode and then a harder version of it called “Bonkers Mode.” That might not sound like much, but what's there is really, really fun. Bonkers is the perfect word to describe the game. Managing everything going on all at once is really challenging and rewarding to pull off.  This being a one-screen indie arcade game, it’s pretty natural to want to compare it to Super Crate Box, but aside from the level layout, the two games play very differently. Woah Dave! is more like a crazy-fast version of Mario Bros. than anything—and any of you who have played the later stages in Mario Bros. know how much fun a faster version would be.  So yeah, very simple, very elegant, very crazy game—definitely worth checking out if you’re into the genre. Think of it like you're paying five bucks upfront to play the best arcade game ever for as long as you want instead opposed to putting in a quarter each time.",

            "review_text": "I played 'Woah Dave!' just shortly but i guess i saw all the game has to give so far...  Woah Dave! tries to be a 'arcade Classic game'-styled game to hit the highest score only - only thing: there is NO score. Insteed of score, the game counts how much 'coins' you collected, which is pretty hard as longer you play.   The game is easy placed, it self says you chould best play it with a PSone or Xbox controller but if it should be a 'classic arcade game' i was about to use my old joySTICK which sadly didnt work...  Also, the game feels anyhow as whould it try to be a bunch of old REAL classic games mixed To the game play self: You play Dave (so i guess) who pic up skull bombs or eggs to smash the alien(eggs). You collect the coins they drops and sometimes a 'WOAH!' block appiers and you can use it to smash all on screen. Also it gives only ONE screen, nothing more - it maybe changes collors but thats it.  Having that all in mind i thought about follow games: Eggs destroying = Joust Coins and WOAH block (which looks a lot like the POW block) = Mario Bros. Level Style = feels like Super Creat Box  But anyhow, Woah Dave feels really boring after time, there is nothing new, just throwing and thats done. The most thing i hate is that you just need to touch the things and dave picks them up, mostly the things you dont want to pick up. there should be a button to take things and throw them. I often died coz i picked up a bomb i dont want.  Also, 'only' for hunting coins, the game gets pretty quick boring and there is not much to play for, ones you played over or reach '1.50$' you can play in a kind of 'hard' mode which doesnt makes more 'fun' than the normal mode.  Honestly, its not worth the 5$ and looks more like a poor rip-off from the real good classic games like Mario Bros or like. There is no '80s' in this game...",
