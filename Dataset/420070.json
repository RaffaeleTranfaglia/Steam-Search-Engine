Before i posted what this spoiler was in my review, and im sorry for this whoever read it.  One thing about this game is it seems to short. Most of the 'levels' involve one screen maps where you control the monster on it and try to kill the plumber in various semi puzzle situations. There are also secret endings..one of them is quite funny.  I recommend this game for original idea about playing the baddies to protect the princess.",

Each level is short, although some of the more frustrating ones may take many tries to complete. It's a good game for those who enjoy striving for impeccable timing. I enjoyed this form for taking short breaks from work, as the game doesn't demand too much investment at any particular time.  The controls are playable, although not optimal, and some of the challenge of the game comes from dealing with this imprecision. The game is also relatively short, and replayability seems limited. But still a fun one for the library given the price.",
