            "review_text": "It's a pretty good proof of concept. When does the full game come out?   I'll explain. The entire game is boss fights, but there aren't a whole lot of them. The only other gameplay element is wandering around a small world looking for bosses, which is just filler in an already exceedingly short game.  To their credit, the designers did well with the combat mechanic used. Unfortunately, they definitely started to run out of ideas. Some of the bosses are completely reliant on quickly hitting a small target in a split second opening, with attacks to avoid before you get the chance to do so.  The game also felt incomplete right from the start. After defeating every boss an over-the-top animation is played in which you absorb its soul, power, whatever. This does nothing and serves no purpose. It leads me to believe that it was supposed to do something, but the developers either ran out of time or didn't know how to make use of it. There is no character progression.  There is one moment of story in the entire game. Interestingly, it hints that by killing the Titan Souls you will gain knowledge or power, but as stated in the previous paragraph, nothing happens when you kill a boss.  The music is exceptionally strong, and is probably the strongest part of the entire game.  The quality of the artwork is high. The water and lighting effects are quite impressive, however the aesthetic is generic and uninspired. Though this is largely subjective, the main world has a standard overgrown monolithic theme, with an even more generic forest, lava cave, and frozen area. The open world aspect of the game again seems like it was intended to be something more, but somehow ended up as an afterthought.",

            "review_text": "(oh my god I'm so mad that I bought this, I have to write a long review)  I bought this game on its idea alone -- a fast-paced boss rush where one hit kills. Who wouldn't think that sounds intriguing? I was really excited, and I like hard games a lot. When I started playing the game, I think it's one of the worst designed games I've played in years, and I had to put it down pretty quickly. It's presumptuous that the developers seem to think this will be a popular game for speedrunning, because the game needs tons of improvements before it would even be fun.  The biggest thing that I hated was your weapon. You have only a bow, and press X to charge a shot. Not only does the camera move confusingly when you do this (making it difficult to aim precisely), but you actually have to continue holding X for your arrow to *return* to you. This completely and utterly breaks the flow of the boss fights, as you constantly have to find small windows of 'doing nothing' so that you can retrieve your arrow. I feel like this mechanic was put in solely for the uniqueness factor, and nobody seemed to think about whether this actually made the player feel 'cool' when fighting all these bosses. Shadow of the Colossus made me feel *awesome* -- I was climbing these huge, hairy beasts, hanging on for dear life. In this game, 3/4 of my time was spent scurrying around and retrieving my arrows. Not exactly the same feeling.  Absolutely everything about the game has these tiny, aggravating design problems. Death animations are long, and elevator animations are longer. Respawn points aren't right by the boss you were just trying, so it takes a minute or more to just get back to the boss you were fighting (even after dying in as little as 2 seconds). The arrow moves so fast that you can't even see it fly through the air, just where it lands. Bosses also have one health, so when you beat them it feels more like dumb luck than you actually having mastered their mechanics. The overworld is huge and has no map, and it's way too difficult to just find bosses to fight. You can't charge a bow shot while moving. You can't dash unless you roll first. Rolling has a short cooldown that doesn't match up with the animation and isn't indicated in any way. You can't roll up stairs, and it halts your movement if you even try. Basically, each and every one of these little things decreased my enjoyment of the game, and one of them was the straw that broke my tolerance.  All of this adds up to a game that *seems* like it should be absolutely stellar, but I beat about eight of the bosses and couldn't stomach having to sit through one more death animation or one more cycle of missing an arrow, then waiting helplessly until I could find a window just so I could retrieve it and attack him again.  Please do not buy this game. The saddest thing in the world to me is an amazing idea with awful execution.",

            "review_text": "First thing to note here is I enjoyed the game but I'm not reccomending it from a price to value position. TL;DR Version at the bottom  Titan souls is essentially a very high quality newgrounds/kongregate game with a wonderful soundtrack, challenging/awesome variety of boss fights, and great visual tone. The problem here is that there really isn't much to really get into. Here are the major points I have for it.  The game is really quite short only lasting me 2 hours with only a few bosses left to clean up. Your playtime will likely fluctuate based on your skill level and how many attempts each boss takes you. It's similar to something like Super Meat Boy where you will be trying each fight quite a few times. I died 92 times in total.  As most people know the game's main gimmick is you only have one arrow and that's all you will ever have. Fights are very fast with either you dying in one hit or the boss dying in either a hit to expose them and a hit to a weak point or just one hit to the weak point. While there is plenty of variety in the boss fight paterns the arrow mechanic got dull fast.  There are more modes you unlock once you beat the game but, again, the arrow mechanic didn't sell me on going through again on a hard mode or a no roll run.  You can tell that the devs wanted to have the story be told through the enviroment which I normally LOVE to death but in this case it is so very bare bones that there was no initial catch for me and I didn't enjoy the gameplay enough to delvae deeper.  Last of all there's the comparison to Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls that I don't think are really acurate. The simlarities to Shadow of the Colossus is the more obvious with the minimalistic story, only boss fights, and the absorbing the boss' 'souls' in the end of the fights but the gameplay is totally different where it's more about quick execution and mastery through repitition rather than thinking things through. As for Dark Souls it's nothing like it unless you call anything challenging 'like Dark Souls' which would be idiotic.  TL;DR Short game with an interesting mechanic that gets old fast. Won't last more than a couple of hours for most folks and isn't worth the current price of $15 USD IMO. Worth about $5 USD.",

The music is beautiful and the world is very pretty but the gameplay really dosn't hold up. Its basically a puzzle game and once you figure out what you are suppose to do each boss takes about 10 seconds to kill.. and there isn't any reason to fight the boss longer then 10 seconds because its best just to try and get the kill fast and take the 5 second walk back to the boss if you miss it. Because of this none of the fights feel any sort of epicness to them and fails to capture the feeling of games it obviously takes inspiration from (Shadow of the colossus and dark souls being the two main examples) and just feels like a waste of time...

            "review_text": "For people who'll TLDR, here's the verdict. This game is amazing but it's specifically aimed towards people who like a darn good challenge and don't care about dying a LOT. Not like in Super Meat Boy where it's fast paced but still holds a lot of the trial and error.  ----------------------------------------------------------  I don't think the constant not recommended reviews said to be the most helpful give this game the right kind of justice. This game is very, very good. I had way too much fun playing it. It's really short however, and would have liked more bosses to fight.  Something important to mention: THIS GAME HAS A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC!  What do I mean?  It's simple.  If you don't like constantly dying a LOT in a game, traveling back to where you were despite it being a short distance, you will not like this game. You will get infuriated and lose any interest in playing. It wasn't that difficult for me. I died a lot but I kept trudging on because I liked the difficulty of this game. You also only have one type of attack and that's a single arrow. You fire it and then you can pull it back or run up and grab it. But it's all you'll have.  I liked the 'One hit equals death' aspect of the game as it wasn't exclusive to you, the bosses die in one hit too. The one type of attack meshes with this very well. However unlike you, bosses can only be killed at a certain moment in a specifc area. I actually watched a friend play this a little and knew how to get through the first three bosses and knew to hit the tail of the electric eel, but the rest I was pretty much on my own. While some weaknesses are obvious, others take a little more thought. (Seriously, if I was not told about the tail weakness, I don't think I would have ever figured it out).  This game has some wonderful music as well. It's truly astounding. It makes every part of the game that much more lively. It's a shame the game is so short. When you beat it, you unlock new modes like Hard mode, Iron Mode (Die once and it's game over), and No Roll or Run mode (How the hell is this one possible? Please tell me!). There may be even more than that when you beat those modes, I'm unsure as of yet. I only just unlocked these modes after all.   Either way, the game was very fun. I beat it in the same run I started in as it was very enjoyable depsite constantly dying. The more you figure out trying to fight bosses repeatedly helps you figure out ways to make fighting them that much more easy though still remaining quite difficult. If you're a casual gamer, just stay away from this because you'll get infuriated. For all those hardcore gamers, get this. It's just a blast.  EDIT: I've just gone through a lot of hard mode and have also realized I missed about 6 titans as you don't have to kill them all to reach The Soul. Once killing all of the titans, I got to experience Truth. While I haven't made it in hard mode yet as I didn't know about these titans that existed, I've beaten truth in the normal game and that was a lot of fun. He's a great boss to finish things off with. Defeating all the titans in the game doesn't really increase the game's length by much but it sure does make the game feel more complete. That's all you really need anyway.",

In Titan Souls, every fight is a bossfight, quite difficult as a single hit from anything will kill you, and furthermore you are intended to work out how to kill the boss, usually via trial and error.  This is great gameplay really, but the issue the game has more than anything is everything outside of the fights.  Zero indication of where to go with pointlessly large walking distances between area, and everytime you die you end up having to walk back to the boss to retry, and death is VERY frequent.  If the game worked more like a frustration platformer, and instantly shoved you right at the boss' door after a defeat then the game would be amazing.  As it is now, it just becomes tiresome, very quickly.",

            "review_text": "So first off, as many people have said, don't even consider getting this game unless you're willing to die a lot. From what I can tell, there's no progression - you're as powerful as you'll ever get right from the beginning. That's not a bad thing. I've not played a game of this genre before, but from the first area I found I was really enjoying it. I think I can quite safely say that this is a genre that I would enjoy.  However, there is one major issue. 'Controller Recommended' is not quite precise. This game is possible to play without a controller, but ultimately an exercise in frustration. The reason for this is quite simple: A lot of the bosses after the first four were designed for an analog aiming mechanism. Which would be fine, except for the fact that the developer, for some reason, decided not to implement a keyboard and mouse control system. This means that playing the game as expected on PC is inferior to on a console. Additionally, there is no remapping of controls.  Now, if they had said 'Controller required' and cut out the keyboard controls altogether, fair enough. I wouldn't have bought it, because I don't like using controllers, but everyone that did would have gone into it knowing that they'd be playing on a controller. However, they really didn't bother to implement proper keyboard and mouse controls. This is a bad port, not a game that was designed for PC. As such, it should never have been released on PC.  I may continue this with a controller, but I doubt it. And if I do, it's purely because everything else about this game is amazing, and rock solid. It just should not be a PC game in it's current state.",

I'm all about indie games. I love how free exchange of ideas is becoming commonplace allowing flash animators with great ideas to become success stories (read binding of isaac, risk of rain, etc.), and Titan Souls is no different. This studio brought an amazing idea to bear. Cut out the cheap trash enemies and give us a tale befitting a titan in small shoes.  I was instantly charmed by the game. A young hero with just a bow and arrow imbibed with power. This hero is small in a large and amazing world spanning the seasons (as is tradition) against bosses that are simultaneously terrifying and unique. You have 3 buttons to use: joystick, shoot (and retrieve), and roll (and run). Between the three, you have to solve the boss puzzles and learn their patterns, their tells, and their weaknesses. I cream over games like these.  ...but sadly, TS was over before it started. My first playthrough I beat in under 2 hours. And while I will certainly go back for some achievements, particularly to beat it in hard mode and potentially the other modes, I can't rightfully appreciate that a game's main campaign is 2 hours long. (I do feel like I missed a boss or something, but at 2 hours to be 90%+ finished? For those not seeking a facebashingly difficulty game, you might want to turn around now). I have 0 reason to go back outside of steam achievements, and what started as a beautiful game that only expanded and promised me something amazing, left me with a short game with less than 30 enemies total. And for a $15 price tag, I am hard-pressed to recommend this to anyone that didn't receive it as a gift (for me, I was gifted it from a charity event).   It was fun. It was worth the experience, but it is a game lacking except for the most sadistic of achievement hunters.",

Obviously tacking some points from shadow of the colossus this game is playing around with 'glowing weakpoints' that almost always one shot kill your boss enemy of the day. The problem is that it seems that the game can't decide what it wants, some enemys behave in very obvious patterns, some seem to purely based on luck or chance concerning their patterns. I don't know if I would even say this game is hard, you figure out the patterns quick enough, and then its just a war of nutrition, staying alive longer than the enmy, there is no real strategy other than shoot the obvious weakpoint. The problem I have is that this game offers nothing besides killing titans, no exploration, no character development, no reward and no real driving point besides killing the titans, that seem to bother noone. Maybe that is the message behind the game, you are the villian, the carvings and pictures do not represent the coming of a hero, but warning of a menace, that kills off those innocent titants, after all you are the one who keeps awakening and challenging them, the same vibe that shadow of the colossus had even.

It wears the APPEARANCE of challenge. The bosses are basically 90% luck 10% skill. Everytime I beat a titan, save for the first couple, it doesn't feel satisfying. It just feels like you got lucky. After a dozen tries, this time the arrow was 'drawn just enough' and the angle was 'just enough' for the game to recognize it as on target.  The trick to the titans is obvious, so you don't feel smart for figuring it out. Getting to the titans is frustratingly slow. Firing your arrow is frustratingly slow. Getting your arrow back is frustratingly slow. Dying and getting another crack at a Titan is frustrating slow.   The game and the mechanics are identical from start to finish. So traversing the big and open world, while pretty and with a nice atmosphere, gets very boring, very quickly.

I bought this on HumbleBundle, which is currently bundled with two other games for $1. So roughly 33 cents. More than worth it. Full price I'd be rather hesitant to recommend .  We'll start with the good. The pixel art is lovely, absolute eye candy. The gameplay seems to take a number from Shadow of the Colossus, an amazing game. A large world filled with Titans to destroy and absorb. No specific order of what needs to be done. Various atmospheres. The music does nothing outstanding but it fits the world just fine..Relaxing while exploring and starting to pick up the pace. The gameplay mechanic was something that surprised me...with the main actions being dodge rolling and a single arrow, which you have to either go pick up or call back to you. This was something I really enjoyed.  Now my main problem with the game. Irronically I've read a lot of people complain that this game is too hard because of the difficulty. I feel the exact opposite. Essentially it is one shot one kill both ways...The only difference is you have to find out how to kill each titan. The bad part is most titans take little effort to figure out and kill. I've literally went into a boss room, had a boss charge at me, as soon as he hit the wall and landed I struck his weakness and boom fight was already over. And thats how I've found most fights. There have been a few that took a little thinking, but nothing has been challenging so far and thats a shame. I get that fights can't be overly complicated seeing as you are very easily killed, but bosses shouldn't be as easy as you.  Overall, if you want something unique and its on sale, jump on it.

Generally, you die. allot. every boss has a new fighting style and weakness, and it can take several tries to find it, then a few more to actually kill it.

This will happen every time you die. over and over and over.  3. controls are clunky - you can only shoot in 8 directions left, right, up, down and their diagonals. You will realise how useless this feels when a boss reveals its weakspot for a split second and even though you're right next to it you cant shoot it because its in between those directions.   NEEDS to be played with a controller. AND you cant change keybindings even though every PC gamer has been trained to you WASD keys to move.

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this game, the ideas behind it are good, and it does have good intentions. However, I've come out of the game feeling more frusterated than like I completed a fun, hard challenge. The art design is pretty pleasing to the eye, the controls are nice and tight, and the music is pretty good. Titan Souls is a glorified one hit KO boss rush dressed up as a retro Shadow of the Colossus without any real feelings of progression. There is nothing else to do besides slaying Titans, and that's a real shame. There were many opportunities to hide nice secrets in the overworld, but since what it does have (murals) adds nothing to the combat or the game in general, it ends up being more disappointing. Lorewise, it feels like a mess. It tries to be as vague as possible, and when you do find murals depicting what could be lore, it is meaningless and doesn't add anything to the game. There was a large mural in the Forest area that no matter how I looked at it, it meant absolutely nothing. There was no context. As I've stated before, the overworld is empty. SotC made up for the large overworld by adding upgrades to health and stamina, but since Titan Souls has no health mechanic whatsoever, and the bosses are one hit KOs anyway, there is no point to the overworld except as acting as a hub between the actual game. So the more time I spent on the overworld, the more I got bored of it. Most of the bosses operate on a 'Think Fast!' attack system. Where the boss will attack at ludicrous speed without giving any tell worthwhile. The amount of times I started the boss fight, only to get killed a second afterwards because I had no clue where the boss was landing an attack is too much. The game gets most of the difficulty from this. And while some bosses have a rest in between a combo, the rest is not longer than 1-2 seconds long. So anticipating the direction of the boss to how long you need to pull the arrow back and avoiding death at the same time, creates even more frusteration. It gives off an RNG/luck feeling, as you can't determine what direction the boss is going to face for its rest period. Hitting the weak spot does also not guarentee a victory, as it takes into account how much momentum the arrow is going and which direction it's facing. I've shot multiple bosses with a weak point facing towards the screen, but it didn't connect because I was coming in at an angle. The attack has to be precise, and frame perfect, or else you die. And die, you will. I spent 4 hours for myplaythrough, and died around 250 times. This is where I started feeling like I was playing something like Super Meat Boy, but not as fast paced when it comes to death and respawn. I am in the firm belief that most of my time spent in Titan Souls was watching the area fade to black as the boss continue to pound my body, and waiting for me to be able to control my character again to head all the way back to the boss arena. The forest area was the most annoying, because you had to keep scrolling through multiple screens before arriving at the bosses once again. There is no real prgression outside of the gates you open, of which there are only two. The first one opens after the first 4 bosses are destroyed, and then the second after the the rest. So there was no seeming forward progression because of that. If the gates were used to continue on to other stages instead of dumping you into the hubworld and final area, there may have been a bigger sense of momentum, but even then, character progression doesn't exist. The game is less forgiving than Dark Souls, and I believe that's a bad thing. The one hp is more annoying than it should be. If you make one mistake, have fun going back to the boss arena. Titan Souls sounds really good on paper, but because of the lack of other mechanics to give it more body, the game is too short for what it could've been, and too frustrating. Makes me want to play SotC even more though, so there's that I guess. TL;DR-It's a glorfied one hit KO boss rush with too much walking in the 'menu.'",

            "review_text": "Why I dislike this game: Titan Souls is difficult simply to be difficult. Your attacks are slow (compared to enemies), you only get one health, and the bosses are overpowered for no other reason than because they can be. I understand that some people enjoy that kind of game, but I am not one of those people. I'd rather play a game and have fun with it than try for hours to defeat a tough boss and ultimately wind up feeling frustrated and empty. Even after beating a boss, instead of feeling any sort of triumph I only felt a sense of annoyance that I'd have to move on to the next extremely powerful enemy.  Why you might like this game: If you're a glutton for punishment and enjoy playing a hard game because of the difficulty level and bragging rights, this might be a game for you. While the bosses are tough, there is a pattern and strategy to each of them. You'll likely die your first time against each new boss, but as you continually challenge them you will learn from each death and adapt for the next round. Each fight is not perfect however. One boss I was able to defeat by simply standing out of its range and firing my bow at it; another I defeated by accident within 30 seconds of our encounter (don't worry, I died plenty of times before against it).  What I still enjoyed about this game: While I disliked the gameplay, I very much enjoyed the art and music in Titan Souls. The graphics designer is very talented and the music is great. While the gameplay wasn't my cup of tea, the mechanics were fairly solid. If the context of this game were different and it was more an adventure than a torturous boss run, I'd likely have enjoyed the way my character moved and attacked in the vast environment.",

So the walk back over and over again, I suspect, may equal or surpass the time actually spent fighting the boss. I don't understand why you couldn't respawn in the boss' chamber. The walk back means you can't get right back in the action.

            "review_text": "So I just finished the game and wanted to share this review with you. Please take your time reading this and let me explain under what conditions I recommend this game. First things first:  -This game has a splendid soundtrack for most of the time. As music is a very personal point at least I can say (as being a musician myself) that the music fits to the overall atmosphere of the game.  -The graphics are beautiful compared to other top down games from this century (such as hero siege, relic hunters zero, hotline miami 2, etc.)  Now lets get to the gameplay. I played it with the keyboard and had no complains about the controls. I wont describe how the mechanics are in detail but rather point out the results out of them.  -It feels smooth to run around the world and shoot and so on  -Depending on what boss you are on it feels more or less lucky to kill one. For some bosses i was disappointed that it worked, for others it felt just great and satisfying  -You learn the tactic of each boss by dying to them several times before even discovering their weakness. This can be annoying as for some bosses it takes too many deaths or more likely too much time. This phase of the bossfight is the most disputable one in my opinion for as you know how to kill a boss the fight immediately depends only on your reaction and skill to bring it down and the game starts to get what it was ment for: fighting bosses and kill them (not discovering how to do that)  -The respawn time is fair and the way to the boss is short enough  -The overworld is relatively big but its the perfect size. You are completely alone in this world except for the titans. Hence an encounter makes the titan feel exalted and mighty and the main character just small and weak. This is a brilliant effect just reached by games like 'Shadow Of The Colossus' and makes this big world worth exploring and the games atmosphere so magically  -There is no real story in this game. This is a huge minus because you are willing to know why you are killing these titans and what is going on in general. At least there is some text appearing as you walk through the game that gives you the idea of what is happening but it is just too little to get this satisfying feeling of a progressing story. But this game does not rely on a story to thrive in atmosphere because the 'not knowing' what is going on underlines the unsettling encounters with each titan  -The Titans themselve are well crafted. Each has its own mechanic and the developers were pretty creative in making them all different  -The game is really short with its 19 bosses  These are my impressions of Titan Souls. I would like to conclude by saying that this game is worth a try and is developed properly. BUT in relation to its length it is not worth its price at all! I bought in on sale and so should you do unless you are a complete fanboy of top-down-2d-pixel-graphics-boss-fight-games. An adequate price in my opinion would be 7€/$.

            "review_text": "This is really a borderline case, but I personally wouldn't recommend this game to folks like myself.  It's clear that the inspiration for the game is Shadow of the Colossus. And that's a great place to take inspiration from. The game attempts to build up a similar atmosphere. At times it works, but most of the time, the heavily-abbreviated pacing just doesn't give the game time to build up any sort of ambiance. A game like Shadow of the Colossus really gives you a lot of time to soak it all in, and on top of that, it's not as brutally difficult and unforgiving as this.  Really, that's where I see the primary divergence from its inspiration. It's a very hardcore game, seemingly built around perfect boss runs and completing the game as quickly and flawlessly as possible, which feels very against the spirit of its progenitor. Now, of course, if you're a big fan of speedrunning, this may very well be your game of choice. Just realize that if you enjoyed Shadow of the Colossus, there's a good chance you will NOT enjoy this.  There are positive aspects, though. I like the 'one hit' idea, although I feel that the game would be better served if the bosses could only take the one hit (but potentially harder to expose the weak spot), where the PC could somehow at least absorb a couple. It does lead to some incredibly intense fights, though. It's certainly not a game to play to relax, and it's a pure adrenaline rush trying to hit some of the bosses before you get crushed, fried, stabbed, or what have you.  It's also a quite pretty game. I like the way it looks and feels, I just wish there were a slightly better sense of pacing and some length to absorb some of that world a little more. As it is, even with my difficulties, I finished it in about three hours.  Quite honestly, a version of this that wasn't quite so difficult or unforgiving, and had a good deal more exploration, would probably be 'Game of the Year' material for me. It's just not structurally what I was hoping, but maybe we'll see something like that in future work from this team. There's a ton to build on here, and it's certainly not a bad game at all, just not my cup-of-tea.",

So, I dutifully waited until the game went on sale for under $5, and went in with low expectations.  The result? I was surprised. Titan Souls is a pleasure to play. At its core is the exploration of a simple concept: what if the terrifying big bosses were just as fragile as you? Both you and your foe will die after one decent hit, although landing this one decent hit can be quite a challenge.  You have at your disposal a single, magical arrow that can be alternately shot, then retrieved by magically attracting it to the player. You can also run and roll to dodge enemy attacks. Both shooting and retrieving the arrow force you to stand still, and the arrow will fly further the longer you hold down the attack key. Titans also tend to be very quick and very aggressive, so even finding the time to get a shot in can be very difficult.  The Titans themselves are beautiful (and often quite clever) in their design. As I mentioned, the weak point of each Titan tends to be evident, but it often takes some thinking to force the Titan to expose its weakness. Sometimes just seeing its weak point can be challenging, as often Titans will kill the uninitiated player in a matter of seconds after commencing battle. But when everything comes together, that moment, when your arrow hits your opponent square in the weak point it was guarding so effectively, is indescribable!  The world is also beautiful, but a little dull. Titan Souls' greatest weakness is the delay between fighting Titans, in which the player watches his corpse be pounded by the last Titan, then respawn several seconds walk away from where the fight took place. Generally there was a delay of 10-20 seconds between losing a fight and challenging the Titan for a rematch.  I often found that I didn't really mind, certainly not as much as other reviewers. Titan Souls is packaged so beautifully, with lush 2.5-3D pixel art and a gorgeous soundtrack. However, the purpose of these trimmings is clearly just to accentuate the stellar gameplay.

Simple slip ups are punished harshly, and although the checkpoints aren't far from each Titan, the 20-45second treck can get tedious when it's the third, or fourth, or fifth time in a row.   If you can perservere through the trial and error, however, the game is quite rewarding and it's very satisfying to finally take down that Titan you've been stuck on.",

A one-on-one boss fighter that revolves around a one-hit mechanic where either the player or the boss typically dies in one hit. The player has unlimited respawns, and a bit of walking between retries to give them time to strategize. There's a bit of a puzzle behind how to defeat each boss, but less times did I find myself cheering after the discovery of how to beat that boss than thinking  'oh, I could have just done that the first time.'  And to top it off, defeating each boss rewards you with a quickly repetitive animation where you absorb the titular Titan Souls from the defeated boss. It hasn't anything to do with how you defeated the boss, even a humorous animation to spite how many times you had to repeat the boss would have been appreciated. The whole point of a boss battle is as a test to see if you've improved with given abilities or disadvantages over the course of a level or front of enemies. This is just repeating several tests given no context and told which answers you've gotten right last time. Maybe with a bit more effort a concept like this could have worked.

My only complaint is that you can't change the controls. If you don't have a gamepad or controller (like me), the default buttons are: the arrow keys to move, 'c' to fire, and 'x' to roll. Also you don't get a full 360 degrees rotation if you are not using a controller. I have yet to beat the game, but it has been incredibly hard without a controller. All in all though, the game is still fun, and if I had a controller (i will probably get one) I think that the game would be twice as fun.

Because you only have one arrow, there is this strange, frantic panic that comes when you miss that shot and have to dodge around more attacks. Theres an interesting relationship between the game and the player where no matter how many times you die, you never feel discouraged. It's like if Shadow of the Collossus and Dark Souls had a baby and the original Legend Of Zelda was the cooky uncle that showed the kid how the world works. I love this game. It's beautiful and haunting and genuinely challenging. I can't state how great it feels to finally land that shot, killing your adversary. It's a thrill that only this game can offer.

If u want to get into speedrunning, this game is great to pick up  about negative reviewers I have to say that those are probably people who don't like a challenge, I would also argue that this game is harder on its first playthrough than dark souls, which could be too much for some ppl and no.. it's not like dark souls but some people mean to compare the 2 and I can see where they are coming from in some form but they are not rly similar.  anyway.. just pick up the game It's a great game/ experience and don't let urself get down, It's rly fun and rewarding.. be it completing ur first playthorugh or beating every boss in the game without dying and feel like a pro-- this is just a rly solid game  In my first 88 hrs. I've encountered only 2 bugs, 1. got stuck once on the teeth of the ice world boss and 2. killed Soul once in a very strange way were he died while I didn't even shoot at its direction^^  anyways GG and HF!",

            "review_text": "INITIAL REVIEW -- The Game of One Shots (After 1.5hrs) If you're a fan of souls-like games, you might really, really enjoy this- 'might' being the optimum word. If you play souls-like games for the objective-focused but RPG-like advancement system full of resource management and build options, you'll find yourself a little out of place in Titan Souls. But if you're a lover of the really difficult boss fights where you throw yourself against a wall repeatedly until finding the right 'tool' for the job, this game would suit you. While you only have one weapon and one that would appear to be very limited at that, this game is heavily focused on problem solving. It's a lot like a series of puzzles, but with a lot of twitch motor skills involved. It's one thing to figure out how to beat a Titan, but it's another to train your eyes and hands to throw the shot that wins the fight. So far, I recommend it. It will hurt you, just like Dark Souls did, and it will ♥♥♥♥ you off to the point you want to uninstall it. And then you kill the Titan, and feel a sense of accomplishment that any really hard game aims to reward you with.   Other notes... The environments are large, and often a bit empty and unremarkable. Keep in mind, however, this is by no means a game that stresses its creative landscape or open-world discovery elements- though it is very open world. Right away you have choices, and from what I can see, you will have the option to seek out a number of bosses from several different areas throughout all of the game.",

            "review_text": "Titan Souls is a fun little game in which you play as a character with a single arrow. You use this arrow to take down giant beasts, giving the game a Shadow of the Colossus feel. Controls are pretty good with a gamepad although i'd imagine it being very frustrating with just a keyboard due to directional control being integral to how you aim your arrows.  The game is pretty much a boss rush, and each enemy kills you in one hit (and likewise, you typically kill them in one as well). You can complete the game in quite a short amount of time, so I'd recommend waiting to purchase this until it's on sale, as a $15 price point is ridiculous for a game that may last some little more than two hours. Sure, you can redo the game on harder difficulties and go achievement hunting, but for the most part the rush that comes from figuring out how to kill a boss dies away after your first completion. Another complaint is that respawning takes a bit of time, which is a little annoying when you have to walk up to boss rooms and can get killed in a matter of seconds (at least 1/4 of my playtime was waiting for the screen to go black and returning to a boss encounter room). Along with this, while the bosses are on an epic scale, the one hit kills sort of work against the game in some cases. I've had random shots kill some bosses, which made the fights very anticlimactic. Since most bosses require precision, I didn't feel elated that I got a random shot, just like I cheated the game and didn't deserve the victory. Others may feel differently in such a situation.  The score is well done and the art conveys the boss characters well. Story wise there's not really much going on (from my playthrough anyway), although there are like murals on walls that I suppose are supposed to tell some sort of story if you pay enough attention to them?   Get this game if you're looking for a challenging little boss-rush game to play through, but make sure to wait until it goes on sale. If you're looking for something with a strong story or a lot to do, look somewhere else.",

Every victory feels like an accomplishment, as you have spent time backtracking and dying over and over until you finally get in that one shot. A lot of the reviews list this as a negative; I would argue that it's a positive. If you could just restart a battle instantly, death really wouldn't have a meaning, you might as well just make the player invincible. You have to spend 10-15 seconds (literally, that's all it usually takes) to get back to a boss area after you die. Do people not know how to activate the checkpoint seals?  It'd be nice to have a bit more to do, the world is beautiful and fun to explore, but eventually you start to realize that mostly all you're going to find is more pretty stuff to look at. This is another thing that I consider more or less a positive, though: the game knows where its focus is, and it does it well, even masterfully. This is a game where it's nearly impossible to feel bad while playing it. I found myself fighting and dying to the same boss over and over for about an hour and a half, and never once did it start feeling like work. The atmosphere is so enthralling and I was just so focused on thinking of different strategies, different vulnerabilities in its attack patterns, that I hardly noticed I had done more or less the same thing who knows how many times.  And when you finally get in that killing shot? That's the most heart-stopping, fist-pounding, '%$#&amp; YOU I GOT YOU!' moment possible in a video game, and the design is artfully engineered for you to savor that moment of victory: the music stops, all the action stops; what was formerly a violent, loud, action-packed battlefield lies quiet and still, your arrow protruding from its mark, awaiting the collection of itself and your new, hard-won Titan Soul.  12/10 can't praise it enough. A game for the type of gamer that is tired of tropes, dialog, and heavy-handed commentary, and who just wants to savor a game that focuses on being the best possible game it can be by exploring every possible variation on its theme of 'one arrow, one hit'.

I spent a while trying to line up one of these shots and was never able to. Clearly with a joystick on the controllers it would not be a problem at all. You would just have to point where you want to shoot. However, with a keyboard, the only directions you can shoot are up, down, left, right, and the in-between combinations.

A optional replay of the last shot you dealt, playable after you die, so you see how far you hit where you wanted.

Every boss has one weak spot and only takes a single shot to defeat.  I cleared the game with a few achievements unlocked at around 6 hours with around 100+ deaths. Once you complete the game you can take that same character back into the world where all bosses will be alive again in their rooms, this is great for achievement completion and speed run practice.

            "review_text": "Titan Souls puts you in the shoes of a child protagonist who is armed only with a bow holding a single arrow. You roam through the remnants of an ancient civilization and the lairs of gargantuan creatures, each of which you are required to kill. Why you have chosen to visit these lands and why these Titans need to be killed is never explained. While this may be seen as a weakness the lack of explanation has a beneficial effect on the atmosphere of the lands you roam through.  Titan Souls is similar to Dark Souls in the sense that through deaths you will start to learn the boss pasterns and master the fights. There is one main difference, if you hit the Titan once with your arrow on the vulnerable spot it will die instantly. In similar fashion, you will die instantly if you get hit once by the Titan. To aid you in your task is a simple yet precise set of controls. As you only have a single arrow in your possession you need to make your shots count. Charging up the bow will make it fly faster and further. Once you have taken your shot you can run or dodge your way towards to arrow to pick it up or use your power to pull it back towards you (requires you to stand absolutely still though). This can get very hectic as the Titan will not sit around while you recover your arrow.  In the best moments, you will barely dodge your way past the Titans hands slamming on the ground, shooting your arrow at a perfect angle at the wall and using your power to draw the arrow back right into the Titans' back to finish it off. In the worst case scenario, you will get frustrated over a great number of deaths only to have a random shot kill the Titan and feel no sense of accomplishment at all. Futhermore, while most boss fights are original the level of difficulty can be both very high or very low for certain fights which makes for an uneven progression through the game.  Final score 9/10 +Thrilling and challenging fights +Simple and precise controls +Pixel art  -Can be frustrating; death comes quickly and often. -Sense of accomplishment can be diminished by finishing a fight through luck and not skill. -Spikes and dips in difficulty. -Somewhat short",

Some people are complaining about it being repetetive on the fights? I don't know wtf they're talking about. Every boss is unique. Sure, they all have a weakpoint you have to hit, but the method of hitting it is very different for each boss. Learning their attack patterns (and trying to stay alive long enough TO learn them) makes each fight challenging and intense.  Another complaint I saw was the lack of story. Why do you need a giant narration or deep story for $15? Honestly, this has more story than some $60 games I've played... Finding the secrets and reading the boss names adds alot of flavor to the game.  MY only complaint is that you can't change the keyboard controls. From watching videos, I kinda thought that shooting the arrow would be done with the mouse, but the videos were done with a controller. With the keyboard, you use the arrow keys and X and C, so aiming is only 8-directional and makes things quite a bit harder. But it's STILL fun with that limitation. Maybe even more fun if you like that kind of challenge.  I honestly hope that there is either more added to the game over time or a sequel is made. I highly recommend this one.",

You'll spend a lot of time dying; and making long walks back to try again.  The graphics are cool, I don't mind the pixel games. Its simple and okay to kill time.  I will say, once you finally kill a boss it is very satisfying.. but then when you go to the next one you stop being satisifed and start being angry.  My verdict, it isn't worth the money they charge for it and as a result of that I'm less offended that I got it plus several other games for a $12 a month subscription.

The controls feel good. The boss designs all felt new and interesting. The game is one-hit-kill for both you and the bosses. This often means that a successful boss fight only lasts ~30 seconds.

You have 1 arrow, and must retrieve it after shooting. You die with one hit. You are completely underpowered and overwhelmed, facing down huge monsters. When you manage to beat them, the sense of accomplishment is *very* satisfying.

Whereas, with Titan Souls it beats the hell out of you until you get it perfect, and that in itself is a rare quality in a game. The core mechanics of the game are solid, the very first screen tells you to use a gamepad, which doesn't redeem the poor controls without said gamepad, i myself played an entire playthrough with the keyboard and got thouroughly frustrated, but had a much more enjoyable experience when i plugged in my Xbox 360 controller. But what this game does have going for it is its incredibly addicting sense of satisfaction when you finally manage to overcome the obstacles it throws in your face, its absolutely BEAUTIFUL soundtrack, a suprisingly rich atmosphere, and a charmingly simple concept. My overall conclusion for this game was an 8/10, docked down only due to the fact that the experience i had was not as long as i would've liked for the money i spent and the poor PC controls. If you're into this archetype of games then definitely pick it up, but if you're not willing to spend some time and roll with the punches odds are you'll end up hating something you don't understand.",

Bought the game later and played it at times like before heading off to work or before going to bed, so my progression was slow at first. One day I decided to grind the game out. When I pulled stupid moves that caused me to die, I couldn't help but laugh becuase it was just simply funny to die the way I did. after three and a half...ish hours I couldn't belive I had won. Some titans were fun, some were too easy. but in the end I did enjoy the game on the first playthrough and will make another day to attempt the achievements I didn't get by accident on the first playthrough.

I can simply try it for myself and I'll either like it or dislike it. But my homeboy is a TB fanboy for some reason and he said 'because TB doesnt like it and had a twitter fight with a developer is enough for me to not try it' ok, Don't think for yourself there buddy. I tried it I liked it and others will too. Sure not every game is for everyone, I personally don't like too many shooter games but that doesn't mean I dislike the entire genre.

The wall art and ruined/overgrown structures in some environments tells you bits of a story and there's a cryptic message from one of the titans that gives you an idea of who the character is.

            "review_text": "Titan Souls is a game that is all about fighting bosses. The game has about 20 bosses and most of them can be defeated in just a single hit. Now that sounds like the game would be really easy but the baddies are pretty good at guarding their weakspot. For most bosses it took me multiple tries to understand what i had to do and then a bunch more tries to actually execute my strategy to defeat them, however when you finally get a kill it is very satisfying. The controls are simple and good but your character is deliberately poorly prepared for fighting, he only brought a single arrow to defeat a bunch of huge titans.  The game is short, it took me about 5 hours to get the 'real ending' but after you beat the game once you can replay the game on hard mode, no roll mode or 1 life only mode, none of these are too exciting but at least it offers some replayability.  Things i disliked: While the fighting system is good for the most part, the 1 hit kill system sometimes allows you to kill a boss by accident without even understanding the mechanics of the bossfight. After you have defeated a boss he is gone that means if you want to fight the boss again you have to make another savefile and beat the tutorial again to get another try at that boss.  The game has a superficial overworld and the game forces you to walk 5-10 seconds after each death instead of respawning you directly in front of a boss fight, about an hour of my 5 hours of playtime was just walking back to fights.  Summary: All in all i enjoyed titan souls, i often found myself 'just trying one more time' until i eventually beat the game. If you are looking for a short but well designed experience this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "  First off: this is from the perspective of a person who got the game on sale and played it with a controller.  The opening of this game gives you the impress that it might be easy with its two simple game mechanics. A button to shoot an arrow and a roll button.  This game is hard. It's still hard whether you play it with a controller or a keyboard. You can shoot your arrow in any direction with a controller but with a keyboard your aim is limited to a 45 degree angle. It's comparatively unfair but aiming is part of the challenge.  It's a beautiful open world to explore with no other enemies except for the 19 bosses, each one being unique with its own set of attack patterns and ways of defeating it. You'll die a lot in the game but the respawn point is never too far away from the area's set of bosses.  The wall art and ruined/overgrown structures in some environments tells you bits of a story and there's a cryptic message from one of the titans that gives you an idea of who the character is. It's open enough so you can toss around ideas in your head and let your imagination run wild.  A fun yet challenging little game with a suprising amount fo depth.",

The initial pitch made me stay away: that it was a game just about boss fights, all of which required fast reflexes to avoid one-hit death, all hinging around their weak points. That is all the game does, yet it does this brilliantly. Bosses obey very different rule sets, some mirroring how you use the bow and single arrow, others being giant mimic chests or tentacled plants, requiring very different approaches. It's a game with one weapon, the bow, and you only have one arrow which you'll have to retrieve if you miss. Yet the versatility of challenges in the boss fights with that one weapon are inspiring. It's all done with remarkable pixelart and a soundtrack that often draws on Transiberian Orchestra and Legend of Korra. By the end, it oozes style and begs you to hunt down the hidden titans. I had a blast.",

The game is pretty cool, but most of the time you find yourself yelling due to dying again, and again, and again... The game is really hard and you'll find yourself dead most of the time while trying to figure out the bosses' patterns. Luckily you feel like a king after finally defeating the bosses. I didn't find the aim system very good, making me doubt the solution to defeating a few bosses since you thought you hit their weak spot. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this game to hardcore gamers who like puzzles and a good challenge.",

            "review_text": "Okay, let me just start out by saying that this is one of the best and most creative games I have played in a long time.  - They have no minions, puzzles or even platforming in order to get to the bosses. Generally, this would make them anticlimactic, but a combination of the vast and beautiful world you travel through to get between them and the fact that you don't have to finish one boss before moving on to the next (which means you will clear out all the ones you find easy first, and be left with the ones which seems like an impossible challange). - You can figure out how to beat the bosses through a well balanced combination of logical deduction and trial &amp; error. - After playing for an hour I suddenly managed a boss on my third try, and it felt incredibly satisfying, as I felt like I had actually become better over the past few battles. - No health bars means you don’t have to keep trying and trying to beat a boss even after you figured out how to hurt it (especially important in a game where you are supposed to die a few times). This put the focus on what the player want to do: figure out how to kill these gigant titans! - No extensive backtracking (since it’s open world) and no filler rooms with no real purpose, means that every single time you explore a new area, it’s exiting! - Different trace in the snow when you roll, rolling down stairs etc. (the devils in the details)  Reading through the negative reviews was what drove me to leave this one, because far too many of the claims are invalid.  - The few seconds it takes to get back into combat after respawning are strictly necessary to prevent the game to just feel like endlessly beating up the same guy. It is the very thing that make you feel the weight of having only one life. That you are fighting things that has a million different ways of killing you in a split second. In addition I would feel like I surrendered if I at any point spawned inside the boss room, but had to leave because I was tired of dying to the same titan. Now I just feel like I'm saving it for later! - If the world was full of people and objects to interact with, it would lose all it's impact. Anyone who has played shadow of the colossus will know what I mean. The feeling that this world is unchanging, and have been like this since times unknown requires that you don't find belongings of others all around the place. And the effect the lonelyness has on the mood of the game speaks for itself.",
