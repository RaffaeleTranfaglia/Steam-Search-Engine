But I decided to purchase the game and after first hour in the battle, I must say: this is game worth every cent... On playable level, its even better than previous one, but what amazed me most, this game is polished to the level I dreamed of. The frame rates is absolutely great, even with hundreds of units....  Expecting first DLC soon ;)",

            "review_text": "I am a very avid wargamer and have played a decent amount of titles, and this game is possibly one of the best wargames out there for its scope. There are several layers to wargames, strategic, operational, tactical and this game falls under the category of the last two for how the game plays out in its two phases. The first is a layer which shows a large map consisting of a company sized force. Which is organized down to battalion, platoon and at the lowest level, squad.   Those that bought this game right away are fans of the first Graviteam game Operation Star, which was a gem in its own right but had its problems which come naturally from a Ukranian/Russian game studio. The most obvious of which is a very confusing user interface. Although it did change from GTOS there is an increased amount of abstraction but gives a decent amount of info. The first game allowed you to detach units from the reserve groups and manually attach them to platoons with a spare space. This is changed in this game because now you do not have the option to attach these reserves on a specific nature. Instead you choose the type on reinforcement on the management screen, and then hope you got what you wanted. For instance in the first you could move an anti tank rifle squad into a platoon, nice and simple, but now you would select 'anti-tank' and you may get that squad, or a gun. If you select support you may get a mortar or an arty spotter. This simulates the 'you get what you are given so stop complaining' nature of warfare but sacrifices control of platoon composition  The graphics are amazing, and are much improved from the last game. It looks great, so I'll leave it at that.  Sound is a bit to be desired with slightly cut off and strange sounding guns and explosions, however these will be modded in the near future. Going down close to soldiers also lets you hear them laughing...really...damn...awkwardly  Tactical battles are a work of art but leave a little to be desired in regards of unit control. This game simulates high level command so there is only so much you can control. All you can basically do is tell your units to move in a certain formation, face a direction and give target priorities. Although you can adjust the modifiers of how your units move in a neat radial menu. I would like to be able to adjust rate of fire, and grenade usage. However this will be forgotten in the heat of battle.  As I said before, the UI sucks. Its horrible, its ugly, and its only a minor improvement from GTOS. The manual does not help with this..  Lets conclude this haphazard review. This game is NOT for casual strategy fans, that comes out as elitist, but this game is designed for a very niche group of people called Grognards, these people play very abstracted games focused on wargames with a high level of complexity. This is reflected in the type of warfare that plays out which is primarily skirmisher warfare. Where units get into trenches, spot the enemy and fight a battle of attrition. You wont flank through gullys, charge a fortification or storm a building. You will be placing your units through forests and positioning at the edge for them to fire at the enemy. This is pure skirmisher warfare and it is not for those expecting a Company Of Heroes or Men of War Experience. Behind the bad UI is a beautiful gem of a wargame that can allow one to simulate high command on a operational and tactical level. Where you can give general orders to your units and hope they have the strength to carry them out. This game is for wargamers, and not for people looking for a quick campaign.",

            "review_text": "Any game where you can run over dudes in trenches with tanks to kill them is OK in my book.    This game is so good its funny. I still do not know the intricacies of the game completely. When that happens they better cancel Christmas.    Like other reviewers have said, its like Combat Mission games with less micro and more macro. You are more a battalion commander rather than every single officer in the game. Oh and its half the price of those games.    The operational interface is a bit obtuse, but with a little time, its workable. The actual battles are nothing short of amazing. The AI is decent too. I've see flanking maneuvers, over watch tactics, ambushes, etc. all executed by the AI. They also run over dudes in trenches with tanks. Also a very deft, albeit direct, tactic.",

An incredible game where deep strategy meets in a real time world. Players that can navigate a UI that, out of necessity, is very complex, yet gets easier each time you play, are rewarded with the most realistic WWII experience out there. Quite simply, there is nothing else like it that integrates operational aspects and tactical battles with such wonderful results. Graviteam included so many small details in this game that other developers overlook that make it truly unique. A masterpiece. But not for the feint of heart. It takes commitment to be an effective commander. That is my only warning.   9.8/10",

            "review_text": "Updated Review: I had not a NO recommendation because I was below the recommended specs and the game suffered, HARD, on performance. It was like trying to play a slideshow. Here's my updated review:  Given the fact that I've recently upgraded my rig (considerably) with upper level components, this game runs smooth as silk now. This is the best 'war' simulator you're going to get on the market. It takes some getting used to because it's not a typical RTS control system. If you're thinking about getting this, look up the YouTube videos, there's more being uploaded for this game everyday. But if you're REALLY leaning on getting this game, then you owe it to yourself to watch the tutorials on the Operation Star gameplay. While this game is much improved in many ways (UI is more intuitive, AI is better, etc...), the core gameplay and approach is pretty much the same between the two games. If the tutorials on YouTube for Operation Star seem like your cup of tea, then this is a game you will really learn to love.   I'm looking forward to mods and DLC.  This game is HIGHLY recommended *If you and ONLY if you meet the recommended specs*",

            "review_text": "Mius is Graviteam's latest deeply complex wargame, which we can expect to receive constant attention from the developers for many years to come. Mius breaks new ground in Graviteam's steady march toward a true battlefield simulator.   Compared to prior titles, Mius brings noticeably enhanced graphics, a more elegant interface, more units on the field, more complex AI behavior, more complex munitions, more extensive use of air support in combined arms combat, smoke screen, artillery fuse settings, and more.   The developers respond quickly to reports of flaws and they are always working on new features and DLCs. Prices are always reasonable, but sale prices outright undervalue the game.  As with all Graviteam titles, Mius is not a game you can just pick up and play. You have to learn the interface and commands, in addition to the funcitionality of all the weapons systems in the game. You have to understand the effects of terrain, down to whether your heavy weapons can move through a muddy field. You have to understand the effects of weather, such as how to deal with wind or storms.   Beware that you will only find Mius' greatest rewards after extensive efforts to understand details of the battlefield.",

            "review_text": "As an older gamer in his mid fifties who is obsessed with WW2 and especially the Eastern Front, this game is a dream come true. So far with only 16 hours in I am still on the steep learning curve as to how to do things but, that said, with every hour played and with helpful tutorials, especially on You Tube, even those for the earlier Graviteam game Operation Star, I am understanding more. With this understanding you realise just what depth and knowledge this game has to offer, There is a saying that the Devil is in the details and there is one huge Devil in this game. The Binocular and magnifying glass view of your tanks taking AT fire, of hits and brewing vehicles with molten steel sparking high into the air as ammo cooks off makes the game worth the price alone. The inclusion of German and Russian as the language being shouted by the soldiers adds to the historical depth that runs through the veins of the programming that has been lovingly coded into this creation.  I could go on for many paragraphs about the attention to detail here but suffice to say, having a library of over 300 books just on the Eastern Front alone, Mius Front beats the oppositon in so many ways showing the War in that theatre of operations. Get over your concern about how to actually cope with all the menus and control options as they will make sense over time. I am still learning and will be for a few days if not weeks but who cares. Buy this game and Operation Star and a smile as wide as the Russian front will appear on your face.",

            "review_text": "  Extremely lacking in content. I managed to learn how to play (really wasnt that hard as somebody experienced with complex WWII strategy games), and had a blast. Then I realized how empty this game truly is. The base game has 1 map...ONE. Okay so thats not so bad considering the size I suppose. Then I went to try and change the settings to make a custom battle take place in winter since of course, this game takes place in ♥♥♥♥ing Russia, right? WRONG. You can not get a single drop of snow on the ground in this game. You can make it winter, you can make there be a blizzard with snow blowing around, yet the grass will remain green as a hot July day, even though tanks will have winter camo, and trenches will be white as if they were dug out of snow. Thought something was wrong, so I check the community hub. The Dev comes off as an absolute moron. They say 'Well people didn't like snow in GTOS so we completely removed it from Mius Front. The game is exlusively set in the summer' Which is just an absurd thing. I could understand this quote a little better, if there wasn't an option to ♥♥♥♥ing set the battles in the winter, and change infantry camo to winter, only to have it do absolutely NOTHING.   Its a joke of a game, really. I'm fortunate enough that this was gifted to me for Christmas, but I feel bad that the money was wasted. This game is NOT worth $35, it is NOT worth the sale price of $22.74, and it would not even be worth $15. I would say this game is worth $5-$10 TOPS. It is an overpriced P.O.S. completely lacking in content. It will be fun at first, but once you get the hang of things, you realize how awful this is. If you want to get into it, get Operation Star. That game is also lacking in content, but the price during the sale is very reasonable. This game however, is a joke. Please do not buy it for more than $10. I wish I learned sooner how much of a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ this is, so I could've taken it off my wishlist.  *I do not care if there are more maps in any sort of DLC. The point remains that you still can not get any snow on the ground, and everything is locked to a summer theme. I will not be investing any more money into this garbage unless it was some sort of snow map, which sounds ridiculous. Why should I have to pay extra to get snow in a setting that is known for its harsh winters and heavy snowfall?*",
