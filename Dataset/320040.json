It could be based on a actual old legend! `Multiple Characters to choose from (plus 2 hidden ones!) `Multiple Endings `Cooking! `Random Maps! Some maps are fixed, such as the 1st map the player starts on `Great Musical Score! `ARPG basically.. `Different skills per character you play!  Cons: `Repetitive once you beat it once. It can get boring doing it over and over again to get everything in the game `Some maps are fixed and are always the same event on them! `Getting Moon Opals(Money) is quite hard and must be farmed for!     Multiplayer is SO-SO online: Last time i played the game online with others there were some disconnection bugs..still it is quite fun to play. There are also some map bugs when you play online, but the game is pretty playable even when online...so yea, multiplayer online is fun. Don't be put off by these small hiccups though, you just need to friend someone on the forums here and invite them automatically into the game..it bypasses the lobby code on the game..  Anyway, the pro's outweight the cons in my personal opinion.",

I have to say there really is something special about It that keeps me coming back. Sitting down with a couple people and just playing is loads of fun and engaging, and even if the campaign is short, It is meant to be that way, The game isnt quite a rogue like but it is meant to be played as one, you start over again when you finish carrying through only minimal things from before. but those things can make a difference. I do reccomend this game, but not as a solo or an online game. As a great couch coop game.  ",

            "review_text": "This game boasts procedural generation when in reality the effects it has on the game is minimal. This game is extremely bare bones and does not offer much replayability in regards to story and gameplay. I managed to play through the game 3 times in 100 minutes. I beat the final boss the second time and all I recieved was a different ending cutscene and a new map which doesn't add much gameplay wise. Gameplay consisted of either slowly picking off enemies using the same basic attacks while trying to avoid damage and running past everything trying to find the exit because I had no health.   The trait system is odd and seemed like a good idea but was underused. You get one or two traits early on depending on a vague choice and then if you are lucky you get the chance to use them. (I never did) Pros: -Great Soundtrack -Good Cutscenes -Character Design Cons: -Low replay value -Combat is meh -AI constantly gets stuck in place -Weird hitboxes on the enemies with frontal protection (you have to hit them from an angle? I think?) -Feels bare bones and underdeveloped  I was hyped for this game and am severly dissapointed. I'm sure this game could be great if they added more features and diversity in gameplay but until then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  (Also people comparing this game to Zelda and Diablo are full of ♥♥♥♥ lmao)",

            "review_text": "I currently have 13h on the beta version of the game.  First of all : Even if it looks like an action packed Mana game serie, be aware that this game is about the journey, the seek and the poetry more than fighting (but there are fights if you like them, and in co-op, it will feel like a Gauntlet)   You are seeking for a goddess that you might or might not find and different things happens each time you play, even when you make mostly the same choice. 'Each time you play' means 'each time one of your character become a legend in 5 days and nights', which happens kinda fast to be honest.   So here it comes : the Main features :   - Rogue like concepts. - Fast, easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master fighting system. You might die a lot, especially with the bard, but don't worry, it's part of the story to run away sometimes.  - NG+ mechanics A LOT. In most rogue like, you spend a lot of time in game but you rarely beat the final boss. Here it can happen really often, but even if you die against it, you'll unlock new features anyway.  - Poetry ! Songs and winds whispers are delightful !  - You didn't read dialogues in game since the old RPG era ? This game might make you actually read the dialogues again, and wanting to read it, which for me is incredible.   Conclusion : Blend Gauntlet with rogue like elements, put an extra 110% poetry and 'play again if you want to see what I have to offer' and you have a solid, original and enchanting game.   This game is like none other until now, and really has some fresh air for your face, so for me it's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "There are a lot of things to like about Moon Hunters. The game is fun to play. If you like 2D action/adventure games, like Zelda or Diablo, I think you will have a lot of fun with the game. The controls are pretty simple but are responsive. The game works better as a co-op game but you can still have fun with the game in single player. Moon Hunters probably works best in group settings where some of the players aren't experienced gamers since the game is pretty easy overall.  The story is interesting and I like that every decision you make has an effect on gameplay as well as the ending. Each decision you make gives you stat boosts that help you in the game. When you finish the game you also get a little story about your journey telling the legend of your hero. This legend gives you details about what happened to your hero after your journey. Combine this with great music and good graphics and Moon Hunters creates an engaging environment.  The biggest problem with the game is that each game is quite short (30 minutes to one and a half hours). This means you will quickly start running into repeated material. While the worlds appear to be randomly generated, the events that you encounter start to repeat themselves quite a bit. A good example is that the final boss of the game seems to always be the same (unless I have yet to find events that change the final boss battle). While this doesn't ruin the game, it keeps it from being as good as it could have been.   If you like 2D action/adventure games you should enjoy Moon Hunters. If you want to fully explore the game's world you can get quite a bit out of the game. If you don't like to repeat a lot of material though you may not get as much out of the game as you were expecting.

I don't love how repetitive it is though and a lot of the playthrough feels sort of aimless, like I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing so I sort of just wander around until I die. I think if it were a little bit more clear what I'm supposed to accomplish beyond don't die and eventually beat the final boss, I would enjoy this game a lot more/not mind how repetitive it is. Still it is enjoyable to play and like I said already, beautifully made.",

The cut scenes are beautifully illustrated and the dialogue articulate. The game is meant to be explored several times through, enabling the player to discover new and refreshing classes, skills, and areas. As a co-op team, it is much more thrilling. It is interesting and unique to see each player's choices and decisions in real time. While the game does not provide much background or lore in the beginning, the universe still feels deeply thoughtful and story-rich.  My only real critique of the game is the customization options. I am a left-handed gamer, and at the time of writing this review you are not able to rebind keys from WASD, which makes it more difficult for me to navigate versus the arrow keys.",

The cooking system and the constellations have kept me coming back to play it through multiple times, as well as the changes to the story for each choice you make.   There are some cons, being there are a limited number of choices and you can get into the same ending pretty easily if not careful. But everytime you unlock something, you expand the amount of things to do next playthrough as well.   The soundtrack is one to remember and a pleasure to listen to.   I'd say $10 or below is a very fair deal and to buy it at such, if it's there.",

Though my friends commented on how it would be nice to set up some custom options on the game, such as longer game length to be able to explore a bit further before the end. Either way, we have not unlocked everything in this game. It will definitely be coming out for another round on our next gaming night. Highly recommended as a couch co-op.

I am not a kickstarter backer, but since I saw this game a year ago I was really excited and hyped, and waited patiently. Unfortunately this game lacks replay value. Sure, you unlock new things, such as events, cooking dishes and constellations, but that's all I can come up with. It feels incomplete, unpolished and pretty hollow.   No challenge, no story. The only motivation I get to replay it is to see what new events I can trigger, that is if im really lucky. I will hope that it gets patched regulary and polished because Moon Hunters has huge potential.  I dont know if its ok to mention other games, but It would be nice that the devs could play other roguelikes such as rogue legacy, risk of rain, faster than light, binding of isaac, darkest dungeon and many more, and see why they were succesful, and compare them to moon hunters. Im not saying the game should be similiar to those i mentioned, but to grasp what can moon hunters offer their users to make them keep playing, and surely constellations arent enought.  TL;DR: We need a more drastic change in gameplay in each play session.",

When I looked deeper, I discovered that they planned to incorporate so many of the things my friends and I added to our experiences playing Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, and I think SquareEnix would do well to look at this game if they ever want to try to create a true sequel to FFCC.  Launch was a bit rough with a few balancing issues, bugs, and the unexpected short-form play style, but Kitfox is engaged and attentive to their community and have worked since launch correcting and improving the game. I was so impressed with the results of their hard work that I decided to suggest a 'Practice Makes Perfect' Steam Award specifically for Kitfox and Moon Hunters.

The character's playstyles are unique, and the story is pretty interesting.  However, after afew playthroughs, the gameplay becomes abit monotonous. Each area you go through follow a similiar pattern that after my 4th playthrough I wasnt having fun anymore just trying to see a different ending. Plus I never felt really challenged throughout the whole thing. Thats not a brag, I'm not MLG pro or anything, it just kinda felt I was skating by. And I felt the game did alot of telling rather than showing. For instance, some dudes asked me who I thought was hotter, I choose one, then at the end it informs me I made out with him??   I'd reccomend picking this game up if you wanna play a co-op adventure with friends. Espescially if it goes on sale. I just hope the developers build upon this game and release a more fully fleshed out sequal! Thanks you guys.",

I have only played a few hours so far, but I feel like I have barely scratched the surface. This game is challenging at first, and incredibly fun with more players. Easy to play with controller or keyboard, but I recommend controller :)",

Plus there are many things to explore in the world. You can't just play through the game once, or twice, or even 20 time!",

I wasn't good, and my character ended up being garbage, but I had a great time. I played again, had a blast, and made a slightly better character. Yes, some playthroughs have the same events. Yeah, the challenge starts to fade once you figure out combat mechanics. But I really felt like each of my characters were unique and interesting, and that my paths were varied and compelling. Looking forward to future playthroughs, as well as seeing what the devs has in store for the future.",

            "review_text": "I'd give this game a solid 8.5/10.  Pros: - The roguelike elements ala groundhog day: that means that every action you take makes the game progress. Even dying all of the 5 days. Each playthrough digs deeper into the story and builds itself more complex and interesting. - The classes: interesting, plays well, pretty cool co-op, different story paths each character. - The art: gorgeous game. - Random events and environment shape your adventure. You start with one of the classes, map and levels are randomly generated with events, npcs or places that will affect the outcome of the playthrough. - Character skill customization: each character has upgradable that will affect attacks/spells/permanent. You need to buy them and think how you want to play it this playthrough.  To improve: - I feel the combat is a bit too rigid. But not by that much.  Cons:  - Ally AI: This game needs pathfinding. Tue summons and following allies always end being stuck somewhere every 5 seconds. - Boss difficulty: Every boss is really easy. There's always a ways to exploit them somehow. Not mucha challenge. - Bugs: I found a few innocent bugs here and there. Nothing gamebreaking.    I really enjoy this game.  Disclaimer: I read my review and devided to improve the score from 8/10 to 8.5/10. I felt that it lost half a point because I think it needs more DLC, and I don't think it's fair to remove half a point to something that needs to be more of itself. I rate the quality, not the quantity.  HOLY. I just tried the songweaver. Those mechanics are really interesting. Great idea.",
