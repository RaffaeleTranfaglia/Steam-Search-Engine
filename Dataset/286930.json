    "description": "Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action/RPG game developed for SNK’s Neo Geo console which came out in 1990. It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules.",

            "review_text": "When this game was first released onto steam I wanted to give it a shot. The art looked alright and the crude humor seemed entertaining. Sadly I haven't even been able to get past the second level. The combat is baffling. While there's nothing wrong with color coded attacks making them go at a snail's pace doesn't help. More often than not you'll try attacking a red enemy just to have a blue enemy shamble in frony of them in the ages it takes your projectile to reach them. The enemies also are damage sponges yet you die in just a few hits which is no fun, especially when it's paired with a lack of a dependable checkpoint system. Maybe they were trying to give it a classic type of difficulty but it just doesn't work with how the game plays. I wish I would've waited before buying this game.",

            "review_text": "Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon is a horrible action/RPG game which tries too hard to be funny or look oldschool.  The gameplay is awful and very boring. You have 2 attacks, but you will only use the ranged one since the melee one is useless and will get you killed. There are 3 types of enemies, the red ones and the blue ones, you have to kill them with a shuriken of their color and also the purple enemies who must be fought with weak melee attacks, you won't even stop their attack animation by hitting them. You will spend most of your time running around and trying to kite. This game is clunky due to your firing rate being slow, the movement being slow, you will have to mash the button because you can't hold it down and it also only fires in the direction of movement. Enemy spawns are based on movement so they will sometimes pretty much appear in your face. There is also arena mode which locks you in one screen with many enemies and doesn't let you out, you are pretty much dead and it's not fun at all. The RPG elements are very bad, it is incredibly hard to level up and you will probably be too poor to buy anything in the shop, but that isn't meaningful because the game is linear and you can't grind. Also, the controls are complete garbage and the enemies will sometimes glitch into a wall and become unkillable. The level design is dull, and it's also easy to get lost on the map, the cursor only points to the location you need to get and not how to get there which is not helpful.  The only good thing about this game might be the graphics, which i find pretty nice. The sound sucks as well. The story is stupid and I can barely understand it, it's something about retrieving a chest because some old guy dressed as Batman in BVDs wants it. You have to choose between two characters which are big, clunky and slow despite beign ninjas, one is a guy in a horse outfit named Pony who says nothing but 'oompf!' during the cut scenes or the over-sexualized girl named biki, who wears nothing but a mask, a very small bra on some huge ♥♥♥ tiitties and a tanga (as can be seen on screenshot number 6 of the game).   I don't recommend this game, horrible gameplay, horrible story, not funny 5/10.",
