            "review_text": "Story: Vanessa Helsing, grand-daughter of Abraham van Helsing, receives an invitation to come visit Father Bendict in Viva, Italy. Since her grandfather is missing Vanessa goes there for information. She is also having terrible nightmares and day-mares and hopes Father Benedict can answer those questions too. Father Benedict explains her family and ultimately she is a part of the secret organization, the Order of Light. It is the organization's task and hers to prevent demonic evil from entering this world through a gate door. Vanessa embarks on a quest to return the four runic seals stolen form the door and to find her missing grandfather who was/is chasing the traitor thief.   Gameplay: This plays very well with amazing cutscenes. There are ultimately 5 areas with subareas which break down into 8 chapters, plus the epilogue bonus chapter. The first area is the cathedral from which 4 other areas open via a portal, and another area for the bonus chapater. Warning: while searching for the grandfather's letters (scrolls) make sure to find all of them in a given area, since once the runic seal is found Vanessa is instantly teleported to the gate door and there is no longer access to that area.   The game is quite a bit point and click, with some different puzzles types from the standard fare (several quite difficult slides in that 'keeping track of where the pieces are supposed to go type' of way). The HO scenes are of two types: 1) the normal list with a use object (highlighted in red on the find list) and a sub/hidden HO scene with more objects (highlighted in blue on the find list). 2) A reverse list called 'It goes where?' In this HO the gamer puts the clue items (pictures) on their 'list' into the HO scene. For example: A glove on the list would be placed next to its mate to make a pair. A very different type of HO perspective and the reverse of a standard find. Note: the reverse HO scene (placing objects into a HO scene) does count toward the Eagle Eye Achievement (find all clues in 1 minute or less). {Much discussion about this achievement in the threads, and I am unsure whether or not all achievements are possible in a single playthrough. I personally cannot do this the first time nor do I try to ever get this particular achievement the first time.} I think every scene gets played twice first as a reverse scene by adding objects then secondly as a straight clue list find.   I think the cutscenes are excellent. There are quite a few, especially when meeting and talking with the characters. The game is slightly interactive in that regard since the characters give exposition as well as clues. If a character is there click on them, and in one case where the character does not leave click on them at least twice to get all the information and clues needed for that particular area.  This is fairly difficult and relatively long Hidden Object game. The only real difference when playing on 'expert' mode is the lack of sparkles on the HO scenes and the skip feature on the puzzles. There is an in-game strategy guide so there should be no problems if the gamer gets stuck. The no-penalty fast travel map comes in handy when looking for missed non-sparkling HO scenes. There is back and forth travel between the portal world and the real world while figuring out how to get that area's runic seal.   The only extra find are grandfather's letters in the form of a scroll, 15 in total. The scrolls are easy to locate and are not 'hidden' in the least. As I warned before find all the scrolls in a particular portal area before leaving by taking the runic seal since portal areas lock at completion and cannot be reentered.  All in all an excellent game to play.",

            "review_text": "Good length, easy/easy-med Hidden Object game.  The story is interesting and weaves the different areas together. Graphics and sound both good, nice atmosphere. There is a map/teleport system to help you get around quickly and easily. Several styles of hidden object, many different logic, memory, 'follow me' and other mini puzzles give good variety.  Achievements should be easy enough to 100%, though it may take a second partial run through.  Recommend letting your crayon-eaters play this on the easy setting to save frustration.",

The mini-games are fun and range between easy and challenging. The hidden object scenes switch between adding objects to the scene and the traditional seek and find. I definitely recommend this game if you like HOG adventures.",

There is a hints button so you don't get stuck anywhere, and a map for easy moving around.  To play the game including watching the short cutscenes, playing all the minigames and the bonus chapter, it takes about 4 hours to complete. In the Extras section you can replay the minigames at your leisure which is nice.",
