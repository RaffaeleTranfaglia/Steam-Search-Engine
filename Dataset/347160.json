            "review_text": "Fun at first, but gets old rather quickly. Still worth getting on sale though   The good stuff: -Music is awesome. Always enjoyable to listen to when playing, gives a good baseline for shooting things in space with some rock/metal soundtrack. -Graphics. Gorgeous pixel art is gorgeous. Well done! -Daily Runs with specific weapons and powerups. Unfortunately you can only try once, but at this point it's the only thing that maks me still paly the game occasionaly Because...  The bad stuff: Unlike other shmups where you can memorize the patterns and get better at handling certain difficult situations, by either changing your play or picking a different weapon to handle it, here you obviously can't cause it's all 'randomly' generated. So while there are specific waves that might come at one point or another in a certain level, you don't knwo for sure, and you don't know when. And some of those waves are are pretty brutal, able to take half your life in seconds if you don't react quickly.  Also, since the dropship (that has the weapons) is random, you can and will miss it a bunch, purely cause of the way the wave is structured. So that if you weren't accidentally in the right position 10 seconds before the ship shows up or don't accidentaly have a few very specific weapons you just can't get it. Combine that with wayyyy too many weapons (imo). I've played over 5 hours and haven't even seen all of them. And most of them aren't even that great or fun. A lot of quirky experimental stuff, that's just plain worse than other drops.  So often, you want/need a certain type of weapon sooner or later (like spreadshots or stuff that hits hard but is very focused) and in the end, that's what you're gonna keep and not any of the 20 other weapons that are thrown at you along the way.  Similar with the powerups at the end of the level. There are some you almsot never pick and some you absolutely want.  Now sure, one can argue, that that's the idea, that you have to learn to play with weird combos and get good at those too. Alright, if that's your thing, enjoy. But even so there's gonna be a lot of frustration coming your way, as you try and test new weapons, find yourself in unmanagable situations as a result of that and often just lose the run a few minutes later.  Last but not least. IF your'e the guy who enjoys highscoring and repeating runs for ever more points then the scoring mechanic is kind of a letdown. Most of the points (and I mean like 95% or so) come from bosses and the wave multiplier.  You get a multiplier for each wave you kill or dodge succesfuly and you lose some multiplier it whenever you get hit. But because the boss is the only thing that has a good base point value, what that means is, all you really need to do is not get hit at the boss for high scores, as IF you get to the boss you usually got a good enough multiplier on the way anyway, else you'd be dead from the waves.  So basically, scoring comes down to getting good at the bossfights and makes the rest a bit irrelevant.  Again, not my thing, but if you like that high payout at the end instead of more steady increases during the wave, then go for it. I myself wish at this point I wouldn't have spent the money on the game, because even though it was interesting at the beginning it wore out rather quickly (but just out of the 2 hours you can still ask for refund, yay) ",

            "review_text": "Well I deleted my old review because I wanted to make a BIGGER BETTER one but not before like a smart person.  The game has a few flaws, which are simply the raw-input d-pad/keyboard control buffers (you shouldn't have any problem with a properly config'd analogue keyboard), lack of a 'focus' key, and a bit of weapon balancing. Other than that, the game is phenomenal.  Now, I grew up with mostly western shooters, like Raptor (if you buy this PLEASE get the original 1994 version and use DOSBox) and Tyrian, I did pick up Eastern shooters like R-Type and Ikaruga later in life, and found those cool too. On top of that I've played a lot of Java and Flash games that came in various flavors. I like them both for what they are and are not - gameplay, art, music, story (if applicable), etc.  This game takes both worlds of shmup, fuses them together with the French's obsession with shmups as a catalyst, and dials it up to eleven with  one of the most ♥♥♥♥awesome metal soundtracks ever made  [zandernoriega.bandcamp.com] , a grimdark story told with absolutely zero dialogue, an arsenal of well-designed weapons and upgrades that range from basic to Wild Zero, a ridiculously balanced enemy, enemy weapon, and damage sheet...  and some of the most aesthetically beautiful pieces of pixel art and animations, with layers of detail based on distance, paint-to-pixel designed, infinitely scrolling, scifi backgrounds, and super-low-detail combat sprites for less distraction and more action, as well as a helpful contrast against the incredibly detailed environments. Sure, some of that may have been due to their budget, but they're better for it.  As others may have said, it is very difficult, and that is no joke. Yes, some attacks do have patterns, but some of those 'patterns' are actually just spread/inaccuracy, so you have to account for that too. In the mean time you have artificial barriers like Laser Maze traps, including  shielded  ones, asteroid installations, shockwave ships, e-barrier ships, and lil destroyers with a 2-point damage laser that can come at you in waves of  four , all while you're being shot at with directed weapons fire from fighters, gunships with heavy blasters, and those one-two-punch 'mini' frigates. I think I forgot to mention the anti-air hazard. Yeah. Laser fire from above, in random intervals. Have you played Freespace2 at all? And accidentally got within 1.5km of a decked-out GTC Leviathan-class? Basically that. You get double score while it's active, doe.  And come loop 1, you will have enemies dropping shots on death, firing faster boolits faster (and more often than not, more boolits), and bosses dropping waves e-barriers making your life that much harder. Oh, and there's zero backup. You are 100% alone.  However, your ship is  tough . It is not to be ♥♥♥♥ed with. With effectively unlimited ammo for any weapon system, six points of armor and four points of hull, and an emergency screen powered by oncoming fire that can damage enemy ships, you can take a lot. And by a lot, I mean three hits from the Destroyer's main laser cannon tough (each hit from it does four damage). Your ship will also reconstruct itself fully using precious metals dropped by bosses. You can upgrade your armor by two points (stackable), give yourself a regenerating shield that phases you out once destroyed, buffer a bit of beam laser fire, take less damage from collisions, and even reflect damage done to you upon everyone and every thing  on-screen ('in the words of my generation: UP. YOURRRRRRRSSS!'), given you chance these perks from a boss, OR equip yourself with one of two defensive weapon systems that either protect you from all damage or reflect enemy boolits (this one can obliterate a Battleship in nothing flat).  Don't even get me started on weapons. But I will say, yes, it  does  have The Only Way To Be Sure™. Lastly, you'll notice an achievement called 'ULTRAWARRIOR,' for beating the game with just the Good Blaster At Your Side. It is possible. I've done it, and I'm not even that good and have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controler (F310 with faulty sticks). Do not, I repeat:  do not  underestimate the Blaster.  Whether you are a danmaku master or a western shmup connoisseur, you will have your hands absolutely full. ♥♥♥♥ yes this game is hard, but it is the  best  kind of hard:  This game is 100% adrenaline.",

EVERYONE should have this if they're a fan of these types of bullet hell space games. The content is great, the replayability is great, the graphics are fantastic, the characters / ships aren't annoying or overly done, the weapons are very unique (Huge jaw that can bite enemies? SWEET!), and much more. As someone who is rather picky with my purchaces and tests games out on an old crappy laptop BEFORE using them on my good one, I can say I'm very satisfied with this game. It runs great on any old laptop and especially the newer ones. The only thing that's a slight, slight pain is that bosses and certain enemies can have REALLY fast attacks that are incredibly hard to dodge without prior knowledge of what they do and how their patterns work, so it can be tough to play through on your first couple runs. Although, that's to be expected. That being said, it's NOT overly difficult to learn, and there's DEFINITELY not a super, super steep / frustrating learning curve. It's done just right.   It's everything you'd expect you'd be getting and more. What's especially nice is the crazy support for key bindings (mouse friendly) and controllers! More game companies need to get in this habbit. It's so refreshing not to find myself frustrated with annoying controls or lack of controller usage.",

There are some exeptions, like the asteroid belt level and space debris level, but once I've destroyed the boss cube, I pretty much forget everything leading up to that point. Throw in a bunch of weapons and powerups that mostly serve as novelties and you'll quickly realize that once you try to get serious about progressing in this game, 9 times out of 10, you'll be ill equipped to handle the steep challenge.

Many of these points were summarized in other reviews so I didn’t really put much effort into the review. I apologize.  Steredenn has fantastic graphics, audio, atmosphere, and variety and it really drew me in when I started playing it and I still love these aspects of the game. However the game punishes players very hard for anything less than a perfect performance. On top of that there is a function of luck involved in beating the game because only a few items and upgrades are helpful in progressing through the levels and bosses. There is no permanent progression or anything like that so when you do lose its back to start. It is frustrating because the game is so punishing I'm not able to see the rest of the game. I would love to see all the different and unique enemies of the moderate and higher levels but it is effectively blocked to more novice and even intermediate players. The further you make it the more unenjoyable it seems to become because of the looming punishment of losing all progress. If you’re a hardcore side scrolling shooter fan you will love this game it is worth will be for you. If you’re anything less than hardcore you will have a tough time getting through the game. Steredenn is 13$ currently and that’s fine given its high quality but for being unable to enjoy most of it I can’t recommend it. If they added even a teeny tiny minor element of permanent progression I would change this to a recommendation in a heartbeat. Mabey by unlocking different ships with slightly different characteristics or configurations; Or by keeping a fraction of effects from upgrades acquired from boss fights. It can be anything really but playing this as it is feels like beating my head against a wall. Hell you can even make these changes in a side mode and keep the main game as is and I would be cool with it. Wishful thinking for now but maybe in the future they’ll add some of this to it.
