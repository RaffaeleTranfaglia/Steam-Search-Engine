            "review_text": "This was a fun little game. Not very long, not overly complex or maddenly difficult...just a nice little journey though a trauma victim's memories and impressions. Gameplay is essentially point and click for navigation, and you learn to create these 'symbols' (performed with mouse-based gestures) that have generic purposes (e.g., directional controls) and in some cases can be used in less-than-obvious (but usually clever) applications. A modicum of replayability is achieved via multiple solutions/endings to each chapter, and by finding all of the 'polaroids' thoughout.  If you're worried about bang-for-the-buck, then get it on sale like I did. Take a look at the screenshots to see if you like the photographic art style. It's certainly not for everybody. But if you're looking for something simple and explorative, a touch psychological, with some light puzzle elements, then it might be for you.",

You play a female who has been involved in a car accident. She keeps having four recurring dreams which you can navigate through a set of photos. You must discover the ending for each dream and can alternatively find various polaroids and alternative endindgs scattered throughout. I completed the game in around ninety minutes. It was enjoyable exploring the dreams but the narrative was sparse, the voice acting left a lot to be desired and the game mechanics became repetitive.  Because of the price, I would still recommend this game, although don't expect to be blown away or entertained for hours.",

The game does possess the quality of brevity, but in this case, that's a strength - any more would have been exhausting.  The only thing that might have made it better, and this is entirely subjective and debatable, would have been to get further into the mind of the character. There are a great many subtle queues that enable the player to relate to the character, with the game mechanics being worked into this relationship in an ingenious way. However, when I had finally found every little thing in the game, I didn't feel particularly close to the character. Of course, that may have been intentional.  The mechanics of the game are very reminiscent of a game called The Void, even down to the look of the symbols as they are drawn, but that's not a bad thing - The Void was a creative masterpiece that way and I love the interface.  I highly recommend this.",

            "review_text": "A creative, inventive, and intelligent experiment ... that ultimately fails.  First off, the price tag is cheeky. I'm sure a lot of effort went into making this game, but the same is true for many independent games that are cheap or free. Some humility is in order here.  The mix of photography and film is gorgeous and very evocative, though calling it 'real-time 3D technology' is plain deceptive, because the scenes are all in 2D. The voice acting is good enough, the music forgettable but fitting.  Make no mistake, despite the artistic pretense this is intended to be a playable game. As such, it's a bad one: a very hard hidden-object game with 'secrets' instead of puzzles. The game might take a few hours to complete if you play it without a walkthrough, but those would be frustrating hours for most of us.  (Note that I am talking about completing the  whole  game. You can also breeze through it in 45 minutes without seeing much of the secret content and alternate endings of chapters. When reviews say this game is 'short and easy,' that's what they mean. The  whole  game is very hard.)  The problem is that the difficulty of finding the collectible objects (photographs) is due entirely to the incredibly obtuse navigation controls: the player is not otherwise presented with challenges requiring creative thought. The perspective is first person, but your normal sense of direction will confuse rather than guide you, because the photographic angles tell you almost nothing about which direction you will be heading or what exits are available. The map you should be building in your head would be a tree-like structure of locations that has almost nothing to do with the physical layout. You'll miss objects not because you are a bad detective, but because you have no idea how to get to where you want to go.  Even with a walkthrough I cannot recommend this game. The revealed secrets do not cohere into a meaningful narrative or image: it's just a few fragments from the life, memories, and observations of a young, middle-class, female European university student. Despite the poetic pomp, there's nothing deep about her mutterings. There is potential for a deeper meaning, but it is left undeveloped.  I'm happy that developers experiment with video games and try to move beyond our expectations of how they should look and feel. In this case, it didn't work out, and it would be nice if the developers acknowledge this and set a more appropriate price tag.",

            "review_text": "It's an interesting idea, at least.  The game looks interesting and the gimic of moving around from photo to photo while using magic symbols to interact with the game's world has some potential. The art and photography is appealing, especially when it suddenly does something weird, like suddenly sucking up a random billboard or shattering a ghost. It's imagery is a strong aspect.  It's just that it has no overal point.   At best, the game is cryptic. At worst, the game has nothing to say. As a jaunt into someone's dreams and psyche, you'd think you'd come away learning a great deal about that person, right? I couldn't find any value to that assumption. Most of the details given about this woman's identity as a character don't ever appear to connect. She went to Uni, she went to a coffee shop once, she had a teddy bear.   Why should I care?  It doesn't necessarily connect or amount to any revelation about the character. There's no real coherrence about this towards any real goal. It's just weirdness from beginning to end. I'm sure it's the point; to allow for your own interpretation of what to make of all this but I struggle to find that satisfying. It doesn't seem to justify it's own existance by offering any conclusion to take from the journey made.   Perhaps this is meant to be from the point of view of the Doctor tending to this woman? It would explain the tiny amount of information we gleam from her dreams and bits of information from them, only to have the game end abruptly.   What drags this still lower in my opinion is how boring the gameplay is.  One of the larger flaws is how entertaining the game is. The 'puzzles' are no more advanced than find a thing and perform a special symbol on it to get something to happen. Nothing amounts to anything more than just an alternative ending. That also seems to be weirdness for weirdness' sake. If you learn what does what and what will only work with what, your only challenge is to spot what looks interactive and what isn't. This is not all that hard either. If you can be bothered, you'll breeze through this within an hour and a half.   If you like weird things, you won't feel too bad if you get it during a sale. Otherwise, it's not that remarkable. For a flash game this bland, it feels overpriced. Go play one of the weirder looking things on Armour Games. It's free and likely more entertaining than this.",

Its about a woman and her family (or friends?) who go on a night drive but end up in a car accident. The woman and her friends get hospitalized and as the woman, you wander through her trippy memories trying to solve the puzzles and as you complete the puzzles, you gradually get cutscenes of her recovery in the hospital. But once you reach the end of the game however, you see her discharged from the hospital and return home and close the door. But what bothers me is...What about the other people? What happened to them? Did they die and leave an impact on her? There was not a single mention of what happened to them.   Pros:  Interesting concept and deep artwork if you think of it that way  Good puzzles that will make you think for quite a while as you attempt to solve them  Cool intro and nice trippy theme song  Cons:   Story makes no sense  This game has no replay value so once you play it, you'll likely never go back to it.

            "review_text": "When I bought this game I was on an adventure game kick and an indie game kick and steam was scrathing that particular itch at the time. The game appeared to be an interesting little indie adventiure game based on running through mazes, collecting clues, solving puzzles, etc. all while telling a rich story, through gameplay and abstract symbolism. It was supposed to ba a tale of a woman who, while in a quasi-concious state, unravels the story of her demise and/or recounts the regrets in her life, ultimately finding a way to acheive some sense of inner peace or resolve some internal conflict; perhaps while having an out of body experience as she dies or edges closer to death. All this seemed interesting to me as an adeventure game player and I was excited to unravel the mysteries of this womans life and what exactly had happened to her. WHAT I GOT, was what appeared to be a slideshow of random industrial and urban set pieces that resembled something you might be shown by a friend who just went on a walk with thier first DSLR camera. The story was so abstracted and boring, and there were no puzzle elements or really any clues to find at all. You can beat the game or more accurately 'complete the interactive experience' in about 20-45 min by simply moving from frame to frame and clicking on everything. The word game doesnt really apply as there is no challenge or any sense of completeing anything at the end, its more of an activity center for manic depressives. Threre seems to be no resolution of conflict (nor any conflict in general) in the story, and even if there were its conveyed so poorly and in such a boring manner that I couldn't have cared less anyways. Moreover I feel especially cheated for buying this for about 6-7 $ US expecting to be puzzled and challenged for at least the better part of 7-8 hours, only to then 'finish the experience' in under 30 min, with no recourse for return or exchange. Do yourself a favor and do not waste any money on this 'interactive experience', which was clearly designed by people who thought it was so edgy, unique, indie and deep (when it is none of these things) that it could rest on those laurels without anything resembling what would be objectively considered a game. Some might say that Dear Esther could be given the same criticism, however DE is a much richer experience, immerseive in its beautifully exectued graphics and sound desgin which (with a little help from headphones and a dark room) can transport the player into the setting giving them a large sense of immersion. DE is also short hoever, I feel I could explore the island of DE for hours (and have) and there is more value in it to me based on the immersive experience it creates. While DE is not technically a game it IS a well crafted 'interactive experience' the mystery surrounding the letters and clues you find on the island are abstract and cryptic enough not to spell everything out for you, but are engaging and keep you wanting to search the island in an effort to discover what happend and why its important. Trauma on the other hand fails as an 'interactive experience' as much as it does as a game. The choice to move from boring still to still and mediocre sound design make the experience wholly non-imersive. The story is also so abstracted, disjointed and boring that by the end you dont care what is going on or why, thus you have no insentive to continue 'coimpleting the experience'. Trauma fails miserably as a game and even more so as an 'interactive experience', if you are intrigued by Trauma, dont bother and buy Dear Esther instead becuase clearly more love and care went into making it and it is a much richer experience on the whole.",
