Even if you discover the best techinque for victory, the game will change slightly and force you to adapt your strategy little by little. The challenges that the enemies pose are also very fun to oust. The story and characters are hilarious, and they make the campaing a lot of fun to follow. Vikings chasing pirates around the world because they disrupted a barbaque, for example. I would seriously recommend trying Swords and Soldiers.",

You play three highly unique classes, the Vikings, the Aztecs, and the Chinese The motivation behind them is ridicolous from winning a chili contest, to acquiring said vegetable for BBQ sauce.  Swords and Soldiers is not something I would call the next stage in indie development. However just a well-honed game, and enough tweaks and tiny additions, gives the euphora you are playing something new, and yet so familiar at the same time.  9.3/10",

The goal is simple: destroy your opponent's base while keeping your own spotless. Each race has its own distinct play style (and racial steriotypes), although it seems like the Vikings are sadly the weakest of the three. The campaigns alone will last you a number of hours, and on top of that there's challenges and multiplayer. For $10 (price at review) I'd say it's a little on the expensive side, but even if it went down in price by one or two dollars I'd say it would be worth it.",

There is a story mode that teaches you how to play and how to use the different units of the game. It's shown in a cartoony manner, with over-the-top characters fighting over stuff like a giant pepper.   The different races can play very differently so that adds some complexity to the game. But at its core the gameplay is simple and straightforward. Combat units automatically march towards the enemy base and will engage the first enemy they meet. You can gain magic skills that allow you to interact more directly in the combat.   So managing which units to build, which things to research, and which spells to use is how the game plays out.  A fun game with quick little missions that can entertain strategy game fans.",
