            "review_text": " Empress of the Deep  is a quick dip into a still, ancient, underwater world. It's a little like  Amerzone  with more water and hidden objects, which makes it a happy light entertainment for, say, downtime at work, which is where I played it in 15- and 20-minute slices. My 3.7 hours in the game involved reminding myself where I was and what I was doing since I wasn't playing straight through, and I reckon an average player would complete it in three hours or less.  The game is a pretty slide-show exploration adventure set in a deserted underwater habitat called the Ark, where you are awakened at the beginning with little memory to explain why you're there and, of course, with a destiny to discover. This is pretty much par for the course, but happily the voice acting is fairly subdued and the plot is delivered calmly, so the routine nature of the story doesn't compete against the pretty scenery.  You're met early on by Jacob, a disembodied voice that will come to you from time to time over your little handheld device thingy (map, clues, notes, and collections) with encouragement and vague instructions. He tells you to find the three parts of a family artifact, and you're off through a trio of silent, giant pavilions. A furtive little-girl voice will join in later, and she and Jacob push and pull for your trust until the end.  The art is beautiful, and not especially detailed. It's pleasant to push through and ultimately feels like an inert high-fantasy world of science, though without the splashy excesses of, say, Rapture. There isn't much to explore - the eye captures each screen quickly unless there are puzzles present - but I thought from the bones of the design that the game idly aspired to  Myst  as an influence, rather than entirely embracing its hidden-object heritage.  Still, it is absolutely a casual game, with none of the crazy-making that kind of ruined  Myst  for me back in the day. You'll push a button in one scene, activate an orb in another, collect a few stray inventory items here and there, and move similarly through the peaceful scenery at a good clip. The game introduces an 'Area Finished' star icon that displays in the upper left of each screen when all actions there have been completed, and it's a great convenience. Less usefully, it awards you flowers when you finish puzzle segments, and you're meant to collect them all, but since they arrive automatically as you progress through the story and don't do anything but sit on their collection page, it's easy to forget that they are there.  A flurry of action at the end contains a satisfactory reveal, as well as putting the player into position for part two.",

I personally love those kind of games and that's why I would recommend this to anyone who loves those type of games, too!   A lot of fun, but I won't play it more than once, haha. I usually remember story lines and I feel like this is a one-time-game.   Great game!",

Everything is unsharp and it was sometimes quite impossible to find the things. you cannot go directly to a place by clicking on the map, which means endless clicking to get where you want to. this was extremly annoying. which really let make me push the exit button was - SPOILER ALERT! - when i did not activate the purple balls, because i didnt trust the voice. but the game play force you to at one point, which meant for me to go to the whole ♥♥♥♥ing land again to search for them. after collecting them all - bigsuprise (not) - it was the power source for the evil and the next step should have been to run around and deactivate ALL of them again...seriously? at point I was too tired of this ♥♥♥♥. Waste of money unfortunately,",

            "review_text": "Meh. There are some positive things I can say about this game. I really liked the Myst-like environment and atmosphere. Also, the hidden-object scenes have some original ideas - like the one where you look through a telescope. Or the one with objects named in strange language which you had to translate first. Sadly, the downsides outweigh everything. The graphics quality is just horrible. I mean, grainy 800x600 with no widescreen support? Are we back in 1998? It gets even worse in the hidden-object scenes because some object are transparent for no reason, to the point they're virtually invisible. The story is really stupid but I'm getting used to it in these games. Bad voice acting doesn't help it. With the exception of Jacob the characters show no emotions, they just don't care. So why should I? And last but not least, the map. It doesn't show unsolved locations. And it has no fast travel so enjoy clicking a lot while constantly running back and forth.",

There isn't really much to say about the game, which speaks volumes about the game itself.   Pros:  Nice art Interesting story line  Cons:  Voice acting that sometimes disables you from becoming fully immersed in the story  Something I wish to go indepth with with a con, is the fact that a lot of the items you were asked to find weren't what I thought they would be. I would be looking for one item when in fact it was another item that I needed, but because of what could only be considered a lanuage barrier between different english speaking countries, it did make it difficult at times.   Would I recommend this game? All in all I did have fun with the game, and did find a lot of the puzzles fun to solve.",
