            "review_text": "Okay bro, so let's say y'all wanna get fresh with an anime. Like, I ain't judging here, it's cool. If a dude wants to shag a cartoon then God bless his weird ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ed-up worldview. But then you gotta ask yourself 'damn bro, how am I gonna make this foxy cartoon broad wanna handle my balls'? That is not an easy question, man, but this game provides you an answer. You gotta click the right buttons and say the answers to things. Then the anime gals will ♥♥♥♥in' dig your weird comma-sized ♥♥♥♥. They gonna be straight up riding it like the guy in that movie where the guy rides a bomb or whatever. Point is, this is without a doubt one of the most intriguing cartoon romance simulacrums out there. It's got all kinds of animes. The angry one, the boring one, the furry one, the other one. There is no limit to the depravity you can inflict upon yourself as you struggle to romance a cartoon. I guess you can also thrash some ♥♥♥♥ with a sword or whatever, maybe make an elf cast a spell. Elves ♥♥♥♥in' love spells. Can't get enough of them. And when you bang your favorite manga, you get to have a freakish nightmare-baby, like in Eraserhead, except instead of flippin' out and wrecking the lights, the baby just gets some stats and ♥♥♥♥, and then he has to marry an anime. Nobody ever said pimpin' was easy.  SCORE: Graphics: 10/10. You will not BELIEVE the amount of anime underwear you're gonna be seeing here. You like pantyshots? We got'em, it's like a pantyshot discount warehouse. Sick. Sound: 4/10. I dunno why, but everyone speaks in this really ♥♥♥♥ed up accent. It barely even matches what the dialogue text at the bottom says. Are the voice actors ♥♥♥♥ing British or something? Not cool, 'mate'. Gameplay: 7/10. Your swords can level up, you can level up, your Anime Bangin' Factor can level up. Lots of levelling up, lots of swords, lots of hentais. Pretty nasty. The Jappies are still pervos.  FINAL SCORE: 8/10 YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS GAME IF... You jerk off to anime pornos.",

            "review_text": "Very long running strategy RPG with an large roster of characters and a huge selection of monsters than can be captured and also used as party members. Lots of combined attack combinations and specials and a high level post-game can keep one playing for quite a while.  DLC is most definitely not required to play as it is mainly for making the early game significantly easier. (And in fact the vast majority of the DLC items lose their massive advantages by the end of the 4th act and are out-performed by upgraded 5th act or post-game equipment.)  It does have a few downsides I'll admit. It is very slow to start and early on characters are incredibly fragile leading to considerable frustration if you don't know what you are doing and attempting a first run hardmode playthrough to get access to all the endgame content as fast as possible. Additionally you will need some quest area grinding to unlock certain titles that give you recipes and special unlocks.  More a game for those with some patience rather than instant gratification.",

The story, omg, the story. It was amazing following the different characters over 5 generations. I enjoyed every character that I met and was eager to learn about them. 2. The battle system. Yesssh, the developers did a phenomenal job with this one. 3.The anime rpg style, sexy guys and gals, and amazing side characters. 4. Requires many hours to complete. So monetary value on point. May be a con for some people though.7 5. Good acting by Japanese voice actors.  Now on to the dislikes.... 1. Unfaiiiir bosses. No sah. These people did just waan mi mash up mi laptop. Ahhh...let's rephrase that. The level of difficulty of bosses through the game were quite unjust in some instances. Had you squinting at times at the absolute evil. 2. Rare monsters-_-, yeah just think about that. 3. The fact that this game might require multiple playthroughs in order to get the TRUE ending. Bearing in mind after you have suffered through one playthrough thinking that you have done the right thing only to find out how very wrong you were. 4. Graphics, aumm, well, he he he. Tuffs of grass that I could have designed better.   Overall. great game. I have started my second walkthrough but I am a university student in medical sciences sooo you know, not much time but I intend to get the true ending.",

Instead, though, it's just a wad of the most tired and repellent tropes of fantasy anime wrapped around an iinteresting-but-repetitive tactical JRPG. Even the software side is pretty much just there, with clunky menus and problems with basic interface elements and responsiveness. I wanted very much for this game to be the game I imagined it could be, but instead the nicest thing I can say about it is that it's... functional.",

I think one of the main flaws of the Steam version is that you get a lot of really cool items to start out with that a lot of the characters can use. HOWEVER, if you are anything like myself you take these items for granted and only start to look at crafting new items at the point of the game where you realized you had to have been starting the grind from hour 1. The battles are spaced out with more battles and it seems like only a few characters are actually usable (however there are probably many that disagree with me). I found myself putting the game on auto mode and sitting down on my bed waiting for it to finish. Three generations in, Im having a hard time finding reason to continue. I want to continue with the story, I just have an insurmountable amount of tedious fights ahead of me. Its not that I dont like this game, its that I would caution against playing this game. If you love the grind and you have a guide open in a tab on your computer and enjoy JRPG's, then play this game and I do sincerely hope you like it.",

The battle is extremely fun and addicting, the combat system is using a unique combo system that i really like, so despite the flat terrain that many people complain, it got the same amount of strategic thinking as Final Fantasy tactics and Ogre tactics (I bet many people is comparing that to this game). So if you like Tactics, JRPG, and a simple version of visual novel, I recommend this game !  PS: You really didn't need the DLC, it just equipment to make you extremely powerful and it kinda ruined the beginning of the game because you basically just one-hit kill everyone, so i recommend to turn off all the dlc including the one that's included in the base game.",

The layout of the area is similar but the way combat is conducted just made me miss the previous games/company I mentioned before. It tries to be unique from the three and it is, but just not in a way I found fun.  I liked the idea of crafting your weapons, which is popular in many games but having to pump point into gear, only to break it down for a base part that you can't rebuy after you have done once already isn't appealing either.   If you like dating sims and finding waifus then I suppose you wouldn't mind what I previously mentioned.",

J-RPGs are known for being tedious grind sessions, great story elements, and of course, great 'plot'. This series has it all to be quite frank, and I love every bit of it! The visual novel aspect of this game makes it different from most other J-RPGs, and even get the chance to romance with 3 woman for the first 4 generations is pretty limiting, but it's enough!  This game is not for the faint of heart, it has moments where you will feel for a character, and you will want to keep playing. My only bad nag about this game is that there is sometimes a long point-to-point battle system. However, the ability to return to these already battle-fought points for grind makes it easy for grinding and material hunting.   This game is long, overly long for a J-RPGs to take place, however, the endings makes it worth while. I have only ever gotten the neutral ending, and I plan to play this to get te true ending!",

            "review_text": "Agarest: Generations of War is one of those JRPG's that makes you go all woobly doo. It has awesome soundtracks from the main menu to the fiercest moments of an epic battle against the boss of each generation. The overview is beautiful from to the main land, exploration and in battle. The hero creation system onward from 1st generation uses a 'Soul Breed System' so to say, the main basis is to get one of the three heroines you have with you to fall in love towards your character. The more the girl likes you, the better stats for the next generations hero and that sure brings something great to this game.  DLC's for the game are really cheap and useful, some say that the DLC's break the game and make it too easy, ofcourse for the first generation you might overkill all enemies you meet but near the end of the game those weapons do an average damage to enemies and bosses. You can also unlock character profiles, voice dialogues and CG's by buying DLC's which is good for those who don't want to play this game over 500 hours.  Battle system is something everyone will probably like in this game, considering that it requires you to position your characters well and also know what sort of attacks and combos you will do on each turn to enemies, a slight mistake can cost you one of your party members and if you are on a exploration point then you're going to have fun time recovering your member.  As for last comments I know some people have mixed opinions about this game whenever if it's best off all JRPG's or not but in my humble opinion this game deserves a place in every RPG players shelf.",

            "review_text": "Originally posted on  ZOMGPlay.com   The game follows the story of Leonhardt, an officer for the Gridamas army who chooses to follow his own fate after witnessing a fellow officer attempting to kill a young child. This ends in his failure as the mysterious, overwhelming Dark Knight almost kills him with ease. While dying, he feels the regret of not being able to save the child and is encountered by a mysterious woman, Dyshana. She offers Leo a covenant to give him the power he desires as long as he devotes his and his descendant’s souls to her. Agreeing to the covenant shapes destiny of Leonhardt and all his descendants as they help save the world from the forces of evil.  This is where one of the game’s most exciting and distinctive features comes into play, the soul breeding system. The game itself is split into five different generations, with you having a new main character in each generation. This character is the offspring of your previous main character and one of three female party members. Dependent on different routes you take through the game and options you pick, affection will increase of decrease with 3 female party members. The appearance, stats and weapon of your next main character is all dependent on not only the mother you choose, but also the level of affection you have with her. Fear not about venturing into the unknown as there is a service in town that allows you to see what your child will look like as well and their stats and weapons. When the game’s story shifts between the generations, it is well exicuted with some characters having their appearance change, new characters appearing, new clothing styles and different world issues.  One thing that that you can’t avoid is the game’s fanservice. When one of the game’s main focuses is to have children with your female party members and some of them can have only two belts and a 1 inch zip covering their decency, it’s something you can’t avoid but mention. While a few of the characters in the game might have slightly questionable outfits, the fanservice content is segregated from the main plot. Any fanservice is contained with separate events listed on the map. These are reached dependent on which path you choose but also the amount of time it takes to get there. Sometimes these events include a cg scene to go with them, which I can say is worth the effort. The content is never explicit and only ever suggestive even at the end of generations when you make your next descendant with your wife. While the all cg scenes may be one sided, the fanservice certainly isn’t, with male characters looking just as good as their female counterparts. All in all, promotional videos may look like there is content coming out of every crevice, but it takes itself very seriously while still managing to keep it’s fun.  While you may come for the fanservice, you will stay for the gameplay. The combat system is tactical and can be customized. Characters have certain squares where they will link up with fellow party members, allowing them to attack the same time. Characters can link skills together to perform special skills, dealing more damage than they normally would. Linking is vital to success making use of the break and overkill mechanics. Monsters have a break bar that acts like a shield, receiving less damage while it is still up. Once the bar is depleted, attacks deal extra damage. Once an enemie’s hp bar is depleted, it starts to fill up again in another colour until it is overkilled. For overkilling an enemy you receive bonus items, many of which can only be obtained via the overkill and are necessary for upgrades. With each fight on the map taking up a day, if you wish to see the timed events on the map, get bonus affection and possible CGs, you can’t afford to grind and need to use this system to it’s fullest.  While the system itself is fulfilling with lots to do, when doing normal 8 battles in a row to progress the plot, it can get a bit tedious. The game features an auto option that will complete fights for you. The AI won’t necessarily do a better job than you but if the combat system starts to become a bit to much, the option is always there. I find the combat system much more enjoyable in event and boss fights where you gain the most from overkilling and speed rather than random encounters.  Unlike most RPGs and strategy games, you don’t buy you weapons and equipment but make them at the blacksmith via the alchemy system. You can buy and find numerous crafting books on your adventure that give you recipes to make new items. Once an item has been made, it is then added to the item shop to be bought again in future. Most weapons and armor require you to have items from overkilled enemies which will drive you insane if you haven’t been doing it. It also costs a lot of gold and you will quickly find yourself running out. You will find yourself skimping, selling materials or using the game’s monster capture system in order to get more more.  The monster capture system allows you to capture an enemy monster in combat if the ability is used on them while at low health. Players then have the ability to either sell the monster at market for much needed gold or make them a party member to fight by your side. With some characters carrying on between generations, I found using a monster in the party not necessary. Capturing them for money however is incredibly useful but also incredibly hard. It is difficult to gauge just how low the monster’s hp should be for capture and the ability won’t work if you accidentally kill them.  On the PC you can play using the keyboard and mouse or gamepad. Although I opted for the gamepad as it is my preferred way of gaming, the keyboard is strongly supported. In the options menu there is a section to remap you keys to your personal preferences. In all the menus in the game, the buttons for both gamepad and keyboard are also listed at the bottom of the screen. One feature I like on the PC version is the ability to toggle DLC on and off. DLC is available from the steam shop including free DLC which is included with the game. When you start a new game, you can choose which DLC you wish to have which is really useful for people wanting to replayand make sure they have a real challenge. I found the fear of not wondering if your DLC had disappeared after usage was really refreshing compared to the console release of the game. The version of the game that was used for the PC port was the American Xbox 360 version which has never been made available outside the country. This means that the version contains improved North American translation, rebalanced turn counter, new background images and the more powerful versions of the DLC items compared to their PS3 counterparts. Having played Agarest on the Ps3, one of the main differences to me was actually the distance from the screen. I found playing Agarest on the PC rather than the TV a much more enjoyable experience. For those who love achievements, there is a variety of achievements available in the game including steam badges for the truly dedicated.  Strategy RPG fans will find themselves spoiled with Agarest. With the game lasting for at least 60 hours, free downloadable extra dungeons in each generation, customizable skill system, monster capturing, soul breeding and item enhancement; there is plenty for you to do and it is all actually very interesting. For not so hardcore fans, you do have the option to just buy the most powerful DLC equipment and leave the game on auto; just enjoying the game’s stories and interactions. With Agarest’s price being a real steal, it is the most definitive version of the game which I actually enjoyed playing more than it’s PS3 counterpart.  8/10",

While the system itself is fulfilling with lots to do, when doing normal 8 battles in a row to progress the plot, it can get a bit tedious. The game features an auto option that will complete fights for you. The AI won’t necessarily do a better job than you but if the combat system starts to become a bit to much, the option is always there. I find the combat system much more enjoyable in event and boss fights where you gain the most from overkilling and speed rather than random encounters.  Unlike most RPGs and strategy games, you don’t buy you weapons and equipment but make them at the blacksmith via the alchemy system. You can buy and find numerous crafting books on your adventure that give you recipes to make new items. Once an item has been made, it is then added to the item shop to be bought again in future. Most weapons and armor require you to have items from overkilled enemies which will drive you insane if you haven’t been doing it. It also costs a lot of gold and you will quickly find yourself running out. You will find yourself skimping, selling materials or using the game’s monster capture system in order to get more more.  The monster capture system allows you to capture an enemy monster in combat if the ability is used on them while at low health. Players then have the ability to either sell the monster at market for much needed gold or make them a party member to fight by your side. With some characters carrying on between generations, I found using a monster in the party not necessary. Capturing them for money however is incredibly useful but also incredibly hard. It is difficult to gauge just how low the monster’s hp should be for capture and the ability won’t work if you accidentally kill them.  On the PC you can play using the keyboard and mouse or gamepad. Although I opted for the gamepad as it is my preferred way of gaming, the keyboard is strongly supported. In the options menu there is a section to remap you keys to your personal preferences. In all the menus in the game, the buttons for both gamepad and keyboard are also listed at the bottom of the screen. One feature I like on the PC version is the ability to toggle DLC on and off. DLC is available from the steam shop including free DLC which is included with the game. When you start a new game, you can choose which DLC you wish to have which is really useful for people wanting to replayand make sure they have a real challenge. I found the fear of not wondering if your DLC had disappeared after usage was really refreshing compared to the console release of the game. The version of the game that was used for the PC port was the American Xbox 360 version which has never been made available outside the country. This means that the version contains improved North American translation, rebalanced turn counter, new background images and the more powerful versions of the DLC items compared to their PS3 counterparts. Having played Agarest on the Ps3, one of the main differences to me was actually the distance from the screen. I found playing Agarest on the PC rather than the TV a much more enjoyable experience. For those who love achievements, there is a variety of achievements available in the game including steam badges for the truly dedicated.  Strategy RPG fans will find themselves spoiled with Agarest. With the game lasting for at least 60 hours, free downloadable extra dungeons in each generation, customizable skill system, monster capturing, soul breeding and item enhancement; there is plenty for you to do and it is all actually very interesting. For not so hardcore fans, you do have the option to just buy the most powerful DLC equipment and leave the game on auto; just enjoying the game’s stories and interactions. With Agarest’s price being a real steal, it is the most definitive version of the game which I actually enjoyed playing more than it’s PS3 counterpart.  8/10",

The way I felt when playing through this went from 'It's pretty fun' to 'I can't wait to play this tomorrow', then to 'I want to beat this' at the end. The middle section (mid gen 2 to mid gen 4) was the most fun for me because there were so many new combos that could actually be done. Whereas in the first generation, you were more or less limited to less than 15. As you can see, the combat system is played on a board where you move and then prepare your attacks. The fights fluxuate between average difficulty that you can still lose if you're careless on most fights and boss fights that take several tries if you're underleveled. Unless you grind to be 10+ levels higher than the enemies, there will always be some sort of challenge in battles.  With hundreds of weapons, a giant pool of titles to achieve, some really cool looking combination attacks and several endings, replayability is written all over Agarest. The OST doesn't yell 'I NEED THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!', but it's still nice to listen to. Even if you never finish this game, you're more than likely to get more out of Agarest than what you paid.",

I tried again on PC solely because it was on sale with booster packs, so I thought maybe I could get through the game without the grindfest. But now I remember why I dropped the game in the first place. It wasn't that it was a grindfest. It was because the story was not engaging, nor was the gameplay. No doubt, the battle mechanics are interesting with how duel attacks and special attacks are forged between various characters on the board. But at the end of the day, I really think the fact that ALL battle boards are FLAT with NO terrain variation kills the game. Final Fantasy Tactics in 1998 had terrain variation. This game from the 21st century does not. Perhaps if it was on NES I could excuse it. But this transgression is not excusable for modern games.",

The characters are unique, it's heavy on fan service, and the story tries to draw you in. This game definitely lends itself more to a keyboard and mouse than a controller, so the PC probably actually makes it better.  The problems with this game are many however. Mainly it lacks focus, there is too much going on, too much to balance, to many things to think about, too many choices with very non obvious results. Reading a wiki about this game made it both *much* easier, and *much more fun* which is a low mark for me. Great RPG's (FFVI, Dragon Age, Kotor, Breath of Fire) were extremely fun to play a few times without a guide, and then more fun to play again later with a guide. This game also has a habit of becoming tedious, repetitive battles with no point, and the grinding, oh the grinding.  But the worst part, the part that absolutely ruins the game for me is the translation. It is awful. It's terrible. It is so disjointed and unnatural and painful It stops me from playing. I cannot stress enough how much this hurts, especially in a visual novel style game.  If you buy a few of the OP weapon packs (which I got for pre-ordering) you can skip the endless grinding and put the game on auto, and if you ignore most of the dialogues, and if you read a good walkthrough this game isn't too bad. Still, I can't recommend it.",

So far, it is not raunchy, which is something I appreciate, and the story is interesting and doesn't treat you like a complete idiot. This surprised me as at one point I had to make a couple of logic jumps, ones that would make sense in the real world but is often fit in awkwardly in RPGs.  The concept, by the way, is simple. You, the hero, are stuck in a war between good and evil. As a member of the 'dark' forces, you question your role and break away. Immediately you recruit people and, in particular, a goddess (I think) and three girls who are said to be drawn to you. You, the hero, must make choices between light and dark, which girl you want to end up with, and several other things. THE GIRL YOU PICK MATTERS as whoever you choose changes your descendent, which you play as! There is, in essence, several stories in one (5 to be total). I will confess, I have not played enough of this game to know the quality of the rest of the story, but it is a good solid game. I've been playing for hours and have ventured very slowly across the board. Also, I find it fun that you can miss two of the girls you could end up with.  Combat-wise, I'm impressed. I have played several tactics games and notice many will implement their own little feature. Disgaea had stacking, for example. This game has AP and linking fights. AP is used for everything. Use a skill? It costs AP. Use an item? AP please! Move? Well there's an AP. You get AP at intervals (usually when the character's turn comes up, but I'll get to the part where it doesn't). So long as you have the AP you can keep fighting. Some skills are no longer useable due to range or other reasons I have yet to determine, but most of the time you can use five skills if you absolutely wish. Sometimes it's worth waiting though, even if it means getting a hit, so that your partner can swoop in. This is 'linking' (they use another word for it but I forget that). Each character has particular squares that link to each other which means that if it is their turn or someone else's turn who they are linked to, they can join the fight. It helps since my strongest mage as abyssmal move speed but my secondary mage has a decent travel time. I often have the second mage move up (or the hero) and use them to make combo moves (they have those too!) and defeat the enemies. It means you have to be constantly aware of your character's positioning because moves often move you and break the link, but it opens up so much more in the ways of strategy.  Characters are customizable too! Each level you get points to distribute and each weapon opens up slots to put skills in. There are some obvious limitations, though, but that adds a spice and makes a hell of a lot of sense. For example, my first mage can increase her int for very cheap, her luk and agi for a decent amount, but avoid Vit and Str at all cost!  Anyway, this game is quickly becoming a favorite. I'm not as far as I wish to make a solid review but it easily gets an 8.5/10 from me",

I am a huge visual novel AND RPG fan. When I first heard of this game, I was like 'No way, two of my favourite things in one?! Too good to be true!'.....oh how right I was....  The game promises an epic story mixed with RPG gameplay. The problem here is with the RPG part. You have a tipical Japanese visual novel story, which is good for what it is also loved the family generation system. (that was one of the reason why I bought the game), but they just had to F*** it up.  Through the story progression you constantly have to battle over and over and over and while it was midly entertaining at first, quickly becomse boring, which wouldn't be a problem if the whole combat system would have been done well. Unfortunatelly this is not the case here.... Combat is repetitive waaaaaaay too repetitive, it gets really boring to see the same enemies and use the same strategie for the 15th time. Also, the combat system itself is unpolished, I would dare to say, not finished. When you try to attack an enemy with a skill, the game automatically puts the character in on of the sides of the enemy to attack, but if you have an AOE skill and say you would like to attack from another side, you CAN'T do it. This becomes really annoying when you try to come up with your own strategies, instead of trying to addept to the game, and because of this other parts of the game suffers as well. One of the driving feature are the fame you can get from the taverns various challenges. The main problem here, is that ALL OF THEM requires grinding, and I mean MASSIVE GRINDING, which is already a pain to see through with an unfinished battle system.  I completed the 1st story only, because I just couldnt bear with the constant battling any longer, they are just too boring and no fun at all. They dont even added the option of skipping all the battle parts and just at least see through the visual novel part, which I finded good, especially with the generation system.  Overall, the reason why I dont recommend the game is because the bad covers up all the good in it. Boring and reptitive battles can make even the most hardened visual novel fans scare away.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game with a few warnings to keep in mind. If you have played Final Fantasy Tactics, or many of the other turn based, strategy oriented JRPGs on the market, keep in mind that the system in this game is very very watered down. Battlefields are flat, always, and there are only a slim few variations on what maps do, such as forcing party formations, party sizes, and adding a few buff and debuff squares on the grid. This simplistic map is aggrivated by the fact that the dlc that comes with purchase breaks the first quarter of the game. You can one hit pretty much aything, and if you build your stats in a smart way, you can continue to do so through to the second generation.  That said, I found the quality of the writing in the game to be engrossing, it borrows ideas from alot of other franchises, but it presents them well, in a storyline that makes sense. The crafting system, for some reason I cannot explain, is redonkulously addictive, it might just be that the blacksmith sometimes makes mistakes, and his goofy mug pops up on the screen when he does so. Most other games, I tend to ignore crafting, but with this game I am compelled to make EVERYTHING. Maybe it is because the game almost completely lacks open world exploration, with some of the few exploration maps being recycled in the 'DLC'.  I just recently bought this game because it went on sale for a very nice discount, and honestly, the ecchi trailers for it kind of put me off, making me think it was just another gimmick game. The dating sim aspect is actually a fairly pleasant distraction from the grind, however, especially when there is in an incentive for doing well with the female of your choice. (And I dont't mean the ecchi cutscenes) The game is told by generations, and your next generation hero has stats partially dependant on how much love exists between the female the main character from the previous generation. Some people have compained that affection levels go up and down for reasons that make no sense. Such as, you choose to turn left, rather than go right, and one of the girls doesn't like you so much. Some people say this makes no sense, to me, it does, because I have been in the car, on a walk, or on a trip, and taken a right turn instead of left, and gotten the 'I wouldn't have gone that way.' from the person I was with. Real human emotions sometimes don't make sense.   THIS GAME IS FOR GRINDERS.  There is no getting around that fact, unlike other games where you can wonder freely, and encounters happen at random, every point on the world map is a battle point, so even if you are not directly trying to grind, the game forces you to anyway. One day, after a long day at work, I set out on the current stretch of the campaign, and fell asleep at the computer during the middle of a battle, because there were ten map spots to move through before getting to the next EVENT, because the battles, though well animated, are sloooow.  Many other people have mentioned turning up the framerate in the game to 60fps to make it go by quicker, I cannot recommend doing this enough. It vastly speeds the game up, and instead of taking an hour to get to an event, you can quarter that time. I have noticed that some maps seem to force the framerate back to 30fps, especially on exploration maps.   All in all, I recommend it, but don't expect the battles to be like the ones from Tactics, it's like comparing apples and oranges. ",

            "review_text": "Finding a way too introduce this, mainly fueled by annoyance, 'review' is pretty difficult, but I managed to get it done anyways, if you think this text is written so horribly that you can't be bothered to read it, then the game is most definitly not something you should buy, or in other words this is a pretty bad game and that is actually an understatement, from my point of view at least...  I am just going to explain what the reasons for me not enjoying the game are, which is three main factors, the gameplay, the pacing (which will not be explictly pointed out in the text, but if you can be bothered to read this you will pretty much understand) and the story, also known as everything.  Though to be fair I actually can't judge the story all that much due to never playing through this game, thus it'd be more accurate to say writing and character development instead.  So let's start of with the gameplay, seeing how that is the one thing that defines a game. You have three elements of gameplay, which are battles, character interaction/dialouge parts, and city interfaces with creating and improving equipment and other, hardly worth mentioning, things.   The battles are based on a pretty stupid design decision you get a movement phase and an action phase, both running at the same time for your group and the enemy group leading to fun moments such as 'Oh the enemy ran that way and I can't hit him, such fun and totally something I could have done something about!' or in simpler terms they are tedious as ♥♥♥♥. That is if you do not have any of the dlc equipment, though that only makes them less tedious, but I still don't consider them fun or compelling, seeing how all I can do is hope my movement phase got me in the right spot in order to throw all of my AP into abilities in order to kill stuff. Let me elaborate on that, the battles work like this the two phase I mentioned beforehand both use AP in order for you to do stuff, e.g. each field you move during the movement phase costs 1AP, attacking during the Action Phase can only be done with Skills that use AP, with the cheapest one costing 8AP upto a grand 18AP, though that is a special move, in order to put that into relation, with DLC equipment you have 40AP without ~20AP, at least till the point to which I played... Overall it felt like a ♥♥♥♥ version of decent strategy rpg battle system, mainly Fire Emblem, it was a pain and little else.  While that was all the gameplay for the battles there still is the gameplay for the dialouge, which was the main reason I got the game, hoping it would be fun, it isn't, and I was a fool to think otherwise. Instead of elaborating on this I will keep this short and simple, there usually is no way for you to know how any choice affects your alignment or the affection levels of the heroines, e.g. 'Which way will we take?' with answers such as 'Shortest way!', 'Detour!' and 'Charging straight through the enemy camp!' I figure you could only predict that the third option seems pretty dark which would be a correct guess but other than that it just felt like lucid guessing to me...  But even without those choices the dialouge and the characters are pretty annoying, I figure the easiest way would be to put down an example, avoiding spoilers of course. So let us say you and your group of 8 other people walk into a capital of a foreign nation just chilling and ♥♥♥♥, some guy approaches you and initiates a conversation by going 'Excuse me?' a pretty normal way to do it, right? Nothing unusual here, right? You would jsut assume he wanted to ask something of you, right? Well not so our merry little group containing at least two almost extinct species (No one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that either, they just went 'Oh a member of an almost extinct race? I don't care!') Immideatly go on asking who the hell the guy is, because ♥♥♥♥ smalltalk... What I am trying to get at is, all the characters know that everything that happens can only be relevant to the plot, and so should the player if he/she has a no mental illnesess or handicaps, but they still act as if they just dropped some Inception 'going deeper' ♥♥♥♥ on you...  This leads to alot, and I mean A REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING LOT of information that is completly useless, usually you could just skip through it, but not i nthis game, you can't, because while the game does have a skip mode for dialouge you sometimes can't stop in time to get important stuff out of it and there is no way of going back to that text... And I could put up with that if the skip mode was only another the equivalent of smashing 'a' or 'space' or whichever button you bound to that, sadly it isn't. Outside of the skip mode the game has a pretty annoying screen/character transition. Imagine a movie where every dialouge between characters was shot in a way were only the character currently talking can be seen on camera and the cameraman has to switch inbetween shots, now imagine that with awkward 2~3 second pauses for the transition... Per scene of character interaction you have at least 20 seconds of shot transitions... but wait there is more...  Ever played a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPGMaker game, or seen one? If not, lucky you! One thing those usually use is a 'wait order' meaning taking away control over the character for x seconds. So does this game, everytime it wants to get you to realize characters are moving everything except the background, excluding character arts, fades out and you get a footstep sound file, sometimes they even throw in a squeaking door, leading to a record waiting order of 20 seconds, well the record I got prior to quitting and writing this, to a degree hate fuelled, piece of oppinion... by the way skip mode can't skip those either...  To sum that one up useless information + waiting for scripts is not a good way of conveying information to the player via dialouge, especially if you know the plot without reading the majority of text if you ever watched any anime or read any manga with a medieval fantasy setting, because it is pretty much just that.  Seeing how I lost track of the points I was trying to talk about, I can still guarantee this is better writing than the games writing, if you are really desperate for some interactive games you could go for this one, but I think reading a textbook might be just as much fun with a higher degree of profitableness for your life overall...",

Moreover I'm a fan of so many of the things this game does: lots of playable characters, decisions having consequences later on, rewarding well-fought battles with xp and gold bonuses, an expansive crafting system. I could go on. I even enjoyed interacting with other characters to raise their bond with the PC. The end goal being breeding was a little off-putting but the multigenerational nature of the game is an interesting hook.  However, and it's a big fat hairy however, the two big main things happening in any game are the story and the core gameplay mechanics.   I enjoy this type of combat, like, a lot. So I found myself so surprised that I got so bored of it so quickly. Every battle feels the same and there are so many battles. Worst of all your characters equipment and skills change at a glacial pace. It felt like hours between having that warm fuzzy feeling of getting something new and wanting to try it out in battle. You can't even spend time grinding to craft better stuff because the game takes away the best ending if you take too long. Oh, and when you do get new skills or equipment? Your strategy doesn't even really change that much.   As for story there's not much I can say. This is the kind of bad generic fantasy story that makes cooking oatmeal look like a spectator sport. On top of that all the characters and their interactions with one another are a grab bag of the laziest anime stereotypes and tropes. There is nothing to enjoy between battles except going to towns and staring sadly at all of the stuff you can't craft.   TL;DR The story seems to actively encourage you to ignore it and if you do then the game becomes a single fight repeated ad nauseum.  ",

It plays out on a grid where you move your party around, position them, and attack. Skills can be combined for greater effect, which adds some tactical elements with conserving AP to ensure such combos can be performed. There's nothing really special about the combat. It's not terrible, although sometimes it feels a little slow, but nothing about it feels ground breaking.

About the game: Agarest it's a convination of a digital novel with an RPG turn-based mode that allows you strategic move your character, choose their skills, heal, use magic, defend and some other commands while the game progresses at it's own rythm, you play the part of Leonhartd, a young soldier that betrayed his nation to defend an inocent elf child. Overall graphic quality resambles the old Final Fantasy Tactics as it's not its strong point, it's definetly amazing and very beautiful, music is good and the characters are the best part, each character has it's own body display in battle and the field and also a very well made anime-like image each time they interact, making this a hard to miss for anime lovers.  The game itself worth the money to be honest, it's fun, adictive and has A LOT of dlc's that actually do nothing but they look cool.  Metascore: 75/100 'Anime fans, this game it's for you'",

It's fantastic! (I got the Collector's bundle thing on sale and it came with some DLC, Music, and Art. Pretty cool!)  Over all, the game play is simple and easy to pick up. The first three battles are (annoyingly) very tutorial. It's a bit over bearing how much of a tutorial there is for fighting. On the other hand, everything else outside of direct player control is pretty confusing and not explained well. At least, in my opinion.  My favorite thing is that your actions affect how others think of you (well specifically the main three female leads). In future games, it's everyone, but in this game it's the three main female leads. Well three female leads per generation. It's awesome! If you allow someone to fall in love with you, you will have a child who will have both of your stats mixed. It's actually pretty cool. Then you do it again for the next generation, then the next generation, for a total of five generations.   (Though I highly recommend not concentrating on using the leads too much as they eventually disappear when you move on to the next generation. Or at least level up everyone evenly.)  There are also multiple endings. 'Bad', 'Good', 'Neutral', and 'True' endings. All of them are interesting and over all the story is cool. It's like five mini stories in one giant story. I really like this game, and the series in general is fantastic.",

Another plus is that you have a lot of characters to choose from to form a party, so you can try a number of combinations which is good.  The problem with this game is that it's gameplay is long. That's five generations, and 14hrs in I felt tired knowing that I have to finish 4 generations more :(( and some choices that you make will affect the game entirely, yet the experience is still worth the try :))   ",

            "review_text": "It's really bad, but just about worth the 5€ I spent on it.  What it is is a long, epic JRPG-Tactical RPG hybrid in the vein of Disgaea and Fire Emblem. It has an overarching story spanning multiple generations of heroes, and revolves around *sigh* heroes of Light battling the forces of Darkness. This epic battle is expressed through a scrappy young group of heroes, most of them female, doing... stuff.. that.. saves the world? Honestly, it's all very generic, but also kinda demeaning in a way. At one point they basically ripped off the one ring from LoTR, and I could just sit there and be dumbfounded by how blatant they were being about it. ...sorry, lost my train of thought  The game has a turn based battle system, that revolves around combination attacks with your 6 party members. Think Disgaea. Unlike Disgaea though, the battles all take place on a small flat plane, and your characters always start from the same position. This, combined with the mandatory, enforced grinding and slow skill progression means that you will be fighting many, many fights doing exactly the same thing over and over, and taking way too many clicks to do so. The battles are still probably the best part of the game, since they still involve some tactical manouvering and some flashy explosions and skills, but there are still too many of them. Thankfully, there's auto-battle, which allows you to let the computer fight for you, even if it has the tendency to unload unnecessary ammounts of of damage on a single demonic fly.  The game's story is awful. Feels like absolutely no effort was put on the writing, each scene passes with a hurried pace without really explaining anything, yet the main story is quite sluggishly paced due to all the grinding you have to do. The main character (of the first story) is about as bland as a piece of toast, but weirdly enough, the female characters aren't given much to do either. There are no side conversations or dates or backstory conversations or anything. There is a light-dark moral choice system in the game, and your choices cause some girls to like or dislike you more, but the game never explains to you the benefits of those systems, and better yet, doesn't even hint at you which of your choices is which. Arbitrary choices, like taking the longer route to the city, suddenly turn you into a renegade hero, and cause the thief lady to suddenly shun you. What? It may be just the fault of poor translating, but a good story this is not.  There is some noticeable effort in this game, though. The music and art are on the whole, quite good, and all the lines are fully voiced in japanese. There is a TON of content in this game, multiple storylines which, though they may be bad, will still take a while to complete. Lots of things to unlock, though they may be just numerical upgrades, and as I mentioned, the combat system does have it's moments (when you're not just blazing through with the overpowered DLC weapons the game gives you) All that content though, is spread much too thin, and the core gameplay is much too linear and restrictive to really work. The game's kept me coming back a few times to see some more sights and hopefully unlock some more super skills, but at the moment the progress is still hidden behind 25 identical mandatory random encounters.  Pick it up on the next sale, if you're feeling parched. if you're looking for a Fire Emblem style game on the PC, I suggest looking torwards an early access title Massive Chalice. It does the same thing as this game much, much better, at the cost of not having waifus in it. It's still unfinished, but check it out, you'll enjoy it more than this.   ",

            "review_text": "So I picked this up while it was on sale. I've been keeping an eye on it, waiting for a good sale before snagging it and I can tell you, it was WORTH EVERY CENT. I even picked up a couple of the smaller DLCs just for the fun of it.  To start out - the version on sale at the point of writing this comes with ALL of the 'required' DLC, and by that, I mean any extra dungeons or storyline, and all the currently saleable DLC is just bonus gear or stat/money boosts, so you don't need to buy anything extra after the main game unless they release more actual content DLC.  Now, with that out of the way, I'd like to start off by going over combat, as that's what you're first thrown into after the exposition - Think Final Fantasy Tactics. That's the first thing that came to mind, but surprisingly more 'tactics' to it! Holding is actually beneficial in this, to a point. Combos, attack threads, and widdling away multiple enemies at once is a viable tactic. You don't have to just nuke one thing at a time or die, you can weaken the whole of the enemy party at once and come out on top as well. It took a little while to get used to the 45 degree shift, with 'up' on the controlls actually being 'up and left', and so on. But once you get used to that it's amazingly fun and self paced combat.  Next is the story. I've not gotten too far in, a couple hours at most, and I'm already deeply immersed. The fact that they DID NOT redub all the voiceovers with english actually helps the game a lot. I cannot see this game redubbed. The plot itself is so far up to par with what I thought it would be, and some of the party mechanics are making me think I'm going to be on a party member hunting spree like I had in Suikoden.  Audio/Visuals are well done. The only complaint I have is the overly thick outline around the shrubbery on the grassy battlefield. Everything else is beautifully rendered and/or hand drawn, and really pulls you into the SNES or early PS1 era feel, while keeping a modern game twist to it.  To give this an overall score, I'd probably have to say 95 / 100. It hit a LOT of home runs and kept gameplay over graphics, while keeping the game beautiful, but it really dropped the ball on the 'lets ♥♥♥♥♥ DLC out' part. If they hadn't done so much pointless DLC, this would have been a perfect 100 for me. I'd even be willing to pay full price, if not more. This, to me, is easily one of the best purchases thus far this year, and will be hard to beat though the rest of the year.",
