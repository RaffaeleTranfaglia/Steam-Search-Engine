The action is swift, yet raw, and the gameplay is just about as simple as it could ever get. Everything works well here and is more memorable than you would expect given the graphical presentation. The story may or may not stick with you, but it will certainly stick with me. I thought I saw futuristic human fish walking on two legs yowhza!",

There's plenty of pop culture references, without being meme-spouting. The arena mode is a nice addition/change of pace. Bad: I beat the story mode by just spamming the main attack and an occasional jump+main attack, even all the bosses. None of the enemies drop anything, nor are you allowed to bash open any inanimate objects. Would be nice if they dropped coin that could be used to buy something or temp. weapons as many ohter beat em ups do. Ugly: the level designs, I get that its the retro/pixel style art, but most of the bgs are cheese.  4/10.",

Not enough variety.  -'upgrades' don't really do much at all.  -The fighting just gets dull and repetitive quickly. -achievements are nice, except the ones where you have to level up each character to the max of which there are 20. I started a second playthrough and at level 18 out of 40. Im guessing it would take maybe 5 playthroughs per character for 100 playthroughs. NO. BEAR YOU.  -No co-op, not even local. Inexbearable.

What i do know it's that i couldn't get out of the tutorial section of the game without feeling a desperate feeling to play something else, anything for that matter, just something that wasn't this game.",

Is that bear really in the game, or real life? What is the exact scenario that would happen if I was to fight a bear under incredibly realistic circumstances? Fist of Awesome has answered, and this is the best bear fighting simulator I have seen all year.  And the story is incredibly deep, too. Never have I ever cried, or been so touched by the Tim Burr's struggle for humanity, and the fights he faces with his own demons, with whom he must also fight alongside. The supporting characters play an astounding plot-central role that no other written genius could ever deliver, on paper, movie, or game. This game leaves me with a deep connection to the characters and has inspired me to help deliver humanity from this terrible fate. Truly amazing.  TLDR If you want a good laugh, buy the game.",

You'll find yourself generally using the same attacks against each foe with the occasional jump thrown in to the mix. A simple level up system is added in which adds some depth, as well as multiple characters and unlockables.  However, all of that is irrelevant; Fist of Awesome's appeal and charm lies in it's humourous storytelling. The world is thrown into an alternative timeline where bears are the dominant species, armed with the Fist of Awesome, a super powered talking...fist, you set out to unravel the mystery and restore the original timeline. Along the way your adventure is packed full of comical backdrops, tooltips and enemies. The banter between Fist of Awesome and the lumberjack hero ranging from Puns, Wit, Meta-humour, even to somewhat crude observations.  If that doesn't appeal to you, one of the main features of the game is;  You get to punch bears in the face.",

The controls are always the same, you are not introducted to new forms of gameplay as you advance. All the stages are composed in the same way, you fight a few deers or minor enemies, then you got a bear fight. Always. The combat doesn't feel rewarding, you have 2 buttons to smash and the action isn't fluid, when you throw an enemy to the floor (right after your only combo) you have to wait for him to get up. Then you throw him again. An you repeat the process until it's dead.  Quite a boring game.  The art is interesting though.",
