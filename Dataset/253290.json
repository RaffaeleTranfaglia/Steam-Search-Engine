The news does not seem to be able to unbalance the opinion of those who have got to try it at the time, but the arrival of Steam for this title certainly sounds as further confirmation of the quality of the project. Photonics is the classic title that you either love or hate, launching in the first case in wild ride in search of the perfect score, using occasionally the local multiplayer to give life even to some match in the company. Photonics is perfectly at home on iOS, environment which allows him to better express the absolute minimalism of its control system keeping the distinctive graphic style. Original, challenging and with content height, Photonics is not, however, a product suitable for anyone: it is permissible to imagine that only the most hardcore users will be able to appreciate the gameplay ruthless and bold design, while casual gamers tend to side They could not find anything significant in this.",

Without any hints of pretension, this game has more charm and majesty than games like Fez and Gone Home will ever hope to acheive. Fotonica is an experience that takes us back to the older arcade days of gaming and does so with marvelous authenticty; it's a taste of childhood. Fotonica is what it is--a vector-graphic game about running--and in that simplicity it takes on something much more magical that has to be experienced to be believed.",

I wouldn't say its worth $10, but if you can get it on sale, do. It's a really good time-waster, especially if nothing else in your library looks entertaining at the moment.",

And FOTONICA did this very well. The game just feels like a one direction temple run with only jumping, and that it comes at a price. Although rather overpriced for a game like this, it is actually rather good. But can be easily outmatched by other time wasting indie games or popular platform games like Tetris. It feels like a game that could easily be ported to Mobile devices, which is a good thing, making it cross platforms. I just think the price should go down for the PC.   I'd rate it 7/10",

The game is simple, yet looks beautiful and runs so smoothly even on my not so great pc. I have it both here on Steam and on my phone and its a fantastic game to unwind to. There are 4 difficulties in all, each one varying in speed as you run through the level, so it's quite easy to get competitive on it and to be honest It's easy to pick up and play but can be quite tricky to master but, at the end of the day, thats all part of the fun in Fotonica.  I highly recommend this game, its a feast for the eyes and the music is perfect for each level. You can easily just drop in a level and listen to the music, theres no game over if you dont run, which is perfect.",
