            "review_text": "I created a pair of post offices, staffed them, bought them vehicles and a few amenities, set routes and fixed prices. All of that took roughly ten minutes. I spent the next 50 minutes doing other things in real life. I cooked some soup, put together a decent sandwich (it even had some lemon zest in it), made a banana split, went to the bathroom, and got some things from my car that I'd forgotten earlier in the day. The whole time, the game was at 3x speed. I occasionally hit 'ok' on the dialog that told me the day was over, but most of my time was afk.  I came back to the game and found that after a week, nothing interesting had happened. My operation flowed smoothly and made me a good return. Given a month I could open another office, given a year and I could probably edge out my competition with decent advertisements and expanded service.  Here's the thing - the game played itself. All i did was set it up. There's no management, the prices were already reasonable, there were never any problems, and I didn't have to do anything. Other tycoon games give you a reason to keep playing - more things to build, more people to attract, more stuff to see. This one doesn't - it's over as soon as you've finished setting it up. It's barren and simple. It's so simple that I can't recommend it, because you won't get anything out of it, unless you're looking for a screensaver that doesn't move, but takes ten minutes to set up.  Glancing over the developer's history, it seems clear that this is common. Produce a bargain bin game that's very simplistic, release a new one every couple months. And hey, they apparently make enough money to stay afloat, so cheers to that. Given how many games I play that were made by people who tried 10x as hard and came out roughly equal to this one, I can't really decry someone who is literally in business making this sort of thing.",

The gameplay isn't immersive, and therefore I think the price is too high. You can find mobile games for a 10th of the price that are much better, with better graphics, and have clearly had much more time spent on them.",

            "review_text": "I see a lot of people being very negative about this game. Some even compared it to OTTD which seems rather harsh to me because they are so different. So I will give my 2 cents so far.  This is not the best game ever, yet it is not a bad game either as portrayed by many here. You choose a difficulty. Set up your employees (post sorters, customer handling and security) and vehicles (bikes to trucks with each different costs and benefits). For each vehicle you have to set the service it will do (post collection or delivery for instance) and its specific route and working hours. After a while you want to expand and buy more offices to increase your coverage of the cities and thus increase your customer satisfaction (reputation). You earn stars for being better than your competitor and some generic missions like build 5 vehicles. Stars are needed for unlocking upgrades and advertisement.  The tutorial is also not horrible. It does what it needs to do, although it has some spelling errors in them. The game is quite easy to get into. So if you want a more casual game than for instance OTTD, then I recommend it. I personally paid 2 euro for the bundle and I don't feel ripped of about it at all.  Some also complained about the dev's not supporting this anymore. I have played 3 hours so far and I have only encountered 1 bug in which a popup appeared where it shouldn't. However this did not effect my game in any (negative) way. So honestly I think the devs delivered a nice little working game.  Someone said before that you can make soup in the mean time: that is true. This is overall very laid back and you do not have to micromanage except for the priority deliveries which you have to assign a vehicle to. Apart from that, I only had to micromanage when I bought new vehicles and I would readjust all routes so no routes would overlap.",

The graphics are decent, music is catchy and the pace of the game is good. Seasoned players may not like it, but it is good for beginners. The tutorial is fairly good. I wouldn't buy it at full price, but if you catch it on sale it is a good buy.",

For one, who's bright idea was it to put white text with a black outline with a black shadow on a white background? It's almost illegible and it really ruined the game for me immediately. Just use black text, you weirdos!  Secondly, the gameplay is confusing and seems more complicated than it needs to be. I think this has potential, but until something gets fixed it isn't playable.",
