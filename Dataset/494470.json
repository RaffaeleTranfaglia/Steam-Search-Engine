            "review_text": "I played through Kamizaki's route on my phone before so I knew what I was getting into when I bought this. Honestly this one surprised me with how much I enjoyed Kira's route. He genuinely surprised me in a good way as opposed to Kamizaki, who surprised me by turning out to be way more creepy then I had hoped he'd be. Yonekura was pretty much standard fair.   If you've ever read a romance novel from the 70s or early 80s (the ones where the guy's a bit of a sadist or bully, the heroine is meek and there's almost always a teary misunderstanding in the final few pages) then that's pretty much Dogenzaka Lab VN's in a nutshell. There's a certain level of silly disbelief that's needed to enjoy them, but overall they're fine.   Playtime inflated by forgetting to turn it off a couple of nights. I'd say running through a happy and normal ending takes roughly two to three hours per guy depending on how fast you read and whether or not you're into their archetype.   Forever holding out hope for Kirishima and Kagurazaka routes in the future.",
