The character progressions and back stories were one of the main reasons i originally got into RPG's. Started this game in my early childhood and still playing it into my 30's. Huge story, multiple chances to obtain or lose characters just by making the wrong decisions in game. I will always look fondly on this title for making me the gamer i am today.",

Incredible cast of characters, each with their own deep plot and quests to flesh them out further. Each character also brings unique skills and abilities to your arsenal. The story is one of the most amazing and powerful I've seen to date. You will meet them, you will love them, you will watch them die...because Japan.  The leveling system and gameplay mechanics were quite advanced for their time, making it possible for well over a hundred hours to be devoted entirely to perfecting your magic, summons, items, skills, and stats. It's quite a fun grind, with a lot of hidden Easter Eggs to keep you smiling.  Definitely a game to give a chance if you love RPG's and great writing.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy VI was one of my favorite RPG games on the SNES and still ranks as one of the best games I’ve ever played. The game uses an ensemble cast and has one of the most engrossing story lines of any game I have ever played.  Unfortunately my first hour or two of the game as absolutely terrible. I tried playing with a keyboard at first just to see what the game was like on the PC and it was almost unplayable. The key bindings were in random places all over the keyboard and in desperation to try to figure out which keys performed which actions I accidentally pressed a key that caused me to lose complete control of my party during battle and I could not find the key I pressed to turn it off. Had I not played the SNES version and seen how the game was intended to be played I would have ended my playthrough within the first hour and joined the string of negative reviews that barely had any time invested in this game.  I took a brief break and after calming down and decided I was going to write down the keybindings (or reassign them) so I could at least gain control of my party again. Within a few seconds I then realized “why not try using a controller?” so I tried playing it again with the Steam Controller. To my surprise it worked well with the Steam controller although it did take an hour or so to get completely comfortable with using the controller. After I overcame that hurdle the experience was great.   The graphics had received an overhaul and while I loved how the backgrounds looked during combat I was not entirely sold on the new character sprites as they struck me as being a bit too childish for some of the models (and I am not a fan of Locke’s beer gut that they added).  As I found myself nearing the end of the game I was strongly considering whether or not I could give this game a positive review. This probably ranks as the best game of all time for me and while I had enjoyed most of my playthrough I kept comparing it to the SNES version and was wondering how I could, with a clear conscience, recommend this game after the debacle that was my first hour of learning the controls when I should be recommending to someone that they play the SNES version instead. I learned shortly afterwards that apparently this version of the game had two additional areas added as this was an indirect port of the GBA version of the game (I had no idea there had been a GBA release of the game). These additional end game areas were barely enough to shift a negative review to a positive one although this was extremely close.  There isn’t too much in the way of replayability in this game but a full playthrough of the main game will likely take you around 30-35 hours (around 40-50 hours if you want to tackle the additional areas).   In summary this can be a great experience if you have a controller for your pc to play the game with. If you don’t and are unwilling to get one then stay away from this version of the game.",

You get used to it after a while.  4: I had a few problems with the game in fullscreen mode, but after switching to windowed mode, i didnt have a single crash of problems.  5: Battle system is quite weird at first, but you get use to it after a while. If you are having problems, try switching the battle modes. the default one is pretty crappy but the others arent bad.  Still a 9.5 / 10 after all those years.",

But if you're willing to overlook the cosmetic change, you're in for a rather enjoyable experience.  Some item and spell names have been changed, presumably to fit in better with the rest of the series, so it's a bit tough to het a handle on it in the beginning. The script's also been rewritten with less dunious translations so it does read and follow a bit better, but personally, I miss some of the better mistranslations.",

            "review_text": "A truly epic game re-released with a classy update. I mean this too. I first played Final Fantasy '3' on SNES when I was 14 years old, and have re-played the game every few years since. It is like a favourite book that one returns to again and again. I realise that some folks wanted this game to have been completely redone in 3D and voice acted, but frankly that would simply have destroyed it. This game got exactly what it needed. A touch-up. It's rough graphics, sound, and translation are smoothed out. A few handy features have been added to make it more accessable. And that's it. All they did was wax a classic car, which is what they should have done. You don't put modern mag-wheels and jam a spoiler on a '55 corvette no matter how much you think it will add to the ride. Same thing. So whatever all the nay-sayers are throwing out about this, it is a faithful reproduction of an exceptional game.   Thoughts as follows:  The graphics were gorgeous in their original 16-bit, and they have been carefully touched up to look even better in this version. This is not a simple video filter, as anyone who has ever played this on an emulator like zsnes should pick up instantly.  The Character sprites do not look out of place, they just look different than they used to and they do look better.  The addition of the original art profiles to the dialogue is actually very nice and adds character without spoiling ones own visualization of the characters as a 3D rendering could have.  The Score is enhanced and cleaned up from the old SNES midis and sounds much closer to the original instrumental score, released on cd in 1994.  The translation is touched up and some of the more ridiculous and confusing moments in the original release make more sense. No change to substance whatever.  The only two gameplay tweaks, auto-battle and quick-save, ease the playability by taking away some of the pain of grinding and eliminating classic frustration with the great old glitch/power outage, 'holy xxxx, i haven't saved in an hour' moment. All without changing the gameplay in any substantiveway.   only complaints:   Naming fail. stupid error that I trust will be rectified with a patch, but you can't use 'wasd' for arrow keys without adding 'd' to the end when naming character. Hardly a game-breaker though as all you have to do is use your arrow keys for 'abxy' and use backspace to eliminate the addition before accepting.   A few glitches - game has stopped a couple of times in about 8 hours of play, as expected in any new release. happily though, every time I was able to start where it froze by virtue of the game auto-quicksaving with each room change. So you just hit continue when you reload and start where it froze.   All in all the game is more beautiful, more enjoyable, and gently tweaked rather than sullied by 'upgrades' that would have cheapend this fine game like coca-cola in a glass of Bowmore's 15 year old 'Darkest'.   Happy to spend the price of a mediocre bottle of wine on this well-cellared gem.",

The story is amazing, the characters' dialogue is extremely well written, and the art style is amazing and unique. The game may be over 20 years old, but it is still an experience that I'd recommend for everybody.  Now that I'm done talking about the NES/GBA/Playstation versions let's talk about the PC/iOS/Android versions...  Ugh, the remade graphics are really not something that me and a bunch of other people would approve of if we were in charge of the people remaking this work of art. Most of the sprites look goofy and a bit half-a**ed, I think that square enix could have done a much much much muuuuch better job with them, or not even done anything to them.  Other changes to the game are mostly positive, they can be read  here  [finalfantasy.wikia.com] , my favorite of which being the optional hints and marking where to go, really progresses the story if you're a bit of an RPG noob and don't wanna look it up on youtube. Final Fantasy VI PC also has many things a modern port of an older game would have such as achievements and an awesome built in music player with every soundtrack in the game to listen to (highly recommended because the game has an amazing OST).   Final thoughts: Final Fantasy 6 is an amazing game, beautiful, a work of art, top notch JRPG. The graphics are sub-par, yes, but since when have graphics had a giant impact on a 2d game anyway? The story is fantastic, the characters are lovable, the art style is beautiful and fits the mood, one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard in my life, and 14 playable characters with different stats and abilities. IT IS A STEAL for $15.99.  9.5/10 (because of the lame sprites)",

The updated graphics makes everything look better than any other platform. I do agree with the complaint that 1080p isn't an option, however.    The new ATB style is nice, and it can be changed in the config menu if you want different options.  The game also has a helpful quest guide that points you in the direction to go next, as well as an album that shows all the quests you've compeleted to date.  Many people consider FF6 to be the best Final Fantasy plot wise. I consider it top 3. It has a wonderful cast and a great fulfilling ending. It also has probaby the best villain in the entire series. Highly highly recommended this version specifically over all the others.",

I do wish they would have made native 1080 support, but it still looks fine in the lower resolutions (it is an SNES game afterall).

Graphics are poorly 'upscaled' and look weird. Keyboard/gamepad/whatever is poorly defined; you have to use the launcher to make some config changes (including resolution) and you have to wait through the beginning (which is like 10 minutes) before you even see a menu to save or whatever from.  It's not the first time that Square Enix has let me down, but you'd think they'd put effort into it or something. Not worth the money.",

I have countless stories about how as a kid I’d be yelling in the back of my father’s pizza restaurant “ITS KEFKA ITS KEFKA”, getting really freaked out by the Atma Weapon boss fight, ect.  This port is hilariously bad. The good thing about this port is it fixed the physical/magical evade glitch from the SNES version. Literally, everything else in every conceivable manner is worse to the point where it stopped ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and I just started laughing. The game looks like ♥♥♥, the sprites look like the shrinky-dinks I made by tracing the manual of the PS1 port of the game. The 8 directional movement only sometimes works and is garbage. The game’s resolution had to be randomly generated, because there’s not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person on the planet that would look at it and say “nah, this is acceptable”. The enemy art PNGs have visible artifacting, they look like they were taken off a sprite website from 2003 and ♥♥♥♥ed up in GIMP. The music is ♥♥♥♥ing odd, because some of the tracks sound similar to the SNES version, and some (like the opening ♥♥♥♥ing track in the game) sound like a tumblr ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I half expected the Kazoos to kick in. Various spell animations looks noticeably worse (Mog’s snare in the SNES version didn’t look as bad as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gradient circle they stole off my fan flash animation I did in 2006. The portraits no longer closely follow the unbeatable artwork by Yoshitaka Amano, and now are just a step above stock RPGmaker assets. You can no longer move your cursor left or right to select multiple targets for spells. Some of the enemy scripts are messed up or they dummied out previous scripts. If you press X, you get Omachao levels of condescending hints telling you where to go. Auto-dash from the GBA port is gone. The transition between songs in Dancing Mad is knackered (though, it has been past the SNES port in all fairness, still a flaw). The flaws just don’t stop and if you’ve played the game even once, you’ll notice things just aren’t right at every corner.",

I saw that they were putting this game on Steam and my Nostalgia Goggles slipped down from the brim of my hat and landed firmly on my face.  I bought the game as soon as it was made available and played it with high hopes... for an hour.  I couldn't play past an hour because my overworld sprite had vanished, making it nearly impossible to tell where I was at.  Beyond that, the change they have made to the sprites completely dumbs down the over-all tone of the game.  Final Fantasy VI was one of the more dark games that I'd played in the series, and to be able to do that with such limited resources was a tremendous accomplishment.  One thing which lent to this tone was the appearance of the game - the sprites, and what they did with the sprites dealt a blow to the theme of the game; a relatively small group of individuals who, against all odds, fight for the future of the planet against a massive military power. The game saw the deaths of several main characters (or their families/love interests), and each character had their moment to be 'THE main character'.  They didn't ruin the game for me, they just did a really bad job with this rendition of it.  My advice to anyone considering buying this game from Steam :   Go buy a GBA and find this game in a local game shop instead.",

There's three problems I have that Square needs to fix, because this is unacceptable to release a game this revered in this state.  #1: Naming system is fubar in keyboard. I mapped A to Z on my keyboard and I tried naming Terra Tina, so when I hit Z it adds Z to her name and I can't change it.  #2: User interface is screwed. Why change what we knew and loved for a modern audience?  #3: Graphics are muddy and unappealing. The portraits look robotic and half ♥♥♥♥♥.  Until Square fixes these problems, I cannot recommend this port. Wait until Square gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, or buy the SNES/GBA version. It's 2015, I figured quality control would have existed by now.",

Also noticed the game crashes when trying to use a controller. If these small things were fixed or patched i feel like i could reccomend this game for everyone.    I can handle the graphics, they never bugged me at all, but why why WHY would they change the in battle menu boxes to work like they do and not give the option to revert it ?!? hopefully there will be some sort of mod available in the future.",

First off, I won't list the graphics as being bad since this is an updated version with new sprites. Even though I missed the old sprites from the main map screen, it was kind of refreshing to see something a little newer.   The sound however. Why did they even bother to change it? it sounded fine on the SNES, PSone, GBA advance after the sound patch and roms. The sound is so terrible that I asked for a refund. My atari 2600 has better sound quality than this port has. we're talking over 30 years worth of technology in which apparently sound has been improved in our gaming systems and computers. Why would this game sound like complete crap? A commodor 64 has better sound effects than this.  The game itself however is my personal favorite in the series. Even though I requested a refund, I will continue playing the rom since my SNES bit the dust a few years back. I was really hoping this would have been a nice way to relive some classic moments but the sound alone was enough to uninstall it after but a few mins of play time. The fight menus are a little refreshing to see the change and as others stated, more built for touch screen or mobile devices but still enjoyed the menus scrolling up to indicate who's almost ready to fight rather than watch a meter fill up on the classic version.  Hope this helps anyone looking into buying this. Get the ROM rather than this game if you can help it. Save your money.",
