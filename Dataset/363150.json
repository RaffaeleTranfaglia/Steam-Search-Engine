            "review_text": "Lets be straight here, the game is NOT acceptable for 90 dollars(launch price)! It worths at most 30 dollars at launch for this quality.Koei must be super insane right now. 说真的，这游戏售价90刀（首发价格）真他妈搞笑。就这游戏素质最多30刀。光荣真是想钱想疯了。  pros: several good new concepts intoduced. 优点：有几个新的不错的游戏概念。  cons: insanely stupid AI, you can pusuade any clan to alliance or armisty without any condition. Clan will keep fighting for his allies even when his own cities get attacked. stupid game mechanisim, you get only one chance of diplomacy suggestion per rank( 9 at most) if you are not the clan lord or lord's military adviser, because as I said, diplomacy in this game is ♥♥♥♥in OP to hell. 缺点：超级傻逼的AI,可以同盟或者停战任何势力，无论对方实力如何。一个势力可以为了帮助同盟而不管自己的城市。愚蠢的游戏机制，如果你不是君主或者君主军师重臣，那你就只有最多9次机会可以提出外交建议。原因很简单，这游戏的外交OP到火星。  And most importantly, the game is TOO fast paced, you CANNOT do much your personal ♥♥♥♥♥. But if the game slows down the pace, you actually will find you DONOT have much ♥♥♥♥♥ to do. 最重要的是，这游戏的节奏超快，你基本干不了什么自己的事情。但是如果这游戏节奏变慢了，你会发现你其实也没什么事情可以干。。。内容匮乏。  Overall, it is another cheap designed and implented 三国志 game from KOEI.  总结：暗耻又廉价设计和制作了一个三国志游戏。  Put your ♥♥♥♥ together, Koei, you keep destroying this franchise! 草泥马的傻逼暗耻。别再毁三国志系列。",

No ! No ! No !

            "review_text": "Frankly speaking, RTK 13 is a much better version that RTK 12. However, if someone ever played RTK 11 (XI), you would feel something is not perfect right there, making the RTK 13 (newest version) just a light weight strategy game. In short, I would say: Advantage: - Automation in Delegate system (Governor, Viceroy, Minister). - Role playing gameplay with rich tasks. - Character's relationship bonding. - Professional level of troop type.  Disadvantage: - No defense systen (Wall, Camp / Fort, Tower, Port) built-able by player. - The route is too simplified that all forces ended up running into each other. No shortcut or terrain advantage that player could make use of to select the best battle field, trap and ambush. - Resource re-allocation is a failure. How could you buy as ton of food when you urgently need in a very short time? Even able to redistribute food and gold amongs city within eye blink. Resource transportation is an art of war. I bet you guy missed it. - Pike troop type is abolished, to which I don't agree. Spear kill Horse more effectively that Pike, Pike kill Spear, Horse kill Bow, Bow kill Spear/Pike. Even in reality, Sword has certain role in the battle field. Here, we see no Sword. - Duel? I didn't figure out how to actively duel or trigger tricks, such as confusion, pertube, etc. Without those, you can only win by strong general with more troop count. - Losing the city = lose that army is not reasonable. As long as the general is still there, troop morale should be reserved at some level to keep fighting rather than dispersed all at once. - Arranged marriage is no longer valid. - Marry 3 wifes is a good thing, but having no children with them = senseless point. A leader should have heir by their own, rather than be shaped by historical mode. - Rare items are cheap in shop, especially be sold mostly in Chang An (a +10 to stat could be bought at 6K - 7K coin). I would suggest rare item found from Search / Investigate. Price of the item should be defined by the Trader, however here the price is equal in all cities. - Coalition is sensitive to Tyrany is good, however making Ally is way too easy. Sometimes, alliance can never be bought but has already defined in the head of each leader. Rate this game 2 stars because it looks more like an update of RTK 12, rather than a decent product with a major revision number.",

            "review_text": "I feel it has been getting a lot of stick but the gameplay is quite refreshing and allows for more replay value than previous ones. The role-playing element is quite well done and actually extends the life of the game. You need to develop relations in order to build up your stats and skills, and do well in the strategic aspect of the game. For example, my average stat character (50-70 in all areas) is now a 90+ intel character who learnt fire strategy from Lu Xun. Still get pawned in a charge but I can toast people real good.  Here's what he's doing: In the game, I am a viceroy for Gan Shi (cos Liu Bei was killed by Taishi Chi and his wife succeeded him). I was promoted from the Governor of Luoyang after successfully rebuilding and defending Luoyang from Ma Teng and Yuan Shao. Gan Shi has given me the difficult task of keeping Yuan Shang (after Yuan Shao die of natural illnesses) away from the central plains while she leads Sichuan, Hubei and Anhui in the easy task of playing around with Liu Biao.  Yuan Shang controls the emperor at Chang'An and has hegemony over everything north of the Yellow River with a sizable army, and Liu Biao is enjoying life in Jingzhou. No more Cao Cao as Yuan Shao seems to always overpower him in the early scenarios . Sun Jian mati early and Sun Ce ran straight into Liu Bei and Lu Bu instead of whacking Liu Biao.  Gan Shi took all of Shu and Wei's capable generals and letf me with Wu generals. Luckily ZhouYu is still alive and he is leading an attack across Baima towards Ye. I will ask Gan Shi to attack Chang'An from Hanzhong and I will head out and cut Yuan Shang's territory into half at Hong Nong. Hopefully this plan works as he got loads of capable generals and troops as well.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: This game has lots of flaws, and sure it's overpriced, but it's still entertaining.  More Extensive Review:  I've been a longtime fan of the ROTK series, starting from the ol' days of ROTK IV. Since I never really played the RPG-style games, only installments that feature Ruler Mode (ROTK IV, ROTK IX, ROTK XI, ROTK XII), my opinion does not reflect the previous ways through which Koei executed this feature.  ROTK 13 requires some micromanaging. Not nearly as extensive as ROTK XI, and if you're somewhat lazy and don't want to deal with all the frustrations of ruling like me, that might be a good thing. I loved how ROTK IX felt more streamlined than other entries and ROTK XIII delivers on that front. Attacks are straightforward, commands/orders are straightforward. If I want to develop my city's commerce, there's a clear amount of time that'll happen and there's no TP to get in my way.  However, cities with a large staff not only take up gold (like in previous entries), but also cannot utilize this large staff to full effect. You have limited slots and even when your subordinates (governors) can assign people to administrative positions and delegate tasks to other people, there's a limited amount of slots for them. A city with over 20 officers isn't going to develop itself faster than a city with 12 or so (from what I can tell) officers.  Granted this was a problem in ROTK 12 as well but hey I'm sure we all expected this game to be a huge improvement over 12. (Not that I actually hated 12. To me if it came before 11 and was marketed as ROTK 4 Remastered it would actually have been a better-received game.)  Unlike in some of the other entries, though, routes between cities are fixed and you have no option of developing long-term bases at chokepoints or various areas. This is a missing feature. There's also a severe lack of variety for unit attacks that this game inherited from 12, even though naval battles make a comeback. Frankly, this is a huge point against this game.  Not to mention the price. Sure Koei has expensive games nowadays and $55 isn't quite as horrifying as $90 but are we supposed to praise Koei for making the price less painful? Especially when ROTK XI is still available as a downloadable game for $20?  This game inherits terrible stats from previous games, and is a far cry from the more 'balanced' stats in ROTK IX imo. The likes of Zhou Yu and Deng Ai suffer from this, whereas Zhao Yun gets stat buffs but loses his amazing skill 'Insight' from ROTK XI.  I mean at least Guan Yu isn't quite as OP as before right?  All in all, this is still a fun experience and the amount of time I've spent on it so far (and likely will continue spending on it) ensures that this game isn't quite a waste of money. But I do feel that it's overpriced especially when compared to ROTK XI, and if you are eager to experience a more traditional ROTK experience then look for the ever elusive ROTK X, or maybe VIII (like I said I never played either so I have no idea), or go buy ROTK XI from Gamersgate now.  At the very least, we now have a ROTK on Steam! Here's hoping for ROTK IX and maybe, MAYBE the return of Dynasty Tactics!",

            "review_text": "Veteran of this series, love this series, although I haven't played it since it was last on PS. I own it now on a computer, and this has got to be one the most boring games I've played...ever. They have great ideas, and may just need more time to advance them, however it feels as if they are trying to blend a turn based stratagey with a RTS, so you are litterally sitting and watching your icon, which looks like a tiny red kick ball , but is actually a small red portrait of your character that empties as time goes on, and you get closer to completing your mission. Want to train some soldiers? Awesome, 10 days (game time) of watching this ball drain.   The best parts of the series are still there. You can visit other officers. Cultivate your cities, build armies, train them, make alliances, ask for supplies, all of the features you love, (I'll get to the wars in a little bit. ) Yes all the features you love are here, however I hope you like looking at that red kick ball, because that is what you will be doing most of the time. Want to form an alliance with the next town over? Yeah!!! Okay watch your horse run across the map for 8 days in game. (maybe a minute or two)Then once you get to the foreign leader be ready for a whole bunch of cut scences.   The battles have promise. I personally would rather see the wars as turn based instead of real time that you can pause to issue orders, but this style isn't horrible, just not great. It also feels as though they may have tried to give the battles a little chaos, if this was their intention however they just didn't hit the mark, and it feels like gears grinding that every once and a while hit a smooth spot.   If you are like me, and you are a huge fan of the series, then nothing will matter, you'll buy it, and play, and maybe even still find it in your heart to love it. However if you are not used to this series, and you are just looking for a new strategy game to throw down on, just keep moving, you'll hate it. It's almost as if the Romance with this game is in it's great tradgedy, it's always almost there, they just never seem to hit the mark.",

            "review_text": "Finally, after completing the Main game on the highest difficulty, I can fairly write a review about this game. BTW, I've played ROTK3 and ROTK11 on PC.   COMBAT The combat is more balanced as you can't transport your army and easily overpower the AI with sheer numbers. You can still reinforce and gather your army during the deployment stage but that will take time - fair enough. You don't draft soldiers anymore. They will be generated based on a modifier in the game. You can improve the modifier. The generals still makes a difference but not so great anymore as in ROTK11. I think KOEI can make the game more fun by adding back ROTK11's strategies and abilities, e.g. the spear stun, fire arrow and strategist abilities like perturb, blunder, misinform. KOEI should also give the player more control on wanting to duel or not. Some fools lost their lives dueling Lubu and I can do nothing with it.  MAIN CHARACTER I chose Guan Yu as he is a very well balanced character with great WAR and decent INT and GOV and he belongs to the Shu :). Your first objective is to get enough deeds to be promoted to a 'viceroy'. There is where the real game starts. After you get promoted, you can appoint ministers to get up to 8+1 slots of improvement options, e.g. farming, commerce, training, fealty. Secondary objective is to make 'friends' with others with forte that you can improve, e.g. if once of your starting skills is 'endurance5', make friend with toons with endurance forte. That will improve your toon to 'endurance6'. Also, do make friends with the famous toons.  CITIES MANAGEMENT You have 2 slots which you can freely control on what to do. 6+1 are rested by the hands of your 3 ministers. They will recommend and you can accept or decline. It's no longer based on action points. Simply put it, the player lacks control. The 2 slots is not enough if you have many cities but if you have that many cities, to manage each and every one of them is a tedious job. So far, 8+1 slots seem to do the job. Personally, I think KOEI should improve this because I want to enjoy the game and not leave the game to the AI.  OVERALL The game is decent and it has good potential. Not as fun as ROTK11 but still good after the price drop. For example, once you get Ma Chao or Gan Ning, their charge ability is so god damn powerful. Group your forces together and charge at the enemies and you'll see insane number flying up the screen! I think they should put back some ROTK11 abilities into the game, e.g. stampede, confuse, blunder, fire arrows. They should also implement powerful combos, e.g. charge during stun would deal high damage. The power gauge should also be able to be charge up faster if certain criterias are met, e.g. exceptional morale, damage dealt or taken. That would add more fun to the game. REALISM isn't fun at all LOL!  Happy Gaming folks!",

First off its a solo game so no friends im afraid, and they still havent multiplayered three kingdoms, despite trying to make this kind of play in real time. While you expect a solo game to have many layers, it doesnt have that. The bomding system is decent, but its very limited in how you can create bonds. Its pretty disappointing considering how good they could have made that part? Which seems to be a big mechanic in the game :-( Battles are ok, but u have to control eachof your units which spoils immersion. ( even if your only a general) They are also small scale. Its as though they have focused on massive portraits and duels...thats it, but even that isnt even as good as the simplistic but tactful duels in previous games.  Battles require little brain power now im afraid. Just throw loads of officers against them ull be fine.  Overall...id prefer my money back, which hurts to say cus im a massive fan.

However if you played the series all along, you'll find that each generation has their characteristics. And do remember that this is not the PK version. So it definitely will feel 'incomplete'. I'm still exploring the new features but there are already many things that interests me:   1. There are way way more stronghold points around cities compared to previous games, and they actually play a big way when you are trying to capture a city.  2. The new army system is actually quite realistic. You can no longer support a 100,000 army in a city with a 20,000 population. And it actually will make the late game less boring, since you no longer need to build your army supply chain and send them to the frontline.
