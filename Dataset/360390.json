But the core of the game is very solid, and they delivered exactly what they promised. I'm very pleased to have this game in my library and hope to see it grow and develop.",

            "review_text": "extremely clunky and slow.  each race is neat with their own building mechanics.  the moment the game becomes laggy (too many abilities, units etc on the field) gets worse and lack of response from everything.  but when you're able to decently play the game, and everything is semi running smoothly. unit path finding and ordering is awful. you could issue attack move in a general direction, sometimes they move. sometimes they dont. (happens a lot when it gets laggy)   when they do finally attack move, if there is enemies nearby, they'll take a few steps, while getting shot at. before the attack part in ATTACK MOVE happens.  the 'story' is played at the start of each mission in very brief, briefs of a few images \\ gifs and a tiny caption at the end",
