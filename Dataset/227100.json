            "review_text": "If you haven’t played anything in the Sniper Elite series, what sets them apart from other run-and-gun shooters is the emphasis on over-the-top sniper shots with x-ray cams. The kills feel incredibly satisfying and the reliance on accuracy pushes one to enhance their skill and experiment with the weaponry to find the best player method. What is NOT here is the stealth element of the previous games, nor is it missed.   If you’ve played other zombie games, like Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead, this series emphasizes limited weapon selection, each with different strengths and weaknesses. It also emphasizes slow shambling zombies over fast-moving ones. The mood is set very well in this game, as it does a good job of providing a feel of a destroyed hellish zombie-infested landscape. It is sufficiently creepy, particularly because you know that survival depends on seeing them first and getting a good distance between you and them. As they shamble closer, accuracy matters more making it harder to pull off shots when it matters most, complimenting the major strengths of this game.   No doubt, you’ve read some criticism of this game. Some of the most prominent criticisms are condensed as follows:  Cheap and unambitious.  Monotonous and repetitive gameplay.  Cashgrab.  Unoriginal.  No plot.  While some of these are accurate to a degree, the reality is that even if they *are* true, it shouldn’t scare you away from this title. It is very fun with four people. I could go by each and refute them point by point, but most of these concerns can be alleviated by two counterpoints.  First, this game *is* cheap. The game is $15.00. The average movie ticket is between $7.84 and $8.38 (as of November 2013). At 1 Hour and 30 minutes as the average length of a film, if you get even three hours of enjoyment out of the game, you’ve already gotten more out of it than your average movie (and you can bring your own snacks and be as loud as you like.) It’s not meant to be some gaming magnum opus, and many Triple A releases try too hard to do this, and fail miserably. This is what you might call a “niche market” game… its aimed at a small segment of the gaming community for a modest profit. This is not a bad thing nor is it any more a cashgrab than any other game produced. While it is not for everyone (nor is it meant to be), it is worth the price of admission.   Second, as far as repetitive gameplay, yes it does have this. Every game is repetitive within certain respects, and the lack of a compelling plot or original gameplay elements makes this title’s repetitive nature relatively obvious. You *can* turn off the x-ray mode if it becomes overwhelming (or reduce its frequency) and the repetitive aspects are alleviated if you play with friends. The solo game mode is best enjoyed in small chunks. The shotguns function as shotguns, the sniper rifles function as sniper rifles, and pistols function as pistols. If you get tired of mowing down zombies with these methods, there are relatively few shooter games that will overcome this limitation. However, one should not expect too much innovation from a shooter game. There are precious few shooters that are innovative with regard to combat mechanics, or they’re successful at dressing up this shortcoming by using non-shooter elements. Much like the title implies, what you see is what you get… and what you get is pretty reasonable and fun in the right mindset.",

It may seem that this is only a cheap cash-in on the whole 'Nazi zombie' craze, but NZA is actually the best one out there.

Was great deal at $3.75 pretty much a steal at that price which is what i paid for it, the game took 4 hours to beat, its pretty short game in that aspect but it dosnt have alot of story behind it, the normal diffculty with friends is bit insane the levels are easy but the end fights are impossiable becuase with each extra preson with you seems to double the amount of killing you have to do at end fights.  for example the church fight in single player you only have to kill 1 machine gun zombie in two player you have to kill two of them we did three player and there was 3 of them so it made the end fights pretty hard when not on easy and easy was is just pretty easy, so that is kinda sad.   I think you get ammo reloads bit to quickly in gameseems you never have to worry really about looting any bodys.  it is what it looks like zombie shooter about ww2 its straight forward and works looks good I was thinking it be a pretty junky game but its my frist sniper eltie and it was good.",

The only thing that saves this game for me is the coop since without it I would not recommend it to anyone. What made Sniper Elite good is just gone here as it becomes much more about shooting endless hordes of zombies without much finesse.  The achievements are very grindy and you will be spending a lot of time running areas several times just to get the required kills with certain weapons, certain enemies killed a certain way etc. There are collectables in the game and I  strongly  recommend a guide as the bottles can be crazy hard to find.

In short, yes, I liked the game. A lot.  Definitely would recommend you to buy it although it would be nice to get the game with at least 10~25% off.  It's a pretty simple and straight foward game, you just need to go from point A to point B and kill the zombies along the way. There are some little twists here and there, like when you'll need to hold your position and kill hordes of zombies trying to siege your position or some boss battles.  Even though all the levels are pretty much linear I really enjoyed how they were crafted specially for the use of sniper rifles. There are lots of open spaces, long corridors and high places where you'll find yourself being able to effectively shoot zombies in the head all the time.  By the way killing zombies, the central point of the game, feels nice. You may get sick of it if you play the game for more than 3~4 hours straight, though. But overall killing zombies in this game is really satisfying.  It took me about 10 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty on single player mode. The game has a lot of replayability and also a focus on co-op with 3 other players but unfortunately I don't have any friends so I can't say much about the co-op. I'll definitely play through it again in the future.  Summing up: In spite of the game feeling incomplete, it is a great game with a lot of replayability. It may get monotonous after a while but I definitely recommend it, mainly if you enjoy sniper rifles or games like Left 4 Dead and killing floor.  If possible, buy it when it's in sale.",

'Like a drunk who lost a bet!' It's also nice to shoot a zombie's potato grenade and kill him and his nine best friends, even if that is almost always an accidental hit.  -Don't play single player. It's completely boring and as soon as you start fighting skeletons (very early on) it is basically impossible. Four-player coop is more fun, and does require a little bit of teamwork. For the most part the game is a shooting gallery, but it does scratch an itch.  -I see what people mean by the killcam being the highlight of this series.

Turns out, when I bought it, and played for awhile, I was dissapointed, as this was not the case whatsoever. The game has only a campaign, that can be played alone, or with up to four friends in coop. A survival type of game mode would have been great, and would of had me playing this game a lot longer. It gets extremely repetitive, and fast. From the levels to the storyline, to the objectives, to the weapons. The campaign is very short (only 5 levels), and the characters do not talk at all. Overall, I do not recommend this game. The most i'd be willing to pay is about 2 dollars, if I had to buy this title again.",

It also has the added fear factor of using a sniper rifle, in close quarters, against hordes of the undead. Others may say the special infected such as snipers or gunners are the game's downfall, but I think it makes it more challenging, thus better. If you try to run inscreaming yolo, you will be torn to shreds. If you stand back and pick off the zombies one by one, you will burn through more ammo, yes, but you will be able to waltz right through the next checkpoint after. Ressurecting zombies are annoying, but they can be prevented from a headshot (even before they ressurect). Although the maps were taken right from the campaign, Rebellion reimagined them with the look of an apocalypse. The weapons provided are very balanced, so no player will have a huge advantage over another. X-ray kill cams even got a zombification, so if you wanna see zombie testicles explode, this is the game for you. 9/10",

After about four hours play I bought NZA2.  Good game. I liked V2 and NZA is based squarely on that, meaning it's the same engine and some same sets. It looks different even when the sets are the same.  A hundred rounds plus ammo stocks and loads of creepy enemies - nice! They have given the zombies a great sinister and evil characteristic.  There is little to learn. You just jump in without any need to look at a manual, and it's only a little slow at the very start. You get better as you play, and it gets better as it goes along.  Having a blast now. You soon get back into the swing of judging distance and bullet drop so headshots start to flow. Slow-mo take-downs for vital hits. Never get bored of that.  (Paid £2.50 and put down about 2150 zombies so far.)   EDIT: It's about eight hours play time. Very difficult to estimate though since I played offline and can't be sure.",

All the missions are: 'go there', 'pick that and defend', 'defend', 'go there and clear the area'. Literally... The story was cut in half to sell the sequel, there's even a 'buy NZ:A2' button in the main menu and a popup that tells you to do so... About the zombies: there are a few types that you will encounter million times in every mission: normal walkers, snipers, suicide bombers, minigunners and skeletons. You will be sick of them after a map. There's a boss, too. He spawns even more zombies and does nothing, but stay in one place and wait till you shoot him. Ofcourse he appeared twice - why make 2 bosses when you can reuse the first one? Guns - every weapon feels the same, there's no point in choosing any other weapon (except shotguns). Grenades and traps are cool though. So yeah, that's the entire game. Super repetetive, no replay value. I don't know how it got so many positive reviews.",

This game offers a challenging, and intense adventure while trying to survive the never ending horde of Nazi zombies everywhere. This game is best played with friends in coop mode, although playing in single player mode is much more fun.  EDIT: March 19, 2014  After trying out this game with a few of my friends I can honestly say, STAY AWAY FROM IT! Everything is great until you start to play Cooperative Mode. Laggy as hell, you get dropped by the game so many times, it just becomes outright frustrating. The other Major problem is communication between players. There is no OPTION in the game to make it OPEN MIC and so the Push To Talk becomes tedious and very upsetting. We have never been able to finish the game because of one glitchy problem after the next. You shoot a zombie, and u feel like your shooting blanks. the shots won't register for about 2 full seconds. A delay that none of us care for. And people have left the game because it's just too much trouble. There's no real checkpoint where u can start over again without ending up in the beginning of the level again. and there are no options for this either. What is sad is that this game could've been perfect if there were updates to fix these so called glitches. Yet, they still exist. If there is no support for this game, i think STEAM should STOP selling it. Nobody wants to pay for an UNSUPPORTED GLITCHY game that later u will just want to bury it deep in it's own grave along with the glitchy zombies. What a disappointment. Buyer Beware!",

Sniper Elite V2 is a slower paced game based more on placing a few key shots on enemy snipers and footsoliders while physically isolating yourself from being rushed.  In Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army, you'll find it's impossible to segregate yourself from the enemies, as they come en masse and don't play around with cover or any other such distractions. This leads to high-octane action filled firefights that require basic teamwork and good accuracy to survive.  The shooting distance is generally under 50m; compare this to the base game which typically has 80m-200m shots. You'll often find yourself to not be doing a lot of sniping.  Playing through with three friends and on Sniper Elite difficulty(default enemy spawns), we had very few problems throughout the game. We had to restart from checkpoint all of twice.   There's not much for enemy variety, but assuming you don't have to restart too many times, it shouldn't be a big problem.  The Good: Enemies and bosses encourage teamwork Working netcode (Playing with people 3000 miles away is fine) Interesting and engaging shooting mechanics (Taken from V2) Good variety of weapons (though only a few new from V2) Runs smoothly on moderately old hardware  The Bad: Little enemy variety One game mode Short game length (5 missions/2-3 hours per playthrough) High cost to hour ratio ($5:h) No custom difficulty (as in Sniper Elite V2) Most maps are reused from the Sniper Elite V2 campaign  The Ugly: Can get stuck perpetually alt+tabbing Steam community can cause rapid screen flashing if enabled Poor voice quality and high latency for in-game voice chat Players can occasionally fall through world geometry when knocked out Bullet drop is insane at close ranges for all rifles hit-detection can be broken at times  Buy it on sale/10",

I've also loved the stalker series, and have played left 4 dead 2, killing floor, you name it. But don't let the 'sniper game with zombies' title fool you- this game is a hardcore shooter.  The undead in this game are relentless and walk like Romero zombies. They are, however, magically induced and not virus-induced, so don't be surprised to see some occult gibberish and super zombies, skelletons, etc.  The sheer amount of zombies in this game is incredible. The game loads as you play, so loading screens are very seldom seen. Also, the game is quite playable on bad systems. I think the shooting is fantastic, the smg's feel great and are varied, each gun has its advantages and disadvantages. The snipers feel great, and the x-ray deathcam, while only available in singleplayer, is simply wonderful! I really think this is a good game, but if you're expecting a non-scary breezy game, then I'm sorry to tell you this; this game is actually quite scary and tense at times. The hoarde can be scaled to fit 1-4 people amounts in single player, which I think was added since some of the poor reviews were writte, so look out for that. But the zombies in this game really do get the slip on you, and since they are magical, if you fail to hit the head they will be re-ressurrected! so BE SURE TO GET HEADSHOTS! The ammo is plentiful if you take the time to search every body. The ppsh has the most ammo, and it's quite normal to find 71 rounds for the ppsh on bodies 1 out of 5 times, I'd say.  I really love this game. Get the first one first, though; the second one is kind of different, with its color filters and such. it isn't as realistic in its depiction, so start with this game first and get a feel for the world.  I would give this game 4.5 out of five stars. The .5 is because the game feels simple at times, but hey, I'm a freaking doom fan so that's great to me! So get the game.

            "review_text": "So, you like zombies? Shooting them, I mean.  Well, here's the game for you. It retains the beautiful sniping mechanics of sniper elite with aim adjustment for wind and velocity/distance, you get a satisfying go at popping thousands of zombie heads in gory slow motion (something that you can toggle off in case it ends up boring you after the 4600th kill).  That isn't all you'll be doing, though. Featuring iconic WW2 weaponry with their own benefits and drawbacks, you have plenty of choice when it comes to dealing with the hellish hordes that the führer has summoned. Not everyone is an expert sniper and you can still have a grand old time mowing down the flesheating freaks with a machine gun.  Set at the end of WW2, the nazi war machine is failing and Hitler pursues a desperate method of salvaging his war. An ancient nepalese relic recovered by the Thule society reanimates the slain wehrmacht to devour the enemies of the Reich! It's up to our hero, Karl Fairburne, the great Russian bear of a man Boris Medvedev, Dr. Schweiger and redeemed(?) nazi Herman Wolff to wipe the undead scourge off the streets of Berlin before it spreads to the rest of the continent!  That's it for the plot, really. It's vaugely elaborated upon in the followup Nazi Zombie Army 2 but not by much. If you expect a plot, play something different but it's good for what it is, playing up the nazi occult thing in a way I've only seen the Wolfenstein games explore.  Mechanics wise, it's a third person shooter in which you counter hordes of sluggish zombies (no running here, except for the suicide bombers!) but it's not that easy. Unlike games like left 4 dead, you go down in just a couple of hits and the numbers that spawn in co-op can seem endless at times. But hey, that's what grenades are for!  Single player and multiplayer are pretty much the same deal but with more players come more of a challenge. More enemies will spawn to hinder you and something you thought was a breeze when playing alone can become a nightmare. The levels themselves are largely remade levels from the sniper elite game, approached from different angles and merged in interesting ways. You'll kind of know your way if you played the main game.  Enemy variety includes regular zombies who are just your typical flesh eating monster, groaning and shuffling about as well as quicker moving stripped skeletons who are very good at overwhelming their opposition, forcing stationary snipers to move about.   The previously mentioned suicide bombers appear in the middle of regular zombie hordes to catch you off guard and rush you and sometimes you're faced with eerily cackling zombie snipers, leaping from building to building to take shots at you while you're trying to handle the horde in front.   There's also the trooper zombies who are gigantic, slow moving behemoths with machine guns, shooting right back at you and demanding dozens of shots to the forehead to finally drop.  Finally, there's the occult general. A very rare, scripted boss creature that summons hordes of every variety and protects himself with a magical barrier of floating skulls, encouraging a different kind of headshot.   That's enough about that. Gameplay wise, it's good for what it is. Hardly a captivating masterpiece of storytelling to share with your grandkids someday but an entertaining go through a strange, strange setting.  I don't believe in scores so I rate this game as fun, entertaining but capable of being a lot more than what we're given. Maybe we'll see the formula brought to perfection in sniper elite Afrika's version of the zombie nightmare?",

For the figure from films such as 'Night of the Living Dead', see Zombie (fictional). For the philosophical concept, see Philosophical zombie. For other uses, see Zombie (disambiguation). Page semi-protected Zombie Grouping Legendary creature Sub grouping Undead Similar creatures Revenant Country Caribbean Region The Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa Zombies Overview Zombie Zombie (fictional) Zombie walk Zombies in media Films Films (low-budget) Short films and nominal zombie films Video games Novels v t e Within Haitian religion, zombie (Haitian Creole: zonbi) is an animated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft.[1] Contents [hide]  1 Africa 2 Haiti 3 In popular culture 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading Africa  According to the West African tenets of Vodou, a dead person can be revived by a bokor, or sorcerer. Zombies remain under the control of the bokor since they have no will of their own. 'Zombi' is also another name of the Vodou snake lwa Damballah Wedo, of Niger–Congo origin; it is akin to the Kikongo word nzambi, which means 'god'. There also exists within the West African Vodun tradition the zombi astral, which is a part of the human soul that is captured by a bokor and used to enhance the bokor's power. The zombi astral is typically kept inside a bottle which the bokor can sell to clients for luck, healing or business success. It is believed that after a time God will take the soul back and so the zombi is a temporary spiritual entity.[2] It is also said in vodou legend, that feeding a zombie salt will make it return to the grave. The idea of zombies is present in some South African cultures. In some communities it is believed that a dead person can be turned into a zombie by a small child.[3] It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough sangoma.[4] It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that witches can turn a person into a zombie by killing and possessing the victim's body in order to force it into slave labor.[5] After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers, stories emerged about 'witch trains'. These trains appeared ordinary, but were staffed by zombie workers controlled by a witch. The trains would abduct a person boarding at night, and the person would then either be turned into a zombie worker, or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location.[5] Haiti  In 1937, while researching folklore in Haiti, Zora Neale Hurston encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village, and a family claimed she was Felicia Felix-Mentor, a relative who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29. However, the woman had been examined by a doctor, who found on X-ray that she did not have the leg fracture that Felix-Mentor was known to have had.[6] Hurston pursued rumors that the affected persons were given a powerful psychoactive drug, but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information. She wrote: 'What is more, if science ever gets to the bottom of Voodoo in Haiti and Africa, it will be found that some important medical secrets, still unknown to medical science, give it its power, rather than gestures of ceremony.'[7] Several decades later, Wade Davis, a Harvard ethnobotanist, presented a pharmacological case for zombies in two books, The Serpent and the Rainbow (1985) and Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie (1988). Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream (usually via a wound). The first, coup de poudre (French: 'powder strike'), includes tetrodotoxin (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the pufferfish (order Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of dissociative drugs such as datura. Together, these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of Clairvius Narcisse, who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders, is part of a recently buried child's brain.[8][9][10][verification needed] The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike suspended animation, followed by re-awakening — typically after being buried — into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and psychological trauma was hypothesised by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they 'knew' they were dead, and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect. Davis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep 'zombies' in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.[11] Symptoms of TTX poisoning range from numbness and nausea to paralysis — particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm — unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance. According to psychologist Terence Hines, the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state, and Davis' assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous.[12] Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion, in the context of schizophrenia and other mental illness, suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification.[13] Slaves brought to Haiti in the 17th and 18th centuries, believed that when they died, Baron Samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to heaven, unless they had offended him in some way, such as committing suicide, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie.[14]  Main article: Zombie (fictional)   Participants of a 2009 zombie walk in Moscow As fictional undead creatures, zombies are regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed works. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian Vodun, their links to such folklore are unclear. Many consider George A. Romero's film Night of the Living Dead to be the progenitor of these creatures.[15][16] Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H. P. Lovecraft to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, all drawing on European folklore of the undead. The popularity of zombies in movies has led to them sometimes having been taken out of their usual element of horror and thrown into other genres, for example the comedy film Shaun of the Dead. The 'zombie apocalypse' concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has become a staple of modern popular art. By 2011 the influence of zombies in popular consciousness had reached far enough that the United States government's Center for Disease Control used the idea as a theme to promote disaster preparedness.[17] See also  Anchimayen Draugr Dybbuk Ghoul Golem Hoodoo Jiangshi Mind control Toyol Ro-langs Undead References  Jump up ^ 'Zombie'.

There are a dozen or more zombie games available on steam right now, so is NZA worth buying and playing?   Gameplay:  In a word: Yes. NZA Brings the fun marksmanship-oriented gameplay of Sniper Elite 2 into the grim theater of the zombie apocalypse. Third person shooting action and tense long-range sniper battles with zombie snipers. There are horde-attacks that anyone familiar with zombie games will find familiar and challenging. In addition to the regular zombie engagements and horde defense encounters there are boss fights at the end of the level which are challenging and stress marksmanship, time management and mobility.   Misc:  The Menu system is a bit clunky and probably could be more intuitive, but it works.   Playing the game solo is still fun, but the horde engagements and boss fights are really difficult without someone watching your back. I definitely reccomend grabbing a buddy or three and slogging through this one.  Bottom Line:  If you liked sniper elite 2 and left 4 dead, this game is for you. It goes on sale frequently for sub $10 and I think that If you can pick it up for that price-point it's a no brainer, fans of the genre won't be dissapointed purchasing at full market price.",

            "review_text": "Review ENG/ITA  Little preamble: it's a spinoff of the main series, so you should buy it only for fun, it isn't a masterpiece. It keep the style of Sniper Elite though the story isn't original, it's recommended for fans of Sniper Elite series. Campaign short, few types of enemies, but there will be hordes of zombies which will keep you busy. The main difficulty is knowing how to manage the waves of enemies in little spaces and with few ammo. Good locations and enjoyable soundtrack.  Piccola premessa: è uno spinoff della serie principale, quindi va comprato solo per puro divertimento, non aspettatevi chissà che cosa. Mantiene lo stile di Sniper Elite anche se la trama non è tra le più originali, sono per gli amanti della saga quindi. Campagna abbastanza breve e con poche varietà di nemici, ma presenti spesso in orde che vi terranno impegnati. La difficoltà principale è il saper gestire le ondate di nemici con poche munizioni e in spazi ristretti. Consigliato con i saldi e solo agli amanti della saga. Carine le location e la colonna sonora incalzante.  Vote/Voto: 7/10",

            "review_text": "This game is fun to play solo and is challenging sometimes but with friends and x4 enemies setting is just hilarious, one grenade can kill 26 zombies in row when they are together, and even with more 3 players in game, sometimes you feel that you arent going to make it out of there alive bc the game doesnt stop sending enemies at you (survive the siege being one of the best parts).  They used the Sniper setting very well to build this game using zombies, if you played the SE V2, you will see they used some levels to create this game, using pretty much the same mechanics and the adiction of the Preacher, a double barrel shootgun that have a God damage output, make this even more entertaining and blast to play.",
