            "review_text": "The original Day of the Tentacle was probably the best point-and-click adventure game in the 90s. After playing the remastered version, I'm glad they stayed true to the graphics and controls while improving on them immensely. They also kept the easter egg where you can play Maniac Mansion, which is DOTT's predecessor game released in 1987.  Do yourself a favour: if you've never played the original, be glad that there's a remastered version that improves upon the original in every aspect and get this game!",

            "review_text": "The early 90's were a great time for what we now consider as classic point and click games; the retro pixelated artwork, the high level of difficulty, the need for personal critical thinking and complex problem solving. Some didn't become quite as famous as others, leaving them to fall into the void of cult-classic status, remembered by their appreciative yet relatively small fanbase. Such can be said about Day of the Tentacle, a zany point and click adventure game from LucasArts from 1993, now Remastered with smooth high-definition art and sound thanks to Double Fine Productions.  For those who're already familiar with the game, I'll go ahead and start out with the Remastered stuff. The artwork is all hand-drawn; it looks fantastic, and it's very smooth. The color is extremely vibrant, and the gradients transition so much better thanks to how far technology has come within the last two-plus decades. Not to mention the wonderful use of lighting and angles that really make the artwork stand out above many other point and click games. The interface has also been updated to modern standards, and it's much more user-friendly than the old one. You have the option to transition from the original graphics, and sound, to the Remastered ones all throughout the game; one can even mix and match if they so desire, old graphics/new sounds or new graphics/old sounds. There's also a developer commentary available to those who're interested, and bonus content in the main menu. It's an incredibly solid Remaster, in functionality, performance, and design. I noticed that some people in the review section had problems with the audio, such as stuttering or other characters voices playing. I believe that the last patch, noted as June 1st, 2016, took care of these problems as I didn't experience any audio issues whatsoever.   Day of the Tentacle is a sequel to another highly favorable point and click LucasArts game, Maniac Mansion. At the start of the game a scene occurs where two Tentacles, Green and Purple, are standing beside a radiated river. Purple Tentacle decides to take a sip of the toxic sludge coming out from the sewers, and he begins to mutate; a mutation so inconceivable and horrific at that... he grows... arms. In his new superior form, Purple Tentacle turns into an evil genius and begins scheming to have his army of Tentacles to take over the world. One of the main characters, Bernard, is friends with Green Tentacle, who lets Bernard know of Purple Tentacle's intents. Bernard gathers his two best friends, Hoagie and Laverne, in an effort to stop the evil plot.  What follows are events of wacky cartoon mayhem and eccentric wit. The dialogue and actions of the characters are absolutely hilarious, garnering more than a few laugh-out-loud moments from me personally; which I must say is hard to achieve, I'm more of a chuckler/internal laugher. Bernard is your typical know-it-all nerd, Hoagie is a heavy metal roadie, and Laverne is just out of her mind. You'll even get to interact with the founding fathers quite a bit, and the Tentacles are as memorable as they are priceless. Beyond question, it's an adventure that you really must seek for yourself.  Probably the only downfall that one could find about Day of the Tentacle are some of its nonsensical puzzle solutions. This again stems from the 90's era of point and click gameplay, though, and it's to be expected from a title that originally launched so long ago. A guide is highly recommended, as the game really is extremely cryptic with some of its puzzles. There are also dialogue conundrums that can sometimes only be solved by performing an event and then going to talk to the person again. However, some people still like their games mystifying and complex, so if you're one of those self-punishing loonies, you'll absolutely enjoy this game in its entirety.  Whether or not you played Day of the Tentacle back in 1993, you'll absolutely love this absurd, unpredictable, humorous experience. It's one of those classic games that are up there with Grim Fandago in the 'you shouldn't miss this' category. Double Fine Productions have done a bang-up job on this Remaster, and they've presented in a way that lets the original design shine through, while also making it obvious that the remake was crafted by them; if only all recent remastered editions were this good. While $16.99 CAD is pretty steep for a 4 hour adventure, grabbing this game on sale for half off is a great idea.   Rating:  5.0/5.0  - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.",

So now it is back finally on Steam where you can play in HD graphics and high quality sound, you can still switch between the old version as well! (in any time of the game with the F1 button)  Hope to see more of these titles get a remasterd version.  Just a small list of what i like specific: -Decent price in the store -Hardly any bugs -Like many adventure games not to much system requirements -Just like the old -Cool option to switch between the new and old version (at any time of the game) -Some fun extras like commentary, concept art etc. -And of course can be runned on any modern machine at any place because of Steam ",

            "review_text": "So one of my all-time favourite games got a remastered edition. Is the return to a vectorized mansion worth it, for beginners and fans?  The story: You have to save the world from evil purple tentacle - as three different characters. However, while using time machines two of the group get stranded in the past and future by accident and they have to return to present first.  The original game from 1993 can be called one of the best adventure games ever made. It combined wonderful cartoonish graphics, great puzzles, loveable funny characters, wonderful music, a lot of humour and an amusing time travel story into one.  The reboot does pretty much the same thing. To be honest: Hardly anything has changed. There is no 'Wow!' effect like in other remakes like 'Ducktales Remastered'. However, I am going to point out the differences...  The first change you notice is - of course - the graphics, now sharp and vectorized. This really looks great and makes the game look a bit more cartoonish without taking away the charme of the original graphics. Also the music and sound effects seemed to have a little make-over.  The voices are the same as in the original, so there is no re-recording.  But do the changes please you? As I said, the vectorized graphics are very fine. But when it comes to the sound effects I wished there was a bit more effort put into it. They seem to be selected lazily out of a small sound library. For instance: The same sound effect is used for a reception bell and a ray gun. In some sequences random cartoon sound effects, if they fit at all or not, were put in. You may find this funny but I felt that this could be done better and more careful. Also, in sequences when characters laugh or scream there's still silence which is weird in a remake/reboot. But that's nitpicking, to be honest.  The gameplay is fine and easy enough. The difference is that there's no text field at the bottom with verbs anymore ('Use', 'Look', 'Talk to'...). Instead you can either use the keyboard or mouse (or both) to control the game. A click on something/somebody with the right mouse button for example shows you the actions you can do here. A pop up menu at the bottom shows you your intenvory and the other characters (time periods) to switch to.  The other differences is the bonus material: an audio commentary track starring the makers of the game (like Tim Schafer), the option to switch to original/remastered graphics, beautiful concept art from 1992, 58 achievements and Steam trading cards. They are all nice and if you play through the game you should get most of the achievements since they're often connected to puzzles you have to solve anyway.   Since I am German and there are probably other German-speaking users reading this: There's also the option to change to a German audio track. However, personally I prefer the English one. The German has some good chosen voices but others just don't fit, for instance Bernard (the voice actor sounds way too handsome and uninterested as Bernard, sorry). Also I'm not quite satisfied with the German subtitles. They seem to be just wrong sometimes like the translator wasn't paying attention. Here are some examples: 'awesome' -&gt; 'schrecklich' (terrible) 'sushi platter' -&gt; 'Sushi-Teig' (sushi batter) 'beef jerky' -&gt; 'Bonbons' (candies) 'That's gross!' -&gt; 'Das ist toll!' (That's great!) So if you're German and can at least understand the English audio track then you are definitely on the inside track.  So, does 'Day of the Tentacle Remastered' pay off?  I say: Yes. It's still damn funny and entertaining, a heartwarming return to the mansion. If you are a fan already you will certainly feel the same and also discover the bonus material and try to get all achievements. If you have never experienced 'DOTT' this is a great opportunity to try out this classic that has aged very well (including the prequel 'Maniac Mansion' from 1987 which can be played inside this game!). But prepare for some sophisticated puzzles which force you to think laterally pretty much all the time. However, it's not frustrating and lots of puzzles themselves were designed in a funny way, too.  Grab your Chron-O-John and have a good time! Or three.",

            "review_text": "I have very fond memories about Day of the Tentacle (DotT), back in the DOS days, Lucasarts was my favourite games company, their adventures were the best and their Star Wars games are pretty legendary in their own right. DotT is one of those games that was released when PC gained its status as superiour gaming platform. All previous adventures games still got released on multiple platforms (think Amiga etc), but not this one. It was also released on CDROM and the whole game features voice acting, pretty big deal back in the day.  And so, with rose tinted glasses I started playing this game, would it still be as good as I remembered it? Or would it turn out to be one of those classics that didn't age well, like a fine wine turning into vinegar. Well I can assure you, that none of the magic is lost. The game is still very much fun today, everything still stands, it only lost some of its freshness, but that was to be expected as it's a remaster that stays 100% faithfull to the original.  I'm also very happy that they did not change any of the graphics. When I learned that the Monkey Island series were rereleased, I was excited. Until I saw it at a friend of mine, that is when disappointment set in. They changed the graphics and the new graphics just didn't do it for me, in fact they were a big turn-off. If you never played the game before, you probably would have no issue with it, but the problem for me was that they changed too much. You could still play the original graphics, but what is the point of that? You could just as easily use ScummVM then. This is not the case with DotT, the graphics have been retained. To be honest, the graphics had been retained as how I remembered them. There is a big difference, how we remember things is not how they really were, it's just our minds that make the memory more beautiful than it really is. In this case the remastered graphics just look like the originals with 100x Anti-Aliasing applied on them.  I was able to quickly finish the game as I still remembered a lot and the things i forgot were quickly figured out. You should not read any guides, as this will increase the enjoyment of an adventure game, the whole point is to figure these things out after all.  This game had a big impact on me as a youngster, I forgot how many things in the game I picked up in my vocabulairy and still use, though i completely forgot where they came from - this game!  Take this as you will, some guy has fond memories of an old game, the remastered version of said game is also liked by him. Does this mean it's a great game or that the guy is senile? That's up for you to decide when you're GOING BACK TO THE MANSION!  The game works flawlessly on SteamOS/Linux, the default Steam Controller setup is a bit weird, but ofcourse you can change it to your liking. Streams to the Steam Link without problems (great way to play the game btw).",

            "review_text": "I've played through this game about 5 times since the 90s and I've always really enjoyed it. The voice acting, humour and original art style were always delightful. The puzzles are mostly logical and it strikes and maintains a good balance of being challenging but not frustrating (there are no puzzles that come to mind that made me mad once I figured out the solution).  The update is mostly excellent, with clearer audio, and remastered music, as well as an old-style/new-style hotkey to toggle between the two (much like the Monkey Island SE games). All the original visuals and audio are still accessible this way. I flipped back a few times to watch certain animations throughout the game. For those familiar with the original, you may notice a few changes in the sound effects - nothing major, but you can get accustomed to the sound of tentacle suckers on the ground and overweight hotel guests falling off beds so it could be marginally jarring for purists in that respect.  The new verb wheel frees up a lot of screen space and, once you get used to it, works well. I slightly prefer the verb coin of Full Throttle/CoMI or the 'click through' style from Sam &amp; Max, and the DotT's new one can get a little busy, but it's really not a detractor from the experience.  My only actual gripe (and it's a minor one) is with the new visuals. The classic LucasArts pixelated style was amazing at the time but this update could be considered *too faithful* in some respects. Things sometimes feel a little too simple - we have higher definition, but we really just get smoother lines with very little in the way of increased detail. This is especially noticeable on the main characters (as opposed to the backgrounds), which feel a little 'traced' at times and almost lose something stylistically from what the limited original artwork implied. This approach is understandable considering the exactness of the graphics toggle feature and the new artwork essentially being an overlay. While it was offputting at the very beginning, this became less of a concern as time went on and I got back into the story.  It's very hard to make a great game bad and, with this update, I can't say that's the case. It's extremely faithful to the original and still thoroughly lovable. There aren't too many games that have such well-written comedy and so few advenures where you seldom feel like you're doing busywork to fill time.  All-in-all, I'd strongly recommend this title as solid nostalgia for veterans or a hilarious new experience for the uninitiated. I'm extremely glad that this title has been brought up to modern standards so all its excellent qualities can be enjoyed by a younger generation (and not be lost to those who would have balked at the original, now 'retro', graphics). It really, really holds up, by any standards. ",

The game plays fine, the new graphics are nice, though the old ones are rendered *better* by scummvm than this game... no point in filtering them I guess since there is better anyway.  I tried the new wheel thing, but it didn't feel right to me, especially with having to send items to other characters all the time, so I kept the old trusted bar instead,  The game is still DOTT, nothing changed about it, the intro even still has Lucas Arts instead of Double Fine, which makes me wonder how much work they really *improved* in this. It would have been nice to get some form of new content similarly to Broken Sword DC.  My main issue (which has nothing to do with the devs) is that I remember pretty much everything, so it took me about 3 hours to finish. I wish I didn't remember most of the solutions but I do :/ I guess I replayed it on scummvm too often :)  Overall, I still love DOTT, but it's not that much better than on scummvm...  Recommendation: - If you've never played DOTT before, this is very very fine! - If you have the original DOTT, get this on sale or stick to scummvm.",

It's a classic case of 'figure out what the designer wants you to do' -- down to the fiddly details of exactly what order you click on the relevant objects.  (puzzle spoiler in next paragraph)  For example, at one point I needed to wake someone up by giving them coffee. I had coffee, but they were asleep, so I needed to use a funnel to make sure I didn't spill it. (Already absurd.) So I 'use' the coffee 'with' the funnel and I'm told 'I can't do that, I might spill it.' ... Okay, I guess I'm not doing this right? Nope! Needed to use the funnel on the guy first, then use the coffee on the funnel.  (end spoiler)  If you're yearning for a classic, give this a go, I guess. Otherwise skip it.",

If you played the game back in the early 90ish then it is worth to play it again for nostalgic and reasons to that they made games back then that they can not today, if new to games from that period I would recommend it as well as it stand out and is a very original and amazing game, though some of the jokes and the likes remain from the 90ish and before either way it is an experience.  I will have to give it 10 out of 10 stars for keeping it original, being able to play it oldschool as well as a more modern port to it so one has a choice as well as a crazy universe that only LA could do back in the day and to point out that most games today really has no edge to competete with what games used to be.",

All I can say is 'Thank god for the option to play it like it was intended'.  These were my major issues and it seems to me that the things I wanted just wasnt there in this remake. To bring some perspective to the issues I mentioned I might add that I absolutely adored the remakes of Monkey Island, especially the graphics and the sound (not the interface). This remake is another beast however.  DotT is however still one of the best adventure games around so Im gonna give it a thumbs up nonetheless. The final judgement is however based on the original (and I do own the original in a box), nothing in this so called 'remake effort' would get a thumbs up from me.",

The game is very beautifully crafted and if I could shake Tim Schafer's hand and tell him that I would.   Manaic Mansion was one of those games on the NES that I loved dearly and to hear that this was the sequel to it made it all the better. This game had charm, and tentacles. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the fact that it had to end.
