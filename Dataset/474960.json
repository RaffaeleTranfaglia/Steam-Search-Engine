            "review_text": "Many games try to capture the essence of TV shows or films in their cutscenes, but until Quantum Break none has actually attempted to fuse the two.  like Max Payne, hinges on a time-manipulation mechanic. The biggest problem is that it fails to satisfyingly fuse the (optional) 20-minute TV show episodes that separate each gaming chapter with the gameplay itself.  While it promises to give you control over the direction of the TV show storyline – which features X-Men star Shawn Ashmore and Game of Thrones’ Aidan Gillen – it soon becomes apparent that the choices you make while playing have only a superficial effect.  The game itself looks a treat, with crazy slow motion effects and reality warping moves to use against aggressors, but it doesn’t always play well.  A cover system that forces you away from protection to take potshots is always going to frustrate, while imprecise movement controls make platforming areas – even those that cleverly require time manipulation to clear a viable path – a chore.  Overhall, the game is great, the story awesome.  Pass - Recommended, nice work Remedy!",

            "review_text": "Great game. At the beginning I was expecting something more like interactive movie. But after first few hours it turned to be a fantastic experience. Game has very good scenario, and connecting it with some movie cuts along with good acting makes it a voyage thorugh some exceptional history. Although If You're familiar to some advanced physics, even at the fundamental level, there will be sometimes moments, when You would have to close Your eyes, not listen, only move forward, and not think to much about possibility of some events to happen.  Nevertheless, the writers' knowledge about the time and some it features is good enough and lets the game scenario to keep its integrity.  Graphics, sound, characters are unquestionably on a high level. I had great fun watching main characters animated like and voice acted by actors from the TV show. I like Aidan Gillen very much and his character Paul Serene was amazing. Such details makes sometimes a game or a movie unique.  Gameplay was exceptional too. Tons of fights, great main character abilities, driven into history very well. There even some small RPG aspects in case of Your character build. You have always at least two or three ways of getting out of problems, defeting the enemies and even if Your actual tactics doesn't fit to the new ones, You can easly, intuitively adapt and without horrible continous repeats You can dive immiediately into the battle and find Yourseld winning.  Fighting is very very good.  All in all I would judge the game in my personal rating as 8 points at 10 possible, give its some award, distinction for concept, scenario and gameplay and to be honest and to cool some things down I would say the the main drawback of this game is its length. But we all know that despite my first words this kind of game is supposed to be rather closer to an interactive action performance, but maybe this is why that part of its character can be forgiven.",

            "review_text": "When i see Quantum Break first, i got so hyped on it. When i suddenly see QB in Steam, i just couldn't wait, didn't check the reviews and bought it. Am i regret ? Hell no.   If you want a quick-action game with a good story, it means that you are looking for the Quantum Break. The action in this game is so satiated, scenario is interesting and riveting. As you know, story is about time-traveling and its effects. In this branch, QB is one of the best productions ever made. Actors and actressess are really successful. Especially, our main character's (Jack Joyce) reactions in the game or in cinematics are very realistic and sincere. I liked all characters in the game, but sometimes Jack Joyce can be very insensitive. But i'm sure you are going to like him and get used to him easily. Cinematics and graphics are so good, sometimes you feel like you are watching a Hollywood Action film. Speaking of film, as you probably know the game is processing with a mini TV series. Game has 5 acts, and at every acts's ending (except act 5), you are watchig a epiosde. You don't have to, of course but trust me, you should. It has a important place in the story. But are the episodes good ? I'm afraid they are not. Episodes are about 30 minutes but except the last episode, you feel like they are 60 minutes. As i said, Quantum Break has a exciting action and a riveting storyline. But the tv series are sabotaging your game enjoyment. The idea is pretty cool, but in the production... I'm afraid it is not good enough. In the tv series, we see lots of characters that we have never seen in the game. But of course it has some good points. For example at the end of every act, we are deciding about something important about the story. And the episodes are taking form from the choices we made. Even, a little thing that we do in the game, can effect the tv series. In that way, TV-Series sometimes can be good.  Let's talk about the best thing about Quantum Break. Action.  Our character, Jack Joyce can control the time. Because of that, he has lost of superpowers about time. We can create a time explosion, a time shield, a time loop. Or he can slow the time so that makes him move like The Flash. And those superpowers are making the conflicts very enjoyful. The enemies are not easy to kill, and so do we. I finished the game in normal difficulty but i died 2 or 3 times. The AI can be idiot sometimes, but it is good enough in the throughout of the game. There are 3 main problems in the action.  1-) There is not blindshot. In my opinion, in this covering system, and the action speed, blindshot is necessary. As i remember, in the first gameplay of the QB there was blindshot. I wonder why did they took it out. 2-) I'm afraid variety of the guns are not enough. We can carry 3 type of gun. Shotgun/LMG, Assault/SMG, and pistol. And the variety in these types, is not further than 2 or 3.  3-) Some of the animations are have problems. Like jumping, running or covering animations can be problem sometimes. I saw that our character couldn't reach a wall. The wall was shorter than him.  In a nutshell, Quantum Break is one of the best action games in recent. It is providing a good story. So, why are you waiting ?  (+) - Satiated action. - Riveting story. - Very good graphics. - Nice soundtrack. - Superpowers during the action. - Celebrities like Aidan Gillen, Shawn Ashmore and Dominic Monaghan.  (-) - It is about 8-11 hours. A very short game. - Some problems in gameplay. - And the inability of TV Series in the game.  Overall point: %82",

            "review_text": "As I've only completed Act 1 and the first live action episode, this will be more of an impressions write-up than review.   I'm one of the people who never played the game in any capacity because I've never cared for Xbox and I steered clear of Windows 10 for subjective reasons. However, Remedy's reputation is well known and that interested me in the game before I saw pieces of gameplay footage. Having completed the first act, I feel the game may have been a bit harshly judged in the past. I'm not referring to the Windows 10 version problems either - those are perfectly legitimate. The original PC problems aside though, I find the gameplay to be more fluid than I'd expected and just plain fun. Sure the aiming could be a bit more responsive and the enemies could take less bullets to actually dispatch, but the addition of the time abilities really help push this game from standard TPS fare to something slightly more unique and attention-grabbing.   I'm playing on hard with aim assist and time powers assist off, just to put that out there if it makes a difference to anyone. I'm not really going to touch on performance yet as I've only just gotten out of the first area, but I can say that my performance has been pretty smooth throughout. I run a 980 Ti SC (EVGA), 32 GBs of DDR3 RAM (Amazon mistakenly gave me extra once and let me keep it), and an i5-4460 (product of age - the rig was originally built way before the 980 Ti came out). My game settings are a mix of high/ultra, most notably upscaling is OFF and Global Illumination and Reflections are set to Medium. I get mostly 60fps during actual gameplay and that's even in all the gunfights during the first act. I have no problems with the performance as of yet.   Finally, the live action show. I actually found the first episode pretty enjoyable. Let's get it out of the way that it is in no way a high budget production, but the actors are quality and it's not low budget to the point of being laughable. Hell, I even found myself liking some of the other characters more after watching the first episode. I think it will be an interesting experience playing through the game and watching the show as my choices affect different things, but that's just how I feel at this moment.   In short, I don't regret my purchase and I do recommend others trying this game out if you've never played it as well.",

Gorgeous graphics, sound design, gameplay and a well executed story that will keep you on edge throughout this seamless blend of a live action TV show and gameplay. Definitely worth replaying to see how the gameplay/story would evolve if I'd made different choices throughout the game, apparently in-total there are 40 different scenarios.  Originally I was hesitant to get this game, the reviews seemed average at best and performance wasn't looking good. I'm happy to say I had a blast with this game, kept me playing for hours on end, which most games can rarely do. The Steam (DX11) version also see run around 10fps higher than the Windows Store (DX12) versions, and as far as I can tell from comparison screenshots, there's virtually no-difference.  The game also supports 21:9, certain cutscenes/scenes are 16:9 but the gameplay does support 21:9  In this timeline, I highly recommend Quantum Break.",

The gameplay is good, but the level design and the enemies lack any creativity which makes the game feel very repititive. The port is not very good in my opinion, I wasn't able to run the game on native 1080p (the game has an upscaling option) and the game itself stutters quite often and has noticable screen tearing at times. The game is also very short and lacks any sort of replayability.  6/10 overall",

When I first heard that Remedy were integrating a live action show into the game, I thought that sounded dumb, they could never pull it off. But after playing it, I think it turned out pretty good. It provides a lot of depth and development to the other characters in the game.  The story is fantastic and I've come to expect nothing less from Remedy. It's genuinely intriguing, and the characters are all very well written.  The main complaint I see about this game is the combat, and the optimization. I thought the combat was good enough, Although, 3rd person cover shooters will never really get rave reviews about having engaging combat systems, so whatever. Once you were fully powered up, near the end of the game, and you've built up some experience with the different abilities, it actually becomes pretty fun.  The game ran perfectly fine for me on my 980 ti. People are saying this is a horrible port but everything worked fine for me.  Overall this was a great game and I'm so glad they released a Steam/DX11 version. I will hold out from supporting Windows Store and UWP for as long as I possibly can!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: I loved Quantum Break. And I care to elaborate why. I will try to keep my ramblings structured for those who might be interested in reading through them.  The Story.  Remedy are storytellers, that's for sure. We have seen them do the whole 'blockbuster-story-driven-action-game' thing before, and it was quite good actually. What they have done here sure is next level.  It is not that easy to come up with a good time travel story, some of us might remember 'Looper' being a huge pile of poop on that accord. Quantum Break, does it right. This is the kind of sci-fi that earned the 'sci' part. No plot holes, no absurd decisions. Each and every turn, twist and action is reasoned either directly, or indirectly.  And this is where I can see the main weakness of Quantum Break. In order to fully grasp the whole thing you will have to do a considerable amount of reading and/or listening. You will dig through private e-mails in order to find out background and motivation for most of characters both major and minor. You will collect things in order to unlock diaries of main characters in order to see things from their perspective. Now why is this a weak point of Quantum Break, you might ask? Because the whole running around reading e-mails and collecting documents does not add well to the atmosphere of the game. The world is ending. Predesignated chain of events is about to explode in our faces with a calamity that is hard to fully comprehend. But yet we are standing here, in a cubicle of the research facility, digging through some chick's inbox, in order to get why exactly that other dude was important. Subjectively, I cannot say that it was a chore or something, because almost all collectibles sit there in the open - but I really can see how this can be frustrating for some people.  Then again, some will claim it to be short - but playing it on Hard, trying to get all of the story will take you roughly 10 to 12 hours. That's pretty much what you can expect from a story-driven game.   The Action.  Gameplay breaks down to progression to the mission objective, methodically clearing up enemy squads. Sometimes you will have to use your time-bending powers in order to proceed, and it feels really intuitive. I really like that all your skills are equally used in order to solve temporal (pun intended) problems that will hinder your progression as well as to get an upper-hand in firefights. Quantum Break is not a great shooter. Do yourself a favor and play it on Hard. Otherwise, some shootouts might feel a bit casual. To be perfectly frank, I did not enjoy the shooter part until the first action sequence where your enemies can operate in the 'Stutter'. The 'stutter' is a consequence of the incident, during which the time around you 'breaks' and either stops altogether, or erratically goes back and forth. This looks mind-blowing. Things around you crash repeatedly while you are fighting with enemies who are, to a lesser extend than you, able to manipulate time. The game will push you into using your time-bending abilities as an addition to the gunplay and all that actually looks natural and engaging.  The Presentation.  It is not that easy to mash up a game with live action series, or at least it is not seen before. Remedy managed to spend each dollar from the MS paycheck in order to do that. Series itself looks better, than certain TV shows and as a mean to tell a story of Quantum Break they serve just right. In order to further blur the line between QB the Game and QB the Show, facial recognition was used and as a result we have top-notch face animations of the characters. This helps to better relate to them and also makes transitions from cutscenes into gameplay fluid and natural. Soundtrack is rather brilliant too. The glitchy tunes during stutters and firefights really add up to the atmosphere. Just like it was with Petri Alanko's score to Alan Wake, I will probably pick up soundtrack for future listening.  Interface is slick and informative, albeit minimalistic. I tried playing the game with mouse+keyboard, but it felt a bit awkward due to mouse acceleration, and instead of fiddling around with settings I just hooked up the controller. Plays really great with it.  The Optimization.  This is where the most will find the second weakness of Quantum Break. Steam version runs with DX11 and seems to run better, than the DX12 one, but still the game is very demanding to your hardware. I had to tinker around to get the most juice out of my 3GB 7950 (which is, actually, lower than the minimal requirements) but all in all I was able to run the game in 1080p with high/medium settings. It runs smooth, and steadily above 30FPS and it looks great. Sure it can look better, but that would require serious hardware upgrade which I am not ready for yet. I had no issues with glitches, crashes, FPS spikes or anything else. But if you have a half-decent PC and is used to run everything on ultra, you will probably be disappointed. Not sure actually if it is a mean of future-proofing or really is a result of a poor optimization - but yeah, you need some serious hardware to get the most from what Quantum Break can offer graphically.  The Verdict.   I loved it. I loved all of it. I have been waiting for it ever since Remedy announce, and just like a lot of you I was disappointed that it is not AW2. Just like some of you I was disappointed that it was promoted as XBOX One exclusive. Just like some of you I was disappointed that after that it was Win 10-only. But ever since it was announced to come to Steam, I was pumped. I sure hoped that Remedy will deliver. And for me, Quantum Break is a rare case of high hopes justified.",

That being said here's the real reason why I recommend this game.  I feel that this game is a pioneer of future storytelling. The mo-cap in this game is so spot on, every character feels like an actual person and at times you feel as if you are inside of a movie more than playing a game. In between acts are mini-movies about 20 minutes long, altered ever so slightly by your choices in the game. QB is one of the most absorbing experiences I have had with a game. The story felt a perfect length, not too short and not too long. My only beef is that the ending leaves much to be desired.  Calling this a game is an understatement.

            "review_text": "AN OUTSTANDING MASTERPIECE!!!   Quantum Break proves time can stand still and be enjoyable on every level!  I fail to understand why so many people out there falsely claim that this game is terrible, too short, and easy. So let me set the record straight and tell you it's not. It's definitely way better than that and well worth the current price!   I think a lot claim this because of the time-based power to combat ratio and this game balances it quite well. You really can't compare it to any other game out there since it brings everything to a whole new level of awesomeness! After all playing with time-based power in my opinion is the greatest thing ever! I've played a ton of time-based games with time powers and this is by far the best no doubts!  I've played through the game some it's absolutely beautifully fun and interesting game that goes above and beyond what you'd ever expect since it's trying to break the rules of games and it does the job quite well!  In a sense it's almost like Max Payne meets Timeshift and they had a baby but with totally different story being born that really draws you into the bigger picture of the past, present, and future of the game while gaining some epic time-based skills with killer moves that are riot to play with especially if you like crazy-stuff happening and some environmental destruction!  It's even quite challenging on Normal since I've died countless times and let me tell you that I'm never too fond of many games if I don't feel challenged somewhat. I enjoy a good tough ride and this certainly brings it through the entire game while playing it so it definitely isn't 'too easy' as claimed and you're in for a real ride of your life!  Another thing I really love about the game is the graphics are just beatiful to look at while playing. There's also a choice-consequence system so you could realistically play through one way then try playing through another which makes it a bit more interesting to extend the game's lifespan.  On top of that they do a mix of game + movie which is something I really haven't seen before that I like to tell the story more in-depth. You'll play for an act then it'll play out on a tv show to watch more then you'll go back into the game for another act and it really helps build the story.   If anything I kinda wish they would've made it purely a game since that would have extended the gametime you're playing but hey it's still awesome enough that I was very happy with what they gave me and I mainly think the devs wanted to make it a bit different from your other run-of-the-mill games out there.  Lastly, as far as bugs go I haven't really noticed any major issues other than a few minor occasional animation problems though it plays fine, nothing affecting game play on my end with no lag so far and I'm pretty far into the game. Also, the graphics settings on high seem more like medium for some reason and I think that could do better but it's still amazing to look at for sure.  But, anyways either way you have it good or bad this game goes above and beyond and highly recommend it since it's just fantastic and you certainly won't be disappointed at all! :) BUY IT NOW or when it goes on sale for sure! You'll love it!",

It feels like they had a lot of plans that just never panned out. That aside the game was a great play, I binged it over two play sessions. If you have cash to burn and the hardware to run it, I'd definately put it in a must experience category. If your looking for a game with a little more longevity, you might want to look elsewhere.

Kinda like The Last of Us in the sense that you go to Point B from Point A, wherein Point B is the quest.  And there are scripted enemy spawns at certain parts, which you'll immediately recognize because of the way the stage is set up, and because the main character could detect explosive barrels, ammo refill stations and guns lying around.  There is a stealth element but you would almost always break cover to complete a task. You're just gonna need it to position yourself correctly. There's also an enemy line-of-sight mechanic. And an ability upgrade scheme.  There are narrative objects that you can read or look at to have a better feel of the story. But the number of content is almost overkill. It's optional, but the amount of help that it can do is almost nil, aside from feeding you more relevant but technically useless stuff to work with. Honestly, it felt like a chore, because there's no motive to do it, aside from bragging rights.  Replay value gameplay-wise is almost non-existent. Technically, there's no new game plus, and if you explore diligently, you get all powers and collectibles within one playthrough. The only reason you'd replay the game is to see what happens if you picked the other choice   (and there are a total of 5 choices)  .   The show thing is cool tho. It's the first time I've seen a game incorporate your choices into a show.

The only thing that is good from this game,is the story and the Graphics. when it comes to gameplay mechanics,This game is a shame.it's a big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mistake.  First,We don't have manual cover system,yeah,it's automatically enter a cover only if you are close to a wall which is suck for me,above all of that,there's no crouch or stealth button.omg and also,the bulled spread and the recoil of the gun is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  what's wrong with the dev?is it really hard to create such a features like that&gt;? Max Payne 3 is much better than this. This game shouldn't exist.it's a total shame to game industry.",

Everyone who enjoys story-driven shooters should play it at least once, though if you're unsure you should just wait for a discount.   The live series was an interesting experiment, but it falls short due to inconsistent acting and flawed camerawork. I appreciate them trying though and the main actors did quite well. It has some good moments to make it worthwhile, but you'll probably skip it during a second playthrough.  + Cool time powers + Solid shooting + Interesting story and characters + Impressive graphics and setting +/- Mediocre show is a respectable effort with a few highlights, but it doesn't add much to the experience. - Collecting skill orbs just breaks up the flow of the game. It would be better without them - Could use some more gameplay variety (stealth takedowns, vehicle section, more varied weapons would be nice) - Minor annoyances such as glitches, optimization imperfections, game file size, live show only streamable",

The gameplay adds a pretty unique twist to the usual shooter.   The first 'cutscene' that I encountered (really a 20 minute episode) was quite annoying, more because I wasn't expecting it and I was about to wrap up for the night. After that, and forewarned with this expectation, I rather enjoyed the remaining episodes between acts.   The character models are really detailed, and whilst not perfect, they are really approaching a new level of realism.   There are a few slightly annoying bugs and jitters here and there, but these are certainly not game-stopping.  On the whole, very enjoyable, and recommended.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to give QB my unhesitating thumbs up, but I can't.  Maybe you can make up your mind whether the game is for you by reading my two cents.  QB is an action game and narrative-driven. You play some levels, make some heavy decisions, then get to see a live-action episode before the next Act begins. Here's what I thought:  Technology: I played on a Windows 7, with a core i7. a GTX 980 and 12 GB RAM. I put it on ultra preset and then moved a couple of the detail sliders higher, and I think the lowest my frames ever went were 50 fps. The game played flawlessly for me. It did not crash at all and I had a smooth ride all the way through.   Presentation: Very slick. Like a television production. Well directed, well-written, well-acted. Very immersive. The live action episodes were lengthy, too- 20-30 minutes each. Very well done.  Story: Nicely told, gripping, interesting characters. The story itself was interesting, and, for one involving time travel, not puzzling or brain-draining. The only error the writers committed was not wrapping everything up into a satisfying package at the end. They obviously wanted to leave a sequel on the table, but there are good ways to do that while *still* providing a satisfying ending to the present tale, and unfortunately they failed here. It's one of the 'you'll have just as many questions at the end as you have at the beginning' sort of deals.  Action level design: Very straight-forward. Very linear. You have no choice about how to proceed through the levels. You have cool powers, but you get to use them only when the designers want you to. That sort of thing. You do get to choose the order you upgrade your powers. The upgrades are generous, and you will get all of them by the end, if you want. Normal difficulty level will not be very challenging for the experienced gamer.  Collectibles: All optional, but all contribute to the narrative. Much won't be explained unless you interact with the collectibles: text, video, audio, it's all there. Game voiceovers from chracters, too, about the content.   So why do I hesitate to recommend this game? Because of the last part of the last act. It is extremely poorly designed, to the point that it sticks out like a sore thumb and threatens to ruin the experience. It is frustratingly hard, totally breaks the immersion of the story from having to retry it over and over, and even after you know what to do, isn't any fun. It was *massively disappointing* because the rest of the game was so engrossing. Do yourself a favor, and if you get the game, when you get to the very end... prepare for frustration and maybe go read an article about that part, then go try it. I wish I had-- but I was afraid of spoilers. Believe me, when you get to that point, there's nothing left to spoil. Just go read about that part and then return to the game, and you'll save yourself a lot of frustration.  So I guess I will recommend the game after all, even with the ugly wart on its nose. The rest of the face is joy.",

The time abilities are great, and are for the most part very effective. I did find that some abilities didn't function like they shouild every time, like the attack durring the dash. Not sure why, but this didn't always trigger for me. My first play through took 18 hours, but I found almost everything during the first run. In most parts of the game, it will just wait for you to find everything even though the NPC is urging you to 'hurry up'. I took the   'Hardline'   approach the first time through, and plan to play through again choosing the other route to see what differences there are. Deffinitely an original title with a great story and excellent game play. Recommended!!",

The game feels like it was made by someone trying to make a new show for the space channel and someone trying to make a half ♥♥♥♥♥ third person shooter with some zany time elements. Overall it kinda just makes me wanna play other games, like Max Payne or even just some good old tomb raider. Its lack of actual enjoyable gameplay shows when you are using your powers. You get a few that are great but I found myself using only one of them and it wasn't even that good. Also the guns feel like toys, I played on normal difficulty and enemies just soaked up so many hits, even when shot in the head. This game also has the invincible enemies, so a mechanic in the game stops time for all enemies unless they are weraring special gear, but when this happens they are the only enemies that can be shot and killed. Overall the game made me just feel like I wanted more game from it and less TV show. Each level is broken up by an act that is in itself broken up by a 22 minute episode of a show. Which just makes the whole TV show feel even worse and pulled my out of the experience due to the fact that the cutsences looked different from the game due to the actors being real and not animated. But with my final note I will say that choosing actual pretty decent actors was the best choice and it did somewhat sell the terrible story. But if I am going to say it, no dont get this game, play it at a friends place or even just watch a lets play. Cause Quantum Break is not worth the money.",
