            "review_text": "Oh man, this is a blast to play! It's twin-stick shooter old-school arcade heaven! If you're old enough to remember Robotron 2084 then you'll be right at home here, and if you're familiar with the gameplay of stuff like Geometry Wars, Waves, etc., then you'll enjoy this too.   The mechanics are dirt simple, -you move around the arena and you shoot everything. Dead enemies leave 'money' which can be spent on upgrades and weaponry to boost your performance. Money doesn't come quickly though so it takes a long time to fully upgrade things and you'll never get all the power ups possible. Boss battles come into play but the main thrust is you are constantly mobbed from all sides and have to dodge your way through fusillades that while tough aren't as bad as 'bullet hell' games.   Layered overtop of this is delicious pixel visuals that are snazzied up with great special effects not seen in the old arcades. Play this in a dark room with some pizza and a soda for the arcade experience. OOoohhh.   Only complaint is the intensity never really escalates to a frenzied level, so it's quite possible to play for a long time and feel like you're either AWESOME!!!! or bored and ready to kamikaze yourself and do something else. Personally I had a great time.",

If saves your build/state at those checkpoints for you to reuse. The progression system allows for different builds with different play styles: go with strong turrets, play with some friendly droids to help you along or build yourself into a robot killing machine. It can be quite addictive but due to the levels being the same you might also get saturated quickly. The main drive of the game is getting higher up the leaderboards, so nice if you are into score attack games, less relevant if you are not.  Recommended to play in short bursts (to keep the game fresh and keep it from going stale on you) and pick the game up when it's on sale.",

It's absolute fun, it's filled with challenges, has nice music, and a GREAT art style (Along with all of the other games by Puppy), but for somewhat of a hefty price. If your'e really into getting to the top of the high-score list and aren't afraid to dish out 10 bucks for this game, then go ahead.

There's one negative aspect: it doesn't work with my gamepad. These games are pretty much meant to be played with a gamepad... but I think I simply bought the wrong one as Portal 2 doesn't properly recognize it either.",

            "review_text": "I rate the game Ultratron 3.5/5. Pretty good.  This is the direct sequel (at least in spirit) to the famous Robotron 2084 arcade game (which I used to play extensively on my Nintendo 64). Ultratron is harder and more complex than Robotron 2084 in every respect but despite its many differences, such as the presence of weapon and character upgrades, better graphics, more complex arenas and the music (Robotron 2084 had no music at all), Ultratron still somehow manages to feel very nostalgic. Despite its high difficulty and despite its initially clunky looking graphics (reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games), this is a seemingly simple but extremely fun game with absolutely no bugs (other than the intentional warping and flipping of the screen).  ++++ +This game is pretty inexpensive.  + The controls are highly responsive and generally outstanding.  + The sound is highly reminiscent of 1980s arcade games. Still, this game's intentionally nostalgic sounds are extremely well done and hearing all the nifty computer sounds this game makes is a lot of fun. Despite how nostalgic the sounds are they will not make your speakers pop. The sounds in this game are high quality. They don't come through as fuzzy, grainy or full of static. Every single sound in this game also tells you something important.  +The graphics, while reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games, are actually quite a bit more complex, including some pretty lighting effects and little spotlight rays which follow your character around. The lighting creates a wonderful techno-menacing ambient feeling which goes far to create this game's atmosphere. The overall atmosphere seems to be halfway between a 1980s arcade, a techno rave dance club and a weird, futuristic computer factory. Indeed, the levels all sort of look like they take place in a 2D dance club of some sort which is at once funny and fitting for this game. The high-contrast graphics also helped me concentrate even better than I otherwise would have. The intentionally strange screen distortion effects helped increase the atmospherics of this game still further without significantly distracting from the gameplay. When playing this game it almost looks as if your own computer monitor wants the machines to win but can't really do much about you.  +The overall game design and object of the game (destroy everything on the screen) is simple but extremely well executed. Levels are divided into 4 sections, each of which has a boss fight at the end. Once a boss has been defeated you can jump to that section at a later time using the extremely easy-to-use game menu. Between each level you can upgrade your character with little monies you earned while you were destroying enemies during each preceding level (or you can save your little monies for better upgrades later. The boss fights are challenging but only the final one is potentially frustrating (I defeated it on my third try but then I currently hold the 5th highest score in the world). After the final boss, you can continue playing even further to get an even high score. The furthest I've gotten is to level 60 but I think I heard somewhere that there are 100 levels in all but I'm not sure. The designs of all of the smaller enemies are also very, very good, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  +/-+/-+/-+/- +/- Asides from the good main theme and the excellent music which plays during boss fights (the same song which plays on the Steam store's Ultratron page), this game's music is largely mediocre and tends towards an overly complicated and chaotic musical style (that oftentimes would sound more at home in a Unreal Tournament game rather than a little arcade-style game like this). The music can, at times be distracting but the music can be easily turned down.  +/-This game gets very difficult very quickly. This is essentially a dual analog game. (I play it with a mouse (to aim and fire with) and keyboard (to move)). If you do not have a background in playing other dual analog games I'd recommend playing some other dual analog games first to get used to the fundamentals of the controls before diving into something as challenging as Ultratron. Playing the original Robotron 2084 (if you can find a good version of it these days) will help you to be better at this game too.  --------- -It would have been nice if the difficulty ramped up more slowly (so the game would have more stages to play through).  -This game could use some additional gameplay modes of some sort to add variety and increased replayability. (For example, a mode where you must fire as little as possible, a time trial mode, a boss rush mode etc. would have all been nice additions) As it stands, this is a fairly bare-bones arcade style game with just one mode.  -It would be nice to be able to play a cooperative mode with AI's if you don't have any friends who also play this game (like me).  -The game needs more variety to its arenas. It needs more traps and physical barriers etc. Maze-like arenas would have been cool too. There's a whole lot more than could be done with this game.",
