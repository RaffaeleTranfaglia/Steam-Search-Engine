            "review_text": "The poetry of the diary pods is beautiful and often thought-provoking, and they very effectively capture the essence of solitude and desolation. This is not merely a game about wandering through space, this is a compelling story about a cosmonaut who shoulders the responsibility of finding a new home for mankind, and who struggles with a profound loneliness along the way. The voice acting brings the diary pods to life, and adds an emotional power that could never be felt if they were only read. This is immersion done right and it is storytelling of the highest caliber. The diary pods, to me, almost single-handedly elevate this game to the status of art, not simply entertainment.  Not to mention that the game looks gorgeous, and proves to be an enjoyable challenge. I highly recommend this game if you're in an existential mood.",

            "review_text": "God if this isn't the calmest, most difficult game I've ever seen. Beautiful in every way imaginable, from the custom soundtracks for each ship you can fly in, to the backgrounds of the space around you that shift when you pass through different zones, this game is literally art. If you're a poetry fan you'll like the fact that the only voice acting is read poetry from the pilot, which also helps unravel more of the plot as you go along. Very calming besides the fact that, as any good rogue-like will have, it's nearly impossible to progress the story for a very long time. For instance, i nearly completed the first chapter when i got a gift from the game for travelling through space for 8 years: a wormhole that puts me all the way back at spawn point. But besides the unfair RNG, one of the best games i've play in a while.  tl;dr this game makes me want to ♥♥♥♥ space and you should too.",

It's bit hard to get the hang of it, really kind of frustrating, but I stuck with it mostly because I thought the design and music were beautiful. If that's not your thing, you're probably going to get really annoyed really fast. Overall exactly what I was looking for... a scifi adventure with gorgeous graphics under $10.",

Beautiful writing, haunting music and abstract visuals will be your primary companions on this trip. More than once I was distracted by the image of a nebula or a peculiar derelict space ship drifting by, making me slam my ship into a long forgotten minefield, promptly turning me into space dust.  This curious little gem of a game packs several features that become unlocked gradually as you play, and the developers have mentioned the game will grow further with feedback!  It's time to get lost in space to find yourself again. See you all in space. ",

The game really tries hard to make you feel like you are alone is space, traveling vast distances full of beauty and danger, and it largely succeeds. The pixel art and music really contribute to the game's atmosphere. Unlike many spaced based games that focus largely on combat, this game focuses on the beauty and wonder of space itself. It is obvious that the developers really care about this game and have tried to make it as good as they can. This is a very unique game that anyone who enjoys playing video games and learning about space ought to take a look at. I do hope that they add more content to the game in the form of more things to see and do in space and more missions, but they have already stated that they intent to do so in the future.",

There is no guns in this one, so dont expect a space fighting game. This is about exploring and surviving in space as a story evolves as you explore. It really got me hooked and the feelings and emotions that the game got me to feel was surprising and not something I expected.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this title!",

She's shy though and talks through a voice modulator.  Hit X and make arbitrary choices to see whether you live or die. Literally. All the while moving through space, finding more slot machines to play she tells you more and more about how at peace she is with her losses .. Except if she were really at peace, she'd let me play my slot machines in peace.  In it's defense, the game is clearly geared toward people who need help coping with loss. I'm glad if it can help people, but that's an interactive experience. Not a game.",

Yeah...  First thing, there's absolutely no Pew Pew for you. None of the player ships have weapons, to my knowledge. This doesn't necessarily take away from the game - but it would have been nice to fire back at some of the infrequent enemy ships.  Other than that, it's a 2-D exploration game with semi-newtonian physics. Most of the dangers involve avoiding suns, and various bits of debris. All the while there's a kind of relaxed randomness to the environment.  For the stat heads and RPG folks, there's a bit of ship customization and a wide range of items for such.  I managed to beat it, not 100%, in under 10 hours. So yeah... it's a short game if you just want to plow through it. If you're a completionist, I would imagine this game has at least 30 hours of play in it.   Not a bad buy, if you want a weird semi-casual game.",
