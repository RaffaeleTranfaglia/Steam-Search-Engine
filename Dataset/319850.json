Build sturdy bridges to supply your city with provisions - or cunningly constructed bridges that collapse under the weight of attacking troops, sending the horde of enemies into the abyss below.",

            "review_text": "Bridge Constructor... Yeah it is fun, but highly flawed. You are not really trying to get good at building bridges as much as you are trying to get good at understand the game mechanics. I don't know for sure, but I don't think an engineer would have all that much advantage when playing this. It is fun, but I just think the devs could make it so much better without really adding new content (just changing what is already there). They should:  1. Change up the music. It is soooo monotonous after an hour or so. Just have intermittant music if you cannot add any more.  2. Change up the scenery. It is like the same 3 or 4 scenarios for the whole game. 3. The roof mechanic is stupid. Just use it less. Why can we not have real elements like wind or weather or something. 4. QUANTIFY prices and stress for individual parts. Give numbers to things. They never tell you how much money you have - it is simply a meter that you fill up. What is the exact difference between good wood, rope and logs? Is logs twice as good as lumber, or only 1/3? This stuff matters.  The game is relatively short. If you really want this game, get it on sale or in a bundle IMHO.",

            "review_text": "Its another bridge constructor this time with trebuchets (incoming only sadly). I think I might have liked the original better because it allowed for sloped bridges which was fun and added some extra challenge I thought. This one tries to make up for it with new modes and has a better (or really at all) story as you take on the role of the royal architect during an attack on the kingdom. You have to build 3 different kinds of bridges, regular bridges, roofed bridges that can withstand flying boulders, and booby trap bridges designed to collapse but not until all the enemies are on them.  My biggest gripe though is the inconsistency in the physics. Some designs will work one time and fail another with the exact same design. Sometimes a unit will make it across a bridge thats startign to crumble, other times it wont. Sometimes a bridge will collapse and sometimes it wont. I noticed that if i scroll between my virtual desktops causing CPU load to climb it seems to make the physics run in a more shallow iteration, its possible this could be advantageous to someone stuck on a challenge I guess but it was just kind of annoying to have a design fail then spend 15 minutes messing around changing it only to find that the original was actually perfectly functional and I had an unlucky run the first time.",

            "review_text": "This game is something you can get a better, free version of on almost any flash game website. My main problem with this game other than there being better, free games in this genre is there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what part of your bridge breaks. Parts will just randomly explode for seeming no reason, even when the nearest thing on the bridge is in an entirely different, unconnected in any way, section. Also it doesn't have audio settings which is a minor thing considering the nature and genre of the game, but I wanted to turn the music off and listen to a podcast while still having the sound effects of the bridge breaking and other things. I don't like writing reviews this short but there's really nothing else to go over.",

Add annoying bugs from the previous game of the series (Bridge Contructor), like not-properly-working physics on small bridge elements, cars/units going upside down when the bridge broke, physics of units, ... Add annoying 'we are trying for some storyline here with these dialogues' and you will get to the same thought as I did -&gt; 'At least I bought it for 1$ at some bundle'  Buy for full price? Are you kidding? No, thanks.  It has some good things though. I really liked bridges being bombarded (you have to strengthen them a little more or make them more flexible) and destroying the bridge under marching enemies. The latter is real fun.",

It would be great if the designers gave users a little more credit and allowed a detailed/advanced mode which showed where the load was moving from to where and why some joints pop before others, better instruction to bridge-building noobs like me, and some better ways to think about building complex structures.",

I would guess you could get a solid 5-15 hours of gameplay out of the game, depending on how quickly you catch on to the tricks. I clocked in right around 10 hours, which I am guessing is about average. You'll find yourself annoyed from time to time as you struggle to get the cost of the bridge under budget for the crown, but it's quite enjoyable to watch the support structure get deep, deep red, but still hold. I probably wouldn't pay full price, given the natural lack of replayability, but certainly worth it on sale. Very enjoyable game.",
