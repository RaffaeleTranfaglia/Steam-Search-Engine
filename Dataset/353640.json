            "review_text": "I've been looking for something to scratch the Transport / Railroad Tycoon itch for a while now, and although there are some potentially promising games on the horizon, it seemed like there were no good examples in the genre at the moment.  And then I stumbled upon Train Valley, which, within a few minutes of playing confirms that the above is true - this isn't a tycoon game. What it is, is a puzzle game - and once you get a few levels in, it's fiendish. It conjurs up the correct mix of raising a smile when things go to plan, and swearing at your screen when you get overwhelmed and the inevitable happens - and trains crash.  The premise is simple; you are given a grid and two coloured stations on each map, and you drag lines from one to the other, avoiding or bulldozing (at a cost) your way through buildings and trees, some of which are randomly placed whilst some are always in the same place. Trains will spawn in the stations with a colour indicating that they want you to direct them to the other station, you click to launch the train and it makes its way down the track and you get paid when it arrives - each train has a value which ticks down from the moment it spawns to the moment it arrives at the destination. The complexity comes in as the map progresses. New stations will spawn on the map - in predetermined positions but in a random order, and begin to spawn trains all eager to go somewhere else. You will lay more tracks, launch trains, and use the track switches to try and avoid a catastrophe. Fortunately you can stop and reverse trains, but this doesn't always help if you're not keeping a good watch out - only one train can occupy a station, so it will launch itself if a second one is about to spawn.  The difficultly ramps up; early maps serve to teach you the basics and later ones cram stations in awkward places with choke points to force trains onto the same pieces of track. When things go well, it's great - but sometimes, you just can't avoid an explosion.  Back to my search for a tycoon game - even though this clearly isn't one, the art style and simple way of laying track would lend itself very well to a more in depth strategy game which, if I were the developer, I'd seriously consider.",

            "review_text": "Bought it, played five hours in one session right away. So I guess that's good.  It is not a classic 'Tycoon' game, as you might have figured out from the screenshot, more like a halfway point of that and a puzzle game like, say, Air Control. Which is good! The levels really change up the core gameplay of 'somehow get a bunch of trains from A to B without them all crashing into each other' in some interesting ways, and some of the Russian and Japanese levels require LOTS of concentration.  I would say I had more fun with this than with many of the 'real' railway management sims. Two things, though:  * I'd like to have more content. There's enough right now to justify the price point, but after going through most of the levels, I'd still like to go on. So give me some DLC and I'll buy that stuff. * There are still some glitches, which also occasionally forced me to restart levels. It is annoying as hell, but because I like the core gameplay so much, I can still recommend it. I hope there will be improvements, though. (EDIT: Yay, there have been indeed.)",

            "review_text": "Not sure if you've ever played 'Sid Meier's Railroads' but it's a much more simplified version of that (and that game was fairly simple to begin with!). Someone also compared it to 'Lionel's(?) Train Town' which is also a fair comparison to make!  To start with, it's not a tycoon game so don't be fooled by the images if they look like a Railroad Tycoon. The game is more focused on being a puzzle game based around trains. I'm sure if you've played Railroad Tycoon or the like you've had to overcome complicated junctions or network improvements the puzzles tend to focus on that skill - placing stations in awkward places.   Every so often the game will general a train which will be at one of the stations (there's a gauge timer thing at the bottom right of the screen so you can see when the next train will generate) - you can also call on addional trains to create additional revenue. The train will be assigned a colour and you have to create a route via the switches/junctions you've made in your solution to get the train to it's destination. Laying track and destroying objects costs money and, along with a tax you have to pay, your balance can deplete quickly - going below 0 results in bankrupcy and you lose the game.  There are four different regions progressing in difficulty. Difficulty in this game is present through awkwardly placed stations, objects to either neogotiate around or destroy and build over at an addition cost (depends on what you destroy for cost) and the challenges present in each level (spend x money, don't let trains go to the wrong stations, etc) create some replayability.  This is a fun puzzler and the trains were just a bonus (well, at least for me anyway).",

            "review_text": "English than Portuguese  From someone if 27.6 hours played and who finished the game with all the ' Stamps' and completed as All the Achievements (with exception of those in dlc )  English: I believe it is important to tell those interested in buying this game that, although it is a very good game, is not exactly a train simulator. If you exchange the stations for water records, the tracks for pipes and the trains for water, the game operation would remain exactly the same (!), so, it´s a puzzle that uses the 'skin' of trains . In the end, you don´t do nothing but have to come up with a way to take the trains (replaceable by any other object) from point 'A' to 'B' point. The criticism is because I bought the game having in mind something like the old Railroad Tycoon II, and there is absolutely nothing of his features here. There is no management of the trains. You indicates your ways and just take care of the break. The connection of the tracks is simple, limiting creativity in creating lines (intersections) more complex. There is no freedom to choose which trains to use, which loads carry loads, which station is more important to get that load, and so on .... it is a puzzle where you connect points. A very good and even challenging at times, but a puzzle. Not a simulator. Likes puzzles, go ahead. Expect something more than a puzzle ... better pass or run the risk in a very good sale.  Português:  Para indicar minha experiência com o jogo, tenho 27.6hr. de jogadas e terminei todas as fases, cumprindo com todos os desafios (são três por fase). Tenho todas as conquistas existentes com exceção daquelas constantes na dlc  Acredito que seja importante avisar àqueles interessados na compra deste jogo que, apesar de se tratar de um game muito bom, não é exatamente um simulador de trens. Se você trocar as estações por registros de água, os trilhos por canos e e os trens por água, o funcionamento do jogo continuaria sendo exatamente o mesmo (!), ou seja, trata-se de um puzzle que utiliza a 'skin' de trens. No final das contas, vc. não faz nada além de ter de bolar uma maneira de levar os trens (substituíveis por qualquer outro objeto) do ponto 'A' ao ponto 'B'. A crítica fica pq. comprei o jogo tendo em mente algo como o antigo Railroad Tycoon II, e não existe absolutamente nenhuma característica deste. Não há administração dos trens. Você dita seus caminhos e no máximo os pausa.  A conexão dos trilhos é bem simples o que limita a criatividade na criação de linhas mais complexas (cruzamentos mais complexos). Não há liberdade para escolher que trens usar, os evoluir/melhorar, que cargas levar, para onde levar, a importância da carga para aquele local e assim por diante.... se trata de um puzzle de conectar pontos. Um muito bom e até desafiador às vezes, porém, um puzzle. Não um simulador. Curte Puzzles, vá em frente. Espera algo mais do que um quebra-cabeça... melhor deixar passar ou correr o risco em uma sale muito boa.",

Be prepared to restart a lot at the second half of the game. It's hard to compare with any game that I've played, but there is one, which is basically the same - old DOS game called Short Lines from 1992. I have spent a lot of time playing ShortLine and I really wanted something more modern - Train Valley is exactly that.  Of course It has a few thing, that I'd like to be improved - bigger maps; better UX (sometimes it hard to click on train to launch it or on switch etc.); music, better turn it off once you get to the settings; more variety. I will hope on Train Valley 2, but, unfortunatly, it looks like we will not get it soon :(  Thanks guys for the grate game, I will recommended to my frieds ;) ",

The game is charming, with good music and sound effects and a really great design, essentially like looking at a really good train set!  I was playing on level 9 or so and made a really elegant rail system, so when I didn't notice I had two trains on the same path until too late I literally cried out! All I'm saying is that any game that can get that sort of reaction is a good game.   My one critisism is that the first time I played my progress was lost because I wasn't syncing to the cloud.

It is a fun experience of train traffic management.    Rough around the edges though. The missions are absolutely homogenous. Any difference between the 'Japan' and 'wherever else' missions was lost on me. Considering how interchangeable and unmemorable the missions are, I am a little surprised there were not twice as many. The experience is compelling, so I want more. And some tiered achievements would encourage level replay -- the levels are easy to triple-crown the first time through. So what am I going to replay them for? I would like to replay them so that I can get Super Platinum Ultra but there is no such possibility.    It could use a bit more polish. The trains enter buildings, and you can see them pop-out. This hurts my eyes. Please do not do this. Pop them out once they are completely hidden from the player.    And you're allowed to build train tracks where future train stations will appear, spontaneously, without warning. Why would this be allowed? It is completely disruptive to train traffic when a train station suddenly blocks the way. This is completely opaque and unpredictable for the player. It is the 'blue shell' of Train Valley.   So, the game is broken in a few ways, but I still couldn't stop playing it. Your mileage may vary.  ",

This game is quite fun, but quite short of you don't like completing all the challenges in the game.  I picked this game up during a Steam sale for €7.00 including DLC. I would say that it was worth that money, but I am not sure if I would recommend it at full price (€12.50).  Pros: - The core mechanics, laying rails and directing trains, are easy to understand and work reasonably well - The theming is great - The levels are designed well, making it a challenge to find the optimal layout of tracks to complete all challenges - The game is not incredibly difficult. The 6 levels added by the DLC are somewhat harder than the 24 in the base game. The ability to pause the game makes it a lot less stressful too.  Cons: - The music is repetitive, and while soothing it just annoyed me after a while. - Rail junctions work... weird. Rail junctions are blocked when a train is on top of them. However, the game also blocks rail junctions on adjecent rails, or even crossing rails. - The challenges get stale after a bit. The challenges for Germany have some more fun ones in them, such as blowing up 5 trains. - The sandbox mode is completely broken, with train stations not showing up at all. Besides that, it's not all that fun without a clear goal or even money to worry about. - Even after completing every challenge, and completing every other achievement, I only built about 9000 train tracks towards the 'build 10.000 train tracks' achievement. Luckily the game counts train tracks built just before restarting a level, so building a lot of useless tracks on a level with high starting money solves that problem, but 'grinding building train tracks' is not fun nor won't it give me a sense of achieving something on reaching it.",

What makes Train Valley stand out is that while it is pretty simplistic it is still challenging. All you do in the game is build tracks and guide the trains towards their destination. The fun comes from creating the routes and juggling multiple trains at the same time while trying to keep them from crashing into one another and running out of money. Train Valley does a great job of being a relaxing game that still challenges you.  I would classify Train Valley as an easy to play but hard to master game. It is not that hard to beat the levels in Train Valley but it becomes quite hard to 100% some of the later levels so there is quite a bit of challenge if you want it. Length wise the game includes 24 levels and should take at least six to eight hours to complete. I found Train Valley enjoyable enought though that I actually wanted to try and complete as many of the additional objectives as I could which can add quite a bit of time to the game.   If you are looking for a train simulation game or don't really like puzzle games, Train Valley is not going to be for you.

It has a really weird loose condition: you can't have negative balance, like in all other economy based games, resulting in regular and spontaneous 'You are bankrupt' pop ups, while you have 4 really expensive trains on there way to the stations. Usually it happens because you had to expand new rail tracks really long to a new trains station and spend all the money. And than after a minute the tax comes and makes you a bankrupt. So you have to always keep an amount of money on your bank account to not let it happen, though the amount is always growing during the level, so you have to guess or loose. Can't imagine play testers did not mention it while on development.   It also has a typical Unity bug: it works really terrible on a dual monitor PC. So you are most likely have to change windows registry to be able to play the game. Also, the devs were not of a particular help here.  The UI even on a regular 1920p monitor is tiny and unintuitive. I have a 27' monitor and it's hard to spot most essential gameplay information when you need to. The tools icons are like 20 pixels at the top of the screen and the new train icon on the station (most essential gameplay ui element in the game) is like 5.  Track building tools are rather unresponsive, far from polished.  The lack of a proper tutorial is a pain also.  It's sad, that developers didn't put enough effort here.

I was instantly hooked on the game once I got the overall concept and how the game worked. It's a game like none other I have played despite having the same concepts as others. But it is unique in the method of which everything is applied.  Train Valley is a simple game as-is, but that doesn't make it easy. It can be a very challenging game and you'll spend a lot of time getting those last few stamps. With a relative small map, you have to build train tracks between given stations and change the tracks to direct your trains towards the proper station. That in itself would be easy if you had unlimited money, time, and space - but you don't - and that's where the challenge lies.
