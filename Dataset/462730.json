I dunno if its a rip-off of that game or not, I do not care really, as this game is fun to play when bored, and its the best investment of a game I have gotten. It was worth it, Buy this game if you like casual building.   Someone wrote on here in another posts rating it bad and comparing it to SimCity... this is nothing like SimCity as the population does not go any higher than 1500, and SimCity you could have a population of 500,000 plus bigger maps. This is a different game type than SimCity, and is more of a planning zones and placing the proper buildings in the proper places to make them happy.   I like playing the sandbox game and setting my own goals, its fun to reach those goals and feel accomplished everytime I finished them. The game has replayablility, and I keep coming back to play when I have time and not playing another game, or if I need a break from other games. It gives me something to do to kill the time with.",
