            "review_text": "Price / hour: still playing but probably below 0,19€, sales 0,09€  Pros: - Good idea for puzzles, fun to play - It's a long game. For its price it gives 60 levels which is sweet, in sales you basically pay 1 cent per level. The puzzles ain't so easy either.  But then, reviewed no, cons: - Music. This is first thing that comes to mind. The music is so annoying, and it always starts over when replaying the level (getting stuck, that's why) and it feels so glitchy, but the reason is just rushed game design - Graphics. It's okay, decent, but all the backgrounds and levels and so on looks so same. This just looks so copy-paste everywhere, rushed, done in few days / weeks. - Controls. Oh my god, you have to switch between different arrows very, very fast, but you have to click your character, and then click the weapon you want to use (and the selection moves very, very slowly) and then draw the another arrow you want to use, and probably in this time you already ♥♥♥♥ed up. Trust me, this is the main con and why it shouldn't be paid the full 1€ even, just in sales. Game devs: If you are going to do fast based puzzles, make the game quick as well. Even a simple solution, putting the arrows in 1-3 number keys would fix this problem. It seems you haven't done any effort to looking to this game, it was 2015!  Conclusion: If you are bored AND look for indie games, this is good for a sale game. But not the best at all. Mixed reviews is kinda good conclusion for it. And if you are going to play it, turn the volume to 0 and find your own music.",

            "review_text": "Game has promise as a puzzle game, unfortunatly control system of firing arrows is buggy at best and non functional at worst. It needs a better system for selecting ammo and displaying which type is selected. Also the click and drag never seems to work, I couldn't make it past the second level after barely making it past the third.   I'm running this on Windows, and tried both windowed and full screen options.  I would retry and rereview game if controls are improved.  Update: I was able to figure out a trick to get the bow to work nearly every time, you have to click really far away from your character. Levels are challenging and fun, but I still would like to have improved controls before I play a lot more.",

The 3 different arrows and the ways to use them are cool, but why does a tin robot dude have a bow? Something more suited to the theme would've been better. Also, the level I'm on is really difficult, i think it's 11 or something like that.",
