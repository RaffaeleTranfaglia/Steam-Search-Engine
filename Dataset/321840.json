What I found was a gripping, tense, emotional rollercoaster of a visual novel, that deserves a much better position then in the free to play game area it currently sits in.  From the moment I started the characters personalities began to grip me, letting me know each part of their individual backstories, and how its shaped who they are in this story.  By offering multiple choices while keeping a by the line save system, this game offers a perfect amount of replayablity, especially for those who wish to explore multiple options.  Hopefully this game will be the first of many , if only so I can follow the exploits of these characters.  10/10, need to play again.",

            "review_text": "I rarely if ever write reviews, but I have played many VNs in my life (both Hentai and Non-H, hehe) so, upon stumbling on one that puts many +$15 visual novels to shame, I simply couldn't let this slip....   -Story 10/10  ''Whom do you trust? And whom you shouldn't trust?'' This is a very mature topic in an even more mature story. So if you expect the choices to answer this question to be as Black and White as the ''Side with the Rebels against the Evil Tyrant, or side with the Evil Tyrant to crush the Rebels.'', then move along; you won't like this VN. But if you like plot full of mystery and doubt, betrayal and friendship, where one single wrong choice could end up dooming everything you care about and you like to feel the jarring tension and drama, then you'll love this work.    -Art 7/10  OK, this score is a bit viased; for a VN with so many endorphins-releasing situations, moments of sheer shock and fear.... I seriously expected more CGs of them, not just a black screen with the text. I know the most pivotal of them have CGs, but you can count those with one hand and there many, many more events that deserved a CG. As for what Art Style and Quality over all, this VN has better art than many paid VNs; I'd give it a 10 in here.   -Sound 10/10  The BGMs tend to be quite quiet and inconspicious when nothing of importance is happening, but when something big happens.... Well, the soundtrack kicks in just in the right way (to the point you might find yourself jumping in your seat if you favor headphones). All of the music is beautiful and perdfectly crafted for whatever events are taking place, and that's simply perfect. Love the opening soundtrack, too.   -Characters 11/10  This review is viased too; I love monster girls in all their shapes (Monster Musume be praised! And Okayado-sensei's previous hentai works too, heheh) so, to have a REAL GOOD STORY, one that's not about silly romantic comedy or pointless fanservice, in a setting with monster girls on it is golden. Going into the specifics, a good Female Protagonist (that isn't oversexualized), a Ditzy Dojikko Dragon with confidence issues, a Tsundere Ojou-sama Kitsune, a Lazy but Lovely Wolf Girl and a Cold and Harsh Elf spelled epicness to me. But, each of the characters is much, much deeper than just their physical traits; each of them feels and acts like a real living being; with virtues and faults, issues and traumas, and with unique and interesting personalities; characters you can relate to. (Such a thing is so rare these days).   -Lenght 10/10  At first I thought this was too short (beat in on 3 hours, and got the True End in just two tries) and I was about to complain about it. Then, I saw that Kickstarter page with a fully-funded sequel, and all my complains vanished and were replaced by the desire of it being released soon. If it's as epic as this one, I'll get it even if I have to pay.   So, to sum up, if you're looking for a fanservice-packed romantic comedy, with lots of bouncing bewbs, panty shots and Gainaxing, then look elsewhere (try NekoPara, which is quite good in all the aforementioned, specially the last two). But, if you are looking for an epic drama filled with emotions and anxiety, then by all means, get this VN.",

            "review_text": "Before I start my review, I have to say that I have played a number of Japanese Visual-Novels and have experience in the matter.  Rising Angels: Reborn. Is it a good visual novel? Yes. To go into detail, I must say, the amount of detail in the dialogue is better than I expected from a free-to-play visual novel. The characters are believable. You feel that they are alive and that they mean something to you and not just some hollow arch-type character to move you along through the plot. The main story flows fluidly with the characters itself rather than the character-goes-here-for-the-plot type.  The music is decent. I mean, for a free-to-play, what do you expect? But, I do have some problems with some scenes in having the wrong kind of soundtrack to play in a heartwarming or first-clenching scenes. Other than that, it was okay.  But your main hook on this genre will not be the music, or the graphic (which is obviously CG drawn) or even the endings. Its the character development. You learn their history, their drive to their goal, their will. And you care for them across the story. With the amazing dialogue, I had no problem believing any of the hardships they went through together.  In the end, I was left feeling, 'Wow, I wasn't expecting this good of an experience.' And was satisfied with how the plot ends. I cared for the characters and even for the ones that died. It managed to enter my personal territory and made me feel sad with each hardship they go through. I want them to succeed and I cheered for them. All done without paying a single penny towards the developer. (Which made me feel sour at the end for enjoying such a good experience without paying a single penny)  You don't get a massive cliffhanger that makes you want to rip your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hair off, but it leaves enough plot to settle for a sequel (which they are working on and is being funded in a kickstarter)  All in all, this was a Visual Novel worth of your 2-3 hour of spare time and definitely worth doing all the routes to all the ending. What's even great is it's free! (I wouldn't mind paying this for 5-10$ though)",

            "review_text": "This game? No, allow me to rephrase it.  A visual novel.       Note: This review  may be lengthy  is obviously lengthy. Also, I only clocked 1.1hrs and have not finished the whole 'game' when writing this review. Will edit if needed once I actually complete the 'game'.  ___________________________________________  You're literally reading a book, and deciding on a few conversation choices that is seemingly pointless. From what I've experienced and been through in the hours I've clocked, I've made 4 conversation choices, 3 of which was pointless and could have either been taken out or just added to the storyline, but probably affects how your crew thinks of you. The only one that was actually a choice was the option to talk to the person of your choice.  Storyline is great, but I do feel that it is a little draggy and slow. Nonetheless, when it starts to perk up to the mysteries, it kicks in well. Personally, I would have preferred to get to know each character slowly, but no. Everything was dumped on you right from the start. It's fine I guess, but that probably took up say about 30minutes of gameplay time(not accurate, just felt like it) to go around the spaceship to introduce yourself and do ice breakers with your crew.  Not the best music, nor does it shout the worst music. It certainly does bring out the right atmosphere according to where you are in the story.   The art style in this VN strikes the word odd to me. In the spaceship, all the backgrounds pops out at you with a feeling of being detailed. Yet when you leave the ship to an outdoor scene, the backgrounds are less detailed, seemingly a quick painting sketch(it still looks detailed, but how should I put it... unlined or dabbling paint blobs?) Even within the spaceship, some backgrounds look a bit more on the realistic side, and some other scenes more cartoonish. At the end of the day, it's alright I guess.  So. Remember i started off with saying that this is a visual novel more than a game? Well at the end of the day, some people may find this VN engaging for the storyline, while some may deter from this for the lack of gameplay. Personally, Rising Angels isn't my cup of tea, no matter how much I like visual novel games. I believe that at it's price it is worth a try, but if you are looking for a more interactive type of Visual Novel game, you will try something else.",

The story is about par for a mid level sci-fi story. Not the greatest work of literature ever created for its genere but enjoyable in every way if you are a fan of science fiction.  There are some cirtiques with regards to the story, for one, it focuses far too heavily on Zuri as oposed to spreading the story more evenly amongst the entire cast. Secondly, there are some writing mistakes. Where the text for a section is inconsitient with the events that have transpired. These are relitively minor oversights though.  The characters are charming and engaging in thier own way. I had my doubts with the cast of angels, demons, dragons, and furries, but each character managed to bring thier own personality to the front and such doubts faded away. The artwork is sparse, but well polished. Lastly playing from the persepctive of a female lead character was a rare treat, often neglected in the world of visual novels.  This would be a good game for $5-$10, that this game is free makes it outstanding value as the quality is definately well abolve average.",

Every moment has you on the edge of your seat, waiting to find out whether it ends well or not. There's humor, quirky characters, and drastic plot twists at every turn. One moment, you think you might have done something to save everyone and get a happy ending, but as the story progresses, the main character, the other characters, and yourself are always questioning whether what is being done is right.  I also enjoyed how everything was questioned as it was. The characters never once just made assumptions, unless they were ones that they had no choice but to make. You never felt at ease and never felt 'safe' unless the creators of this masterpiece wanted you to.  Though, I was surprised by the lack of choices presented. For the most part, you feel like you're reading a story rather than playing a game. However, when you did make big decisions, they reminded me of Mass Effect and how EVERY decision you made affected the outcome, and not in little ways either.  With all of that said, I would definitely recommend playing this game. And why wouldn't you? It's free and compatible with just about everything computer related.

There are two 'yuri' endings (yay) but somehow, none for the main guy.  Soundtrack is excellent at setting tension and mood.",

This song made me feel like it would be awesomer than it was. It was alright, but not very open in terms of story-telling. You ultimately decide nothing except whether or not at the very end it will be a regular open-ended ending or a neutral or bad ending. Congratulations Rising Angels: Reborn. You wasted a good two hours of our lives.  Now, I wouldn't be so critical if they had at least given us more room to establish a different romantic route for this game but nope. They went ahead and decided that for you too. It's always either vaguely (SPOILERS REDACTED) or already determined. I was honestly hoping for an Azaiah route. I personally go for the cool-headed, commanding glasses types. They are strict and stubborn, but their heart is always ultimately in the right place.  But nope. They (SPOILERS REDACTED). So that's out.  Everything is essentially decided for us except whether or not we're going to need to continue to the next game to have a REAL ending rather than what they called the ending of Rising Angels Reborn.  And honestly, who didn't see the big reveal coming? It wasn't very suspenseful. I mean...you pretty much know the gist of what happens by the time you finish the trailer so apparently they probably have never heard the phrase 'it's better to conceal than reveal'.  I only hope that they give us more of a challenge with Rising Angel: Fates, but, as with the chances of Fate/Extra CCC ever being translated, my hopes are low.",

Long story short the fact that this has sim as part of the classification is sadly false because if these people were in any way realistic... well then i would encourage nuclear warfare.",

I read/watched it for over an hour and had 2 choices. How is that a game?  Anyway, the story was interesting enough that i did read it for that long. If this content had been the cutscences for a game with someting else to do, I would have enjoyed it even. That said, the completly static backgrounds/characters, and limited poses of those characters, make this something I myself wont be reading anymore.  If you're into that sort of thing, this is probably a good one. If not you should probably look elsewhere... like I'm going to go do now.",
