Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one.  I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.  You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.  It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you. If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too. I recommend this game.",

For example, BEEP can fire bullets at enemies and obstacles - that's cool, but what is the point in having an option to reload if you have infinite ammo anyway?  If this was a mobile game, my review would be different. BEEP is okay for throwing a few minutes into here and there, but as a computer game, entertainment feels forced and I quickly lost interest.",

Travelling the universe, exploring and discovering new planets, as well as creatures. The fighting is fairly straight forward and I always dispose of my enemies by using the gravity gun and whack them around a bit before I throw them into a pit of despair! Overall, a fun and adventurous game.  Great job! :D",

One bug i have noticed that is a little annoying, is when youre in windowed mode and not full screen if you click escape to enter the pause menu, the game crashes. Well it does on my laptop anyway- which is not that much of a potato. Lol. But anyway! new game! low cost! I'm sure it'll get fixed and improved. In the mean time, i'm having a lot of fun just playing in full screen, but it is handy to play in windowed mode when multitasking etc. THANKS! :D",
