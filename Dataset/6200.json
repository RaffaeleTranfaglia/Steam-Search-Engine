            "review_text": "Background: Bought for pennies in the steam sale, never heard of it before.  The Good: * Brilliant premise, locations and characters * Decent tutorial (does miss out a few useful hints) * Tons of ghosts to play with with fun interactions * Varied scenarios are brilliantly Scooby Do fun to explore * Trial and error hauntings are both good and challenging * Good balance between creepy and fun * Fun voice acting on the ghosts, Sims mumbling from the humans * Most missions are sub 30mins for quick diversions * 20 hour campaign, some replay value  The Bad: * Graphics are dated.. looking Sims 2-esque * NPC Characters get hooked on the scenery, other glitches in pathing * The ghost/human menu is clunky and could give better feedback * Golden Plasm too easy to waste while learning the ropes * Replay and Upgrade-mansion interfaces are more awkward than seems necessary * Some hints on releasing bonus ghosts very vague * Cries out for more direct control and visually targeted attacks * Some scenarios have triggers you have no control over make the game too easy  Impressions: Some games look great but are boring, others the reverse, this is the latter. It reminds me of the Commandos crossed with Hitman and The Sims 2 games.. looks dated but the game play shines. The game lovingly tiptoes around remaking famous setups from horror movies (the Evil Dead one is great) without getting so close they get sued.  Recommended for: Strategy fans who like replay value and Sims fans who like to drown their vassals in ladderless pools.  Conclusion.: 8/10. A game that triumphs in mechanics over visuals.",

            "review_text": "In Ghost Master, you command an army of ghosts and are trusted with completing an array of different objectives. The story takes place in Gravenville, a town where a lot of paranormal activity takes place, after a group of teenagers summons you – the Ghost Master. Before entering a haunting, you must choose which ghosts you take with you. You can pick anyone you want, but sometimes, especially when you are trying a level for the first time, it is better to press “Recommended” which will pick the best available ghosts in your army for said level. Once you’re in, there are 4 main features you must worry about: Haunters, Fetters, Plasm and Mortals.  There are 47 playable ghosts and you can choose where to place them and which powers they can use. You can’t directly control them, so you need to learn when and which powers you want each of them to use and which orders to give (Allow a ghost to go after someone on its own or even use a certain power when no one is around). You start off by commanding a small army of classic horror characters, like the jack-of-all-trades ghost Boo or the glowing poltergeist Whirlweird. You will also be able to rescue restless spirits throughout the game (every level has at least one of these), increasing your army’s size and versatility. These trapped ghosts need to be set free but that is easier said than done. During the first levels, most ghosts are fairly easy to recruit; maybe you’ll need to destroy the fetter they’re on or scare someone they hated when they were alive. Later, though, there are a couple of complex puzzles you need to solve that require a lot of planning – make a certain person use a fetter or carry something across the building to a certain location. These are hard to figure out but extremely satisfying when solved. There are 6 kinds of ghosts in the game: Sprites, Disturbances, Elementals, Vapours, Frighteners and Horrors. Each type of ghost has a certain area of expertise. Sprites, for instance, consume little to no plasm (the game’s “resource”), which allows them to use most of their powers early on. They are usually bound to smaller fetters, usually electrical, and can make them malfunction and cause blackouts or power surges. Horrors and Frighteners, on the other hand, consume large amounts of plasm and can terrorize mortals like no one else can. They can possess humans and materialize into gruesome sights, making them useful to get rid of humans who are harder to scare. Ghosts can also level up; the more you use a certain ghost in the field, the higher its training level. Higher levels mean you will be able to give said ghost a bigger number of ever more complex orders, making its powers more effective and allowing you to let it haunt on its own, while you focus on something else. There are 8 training levels for each ghost. Fetters are where you can place your ghosts. You can’t just simply place them wherever you want, which makes planning ahead and ambushing something to consider. Certain ghosts can only be bound to mirrors, for example, making them very useful if used strategically, while others can be bound to sleeping mortals, children, water or even emotional objects. There are 2 kinds of plasm. Normal and gold.  Regular plasm is something you need to summon ghosts and to use their powers. The stronger the ghosts, the more plasm they need to be bound to a fetter and the harder it gets to manage used and available plasm. Plasm is not spent – rather, you allocate an amount of available plasm to a ghost. If you need a certain haunter to use a more powerful spell, you can just unsummon one of the other fettered ghosts so the used plasm doesn’t surpass the maximum amount of available resources or make it use a weaker power which does not use as much plasm. Scaring people is the only way of earning a bigger plasm threshold – that is quite simple and straight forward when you need to scare all the mortals away from a level; on the other hand, when you get to levels where you can’t scare any of them away or you have a more subtle objective that doesn’t involve scaring, it is a rather tense experience. It is all a matter of balance. Failing to do so will have you banned from the mortal realm and you’ll have to try again. Gold Plasm can be used to buy new powers for your ghosts. You can usually choose different powers for ghosts in the same category, making a more versatile army. Gold Plasm is earned by completing levels and time trials. Each mortal has a Terror (Red), Belief (Blue) and Madness (Yellow) bar. Some powers cause belief; mortals with low belief are less affected by terror – so you’ll want to increase all sceptics’ belief before attacking them with your terror powers; this will generate more plasm – so you can power-up stronger powers or bind more haunters. You can also take over a human’s mind, making them go insane. People with phobias or older individuals are more susceptible to this. When a mortal’s willpower reaches its Terror or Madness cap, mortals will either flee or go crazy. Mad mortals provide great entertainment and can also help you – terrorizing the rest of their fellow humans with their insane actions.  A big part of humans you use to your advantage is fear – conscious and subconscious. All mortals have them. There are some powers that allow you to uncover said fears. When you know what a certain person is afraid of, you’ll be able to use powers which are absurdly more effective than most others. If someone is afraid of blood, for instance, you can just attract the mortal to a bathroom and use a power that turns water into blood, or make it come out of the walls or even flood the whole room with it. Same goes for spiders, darkness, being trapped or even loud noises. Fortunately, mortals are not defenseless. You will meet humans that can banish your ghosts from the mortal realm, thus, making them unusable until the end of the haunting. From witches that summon protective circles, to exorcists, you’ll have to battle with all of them to be successful. Mortals’ AI isn’t all that great; they get stuck fairly often and they tend to do the opposite of what you want them to do. Pathfinding is also an issue when the action takes place in smaller areas. You do feel like you are haunting a small town because some of the characters you meet during the first levels will show up later in different locations and they also have the same fears and personalities. Levels are extremely well designed and varied– Mortals have a lot of escape routes to temporarily run away from your ghosts and you will need to improvise new tactics and approaches because humans will react to pretty much everything you do. Graphics are colorful and the game doesn’t take itself too seriously – which is quite refreshing, in my opinion. It is quite rare for a game about being a ghost and scaring people to embrace such a tongue-in-cheek, comedic approach. Ghost Master also features a soundtrack I consider perfect. It sets the right atmosphere from the very beginning and I still listen to it from time to time. This game pays clear homage to classic horror tropes; you’ll get the ghost bride that was left at the altar and even the headless horseman who was killed during the civil war. As you can see, movie references are scattered all over the game and characters and levels are smartly named “after” classic movies –“Phantom of the Operating Room” / “Blair Wisp Project”. A game that I recommend to everyone. It may look a little bit dated and it may have flimsy AI, but Ghost Master is an inventive game that brings us new gameplay mechanics and is undeniably a game brought to us by people who love and care for their work. The attention to detail and the countless amount of movie references and replay value make it my favorite game of all time.  Final Score: 9 out of 10.",

In this case, you'll control a group of ghosts, called 'haunters', in an attempt to scare the hell out of mortals. It's a Strategy/Puzzle game, and some missions require you to complete different tasks from scaring. Most of these special tasks involve using mortals to interact with certain objects that your ghosts can't use (not correctly, at least). All the ghosts are unique as each one of them as their starting skills and base behaviour (altough many details are never addressed by the game, it's something you pick up with experience). All of them have their special fetter, or a place where you can 'bind' them, or summon them in the livings' world. Fetters vary from free roaming to being linked to a peculiar condition, with varying rarity. Often, strict links mean powerful ghosts. Most of the ghosts will be locked at the beginning, and will need to be rescued during missions. Each one of them as its unique rescuing requirement. But I already spoiled too much, I'll let your curiosity take over and try out this little art piece ;).",

But you have to find entities along your travels as you haunt locations to bolster your ranks, and you can only control as much entities as your feter power allows so some thinking is required.  And to scare the hell out of people, you have to tether your entity to it's type, for instance entities that use power and electricity have to be tethered to electrical items such as TVs, Hoovers etc. Fire types can obviously be tethered to fire items, like cookers, barbecues and so on.  It gets more complicated when you realize that people have different fears and are immune to specific hauntings, so then you have to get them to a room where you can haunt them, and that is easier said than done.  Ignore the 0.4 hours played, I have played this title retail many years ago and for some reason Steam didn't log the 30 hours I put in to it. Besides it is an enjoyable game and not an expensive one, I would recommend picking this up along with Evil Genius if you can, that is also a great game.",

            "review_text": "Ok, after playing through act 1 and currently on act 2, i will say this,  Ever got so annoyed by the sims? you know the ones you keep killing just for laughs? Well, if you ever wanted to scare them silly, than this game is for you.  Ghost Master is one of those games which can be really fun, along with what i heard as 47 playable ghosts, to the missions you get and pretty much gameplay which can be really hilarious at times, Ghost Master can be really awesome...  If not for a few flaws, Like. Bugs. Oh dear god. i think i had to restart one mission because of a bug that wouldn't let the people find a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book even though it's on the floor AND right in front of them, the AI can be a bit silly/bad at times and the graphics are kinda dated today.  BUT. However, i would actually reccommend this game, why? Because it's literally one of those games where you can sit back and laugh your ♥♥♥ off on how cheesy/B-Movie it is. from stereotypes to scaring the entire police force (Seriously, thats a mission.). Sure i ran into a few bugs here and there but that didn't stop me, all you do is restart the mission, simple as.   Missions go like this, 'Do this and that.' BUT the mission you will come across most of the time is, 'Scare everybody.' Scare OR you can drive them to Insanity. This tells me you can have alot of fun replaying the missions with the new ghosts you have acquired or try and make them all insane. Which i will admit, was hard at first.  All in all, i would say this game is an 8/10, good game but a few flaws.  tl;dr  -PROS- Replayable Missions. Cheesy/Narmy. Variety in Ghosts you can use.  -CONS- Bugs. Cheesy/Narmy. (Why is this on here on both? depends on the person.) Dated Graphics(which, if you can look past, is a minor nitpick at best.)",

One negative however is some levels can be a bit tedious (I'm looking at you hospital stage!) and it also looks a little dated now but on the whole it's a great game with lots of in-game unlockables and with the current cost at £0.74 you'll probally not find a better value game on Steam if you want a spooky sims like title.",

You will run into the Ghostbreakers (Look like the Ghostbusters) and Mediums who will try to capture your ghosts. each level has othe ghosts you can free and some have hidden ghosts. The only 2 annoying things about this game is if you don't free certain ghosts, you don't have much of a chance to beat the game and you have to rely on the AI of certain characters in the game to help you beat certain levels.  Other than that, fun game at a very low price.",
