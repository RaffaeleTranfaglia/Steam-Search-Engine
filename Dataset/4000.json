Not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion NPCs at the same time, it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes, such as Trouble In Terrorist Town (TTT) and Prop Hunt. Both are absolutely hilarious, these fairly small items already make it an EPIC piece of software. Then there's Sledding, Gmod Tower and countless others that make it even more amazing. G'mod's a gem, don't even hesitate to get this one!",

However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.",

The exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future.    Because the program, which is known as 'Garry's Mod' was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project.   I advise you to avoid Garry's Mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects: Withdrawl after play, Major Obsession, Self-Neglect, Self-Mutilation (typically when the game crashes), Emotianally Distant, and sever Cravings.

In this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents. That's a really short describtion but it's basically it. TTT is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time.   Secondly, there is Prophunt. In Prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props. This gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as TTT.   Last example is Deathrun. Like the name says, this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death. Deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often. Nevertheless, it's fun!  Of course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Want to do a survival gamemode(like minecraft and Rust, but just smaller)? Done. The point I'm trying to get across is that when you buy this game, you can technically call it buying a bunch of games. To me, this is just the kick-off point of the game. Games like Murder and Slender are fairly new gamemode.Oh and dont forget the Workshop! The community is great. Which, is actually where you install some of the game modes. Also, the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game. From the workshop, I can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few NPC's to test it on. So, anyhow, if you are looking for a game with a wide choice of playing, choose this game. You won't regret it.",

Often, if using the right graphics card, a picture can look crisp, clean and even outperform Source Film Maker in terms of quality.  However, there is one massive downfall that Garry's mod regularly faces, this downfall is its addons, not that the content is bad, a large majority is awesome to say the least. But, the real downfall is that there seems to be NO MEANS of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes. That's what really makes it fall down MASSIVELY.  As an example, you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly, WHAM! A bolt of pure inspiration hits you, you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true! But then, you load up Garry's Mod and check to see if all your mods are there...  ...You see that it says 'NO MODS FOUND!' it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself, and it's rather dull without the mods, as you have very limited resources to play with, even if it's a sandbox game. Truth is, the game is still confined to all the items within the Source engine, these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary Source textures.   So you're probably wondering... why the hell would someone buy a game that's so plain, boring and buggy?  Well, let me give you an answer, the community. There are literally BILLIONS of mods for Garry's mod that exist as of this current moment in time, there is also a random peice of information that I happen to know and it's the following:  At least one thing is submitted to the Garry's mod workshop every 0.5 seconds at least.  This means that the workshop is still growing, even now whilst you are reading this. But that's not all that's on offer, you have the whole internet at your fingertips (trust me, google is your friend). If you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff, it'll be incredibly enticing to buy Garry's mod.  Overall, I'd say YES to reccommending this game, but I'd attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere... it's not bad, but it's not exactly value for money either.",

TTT : It's so Fun, Unqiue Idea , and it's really amazing made out of a really simple idea which you can still play for hours and you won't get bored.  Prop Hunt : It's like hide and seek but for adults !! It's amazing .. it might get boring but you'll laugh your ♥♥♥ off while playing this smexy mod.  Stop it slender : Not so much of a famous mod but it's scary . the best of it while playing with friends which also shows that garry's mod can be used in such different genres of mods and games.  Murder : Another idea like TTT , but this one i didn't like much but it's still fantastic.  Normal Sandbox : This one is the original gmod , do what ever the hell you want for the sake of lulz.  Sled Build : It's also great and quite unique , making your own ideas for a sled become true .. all you need is just to think xD.  RolePlay : I don't like much but it's great .. this mod is used in other games but the best in gmod.  JailBreak : not so many servers or players playing this but it's unique and it's also in another games .. but it's no the best gameplay in gmod.  So ...

So let's start from workshop, on GMod workshop you could find a huge amount of pointless, poorly made Dupes/Saves/Weapons that are just same and same category(A good example could be M9K or FNAF, yes you dont get to see anything special very often), but if you get to see addon that someone put effort in and didn't used a template, author must be experienced.  Most of servers are just s***, having only Coderhire and random Workshop addons, but if you get to see a server with most of stuff self-made and without 12-years old admins, you shouldn't miss it.  Community is filled with 12-years olds(especially on sales), Thought they're uncommon on not-so-popular servers, but if you get to see a good community that doesn't just bans you for smallest mistakes, you still shouldn't miss it(Even in Garry's Mod, you could meet your worst nightmare, '12-years old server owner').  But, unlike most of sandbox games, Garry's Mod could be edited to any other game genre, a good example could be Prophunt, where 'Props' have to hide from 'Hunters' by changing their model to any physics prop they could find.  Also, GMod could be a good alternative to SFM, since in GMod Sandbox, you could pose 'ragdolls'(character bodies) to any pose, and with specific tools you could really make something really interesting.  And the final rating is: 9.5/10 - Garry, you should listen to your community and stop making money off Rust(which is another story).

With those tools, you can make odd contraptions and vehicles or you can just place objects and characters to make silly scenes for screenshots or videos. Want to slap some car tires on a bath tub and have a race with your buddy? No problem. Want to construct a massive robot out of refrigerators and washing machines? Possible, if difficult. It is all up to you really.  However, Gmod can be as complicated as you want it to be. With extensions like wiremod and other mods you can really get in-depth with the engineering/coding and design things like automatic machine gun turrets. Some of the built-in construction materials also lend themselves to building rather complex machines and structures.   Gmod also has rather good integration of the Steam Workshop and you can use it to share your own creations or to check out other player's stuff. Gmod is most assuredly a game for the creative mind to express itself in a variety of ways.",

You can create nearly anything in the source engine, with the right addons, and if you aren't very good, there are youtube videos on it all. I got into this game after the main yogscast channel showed off the addon pack for making space ships. I spent hours in this, and using the base creation tools, before I found out how awesome the multiplayer gamemodes are. I am not sure how many are made by Facepunch studios, but it is through their work that so many are able to easily experience projects made by single people, or budding indie devs of the future. The other types of people are those who spend all of their time on Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Murder, or Prophunt, or any of the main game modes. Heck, you and your friends can walk into a virtual cinema and watch all of SeaNanners's and the yogscast's videos to learn about them! This game has everything apart from what you can imagine. All you have to do is make it.",

Released it 2004 (same year when Source engine was released) and it wasn't been forgotten since. 1,000+ funny and useful addons to download in the Steam Workshop. You can do literally anything with the .lua and Source engine combined such as modelling and scripting.  The not-so recent 13 update broke almost every addon that existed. But also added ALOT of new features. Such as Kinect controlling.  Garry's Mod is an unforgettable game that made internet so funny with G-Man and TF2 classes.  Main objective of this game is having fun and wasting time with friends or doing posters/videos.",

Now that I have got that out the way, this is garrys mod the great sandbox game? I'm sorry but this is NOT a sandbox game. This is a special game in the way of HEY HEY DUDE LETS GO JAM A MILLION ADDONS ONTO THIS GAME AND MAKE IT CRASH WHEN WE SPAWN IN SOMETHING!!!11 That is sadly what I do now, but this game is great seriously. Look at the pictures jesus it already looks good... and then you buy it.  lets hope that you own EVERY SOURCE GAME EVER well, any by valve or a mod thats gone mainstream (zombie panic etc.) because trust me. all the mapmakers love their assets not beingincluded within the files. I can't go into the mechainics either because this game is what you want it to be! Well to be honest their are a few things.  PHYSGUN: the thing you use for moving 'props' and 'ragdolls' and it wouldn't be garrys mod without the thing.  TOOLGUN: you get to do stuff... you've possibly seen it in the screen shots with the derpy faces.  ENTIRE HL2 ARSENAL: umm... do I need to even speak about the stuff? also if you haven't played HL2 yet then uh, don't kill yourself and buy it.  And now for uh... Lingo Buster 9001!!!  SANDBOX: its a sandbox, do whatever you want in it, crap in it for all I care. (ITS ALSO THE DEFAULT GAMEMODE FOR THE POSING N STUFF)  ADDON: a fancy way of saying mod but it isn't exactly a mod. For example a addons adds something new but dosent change a few lines of code.   MODELS: you'd know what models are if you looks at the banner, screensshots etc. and this also segways into!  RAGDOLLS AND PROPS: ragdolls are basically things that move when you move them around and you also pose them to do uh... things that are innocent and the complete opisi-UGHRRR GROSS while props on the otehr hand are things you can't pose but can move around and stick to each other and do some pre-tty cool stuff with.  SCARY G-MAN VIRUS: RUN, RUN SO FAST, TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER NEVER GO ONTO A SERVER THAT SAYS... Gmod tower server 2 on sandbox on the map flatgrass?! or atleast anything with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ name. For example DUUUUHH I LIKE BUHTS and FURRIES FTW.  This game gets a ?.?/10 because this game is anything you want it to be like i said a million times and you can cause the game to crash. It's all up to you in mod-gameish of the year 2004-93819823612783512734512412572648 (no but seriously how many version of garrys mod are there!?!?)",

Somebody will always be more notable than you, for better or worse. 6. You'll always meet that one guy who is a master at almost everything, but akward to be around. Chances are they are an Admin 7. Servers with custom ranks are guranteed to be a little sketchy 8. More often than not, somebody will scream out DarkRP rules on your sandbox server. 9. Ever hear the phrase RDM where it doesnt belong? Note Note 8 10. All Admins have different personalities, and odds are, you cant please all of them. Stick to rules 3 and 4. 11. Admins may have a Domino effect, so try to please atleast one as a friend. 12. Quality over Quantity? Who says? 13. DONT. Be. A child.

Launching back in 2006 the game has seen steady success in that time selling millions of copies through the Steam platform.  To take your sandbox experience one step further Garry’s Mod also offers ragdoll options where you can bring in a model from a Source game and pose it in a variety of ways. This feature has proven popular with video makers in particular as it easily lets you create your own machinimas.  For those that want to play around with physics instead you’ll also find a realistic physics engine backing up the GMod experience which creates hours of fun as you test your creations.   Of course robust multiplayer is an important element to the Garry’s Mod experience with plenty of servers always online and a large community constantly creating new things both for and with Garry’s Mod thanks to the Lua scripting language (also used in Roblox).  For both creators and players Garry’s Mod has a lot to offer and its popularity still stays strong even many years after its first release, a testament to how great the experience is.

You can find other games, and invest hundreds of hours into them, but at the end of the month, you find yourself wishing you could just play some more Garry's Mod. I don't have over 450 hours into it for nothing, and, compared to some of the people I've met and talked to over the internet, that's not even that much to invest into a single game.  It's setup into different gamemodes. There's classic sandbox, where you can build and screw around on any amount of maps, with NPC's and other Mechanics. There's Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), where a few people are randomly selected as 'traitors', and try to kill the other players on the server, while 'innocents' and 'detectives' are trying to figure out who the Traitors are. I owned a Server for TTT, and I have to admit most of my hours are into asmuch.  A few things to note; First off, it's not the most well-optimized game out there. I have quite an expensive computer, but it still takes forever to load into the game, and will crash periodically, for no reason. I used to play on a DarkRP server (another gamemode) called Serious Roleplaying Hell, or SRH for short, and while that thing had a 'hell' of a lot of 'serious' items for 'roleplaying' (I am so sorry), the game lagged the devil out of itself, while a lot of games would be able to handle something like that without too-much-trouble.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it has Workshop support. Maps, NPC's, Models, Ragdolls, Machines, Weapons, and loads of other Misc. Content fills Garry's Mod, and has been on the second page of Workshop contributators for a while, if not the first one.  Overall, between the content, the Price (especially 2+ years later, when the price has dropped $10), all the dfferent gamemodes (Besides Sandbox, TTT, and DarkRP, there is also Prophunt, Murder, a DayZ Spinoff, and countless others), it's a great game that's totally worth it.

Yay!; Memory bug: If a major game function is stuck on a loop, it'll take a lot of RAM. No joke. In order to fix this, you must restart the game. Or let it crash. Next up, and finally this is the last of the major bugs, The physics bug: Source Engine never expect a game like this to be created, so you'll find lots of rather funny bugs, and lots that are simply useless and need to be fixed. Oh well, nothing will change the fact that Source Engine was horribly written, and given any chance, and programmer (including me), could fix it. It's not FUBAR, just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But all in all, the game is fun, halarious, crazy, and time consuming. I'd recommend it to anyone. Just beware of the bugs I've mentioned, they are real and common. Yes, you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you're hauling money in dark RP, and then you get this awesome idea to make binds for ♥♥♥♥ and so on, so bam you go to open console and CRASH! Just don't break anyhting, you'll get use to it sooner or later. One more thing, this game does have great memory. If you load into a server more than once, each time you'll load faster. The first time you may have to download stuff, the next you'll have it, you may go from hours on the first load, to minutes on the next, to seconds after the 30th load in. It's always nice to know gmod has SOME level of niceness. Whatever, just get the damn game and enjoy it, you'll love it. Just keep your addons on the low, and it breaks often.",

To fix this, either buy the Counter Strike GO game or get the textures online and copy/paste files. That's pretty much all i can say for the cons of G-mod. There are so many good things about Garry's Mod i cant explain them all in one review so here are some of them: There are many gamemodes to play such as Sandbox [Build whatever you want or kill people], Zombie RP [Roleplay with zombies!], Dark RP [Roleplaying for your satisfaction], Prop Hunt [As a prop, hide somewhere where you wont be seen; As a hunter hunt down the hidden props but watch your health!], and so much more. If you dont like the normal Half Life 2 guns or style of it just go check out the wonderful addons for G-mod! There is so many addons such as TDM Cars [Realistic cars], The Slow Motion Mod [When activated makes everything go in slooooooww moooottiiiiooooon], World War 2 Soldiers [WWII soldiers textures, NPCs, and skins], and so much more. So, there is only one question: 'Is it worth my money?' And the answer is 'Yes! definetely get it!'",

Anyways, Garry's Mod is definetely a game you would want to purchase first-hand if you are a new Steam User since it is played by many people and is loads of fun. You can download mods and mess with them, or you can play on a server with multiple people while played one of the downloadable gamemodes available. I like the idea that people in the Steam community can finally put their creativity to the test and create something that would entertain thousands of people. Imagine the guy who created Murder and how successful he/she feels that they made something worth mentioning to people they know!",

It has one of the most active and varied communities of any game I’ve ever played, and for the most part a good community at that (if you don’t like voice chat I’d recommend against playing on RP servers). The game is great if you have no idea what to do due to its vast array of content both official and community made. It’s also very easy to get into with clear labeling of all the tools you have at your disposal (Although it can get very complex and time consuming if you let it). Overall a amazing game for pretty much any type of gamer due to its shear amount of content (which is unmatched in my opinion by any other game on steam). Furthermore it’s not incredibly expensive for the base game, but BUYER BEWARE you will need all the source games in order to have the FULL experience; although it’s very easy to have fun with none of them or very few such as CS: Source and, TF2 (these are all you really need if you want to play online to the full experience). I personally would recommend this game to everyone I know that has ANY interest in a physics based sandbox with combat elements or just to mess around. For the price it’s a great game to look into, and it goes on sale often so even if you don’t pick it up at full price consider getting it during a sale.  SHORT REVIEW: Pro's: Good physics engine  Near unlimited content (workshop) Easy to get into Great multiplayer (lots of modes) Good price for the amount of content Single player is just as good Ability to have complete freedom over what you do (Great Sandbox gameplay)  Cons: (May) Have to buy additional games to have to complete experience Mic spam Poor combat model Graphics are dated in some places Resource intensive (may need a good computer) May need to download packs for servers manually Greifing is common in some multiplayer game types Little help from ingame tutorials (Lots of tutorials online)",

I have 0nly good experience from this game and I think Everyone should have this one [And its super cheap!] Think of this You buy Minecraft for 20$ and all you get is some multiplayer with no voice chat and simple building an surviving its fun but its not the cool exeperience you will get from Gmod where you can Voice chat / RolePlay /Survive zombie apocalipses / Murder some folks / Have a pirate war / Build a pirate ship /  Build ... I Could continue all Day just writing down this list.  Also there is a workshop feature to this game and it supports all ''Valve'' Games !  You will need Conter-Strike source to get the full experience from the game but you can allways use  workshop to fix this by downloading css content packs !

            "review_text": "'What is it?' is probably the most frequently asked question about G-Mod. This ever changing game has left many with that question unanswered. Today we seek to have that question answered. Today we will leave that question unanswered. Welcome to Garry's Mod.  I suppose I should start with the gameplay. That is just the unique thing about G-Mod though. It has no one set gamemode. The whole point of G-Mod is to test, create, and try out the many different gamemodes you can download from the Steam Workshop. They are fun and there is a great variety to chose from. The game also comes with two preloaded gamemodes. Trouble in Terrorist Town and Sandbox. Sandbox is basic build/do whatever you want gamemode, while Trouble in Terrorist town is a murderer/detective style gamemode. Both are fun and intuitive. The sandbox gamemode gives you more freedom, but has a bit of a larger learning curve. The Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode is a bit more for those who are accustomed to games like Unreal Tournament or Counter-Strike. I personally prefer playing on the Sandbox gamemode as it allows you to build anything you want via the tools provided within the Source Engine.   You might still be wondering: 'What exactly do you do in Garry's Mod?' Well to answer your question, just about anything you want! That is what makes Garry's Mod so amazing...the freedom limited by unlimited boundaries.  Now as for the graphics. They are good. The Source Engine does an excellent job of creating a beautiful, fluid, and realistic world. For being an engine almost 10 years old it still does not falter in it's quality.  The sound is anything but a disappointment. It is loud, powerful and moving. Because this is primarily a Sandbox game it gives the user freedom to add on their own sounds or sound effects from the workshop. I cannot tell you how many times I have been playing on some kind of a Horror Map and the key element was the loud and pulsing sound. A screech coming from behind, sounds like a real screech from behind.   Ok, now for Lasting Appeal. Ummmm...hmmmm. About as unlimited and ongoing as you want it to be. Simple as that.  All in all, this is a great game for Minecraft lovers (14 and up :) and Source Engine developers alike. Why? Well...cause it's G-Mod of course! And what is that exactly? Well, let's not go down that road...  Overall Rating: 8/10  Presentation: 9/10 Multiplayer: 6/10 Gameplay: 7.5/10 Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Lasting Appeal: 10/10  Overall Rating: 8/10",

There are many unique players that play this game, as well as many chances to become a moderator/admin on your favorite server, if you live up to the expectations! Create a base and go out to mug people and steal, or build a gun shop with guards defending it! Sell drugs and illegal guns, or be a SWAT and bust into the criminal's house to put him behind bars! I currently have spent well over two years on this amazing game! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! Give me a friend request, and we'll play together!",

So to start off your new sandbox adventure start off with the free Source game TeamFortress 2. The more Source games you own the more powerful your game becomes, because with more sources of games the more items there are to use. Now we all know there are millions of add-ons for this game thanks to the community, and of course not all of them are going to work. Dont let that bring you down, its not that hard to learn LUA (the coding launguage for most add-ons in Garry's mod.) Games I reccomend having for this game: Half-life 2, Half-life 2: episode 1, Half-life 2: episode 2, Counter strike: source, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 dead, Left 4 dead 2. Keep in mind you need to have them installed for them to work on Garrys' mod.  Now this game does take time to learn how to use your tools, and phys gun (the main tool for prop, ragdoll, or really anything) manipulation. If needed go check out some tutorials online. Once you understand the basics the limits are up to you. Using anything, (from the Source games you have installed to your pc), to create anything you desire. This game is incrediable, easy to make servers allow you and your friends to play. Using the Community made add-ons bring in things that are not already in the game to your hands, well your in-game hands. Create things and share them with the Community, your options are only limited to your imagination. Using the Source engine, Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox games, in my personal opinion.  Now grab your chair, turn off your alarm clock, call in sick for work, make sure you mouse has batteries, just in case grab a spare, put your phone on silent, now pre... wait grab some drinks and food. NOW, press buy, then install and click play........ Your new sandbox adventure has just started.",

If you want the grease from playing this to oil up your lanterns and man boobs, BUY THIS! Oh, and Garry's a totally awesome guy.. Really THE BEST DEV EVER!!!!!",

For players who just want to create stuff, destroy stuff, and have a good time with friends, Garry's Mod is the perfect game for you. Want more memes? Check out the workshop for Garry's Mod, packed with over 700,000 weapons, maps, props, player models, NPC's (Non Playable Characters. Aka: Bots, Computer controlled players, etc.), and more!   Want various game modes? Done. There are tons of fun, strategic, and funny game modes available for Garry's Mod to make your experience that much better! Best of all, it's made by the community! Everyday players create these exciting game modes for your entertainment (creators of content are not required to make game modes, so don't go demanding it from them and threaten to contact the developers of Garry's Mod, because the community wasn't hired by FacePunch, so they won't come charging in to the rescue just because of that.)  Although the game engine that Garry's Mod runs on is VERY old and should be remade to be better, Garry's Mod has so much potential in it, which has been fulfilled!

After a total of nine hours playing the game, NUMEROUS mod testing and observations I`ve come to conclude that this game is meant for ANY type of gamer. Lots of ideal game modes, game maps, mods for extra weapons and the above. I really like how skins just make a whole diffrent experience while gaming in a new world as one of your favorite characters by Valve and etc. Lots of sick block busting weapons call out to you when subscribing to mods at the workshop. I highly recomend to check out what I am subscribed to (thanks to a little someone) and to TRY out the parkour mods. Adds realism to the already fictionized game world.    This universal game gets you addicted after you finnally load that level, whether or not your online with peeps or just experimenting on your own blank canvas. I highly recomend a decent computer video card (NVIDIA if i spelt it right! Or anything that can run Fallout 3 - Elder Scrolls IV - Oblivion (Bethesda) ) and at least good internet to get a good ping. Most of my friends play Team Fortress 2, and my ping level to MVM servers or regular comunity servers is at your standard 69 -70. Not all bad, especially for Gmod, but besides some lag spikes and frozen computer screens you need to close down immediately with the task mannager, the Game is not that all a PAIN!    I really like weapons and the maps, umm... Not really much to say now but to thank again those who also recomended Gmod to me, thankyou! Im just passing down the torch to one of the BEST FPS of all time!   Side Notes - I may add more to this if i find more stuff out but so far besides how my PC handles it, its fine. Its worth the $9.99, but sometimes they hype down to $4.99 or one time: $1.99 on the market. But really all togethger just get the game!|",

You can build on maps that have been preloaded for building creations so wacky and enevitably crash your computer from a prop that accidently got welded to the floor. So, what do you do when you have finished all of the wacky stuff you can do alone? You add more people! You can host servers from a plethera of gamemodes that are made by the players, for the players. So what if you were building a roller coaster that became so boring that you thought of just ditching the idea? Now you can have people that know how the game works and teach you how to make them actually work, and make you go from Falcon Punch to Facepunch! (Sorry, one bad pun quota is needed for a game as silly as this!) Make new friends or tragic enemies as they blowup your building made completely out of wood!

Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun.  This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect.  This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do.  To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.",

At its core it's a sandbox but if you're the type that needs an objective to have a good time there are plenty of gamemodes that can completely change the way you play.   For $10 or the price of one of the packages that includes it, Garry's Mod really is a must-have for anyone that enjoys stupid fun from time to time.",

            "review_text": "Garry’s Mod, a very large game by Facepunch Studios. It gives you the power to do so much and yet it always ends the same way, with blood splattered on the walls. To describe Garry’s Mod is hard but possible, and in sections is the best way to do it.  Garry’s Mod is all about creation, it was originally designed as a sandbox game, where you can spawn hundreds of props in, weld them together and make incredible things. But that was a long time ago and Garry’s Mod isn’t just a game for welding things, now you can use winches, rope, hover balls, emitters, and a very large assortment of weapons.  The game requires a few other games to be installed to see everything though. Source Mod games, the minimum amount of games you’ll need to see the most are the games; Team Fortress 2, Counterstrike: Source and Half Life: Source. The game can still be played without them but is better with them, you can spawn in props and characters from those games too. If you like the medic from TF2 why not rebuild the ‘Meet The Medic’ video clip.  Over the years of people playing around with Garry’s Mod extra game modes were born; Spacebuild (original mod removed), Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, DarkRP, Sled Build, Bomber Man and many more. These game modes change the way Garry’s Mod played, from once a game about welding to watermelons together and then blowing them up, to thing like finding a traitor and killing him, running from a knife wielding murderer, hiding as a pot plant in the snow and dropping explosive watermelons hoping to win the game.  Apart from the sandbox, hundreds of servers and many game modes; Garry’s Mod also has Steam Workshop support so you can share your creations, download others and play with them or even change the way the game plays like getting a tool that lets you change the weight of an object, a tool that makes props larger or smaller, a gun that shoots Nyan Cats and nuclear bombs you can strap to awesome looking cars that have thrusters stuck to its rear and have a big ramp in front of it hoping to make a big bang so to speak.  If you’re the type of person who likes building things, this is for you. If you’re the type of person who likes killing people, this is for you. If you’re the type of person who likes running into a war zone with balloons stuck to your ears then this is for you. This game is incredible and fit’s almost everyone’s needs; horror, sandbox, building, strategy, comedy and more.  If I were to follow my normal rules for reviewing games and rating them out of 10. I’d be lowering the rating millions of times over to make it low enough to fit. It is extremely fun and the rating 10/10 is an understatement. ",

It was built for modding, or at least it feels like it, with a well done workshop integration and a massive, but albeit toxic, community, you can change things up or do as I did and go way overboard with the mods.

Try Trouble in Terrorist Town, maybe a roleplay game, or the good old classic build. Whatever you choose, it's your game.  Powered by Source, garry's mod allows for a lot of customization.

I would give it a 4/10 due to the unrealistic graphics and sprinting animations ( REMEMBER YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADD MODS ON THE WORKSHOP INTO THE GAME)  Now,For the gameplay In Garry's Mod the game is full of Gamemodes such As TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town ) Prop Hunt and much more This game gives a better feel to sandbox games ( Instead of old lame Minecraft )  All-and-All i would rate this game : 7/10",

            "review_text": "Anybody who is any sort of fan of Valve games must stick this one on their wishlist and grab it when they've got the dough to cherish this game. Garry's Mod, albeit just a utilisation of the standard game engine, playing online on this game shows off how far the community have taken this.  The game engine has been well and truly taken advantage of in a way that has flourished the creativity of gamers everywhere, yielding only a immersive and captivating online experience in modes such as Prop Hunt, Murder and Trouble in Terrorist Town. These game modes take place on well-known Counter Strike: Source maps and give Garry's Mod a familiar feel while uping the social advantages of having such an abudance of creative game modes.  Buying this game will ultimately provide you with enjoyment, and it's one of those games that everybody eventually needs to have. It's smooth and fun, fast-paced and exciting. A great advantage is that you can play it endlessly because there's so many different gametypes that everytime you get bored of one, there's always somewhere else you can go where you feel like you're playing a whole new game altogether.  So, why exactly should you buy it?  Prop Hunt (a Garry's Mod gametype) captures my attention the most; a hub for laughs as players disguise as objects to hide from 'hunters', the team that must eliminate the team disguising as props. It's like the game of hide-and-seek you always wish you had played as a child. It's tremendous.  'Trouble in Terrorist Town' (or 'TTT') is yet another gametype that can be pretty amusing. Basically, you can be innocent or you can be a traitor. The game assigns each person with one of those titles and then from there, nobody knows who is who. However, for the traitors, they see who else is a traitor and who isn't. Unsurprisingly, their job is to kill (without being caught), and it's fun trying to find out who the traitors are!  'Murder' is similar to TTT in a way that everybody appears the same. There's only one murderer, though, but nobody knows who it is, and only a select couple of bystanders (people who aren't the murderer) get a weapon. It's perhaps the most realistic simulation of being in a mental institution I have ever seen.  That's just a taste of Garry's Mod; due to its lively community, the creativity of what people can do with the Valve game engine is simply constant, and there's always something new to try.  ",

Also, it doesn't take the best hardware to run, so if you don't have the best PC, you can still play.",

That being said there are some issues that new players should be warned about, such as prop spamming lagging the game once you reach approximately 7000 props (only applicable in single player) so don't go trying to build a whole city from individual bricks :P The game also lacks performance server side due to compatibility with dedicated servers being 'Garbage' thus making it increasingly difficult to create a server let alone run a decent server with a decent prop limit. The positives however, far outweigh the negatives, making up for the difficulty found when creating a server by ensuring that, as long as your internet connection is above 500Kb/s, you should experience little if any lag on a server with a player limit of 20. The ability to use other steam games alongside Garry's Mod is another great feature of this game and is essentially the function that divides this game from other similar sandbox games. All in all I believe that Garry's Mod is a game worth buying and will give you hours of enjoyment and will grow to meet the demand of new players and in-game content.",

            "review_text": "♪Old man in a can-Banana plane-magic train! All sorts of creepy yet awesome thiiiiings!♪  The words for this game can't be easily expressed, seeing as the community for it is so vast in numbers. Everyday, new models and items are uploaded to the GMOD workshop for people to upvote and experiment with.  Whether it be an atomic bomb, or a giant robot which shoots rockets, I can assure you that it will amuse you. The little things in life can sometimes be the most appriciated.   The Multiplayer is even better than single player in my opinion. TTT being the best. Prophunt being a close second.  What is TTT? It is a game mode where you are a terrorist. These guys are surprisingly innocent. However, you have to watch out for the traitors who could shoot you in the face at any given moment in time. The detectives however are on the case! With health, DNA tools that let them find the Traitor, and a variety of special weapons in some servers. But beware! The traitors may or may not have the dreaded prop cannon, or melon gun which can kill you in one hit.  Now don't get me wrong, the Traitors may seem overpowered with a lot of 1-hit KO weapons, but it is all in fun. (Especially when a Traitor somehow manages to completly fail and kill himself.)  My word of advice for beginners to a gamemode such as this? DO NOT RANDOMLY KILL. All servers have mods or admins who will ban you if you get on and begin to 'RDM (Random Death Match)' Innocents, Traitors, and detectives. This isn't fun for others, and will likely end up with you never being able to play on that server again.  I could go on and on about what is so great about this game, but I suggest that you just find out for yourself.  A word of Forwarning however, it would be best if you bought the GMOD and Counterstrike source pack if you want to play TTT. There are patches to play as well, but I find it an honest waste of time.  Get in, and play. Join the fun that is GMOD in all its glory.",

That's just the thing though, Garry's Mod has a TON of different things worthy of writing a review over. It's one of the qualities about the game which many other sandbox games can't compete with.   Game Modes: I checked to see how many game modes showed up on my list just for the sake of the review and counted 63. Granted they aren't all popular, but it goes to show that there's an active community and many different things available to do.   Maps: There are a lot of maps available, some of them are extremely complex and it's pretty amazing. For example, they've taken Five Nights at Freddy's and made it into a map that you can walk around in. That in itself is pretty neat, the real cool thing is you can actually play Five Nights at Freddy's, jump scares and all. There are many other neat things you can find while exploring maps.   Servers: There are hundreds of servers available to play on. Many of them have special perks that make the server even more interesting. I've played on servers that have a point shop, you get points every so often for playing on the server. Then you can buy funny hats, trails or upgrades. There are also servers that also have a 'roll the dice' capability which either helps you win the round or makes it extremely difficult. That being said, there are also a lot of normal servers if you'd just like to get the hang of playing.   Community: Of course there are going to be a ton of raging kids on servers, but there are also a lot of mature people on there too. It depends on the server you play on. More often than not I've joined a game with fun people, so don't let the little kids make you change your mind about the game.  Counter Strike Source: The one complaint I have about this game is you need Counter Strike Source for most map textures. They should warn people that the game requires it to play from time to time. The most frequent question I see asked on servers is 'Why is everything pink and black?' or 'How come the textures aren't working?'.   I could keep on going through the vast amount of game modes and other qualities but I think I'll leave those experiences up for you to discover. :)  Overall: It's a hilarious game, well worth the $30 (including Counter Strike Source). You'll definitely get some good laughs.",

            "review_text": "As a Director and Actor, I can certainly see the appeal of GMod. It's astounding how many tools are at your disposal, how many items you can spawn in, and the number of pills that change every game session. I mean, you can either make a game about Mario and Captain America questing to destroy the Thunderbird or play unique chase games in the Ghostbuster car or in a Tonka Truck. But is the pure randomness of this game the only thing it has going for it. Is it overrated and is it worth the ten dollar price tag.  No. Maybe. and Maybe.  Maybe I should explain.   The randomness is certainly a major attractive point for players. With many user-created mods to mods from popular Valve games, you've got an unlimated amount of items, weapons, pills, and more to explore. I personally perfer the oddly catorted image of Mario as my skin, looking like a monkey with a Halloween costume. But my brothers perfer Ghost Rider and an Elderly man. Whatever your taste is, there is something for you. The items are very fun to use. Using a gun, you can move most items, rotating them or shooting them off. My personal favorite is a 10 story grave monument that shakes the ground when it lands.  This is an unforgettable game.  But as I look around Steam, I find people sinking 2000+ hours into this game. Is it fun? Hell yes. Is it good for movie making? Yeah. But two thousand hours is a lot, especially if you don't make movies. I feel like I've gotten a good amount of this game from 50 hours, but I play almost purely locally. Global servers are insane. The moderators often resort to limiting items to avoid Internet hell for those on board  Nothing more scary than an insane player with a rocket launcher online.  It is a good, 'game,' but I hear people put this high on their top games of all time. My brothers and I have created games from the multiple maps present and they definatly are fun but nothing I haven't experienced on other games. In short, this game is slightly overrated. Not a bad game, at all, just a quirky game, which some people are into that.  The ten dollar price tag is a concern for me. I feel this game should be no more than five dollars, since it is esentially a toolbox. Luckily, I was able to trade for my copy and I feel that is the way to go if you are feeling like picking this up.   OVERALL: 7/10. This game is defiently a game to at least try with friends once. Even without mentioning the fantastic, Trouble in Terrorist Town, this game has a lot going for it. I would not consider it a classic but it recieves it's own identity when the user created models and imagination shines through. The graphics range from, Ouija-bad, to, Intersteller-good, (cheers if you know exactly what I mean,), the tools are in depth, local multiplayer is a blast when globally, it is a nightmare. The tool system is deep and I highly recommend those going into animation to at least have this in your library.",

And to top is off there is a wide community with workshop items in them so when you get bored of the original game there is more and trust me you won't.  A few downsides though because this is a review. The loading times for some servers are an abomination taking around 20 minutes because of addons. You need to have counterstrike source and half life to have most of the textures for props. Very few people on there are abusive but only a few.  Edit: You might not want to buy this game anymore as you could easily get bored of some parts and some people you meet on the server are young people who scream in your ears. This includes some admins who abuse their power and ban you. I haven't seen many of these admins but you have been warned. As well as this DON'T DOWNLOAD MANY ADDONS, I say this as if you do you will have to wait while your game freezes and takes time to catch up.  Games still awesome though.  Those are my opinions.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

If you have $11, this is what you need to spend it on. The fact that you can do so much in one game makes it superior to a lot of other $60 games you would find on the steam store. The graphics are decent, the gameplay play is excellent, there is an infinite amount of replay value, and the community is great. What more could you ask for in a game  However, if you plan to play multiplayer, you will usually need textures. Really, the only 2 or 3 texture packs you will need for most servers are the Counter Strike: Source Textures, The Counter Strike: Global Offensive textures, and the Team Fortress 2 Textures. The only way to get these textures are buying the games. I myself do not have Counter Strike: Source, only Global offensive, and usually servers are very playable with just that. And besides, Counter Strike: Global Offensive is worth the $8 it usually goes on sale for. Team fortress 2 is free, and is another excellent game, so you shouldn't need to worry about that unless you do not have space on your computer for it.  Overall, that is the only problem I have ran into with this game. The rest of it I really enjoy, and was very happy to leave a review for the creators.  Overall, this game is definitely a 9.5/10.

But hey if you are still reading I might give you some info about this one. Let's keep it short, This is a game with cool physics and ragdoll stuff. Sandbox mode is the actual standard mode in which you can build everthing you want, you can save your creations and load it in another map, also you can just load creations from other people. BUT, there is much more than sandbox mode, this game includes many modes which you can consider games of their own. For example TTT in which there is one or multiple traitor(s) in a group of terrorist, the traitor(s) has/have to wipe out all terrorists and the terrorists have to wipe out the traitor(s). *  Conclusion: Gmod is a must have, you won't regret it. *I really recommend you buying the Garry's Mod + Counter Strike: source pack because many textures from CSS are being used in the game, otherwise you'll get black/purple colored textures.",

PROS: -Extremely easy to run (It's running on an engine over 11 years old) -Though the graphics are showing age, they are high standards if compared to a 7th generation console -VERY active modding community keeps the game alive (I'll go into more detail on this later. Scroll down if you wish) -Variety of fun and addicting gamemodes, which are still growing in numbers -Player hosted servers (Which is a good thing when you have a lot of them) -A good portion of the community is unserious and goofy, which can be very fun at times -It allows you to pull some content from other Source games (Half Life series, CSS/CSGO, Portal, TF2, etc.) -Playable on all the major computer operating systems -Plenty of servers  CONS: -Is one of those games that steam won't recognize as closed for a while -Some of the community is pretty taint, and either hate younger players, or take things way too seriously -Some bugs after updates, though they get patched within a week, usually -Without Counter Strike: Source, you'll be missing a lot of content for popular communtiy maps, so you'll get a bright purple checkerboard instead, or an error sign  MODDING: This is where the game really shines the brightest. The game's modding capabilities seem almost limitless, and with the Steam workshop you can get a mod with the click of your mouse and some download time. Making a map is simple, and familiar to anyone who has made maps for the Source or Goldsource engines. I haven't gotten any deeper in modding than maps, so I have no idea how hard it is to make those.  The biggest part of the modding has to be the gamemodes. Modders can make entire gamemodes from scratch. These include a lot of well known gamemodes (Due to YouTube popularity) such as Trouble in Terrorist Town (An addicting murder mystery game. Make sure you have Counter Strike: Source for this one, unless you choose to play MC themed maps,) prop hunt (You don't always need CSS for this one, but you'll want it,) DarkRP (It's taken seriously by many but when you get a group of unserious people it's a blast,) and many more gamemodes.  Oh, and there's also an easy to use Local Area Network (LAN) system, that works with any gamemode. ",

            "review_text": "Garry's Mod is exactly what it sounds like, a mod for Half-Life 2 made by a guy named Garry. But considering the fact that you're reading this right now, this part of the review is obsolete because I guarantee at least half of you already know that, so that is good, it means that there is still time to save yourself.   Of course, that's scratching the surface. On its own, Garry's Mod is a pretty simple game. You can spawn a couple item props, you can summon a bunch of Half-Life 2 NPCs so you can shoot them in the face, you can even throw props at NPCs and crush them sadistically without any remorse because they don't have a lot of dialogue that sets them apart from a pet cat. You can jump off a skyscraper and take like ten points of damage out of a hundred. You know, pretty simple stuff.   But that is also still just scratching the surface of the mosquito bitten skin, which is easily remedied with lemons. Sure, on its own, you might build a couple wooden boxes and break them because of how unbelievably fragile they are, but Garry's Mod really shines when you add MORE mods. To be specific, the Steam Community Workshop hosts a bunch of weapons, tools, and gamemodes that are made by a bunch of talented, crazy people who create some of the most bizarre, stupid things that should never work logically in a million years, but work in this chaotic mess.   You can spawn a terrorist with a lightsaber which you can battle with a DOOM Super Shotgun. If you want to get into posing but you have no freaking idea how to put the hat on the ragdoll, that is perfectly fine, someone already made a tool for that so that you can place a billion cosmetics on one TF2 Soldier, practically suffocating the poor guy. But hey, he knew what he signed up for, who cares if he looks like a clown? Gotta get those edgy action videos done. You can even download a lemon mod for those who enjoy citrus fruits.   Now, the gamemodes are pretty fun. There are things like Prop Hunt where you can dodge bullets as a can like a sneaky snake but then get blown up by that one jerk who decides to use his SMG grenade or play Trouble in Terrorist Town and never ever find the traitors until you get shot in the face. However, while experiences with gamemodes differ, I would have to offer a warning. Rules on each server vary. While that's agreeable, around half of the admins on DarkRP servers and Sandbox servers are usually something you should avoid. Another thing you should avoid are literally any person you find shady. Doesn't matter how friendly they seem, it usually ends in a shootout. Granted, if the server you are on allows weapons of any sort. But here's a solid tip I find is very helpful for when you want to have fun on a multiplayer server:   Do not join anyone's server. Make your own. Save yourself.   All in all, Garry's Mod is a solid game with a slightly insane player base filled with very passionate people. It's a place to have fun, mess around, and make impractical objects that you can fly to the stars if needed. Except on public servers where half of the fun things you can do is restricted by a myriad of redundant rules and overprotective admins. It's a great game to play with your friends, but an even more chaotic game to play with psychotic Internet strangers.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

Sandbox Physics aside, this game has an immense amount of content, from the maps, the gamemodes, the addons, the what have you, there is SO much to do.   Looking back at it, it's ironic. I was a young kid who older players didn't like playing with, and now I'm an older player who doesn't like playing with younger kids. At least at first, then I realised there's a me in each and every one of them.   Going from gamemode to gamemode, meeting new people, feeling the excitement that I felt playing new gamemodes that are now absolete and therefore dead and forgotten is something I'll always remember. Going from community to community, exploring maps and playing around with content that has been building up for YEARS. It was an amazing experience, being apart of gamemodes like Sassilization for example, that was a gmod topdown RTS that shut down, gamemodes people will never get the chance to play as they're long dead and gone. I imagine that the 12 year olds who ♥♥♥♥ moms now, will eventually keep playing, well into Gmod 2, until the point where they're older screaming at 12 year olds, reminiscing about when their favorite gamemodes were around.  I remember a time when Darkrp didn't have loads of workshop content shoved into the server, where  garrysmod.org  was the main place to get maps and addons, and where my favorite gamemodes were incredibly popular but now are broken and dead.   Nostalgia glasses taken off, it really is an amazing game that you may look back on the same way people look back at Halo 3's Forge, something you have fond memories of that is still around, but somehow not entirely the same.   or maybe it's just some ♥♥♥♥ing game where you can do a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ in idk",

Again, custimization such as, change your playermodel to any addon you've downloaded.  2. The only thing you pay for is the game itself, all mods and addons are completely free which is the best part.  3. Make anything!  4. So many maps to choose from.  5. Great graphics for an older game.  6. NPCs! Fun to mess around with.  7. Online Multiplayer, this is actually my favourite part.  8. Tons of gamemodes to choose from to play either by yourself, locally with a friend or family member, or online with tons of strangers!  9. Chat and Mic enabled!  10. Cheap!  11. Don't need internet to play. Let's say you don't have good enough internet to play online, you can play offline (only by yourself though)  12. Not rated! As in you can be peaceful and kid appropriate or make it as adult rated as any game!  Now the cons,  1. Glitches and bugs, for such a large game with so much to do everybody is going to experience a glitch or bug at some point.  2. Slow at startup and beginning new game.  3. Turn off backround programs as they can stop you from being able to join a local game. Not all backround programs as you'll need a couple to keep your pc from stopping but mailny anti-virus apps and big programs like that.  4. If you're looking to record for Youtube or Twitch its's almost impossible to use a free screenrecorder as alot don't like to (or can't for that matter) record most Steam games. If you want to record for free you'll have to just use a camera and hope the quality doesn't suck. Otherwise you'll have to pay.  5. If you think you don't need to download addons to have fun in this game... You're wrong. Unless you want to sit there with limited ammo, plain old default weapons and shoot at walls in the default maps and maybe hitting a couple default NPCs then be my guest, otherwise you'll be bored sh!tless. You. Need. Addons. But hey! They're free!  6. If you don't want to see a bunch of purple and black checkered, everything, in alot of popular multiplayer games, and addon maps then I reccomend buying. Yes buying, CSgo. What it does is fill in alot of the textures gmod doesn't have originally.  So there it is the pros and cons of Garry's Mod, I see the pros outway the cons so go ahead and try out gmod for yourself, it's worth it.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to be completely honest about this game. It is stupid, as in weird and fun stupid. This game has no plot or story, only gameplay and visual aspects. So with that out of the way, this is what I think about Garry's Mod.   Graphics: 6.5/10 The visual style of this game is majorly based on Valve's classic Half Life 2. Back then, these graphics were stupendous. Today, however, the game is primitive and overshadowed by games such as Mortal Kombat X or Call Of Duty. These graphics, though, are still decent.  Gameplay: 9.5/10 There are over 25 different minigames made for this particular game. All of them function really well and are a blast to play through. These minigames also spawned versions of themselves in other games such as Minecraft and Call Of Duty 4. Each minigame has its mechanics and all of them feel smooth and fluent.  Support: 7/10 There are well over 6,000 addons being made for this game. Each of them are cool to use, but some of them require additional content, such as having to have Five Nights at Freddy's or Counter Strike: Global Offensive. if you don't have these requirements met, you're stuck with missing textures and sometimes not even being able to launch up Garry's Mod.   Although these mishaps are here, they are minor. Because of this, Garry's Mod recieves an 8/10. It is a must buy at 9.99, and there is so much content. This game will almost never get boring and I strongly recommend it. I've clocked in 292 hours and I don't care.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Coming from gamemodes such as Trouble in Terrorist Town, ZMod, Murder and every GMod Tower gamemode... I just can not come without recommending this game. But if the workshop conetent and the ability to mod this game was to be cut from it, this would not be appealing at all. What drew people to this game is its simple and yet genious lua code. It can be modified but you cant live without seeing some pointers first! Even I was a server host during time.. long long ago, and even tho I was new to the thing, lua drew me deeper and deeper in!

(That is, if you're playing in 2005, A/V cords are still hot, and Sony's PS2 is still a thing.)  This game is without a doubt a new level of autism, it literally screams 'don't play me I'm feminist' on every single server you play on. I have triggered almost every single easily-offended person and because of Garry's Mod alone, my friends list is basically made up of the men who have helped me destroy little MLG kids through the games built in voice chat.  For Christ's sake, the voice chat: the most cancerous part of this god forsaken game. I cannot tell you how many times I've tried to tell someone something, but can't because I am overpowered by little 4 years olds with mental illnesses screaming into their potatoes at the same time on 97% of the servers I want to play on.  To end it off, I hate this game with a passion, but I play it every time I use my PC so I guess I'd recommend everyone else grab a copy and join the stage 9 cancer club with the rest of us.  Now I'll leave you with a quote that a wise man once said in his critically acclaimed book:    “Any alliance whose purpose is not the intention to wage war is senseless and useless.”  [www.brainyquote.com]  ",

The secret to REALLY enjoying the game would be to find a solid-quality server, meet some friends, and just find different ways of having fun! Trust me when I say there are plenty. The very few negative qualities would be a bit of an overwhelming object-spawn-options menu, but you get used to that quickly. The main other negative that you will probably notice if you spend a bit of time in multiplayer is that in a lot of servers the community can be kind of crap which is why I say it's very important you take a bit of time finding a quality server to spend your time on! I personally reccomend DarkRP, Clockwork Half-Life RP, TTT, and Murder! Some of the more popular game modes anyways, and I enjoy them. Overall I'd say a 10/10 game! Just steer clear of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, familiarize yourself with the way the game works, and you'll be laughing your ♥♥♥ off in no time!",

GMod is everything in one; If you want a zombie game, theres a gamemode for that, if you would like a shooter, gamemode for that, if you want roleplay, gamemode for that.

With the inclusion of the steam workshop it is even easier to get great addons for your sandbox world. Although it is a great game there are some things to consider before getting, if oyu are on a slow computer it might lag and that will make it hard to play, also servers take a while to load (depending on the mode of choice) and you need to get a few games like Counterstrike, Team fortress 2, and Left for Dead 2 to get some textures unless you want to download them piece by piece.

Remove leaves and return cabbage to pot for another 3 mins until next layer of leaves soften. You'll need approx 18 leaves. 2.

There is something in it for everyone, wether you want to play a racing game or an FPS, you can in garrysmod there is always a way. Or maybe you enjoy the gamemodes like Prop Hunt or Trouble in Terrorist Town. Or maybe you just want to build your own. In garrysmod anything is possible. There is nothing to not like, amazing job developers. The game runs smooth the graphics are good and the gameplay is fun no matter what your into so read this review then just hurry up and buy the freaking game. Best £14 pounds i ever spent. My only problems have been while on sandbox or sometimes online getting chucked back to my desktop and garrysmod crashing for no reason. But i think the main problem is if you want the game to actually work online, you need Counter Strike Source. This though is not the developers fault. When people made the gamemodes such as Prop Hunt or TTT they made them using mainly CSS textures and models so if your getting this game, buy it with Counter strike source for that bit extra.",

Creative and fun physics and one of the only ways to make easy Valve Skits *couch*hard to make sfm*cough*  Cons - You need CSS to use most of Garrys Mod. Daily/Usual Trolls/Mingebags/baiters.

There are multiplayer servers comparable to Survival Mode, but for that experience, try Garry Newman's other hit,  Rust .

            "review_text": "I absolutley think Garry's Mod is a wonderful game! It has a wide variety of gamemodes, addons (mods), and duplications. Origianlly going to be a mod for Half Life 2, it became a entirely different game instead, but yet still having player models from Half Life 2, weapons, NPCs, props, and vehicles. This game is like a mix of all games due to the gamemodes like Sandbox, Terror in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, Role Play (RP), DayZ, etc. Aside from the gamemodes, it has a large variety of addons (mods) whether it being vehicles, maps, NPCs, weapons, etc. This is where duplication comes in; you can use the duplication tool for making a clone of something you made and like very much, and saves it. Then you'd be able to respawn it in a different map or server (if they allow it). This is a big thing about the game; if a item says 'ERROR' (like a big red floating 'ERROR'), you need to download the addon for that thing, exit out of the game, restart it, and it'll be there. But be careful, you could choose the wrong addon or it would just simply not work. Another big thing with the game is the 'missing textures' which looks like pink and black checkers board. To get rid of these things, you're going to need to buy Counter Strike: Global Offense and Source, and it automatically fixes the textures. Aside of these things in the game, there are the players of the community. There are several types of people: Hackers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, Squeekers, Friendly Nutural, Nutural, Spammer, and those who obey the rules that are given (The Nice Guy/Gal). I'd say that more than half of the community is filled with Spammers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, Squeekers, and Hackers. The rest are the Friendly Nutural, Nutural, and the Nice Guy/Gal. A tip is if you see someone violating rules of a server, hacking, or anything that they're not supposed to do, report them to a server admin immediatley or even the owner; it works best that way. Anyways I hope this helped the people that want this game or have it! Happy Gmodding! :D",

It has really fun gamemodes like TTT and prophunt (although they are now ruined because of crybabies who whine because you killed them, and bad server rules and staff that ruin the game modes) and is definetely worth playing if you can set up your own server with your own rules.  The community of this game sucks though, as I've said before there are crybabies and in gamemodes like TTT they ruin the game because they will just complain about getting randomly killed (Even if you are 99% sure they were a T and could even say why you were 99% sure) and has ruined the gamemode completely (and those cry babies will also get you banned from the server, and are also a large piece of the bad part of the community) but I guess that's what happens when at least 50% if not more of this games community is raging squeakers and immature teens who lie 24/7. Prop hunt is really fun but gets boring fast but sandbox is where there are so many things you can do. With resources from all of Valve's games such as half life and other fan made resources. You want a lightsaber? Ok you can get it. You want weapons from say COD:MW2, they are available for download.  Another bad thing about this game is that it feels and seems to be unprofessional, a mod, and not a full built entire game. Like for example sometimes when I turn it off, it will still say it is running in steam and I will have to restart my computer in order to play any other games because it says GMod is running even though it isnt.  Overall I'd highly reccomend this game, it's fun, has a lot of replayability and is cheap. It might have a bad community overall and some of the gamemodes like TTT and Prop hunt may be seeing the end of their glory days and the beginning of their death (If it's not already here, which I think it is) . But it's still a great game none the less.",

I'd say the only downside is the servers. Sure they're fun once you spend three hours downloading the add-ons, but after that it's mostly a bunch of trolls. Then again, I didn't spend much time on the servers so I may be wrong.   Another thing about this game is that you can find content from almost any game on the workshop. You want Elder Scrolls? They've got it. You want Smash Bros? Yup, they have that too.   Of course you're going to find some slightly inappropriate things, but that's easy to avoid. Just don't look it up.

You want to make a turn-based, singleplayer, strategy setup? Go ahead. You want to play as the secret weapon for the rebel side of a rebels vs overlords conflict? Entirely possible. You want to play as the bad guy in the conflict above? even more possible, with some AI mods. You want to play as the third party enemy? Heck, you can play as a third party one-man army if you want. You want to troll trouble in terrorist town? Go ahead, just make sure noone sees you throwing those smoke bombs or incendiaries. You want to create a walking mech out of wires and props? You are only limited by your own dedication and determination. You want to roleplay? well, there's no shortage of roleplayers or roleplay servers. Want to make a train? There's tools for that too. Don't feel like spending the limited time you have on this planet on the above? well, you're in luck; other people have already done it for you. And it's freely available online. Have something you want the world to see? Contribute it. The world probably wants to see it too, and if it doesn't, no loss; just try again.  I don't know what garry's mod was supposed to be when it started. I don't pretend to know why or how it's related to CounterStrike. I don't pretend to know whether or not the developers truly wanted their game to turn out like this, or are satisfied with it's current state.  I'm just some guy who messes around in singleplayer. I have a blast doing it too. Am I wrong for having fun the way I want to? If so, then I will proudly admit that I have been playing this game wrong since the day I installed it.",

What I did, i tied a man to a chair, set some cameras around him, and then recorded in the basement how i torture him in a funny way. You cant stop playing it! You can even play alien isolation! Just by downloading some files (or addons) from the Gmod workshop!  The only problem is that when you choose a server, for some servers (most of them) it takes too long to download the files, but, this is Garrys (MOD) This is a must buy. 10/10",

Another reason why I think this is an amzing sandbox game is the fact that it has multiplayer this to me this again amazing as when you get bored you can get your friend involed and to me have even more fun.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

I found that although that playing the game is well constructed, that there were alot of glitches and when i joined a new server that most of the customized objects created by people where in this strange purple material, which then made me think that my computer was broken but to only find that i didnt have the right 'textures' for that server.  Garrys Mod comes with 29 ingame acheviement and allows you to be able to enable spawning objects from different games but clicking the controller on the main menu. Then it came up with a dropdown list off all the games that garrys mod can implement spawing in the items from those games.

Wanna make a scenario? Easy! I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a play round with their skills. Plus with the added gamemodes and multiplayer you can try your luck with making a popular server and see if you can get some donations or if you can get recognition for what you did.

Although the game description may not show much, there is much more you can do such as enhancing the general sandbox experience or trying out different gamemodes (such as Hide n Seek, TTT, Cinema, and others) if you get bored of sandbox! Things can also get a bit crazy, even more crazy if you have friends to play with! - Pros:    Tons of mods (like gamemodes, props, various tools, entities, etc) on the workshop to explore!    Valve games such as TF2, Counter Strike, and Half-life have props and textures you can utilize in general sandbox or content creation to have even more stuff to create with!    Great with friends (or making friends!)    Created stuff is able to be saved.    Worth the price.    Great gift to a friend.    Generally a great time waster and you can never really get bored, unless you are excessively playing and start dying from starvation, thirst, and proper sleep which obviously nobody cares about. :P  BUT OF COURSE OF EVERY GAME, there are some flaws, but these really don't disrupt the game experience.    Too much mods will make the game no longer playable, especially if you run on a poor computer. Just remember to limit your downloading of mods because if it becomes overwhelmingly huge, you will die trying to clean it out and reinstalling wont work since the add-ons are synced to steam.    Sometimes you will see vulgar content on the workshop, specifically scenes involving ponies, nude models, sexual positions, and generally suggestive content which can be easily be avoided by not giving them your attention and reporting them. But of course, it's always a thing, especially in a sandbox game with no 'predefined aims or goals.'    Suggestive servers/general trolls/the bad side of the Garry's Mod community. Remember, just don't go to the dark side and everything will be fine! Stick with the official servers or play with friends. But if you are curious, go ahead and knock yourself out. Just prepare for the deathly cringes and the 'nopenopenopelolwhatamidoinghere.'  - SO IN SHORT: A very great game as many say it is and worth the 9.99 from your wallet. There are some cons, but they could be generally avoided with common sense! So what are you waiting for, ARE YOU GONNA BUY IT?

I'd say Garry's Mod has actually declined in quality since Garry's Mod 10, and as a player of Garry's Mod since the olden days people who are newer to the game might view this review as totally untrue as they do not know the glory this game once was. Anyways, long story short, you can't even find a decent server to play on anymore which isn't spewed with weeaboo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and brony sympathizers, and the gamemode TTT has leeched away at any remaining creativity the game Garry's Mod once had and has sucked the life out of all the other GOOD gamemodes, now making it a CS:S hybrid of sorts.

Now, the game has a ♥♥♥♥ tier community that's full of pathetic 16 year olds and angry, horny, premature FNAF Undertale 12 year olds that are ban happy.   Workshop incorporation only slowed the game down even more, recent updates are causing everyone to crash with the error 'failed to lock vertex buffer' or 'CMDL error: out of memory'.  The game is so miserably optimised, no multi core support leaves even the best computer struggling to push over 30 frames in multiplayer sandbox.  The workshop is full of mostly useless dupes and FNAF garabge. Servers are crawling with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kids. Garry spends all of his time on Rust now so updates are few and far between and always break the game in a new way. Full of trolls and hackers. Everyone in the community has some sort of sob story to bring to the table and make you feel like ♥♥♥♥ and that they're life is more relevant and important than yours.  Seriously, for a group of buds, this game is a lot of fun despite being poorly optomised. My buddy and I still play and managed to have fun by taking advatange of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.

EVERY UPDATE THAT GETS PUSHED OUT OF THE DEVELOPERS (butt) BREAKS THE MAJORITY OF NON-SANDBOX SERVERS. I am a somewhat active member of a community with multiple Garry's Mod servers. Whenever there would be a new update to the game, most servers would have to update, so that they are running the same version of the game. I get that. But, in most cases that I've seen, it just destroys the gamemode that the server runs. So far this year, every single update has ruined TTT in some way or another, usually something in the tab menu. In Hide and Seek, when the seeker is supposed to be blinded, they can see very clearly, but their console is flooding with errors. With the new murder on most(if not all) servers is so buggy that it literally took me over 37 stabs into a person(as in blood came out of them and went onto a wall) with a knife before anyone actually died. When I started playing GMod, I almost never had errors in my console. Now when I play I cant go ten minutes without some form of error.

Seriously, the gamemodes that I mentioned on my previous review no longer have servers that don't involve a terrible admin or moderator base, or simply don't exist anymore.  Grab when it's $2.50 and play sandbox with your firends for a few hours, then drop it.",

Let me just say it you'll never find a worse commnity other than just mayyybe call of duty, but that might even be a better one.  The game it'self however, is very interesting in many regards and with work and good players would be amazing to play.  The community is just a bunch of people ranging in age from 6-17 largely, it's very very difficult to play. Espically when most admins are underage.  Pros Good game engine for modifications such as making game modes, and so on and servers. Constructive, game modes are abundant. Many many modifications available on the workshop.  Cons As stated, horrible community, you'll have to find a server with 'filters' for idiots. Very few good servers, and it's difficult to find the said good ones. The owner of Gmod is kind of a....ungentlemen as well. But don't worry most of the money goes to VALVe as it's their engine not his.  Now, suppose you wanna start a server? Find out how to, learn codeing as if your server is 'default' it usually won't get players. Make Filters. What are filters? well, they're much like filters for keeping water flow pure, and also like firewalls keeping viruses out, Filters can work many ways to keep 'minges' out, they will keep minges from joining by a variety of methods. First is registering, such as saying 'in order to play you must register and a email must be verified' or what have you. This being complex often wards away younger and dumber people and such, there's also other methods I can't name them all, but another is tracking hours. If someone has more than 500 hours into gmod, or more than 2 thousand into overall games than odds are more towards them being reasonable players, there's other methods such as also having two servers.  One serving as the filter. This will be a public server for anyone to join, admins observe and meet players here and if they deem them 'worthy' they may let them into the second server where they are allowed into the server.  Finally the best one available but not yet used, Training. Players spawn in a training area when first connecting, admins/staff meet them and talk with them seeing to it they're 'pure' players and not going to grief and so on they then will let them run around for one hour but privately monitor them for grief of some kind if it occurs they are banned instantly.   There are other methods I could mention and come up with, over all Gmod could be good but there are few good servers in the server listing, or as I call the server browser 'the sea of dumb' due to all the 'crap' servers listed.    Over all, don't buy unless you know what your going to do and know some servers that you know for certain are good.",

I learned how basic space ships work, how to build them, how to set up planes, how to fly and drive decently with various vehicles (which in turn helped me get a better understanding of flying/driving in other much harder games). I used to be a kid who wrote with bad grammar and in some indirect way this game helped me master the English language; due to serious roleplaying I also learned how to be creative, how to write a backstory and perhaps even a small book. It also taught me to dislike Russian people (but I suppose cs:go helped me with that).    Why do I rate this game as a negative one?   Because it ruins the way how you look and play other games. Before I played GMod I played other games at the same time. When I felt like shooting people up I either went to CoD, CSS or BF or when I felt like playing a simulator I went over to another (simulating) game. Perhaps this is my fault but I mostly blame the people and the game itself for ruining every other game for me.    The community",

            "review_text": "[Review Revised: 12/22/2015] [Earlier Review: 8/26/2014] Note: I simply laid everything out this way just so it looks neater. Note: Please excuse the fact that I have a bunch of unnecessary things that I can't rate considering how this game is developed, I will be adding this sort of system to all of my future reviews, so... if things like that occur again then it just means the game has nothing in that area to rate or review.  {---Comment/Opinion---} When I got the game I had fun for the rough 3 hours I put into the game, but then the random content began to become repetitive and old so the game became boring. I tried to resort to additional mods which did allow me to enjoy the game for the full amount of 3 hours until I decided I wanted to try and build with the in-game mechanics, which unfortunately that system was an utter disaster, I then searched up that you need Lua (and possible additional external programs) to build maps and what not, similar to L4D2, however for L4D2 it was understandable because that wasn't the core idea or concept of L4D2, whereas for Garry's mod it was supposed to be. I say Minecraft is better than Garry's mod, however nowadays people believe that Minecraft is crap. I think Minecraft is better at least for the fact that the in-game building mechanics work appropiately and I can actually be creative with the mods and items I have at hand. The default Minecraft is old, however through mods, making my own texture pack, and making my own skins I improved my experience with it. Simply put Garry's mod failed at executing a good in-game building system, yet they more than likely built a nice external building system. Let me also point out that Minecraft was unfortunately ruined due to it's popularity and seems childish or old now to so many people.  {---Things I like about Garry's Mod---} Simply the fact that it was amusing for about 3 hours.  {---Issues I have with Garry's Mod---} Well I practically covered this up above(which was just supposed to be a summarization), anyhow the game interested me with having a lot to offer, a nice in-game building system with countless mods to add to keep the game interesting so I could continue building, and be able to make unique maps and structures anyway I like, however this was all ruined when I dived into the game, after about 3 hours of horsing around and having fun, I lost interest realizing that there was no working in-game creation system, but instead that you had to use an external program to build maps. I'm like, 'You got to be kidding me...', a sandbox game shouldn't be like this at all, unless you add more features to keep the player entertained, allowing the player to choose to work with the system or not as an alternative option only if they want to be that creative. Anyhow, in short I was expecting one thing and got slapped in the face with something I hated.  {---The Rating---} [Mean: 3/10 or 2 Stars = Not Recommended] Note: If the rating goes below 5/10 or 3 stars then I don't recommend it, if it ends up being 5 or 6/10 or 3 or 3.5 stars then depending on the content at hand dictates whether or not I recommend it or don't recommend it, and finally if the rating is above 6/10 or 3.5 stars then I recommend it. This is due to how the ratings below will have to be high to allow the mean to come out as a 7 or higher.  {---Game Concept---} [3] The game concept is simply a sandbox game, which can be quite boring depending on what the sandbox game has to offer, this sandbox game managed to entertain me for about 3 hours, so that's something at least, but I was mainly looking forward to the building system, which of course has to lead to an external program, now I have no problem with this fact, but it's a sandbox game, you don't just do that sort of thing, anyhow I rate the concept a 3/10 or 2 Stars.  {---Game Environment---} [N/A] You can't really rate the environment for a sandbox game since you build the environment.  {---Game Quality---} [5] It's not bad, but it's not really good either. 5/10 or 3 Stars. Also, please note since the game was released on December the 24th, 2004, I believe the graphics could have been better. Of course this excludes anything mod related.  {---Background Story---} [N/A] Again, there was no story.  {---Story---} [N/A] There was no story, considering it's a sandbox game, which is understandable.  {---Plot/Story Progression---} [N/A] There is no story so no story progression or plot can be laid out.  {---Characters---} [N/A] There is no character development or characters in general really, again because of no story, and because your 'Avatar' or 'Character' is just something that just 'exists' so you can enjoy the game.  {---Music Quality---} [1] There wasn't really any music at all, the idea is that games should have music, I sometimes fail to see why, but it sometimes can really bring a game to life when the music is good, like for touching Anime games or shows, however having good music in general is always nice to have and not all games succeed in this area.  {---Conclusion---} [3] (My Rating simply is the mean of the available content above.) In conclusion, I do dislike this game, I can also understand or at least piece together how others enjoy and continue to play this game, but it just isn't my thing. Like I said, I was expecting an in-game building system not external building system.",

            "review_text": "Sadly, I can't reccomend this game. Firstly, I like it. GMod is a fantastic game, you can tell this by my playtime on the game. It is my second most played game. (JC2:MP is just ahead) However, there is one fatal flaw with Garry's Mod, it's players. When the game was first released, and when I first played it in 2012, GMod was a great game. It had some fantastic gamemodes. However, since the game and it's various gamemodes became more popular, and thanks to youtubers such as PewDiePie, the community is now based largely of 7-9 year olds, who don't understand the strategy behind modes such as TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town) so instead choose to RDM every player they meet. This has ruined the communtiy, and has caused many servers to shut down, as a result of a lack of players. (who were playing the game properly) Also, in response to another reviewer, who stated (I'm paraphrasing) 'GMod is full of 25 year olds who are constantly saying you are RDMing,' I must say, this is because you probably are. Also, this group of people who are around 20-25 are more than likely to be the people who were early adopters of the game (around 14 - 19 when the game came out) and, another point to add to this, GMod is rated 12 by PEGI, so, these 7 - 9 year old players should not even be playing the game. So, in conclusion, Garry's Mod... it's a great game, but, it's community is worse than ♥♥♥♥. I cannot reccomend, unless you plan on setting up your own server, and playing with just your friends, in which case, GMod is a blast!",

All three times I tried to join a multiplayer server, my entire Mac crashes. I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue or a game issue, but this is a problem for me. If you have an older Mac or a weaker computer, don't even think about going online. Even if you have a newer Mac, like my 2013 low-end iMac, use caution when playing.",

When I mention Ivory coast, I mean land beyond the white roads therefore a land only seen by those who can read and write in pig latin while smoking several ounces of crack meth. Crack meth is the intergal of both cocaine and methadone, but that's way too much information for this game. Anyways this homeless man can only collect bras from the plethora of fast food restaurants on this street. He then sells them in order to get on a computer to buy uselss videogames which then he'll later review 69-420 hours ago. Overall, Garry's Mod is at most, Meh.",

Though majority of the time you're going to have to restart the game to use them if they were downloaded mid-game - but don't get me wrong. They are pretty good. What you're going to find with the game itself, is that opening a map is going to take anywhere from 2-30 minutes - though you (The reader, don't get technical with me about this - I'll cut you -) may not experience this. This game is also prone to multiple crashes while playing, this can be anything from a minor annoyance, to a complete game-boner-killer. These crashes are NOT one-off occurances though, they are actually rather common. If you are like... well, any one else, then you'll sit back, maybe twiddle your thumbs for a while, and wait in complete, awe-inspiring boredom as NOTHING happens, all in the vein hope that maybe, 'It's different this time, it won't crash!' though, just like New Vegas, the game is going to laugh as you sit there, like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot waiting for some miracle that will make your game work.

Now as much as I like Garry's Mod, I've slowly started to get tired of this game, most servers are full of screaming kids who call you a hacker if you kill them, 50% of the servers are run by nine year olds, and this game is hardly updated.  GMod also (kind of) requires you to buy seperate games to even load most of this game's textures, if you don't even own a Source game, then you will run into missing textures everywhere. (by the way, TF2 does not count, it will load TF2 models and maps, but will still give you missing texture errors) Even if you do own a Source game, it will still won't load certain textures (yes, i own more than one Source game) I've even found myself switching from game to game because of the servers are, like I said, full of little kids.  Well, thanks for reading my review, you've probably downvoted my review since I bashed on your beloved GMod.

I've had way too many issues with this game that have caused serious frustration. Looking at the main menu of the game, off the bat, I did not like the layout of Gmod. Everything feels cluttered and looks awkward. It works, but looking at everything in the menu is an eye sore, even more so, going into sandbox mode and looking at the menu screen for items to select is even more of an eye sore. I find myself completely confused on where everything is and how to use it all when in sandbox mode. It's a pain in the butt.  Cosmetic reasons aside, I've had more serious issues with this game.  I've had occasional poor experiences with the online community. I would play a game of whatever, and the players have not been the friendliest.  My biggest issue, however, is the requirement of other games just for Gmod to work properly. I would install a map to play Prop Hunt, and when I play the map, 3D 'Error' objects litter the screen, and many textures are checkered with a pink and black pattern. This means the map has textures or objects that derive from a different game like Counter Strike Source, or Half Life, and basically the only way to get rid of those errors are to buy and install Counter Strike or Half Life if you do not already have them.  The fact that you need separate games to play the actual game modes with ease personally pisses me off quite a bit. Luckily, I have Counter Strike: Source, but a game should not require you to have this or that game just so it can work properly.  Occasionally I'll find that Gmod won't even launch at all, and at that point I don't even know what to do.  Garry's Mod is a cluttered, poorly designed... game? I honestly don't know what to label Gmod as, but regardless, I've had many issues that have left bitter frustration that the end result of playing a fun game may not make up for. I won't lie, I would probably have tons of fun playing Prop Hunt, TTT, Murder, and more, if I could just get Gmod itself to work.  Unfortunately there are just things about Gmod that make no sense and considering how long Gmod has existed, the things I have problems with shouldn't even happen.  I would think that with the popularity of Gmod, it would have had more than enough potential to fix at least half of the issues I've mentioned or improve upon itself, but I have the same issues with Gmod now that I had almost 2 years ago.",

Right now, I'll advertise my videogame: Craft of Sin. In Craft of Sin you play as a homeless ballet dancer that's living on the streets on the infamous Ivory Coast. When I mention Ivory coast, I mean land beyond the white roads therefore a land only seen by those who can read and write in pig latin while smoking several ounces of crack meth. Crack meth is the intergal of both cocaine and methadone, but that's way too much information for this game. Anyways this homeless man can only collect bras from the plethora of fast food restaurants on this street. He then sells them in order to get on a computer to buy uselss videogames which then he'll later review 69-420 hours ago. Overall, Garry's Mod is at most, Meh.",

You can use Garry's Mod create just about anything imaginable. It has the potential to create a nearly unlimited variety of other games, but that potential isn't really fully realized in the community.  Games created by the community are called 'gamemodes' and can be found either on Steam or in the game interface. The best of them are variations on 'Hide and Seek' or arena combat using different environments and weapons. There also seem to be a lot of role-play focused games.

The game’s community still isn’t as salty as Counter-Strike’s but it was still bad. But there were still some good moments left in this game. Sorry for any bad grammar, I was writing this quickly, truthfully and angerly while watching youtube.  Let’s start with a generic Pro/Con list then I will go more in depth:  Pros. 1. Game with lots of playtime with many gamemodes, players, communities, and servers. 2. Add-ons (Mods) add even more game time to try them and have fun  3. Friends, its excellent steam integration allows to easily play with friends Cons. 1. Salty Community: Not CS Salty but people are really annoying when they are mad 2. Bad Admins: Recently admins became really trash at doing their job 3. Too many/pointless rules: These damn servers and their damn rules man  This game does have tons of content made by great community members. From just Sandbox to TTT, Murder, Prophunt, DarkRP and Hide&amp;Seek there is plenty to do in this game. Each has its own add-ons to create more variety in each server but some are always there and having exactly makes some add-ons super annoying. This game is best with friends, and best on a private server, that way bad admins can’t ruin your day because they are 5 year olds that payed $100 dollars they took without permission from their parents.   Continuing on with the bad admins topic; Admins are plain ret*rded these days. There is no kinder way to say it, they never listen. Someone brakes the rules? They get away. You break the rules? Tough ♥♥♥♥ you’re getting banned. You try to reason with them? “Stop disrespecting me I’m and admin and I am banning you” ~ All Admins Ever.  On my recent replay of Gmod I noticed something else. The admins sided with people who play and donated to their servers. I was on an RP server when a VIP killed me for “being too close to him” the admin checked the log. Even though he shot first and I shot to defend myself he only copy pasted the part where I shot, I then got “warned” (Admin tool that “warns” people too many warns gets a kick/ban) I then said “These admins are terrible” then got banned for disrespect. Sorry they are bad though.  The only admins I ever liked were those on one RP server I used to play on since I was one of the admins. We actually gave people respect and we used the damn log.   The community is just as bad as the admins though; when you accidentally “rdm” it makes sense they get mad they died unfairly. But when you apologize they seem to get madder because its “shoving it in their face”. The human race is doomed if they can’t get over dying in a ♥♥♥♥ing video game.  Also what’s the deal with these rules? In DarkRP some servers have a “Maniac mode” where you get a minute of free rdm but I am roleplaying as a psychopath. I should be able to kill as many as I want anytime. That’s why people RP as the police, to hunt me down to take me out.  In RP you also have to “advert” (announce you are doing something) before doing a lot of things like raiding or mugging. I get its for balance but in real life you don’t yell at your local PD that you are about to mug someone. Roleplay is supposed to simulate real life, not balance it out to give your mortal enemy a fighting chance because they looked in chat.  This game used to be good and fun with less ♥♥♥♥. But in this day and age it’s easier to open up Minecraft or some other non-valve game (because valve games have 100% more salt than other games) and play those instead.",

Firstly, you will need to watch YouTube or search online to even figure out how to use this. There is NOTHING in game to explain anything. Searching through Steam Community is equally frustrating because 1&gt; half the guides are in languages I don't speak and 2&gt; the search function can't seem to find a forest amongst all trees. And many of the online tutorials assume you know more than you do (the best video I watched for beginners tells you open the spawn menu, but doesn't tell you how to do it until 7 minutes later; The wiki tells you to do it by pressing O in one place and to press Q in another).  So, if you attempt to start this and you default into the flat map, you start out on top of this God-ugly structure. Unless you have figured out how to fly (search online), you have to jump off and you lose 10% health. A sandbox you can die in! And of course, this God-ugly structure is part of the map, so you can't get rid of it. Its in the way and its an eye-sore.  At this point, I attempt to build something, the entire reason I wanted this game in the first place. Place one object. Place a second one that pushes the first one away. Move the first object back, only to have it go flying off across the screen. Begin again. Place one object. Place a second using the controls and mods that were recommended online (again, nothing helpful in-game). Second objects bounces off the first one, hits me and I die. Game over.

I bought the game because I was led to believe that it was full of fun gamemodes and fun people and I was ready to have a great time. Unfortunately, the vast majority of game modes with players completely suck.  Trouble in Terrorist Town is good as long as you manage to find a decent server with proper RDM (Random killing, essentially) rules in place to stop people trolling servers. This is pretty much the only good game mode I found, it also wasnt hard to find a fun server with admins who were nice.  Prop Hunt - Majority of people either are terrible at hiding or try to mimic Vanoss by disguising as a mug and running around. Not an issue in itself but it detracts from the enjoyment of having to find the props when they revel in being chased around.  Murder - Pretty much TTT except for the fact that your name gets hidden and you can't fight back unless you're a detective  Hide n' Seek - Basically Prop Hunt without the Prop part, people tend to actually hide in this one though  RP (SCP RP, Nazi Occupational RP, ZombieRP etc.) -   Basically all the exact same thing with environment changes. Unless you donate or spend a long time on the server you won't be able to play any fun class. For the purposes of this review I'm going to mainly focus on 'SCP - RP Werewolv's Server'. You start being able to either play as a D-Class personnel, where you are able to follow orders and be shot, thats it - a Civilian, where you are allowed to roam the surface and print money (basically AFK, but don't AFK or some fool steals your money) - or a Cook, where you can supply food and microwaves (for some reason) throughout the facility.  To play as a guard, or anything interesting really, requires an absurd amount of time spent either guarding your money printers (you can't fight anyone off by the way) or waiting for a guard to decide to use you as a toy with an SCP player.  Admins will generally be incredibly uptight about any server rules, any slight breach will earn you an airborne trip via Physgun to a rooftop where you will be 'punished' either with a warning or killing you or something. Rules can vary from 'FailRP' which is stuff like holding out your Gravity Gun to 'MingeProp' which is using a prop in a way which is 'not useful' (During my boredom I spawned a fridge and spun it around in the air, causing me to be warned).  To detract from that TERRIBLE server, the DarkRP servers (The most popular game mode) are basically a gritty version of a city, in that the maps look ugly, you still have to donate money to have fun, and if you cook meth (One of the only ways to make money) you can be guarenteed someone will decide to kill you and steal it with guns bought with money they have received from donating.    ------  To conclude, I don't believe that this game holds up to the hype generated in the community in any shape or form. Aside from modes like Prop Hunt, TTT or Murder, your only sources of fun will be abusing donator powers or trying to create your own fun by messing around in an RP server (Escaping the SCP detention area only to be remotely slain by an admin, really fair)  The singleplayer relies completely on you finding your own sources of fun again, this is where the 'The only limit is your imagination' quote is used the most, because theoretically you can do anything with the tools you're provided with. Whether it be building a house, assault course, murdering a group of combine or seeing how many SMG grenades it takes to kill you.  If you have friends who you can reliably install mods and play custom maps with, you will likely have a blast ('Horror' Maps, Private TTT etc.) as it becomes a lot more fun in the company of friends.   I do not recommend this game because the majority of content available - the roleplaying servers - is completely awful and the rest of it - game modes like Go Kart building- are vastly underplayed and therefore you will be very lonely.",

            "review_text": "Garry's Mod is one of those games I bought because a lot of YouTubers I watch played it. The minigames they played looked fun, and Sandbox looked awesome to mess around with. And after buying it, I'm not as addicted to it as I thought I was. And there are several reasons for that.   First off, Garry's Mod offers a lot to do. You can goof around and create wacky inventions in Sandbox mode, or hop onto a server and play some minigames, like Murder or Trouble in Terrorist Town. You can also change the skin of the character you play as, making it any character from almost any kind of media. You just need to download the model first.   These are some of the main things that drew me into playing Garry's Mod. But after booting it up, I was slightly disappointed. Sandbox mode only looked fun to me out of the enjoyment you can have with friends. But you can only get them on your server if you set up a personal server (which I have yet to figure out how to do) or you have to be in the same building. Plus, going onto servers isn't always the funniest thing to do. They take forever to load and not all of them allow you to mute other players, which, if you're like me, can get really annoying really quickly.  It's overall not a bad game it's just not user-friendly. Most stuff isn't easy to figure out quickly and will take time and effort if you really want to get to the best of what the game has to offer. If you don't mind that, go ahead and buy the game. But otherwise, I wouldn't 100% recommend the game. ",

Its pretty much all i have to say because its the truth and what ruins the game. The game also gets boring after playing because you build some stuff and thats the end for me. I dont know WHY i bought this game but i did. I find everything that i play really boring and not fun and i lose my attention after 5 minutes. I try to stay in the action but always end up being killed .-. Why world",
