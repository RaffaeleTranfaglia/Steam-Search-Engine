            "review_text": "Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Your name is Organa, you work in a greenhouse at the back of a… let’s say, a slightly different shop and you have lot to learn from your Master Irene. Well, she is going to teach you how can grow and harvest something totally…..out there! Yes, you are going to learn how to grow and harvest “Organ Fruits” from their respective trees! EXCUSE ME, WHAT DID YOU SAY…?  Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden is a Novel/clicker type of game (and to be totally honest with you, the first game of it genre that I have played). The story is laid out as a visual novel. Throughout the story, you will meet different characters and you will be given tasks to achieve to keep moving forward in the story.   In the greenhouse, you will start with 2 trees and a watering can. Apparently, it is the conversional equipment for the organ fruit grower. But be assured you will get up to 5 trees and you will be able to produce Hearts, Kidneys, Stomachs, Livers and Colon fruits. Each time you pick a fruit from its tree, you will get points. Accumulate enough points to level up your trees and produce even faster and better fruits but you will also get money to spend in a catalogue. Oh, before I forget, you will be able to use your Tranquilade to produce pickled fruits, and a meat grinder to produce mincemeat.   In the catalogue you will be able to purchase frogs (one of my cousins went for an audition), butterflies, lizards, moles, woodpeckers and Homunculis. They will assist you in the greenhouse.  The artwork is different but nice. I really like the soundtracks; different music each time you meet a new character which changes the ambiance.  Positives:  ~~~~~~~~   - Interesting concept &amp; artwork - Easy and enjoyable to play  - Achievements - Trading Cards  Negatives:  ~~~~~~~~   - Kind of repetitive  A lot of strange stuff combined together, but it works! Just give it a go!  8.5/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!

But as the garden I tended grew and became larger, and as the stories entwined within it revealed themselves, Forget Me Not became a fascination, and I was eager to keep going to see what would happen next. The time I spent with this game was well worth it, and I would recommend Forget Me Not to anyone who has the patience to play a game that takes a bit of time to grow from a small sprout into a blossoming flower.",

Fulfill customer's orders to see their stories and get money to buy animals that help with working more efficiently (frogs, moles, humonculus, ect). The gameplay is very simple and has no time limit so all you need is patience.  Those organs really look like fruits 0_0 Be sure to complete every single quest to unlock the true ending and see what the MC looks like (The way she talks reminds me of Hiyoko from Hatoful Boyfriend)",

            "review_text": "my index finger is killing me from clicking nonstop for the past two hours and i don't even care. this was my first 'clicker' type game outside of huniecam studio, which is more of a tycoon game than a clicker. the narrative is very interesting and dark, and the artwork is beautiful. i love the colors and the character designs and the MUSIC. the music is SO GOOD. the game suits my love of dark and creepy things and honestly reminds me of my favorite ds game, touch detective, with its art style, creepy story, and pretty music. the only thing i'm not too fond of about the game is how low resolution it is, looking terribly blurry and pixelated at any setting but the lowest frame size. also, you can't change fullscreen/windowed or size in the 'configuration' (settings) page, just arbitrary stuff about the text speed. i wish there were more options available on the settings screen rather than just when you first boot up the game, because if you for whatever reason need the game to switch between fullscreen and windowed or just to change the size of the window, you have to save and completely exit the game then reboot it and change the setting on the startup screen. other than that problem, though, the game is beautiful and, although it leaves a little bit to be desired, is definitely worth the full price and is a steal at the summer sale price (60% off at $4).",

            "review_text": "   I liked everything except the gameplay...     Forget Me Not is not your average clicker game, for example it cannot be left running and there is no 'true' automation. In fact the automation is probably the most frustrating part. You can buy animals to speed up your production however this becomes more of a chore than a help as the animals will only stan where you need them to benefit from their buff for so long. That is to say the animals jump around the screen and you have to click them to make them go back and do their job. I find this mechanic extremely frustrating to say the least.    The story  is enjoyable and has a simple premise: You're growing organs to help your master run an organ shop, each organ has a soul and people want them for different reasons. You see a bunch of different characters with different stories and they are all somewhat interesting. In fact these stories are the only reason I'm bothering to keep suffering through the gameplay.   The audio  is admittedly terrible, everything you click makes a loud sound and there are lots of different sounds for each animal. I found my speakers making hideous noises repeatedly sometimes noises will overlap and cut out other noises thus making it even worse. However the music is pleasant and fits the atmosphere.   If you like games like Clicker Heroes and Cookie Clicker then this game is not likely for you as it has almost nothing in common with them. I'd love to reccomend this game because of the story, art, and music but with the gameplay being so unbearable I can't really say this is a good buy.  ",

            "review_text": "Holy mother of Lord Gaben, this game is boring. Dont get me wrong, i like clickers, and i like good VNs, but this is not a clicker, neiter a VN, this is just a very boring game, that has nothing in it. It has nothing, that makes a good VN, theres no story, no characters developing. Every dialog, every new character is just a new quest 'farm a bit more of this stuff' with simple setup. All characters are flat, and cause no interest. Its just 'gimme that, gimme those, i want more of these', you just want to skip all dialoges and get back to gameplay. This game is not a Visual Novella.  Well, maybe its a good clicker? No, it is not. Theres no progress, you just keep clicking, keep farming more 'fruits', that you sell right away. What makes a good clicker game? You click a lot, you spend a lot of time, and you can see at all that you achieved and say: 'hell yea, im cool now, i feel like i made my something a lot cooler, than it was'. This game gives you no feeling of your progress, you just keep clicking and nothing happens. You collect kidneys, you collect hearts, you make some kind of a cat food (mashed organs, simply) and it leads to nothing. You dont want to get better at this game. you dont want to make your stuff better, because it leads to nothing, just more clicking with no joy.  I strongly do not recommend this game, it gives no fun, or pleasure. It has no jokes for you to laugh at, no story to read, no gameplay to enterntain you and no graphics to enjoy. I have no idea, who on Earth could like this game. Give me my money back, ive wasted 2 hours of my life on a boring game, and payed for that with my money.",
