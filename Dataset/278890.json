            "review_text": "I bought this game expecting a rogue-like, but the only roguelike element it has is permadeath. Levels are not random, and there are not many powerups. This is a challenging classic platformer (as was common in the NES days).  That said, if you like classic platformers this one is not bad.  All equipment has a limited number of uses. All weapons and armor collapse and break after it is used 1-4 times. Oils are found occasionally, and can be used to fully repair an armor or weapon while at the same time converting it into another type of armor or weapon.  Levels are linear and the game is fairly short. There are a number of character classes which differ only in their starting equipment, and there is some replayability to be had in beating the game with different classes.  You won't get many hours of entertainment with this, but it's brief and enjoyable fun and the price is right.   Subscribe to my curator page here    View my other reviews here ",

            "review_text": "Very fun platformer with varied weapon types. Reminds me of Ghosts 'n Goblins, but with an Adventure Time art style. You can pick a class to start as, but as far as I can tell it only changes your starting gear. Weapons have limited uses, but many others can be picked up and augmented with potions along the way. Your bird companion can carry your extra gear and eggs that can hatch on your command to provide some assistance in the form of a circling attack bird.",

            "review_text": "Remember how Ghosts'n'Goblins was a really cool game? This isn't.   Retro platformer with low effort artwork. Incomprehensibly bad control schema implies this is some kind of console port, I can't blame the console guys for rejecting this one, and hey, they have pretty low standards as it is.   Fixed resolution, but works okay in full screen if you like blurry upscaling. It does have a 'sharp' mode (c'mon guys) that does nothing.   Gameplay is tired. You get a sword and some stuff that breaks after a couple of hits. You do get a primitive item system that isn't really interesting and just forces you to wrestle with the clunky interface.",

Just playing the first 30 seconds, you can see how slap-dash Angvik is. The game isn't difficult- it's not balanced. The classes would have been interesting had they not been uncerimoniously reduced to a single choice at the begining, and while the art style has it's intrigue, it's not worth the agony of gameplay.  It's not an entirely bad game, it just needs to be overhauled. One or two mechanical updates would absolutely make this game worth playing, but until then, I'd pass.",

            "review_text": "A very charming platformer. You can see the love put in this game. The game is quite short, but not very easy. Don't expect to get tens of hours of excitement from this game. It needs a little different viewpoint. I would consider this game as a piece of video game art, in some sense. Though this is not an 'art game' like some other abstract or beautiful scenery games, it is art in the context of video games. This is hard to explain, sorry, but you have to play it to understand what I mean. If you like classic platformers done with style and love, you will like this game also.  Angvik is nice counterbalance to any hectic platformer, here the atmosphere is calm and somehow relaxing, even though the game isn't easy. The weapons and armors are fun and bring a little variety to the game. You can choose from 6 starting classes, each of which has different starting gear. There is also to choose randomly, each time completed this way the game gets a bit harder (I suppose from the achievement implications, I have yet only beaten it once). So there is definitely replay value in here if you will decide to go for every achievement. Due to it's calming atmosphere it is nice to come back to it sometimes and try to beat it with a different 'great guy as your father' (or class, if you prefer).  3€ is not much, but grab this definitely when on sale if you like the sorts of thing I described.  I also recommend to try Alastair John Jack's other great platformer, Arvoesine (which is freeware).",

            "review_text": "Angvik is hardly a game, and it's certainly not worth your money. The 'game' in all takes about 10 minutes to beat once you understand how it works, and replay value is very low. The only things that change are what character you play and what enemies get generated in each level. Hitting enemies is frustrating; thrown weapons often skim enemies without killing them, and stomping heads is difficult given varying enemy traits - s♥♥♥♥♥dic movements, rapid ranged attacks that are hard to dodge, slim enemy hitboxes, A lot of times, avoiding enemies entirely is the best option, which is incredibly unfortunate given killing enemies is about the only thing to do. Spoiler: The game ends with a boss fight so easy you won't even realize it was a boss fight until the screen says 'You Won!' Roll credits.",
