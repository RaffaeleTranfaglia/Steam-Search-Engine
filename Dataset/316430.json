Some pure entertainment in every battle win or lose. The accuracy of the time period is great as well.  The sheer amount of options for each soldier is awesome, some can be getting more ammo, some in trees sniping, some on the charge...great for micro management in one smooth game.   I will say I spend alot of time in slow motion in this game, almost necessary to cover the action/span the map and still be able to manage active forces in time on many maps.  I dont mind the russian voice acting, personalizes it with the creators which is awesome, they deserve it. Besides, WWI is a bit more symbolic for Russia/Europe than it is for America, perfectly fitting we cater to an honor of theirs for a change.  I would suggest France campaign first. seems to be a much smoother campaign overall, good mix of maps, challenges.  Doing Russia second, and I found some of the narration timing/lengths frustrating, the story line jumps all over, and there are some quirks (pathing ect) that overall made gameplay illogical in some parts, so save often. Still playable, still interesting battles with entertainment every game...just not as smooth and enjoyable as France.  Managed a multiplayer battle once...certainly a new kind of game, in a good way.   Recommend for certain, glorious heoric deaths and hilarious not so heroic deaths around every corner. ",

            "review_text": "Bought this game in early-access because I'm a big fan of this period and I haven't been so let down since Aliens: Colonial Marines came out. What I thought would be an interesting RTS turned out to be little more than an expensive mod for AS2. I have three main problems with this game:  1) The campaign, which is 95% of the reason I bought this game since multiplayer is terrible and there isnt a 'fight against AI' option is terrible for the amount you pay. The levels are poorly done and very often what should be interesting and exciting campaigns become repetitive and dull. Some battles, like the Marne in the French campaign are great, but seriously who wants to spend two missions helping a handful of Russian officers evade small patrols of Germans and *spoiler alert* spend a mission hiding a flag? Where is the Battle of Tannenberg? Stalluponen? The Battles of the Masurian Lakes? A lot of missions are poorly scripted too, voices don't kick in when they're supposed to or cutscenes activate when they shouldn't- a good example of this was in the Ivangorod mission where in the middle of a fierce firefight the game loaded a cutscene out of the blue. This cutscene involved several soldiers being attacked and shot down by germans whilst they continued to have a calm conversation about what they'll do when the war ends.  2) The voice acting is terrible. And I mean terrible. When I bought this game the French soldiers had a strong Eastern European accent, which I could forgive because it was early days and they'd obviously patch it later. Which they did, to my horror. When I next loaded the game, their accents had been replaced by British ones- trust me when you hear soldiers using french slang in thick london accents you can't help but laugh. The voices are as awful as the unit animations. The Russian accents are pretty good, but thats all the praise I have.  3) The DLC is getting out of control. I payed for the early-access with the promise of German and British campaigns, as well as the ones that came with it. And once again I got shafted. Do they seriously expect me to pay a tenner to get what they offered me when I payed for this game? Ten pounds for two more campaigns of bad accents, dull missions and more inevitable soul-crushing frustration at what I've become by buying their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. Seriously this has to stop- it's like paying for a sandwich to be told that the fillings will cost you the same price again. If they hadn't demanded more money via DLC, I could have even forgiven some of the other faults.  tl;dr Poor scripting, bad cutscenes, doesn't bring anything new, poor animations, overpriced DLC, don't waste your money",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. I think the Great War is a section of history that has been passed up quite a bit, and an RTS looked like the perfect way to do this.  This game doesn't do a very good job.  Not counting the fact that literally half of the game is DLC, Battle of Empires does not present a good portrayal of the Great War. It feels too clean, and nothing feels like it has any impact. Artillery is weak, compared to the absolutely devastating thing it actually was. Machine guns have trouble cutting down the swaths of soldiers that come at them. It doesn't feel like the First World War. And gameplay wise, it's pretty boring. It's pretty much exactly Men of War, just in WWI.  Also the voice acting is absolutely horrendous. You couldn't find anyone to give a half-decent impression of a Russian soldier?  I guess I'll have to wait for another WWI RTS to show up and see if it piques my interest without disappointing me like this one.",

Just for reference Jaeger is pronounced like Yay-Grr not 'Jogger'.   However despite those technical issues, there's something still fun to be had within the base gameplay. Is it worth it though?  I'm going to go with yes, but just barely. At least until they put out a German campaign.",

This sounds extremly cool, but when the game is reallistic it's not, your men die 1 shot 1 kill and i have like 100 tries on that missions. I really raged then, and after you survive the prison you spawn in the middle of a battlefield with 2 men, facing the entire german army in trenches and bunkers which are fighting your guys kilometers away and your task is to get there without being killed whic is absolutely impossible.)

The system of DLCs is so complicated that the developers had to put a diagram on the store page to explain it. Not quite Payday 2 level of thievery, but close. The addition of essential WWI game features such as a German campaign has been done through DLC so that the developer can continue to extract more money from players - especially those who bought the game early on.

Lets get the elephant out of the room: the dlc. Yes it is a shame that people habe been promised things that they didn't receive and yes i hate dlc too but look at it from this perspective: i bought an entire game for about €30,00 and that is more than i can say of some tripple a titles out there. The game was made on a lower budget and it can show, espescially in the voice acting department what can lead to some hilarious or sometimes anoying results, which is a bit of a shame but i prefer this over no voice acting at all anyday. But now the pros:  The gameplay is solid, it shows the importance of mass assaults, flanking manouevres, artillery support etc in ww1 very well. It's a ton of fun to mow down an army of landwehr infantry with a machine gun, or let your tank cause death and destruction all around. Where the story VA falls behind, the unit VA shines. German soldiers shouting, russians responding to their commander, it all comes to life perfectly. Compared to it's brother men of war (assault squad), it has a lot more variety, and better story driven aspects. It feels different than most strategy games as it takes place in ww1 which is rare for an rts to do, yet it still feels comfy enough to know what you are doing and how you should play. If you have the money and are willing to spend it, i'd say check this one out.",

Charging money for modes that should be in a WWI rts game? No... this is shameless. Not only that but the missions I've played have mostly been sloppy and poorly done, not to mention a lot of bugs and other crap. I supported this game from early on, and the devs truly let me down.  I recommend the MP only for those interested, don't feed their shameless greed. I know I'm boicotting these guys, and I will warn everyone else to do it too.",

            "review_text": "In my former review I said that this was one of the best WW1 RTS games. I was wrong. I was overly excited and had my hopes up. Unfortunately now that I've played through and witnessed the greed of the devs as well as the horrid voice acting and bugs, I now cannot recommend this game.  Stuff I said before:  - Yes, this is one of the only WW1 RTS games in 3D. Unfortunately, the GEM engine cannot potray it realistically. However, I know the extents of the GEM engine; they have not tried to do as best as they can. You cant charge trenches with horses, artillery doesn't do enough damage most of the time to kill any enemies and they can just heal almost instantly with bandages. Trying to charge trenches with your soldiers is just boring to watch. First time you are like, cool, my guys are getting mowed down, realistic. Then you realise when they get to the trench, they just stand there and get shot in the head. This is partly do to the GEM engine, but the devs describe the game as super realistic and a RTS set amazingly in WW1. They even are naive enough to release a 'season' pass and ♥♥♥♥ over the early accessers, which is a whole different story.  - Game is super realistic. The mechanics are realistic. Helmets fall off, different parts of vehicles break, buildings destroy right, weapons can be picked up, ammo matters, etc etc. That is just the GEM engine, NOTHING that the devs can take credit for. The Men of War devs deserve 100000000 times more credit than these greedy devs.  - Lots of bugs. Yes, end of story. Talk about it more later.  - Cant buy units. This is because I played assualt squad skirmishes before I ever played 2009 Men of War or story mods.   So, here it is, the pros and cons in a longer updated review:  Pros:  + Has nice models and missions with bugs of course. There is no excuse for this now that its out of early access, but its bearable.  + Has a nice amount of missions.  + Has the editor.  Cons:  Everything... kidding.  - Game isn't finished even though its in release.  - Multiplayer is buggy and not balanced.  - Voice acting makes you want to throw up.  - Missions are encrypted in the editor so you cant just mess with a mission and spawn some extra troops for fun. The devs decided their 'masterpiece' was worth too much for people to edit. Men of War allowed this and that is called the freedom of the editor.  - Mechanics are buggy and vehicles bug out a lot.  - Graphics are too bloomy even when its in a dark environment.  - Devs decided to take the game out of early access so they could throw out a season pass and a ton of dlcs for a game that is not even finished. Seriously, 7 bucks for a few tank missions easily made in the editor? Low blow. Plus they have pre planned the dlcs and are giving the German and British campaigns in seperate dlcs.  - Devs decided the early access buyers who bought the game not knowing if was going to be finished(which in its current state it still isn't) will not be compensated with the Blazing Guns dlc and instead people who bought it a certain time after release will. The claimed that they promised early access buyers the russian campaign for free and the finished product. The russian campaign is free for everyone, so that is not a valid excuse. The game is still not finished either even though its in release. It wouldn't be a problem if they didn't blatantly give it to the lucky bunch who bought the game in a certain time frame.  - I dont like the fact that they are selling a mod and acting like its their own masterpiece. The price is too high for an unfinished game, and at the current stage the devs think they are popular enough already to release a ton of dlcs and release the game like its finished or 99 percent finished.  After the overwhelming amount of cons and the fact that the devs completely said ♥♥♥♥ you to the community, I will not recommend this game. I recommend you wait for a better RTS for WW1 with an engine designed exactly for that. Not a mod that is being sold.  Graphics: 4/10 Mechanics: 5/10 Missions: 7/10 Voice Acting: 2/10 Dev's attitude: 1/10 Overall: Not recommended, 4/10.      OLD REVIEW:  One of the only WW1 RTS games besides the Entente Gold but this is utilizing a whole new engine. The Men of War engine, which fits well with this kind of game. If your going to make a WW1 RTS, you need it to be super realistic to work, which is exactly what the MoW engine provides and the game provides.  I have found a few weird bugs and the bootcamp is a bit confusing in the ending parts. Some of the beginning levels are a bit quirky and hard to get around when your units are getting killed when they barely move and cant sucessfully charge. You cant even buy new units like in Men of War.  It needs work for sure.  Also, as a recommendation, you could have 1 or 2 battles with the united states in it. Just as a small bonus battle. I'd recommend this game if you can handle a heavily work in progress game. If my senses are right, I would have made a good decision to enter early access of this game.",

'The night before the offencive' is soooooooooo anoying. Your meant to get some items out of a house, without shooting. Let me tell you the issues with that: Even when you have the knife selected and you choose to engage in melee your soldiers run up to the Germans, the germans shoot you, you stand their getting shot and then the French officer stands saying 'The Germans have called reinforcements'. Melee system in that game is awful.  DLC is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Paid £10 for the French and Russian campaigns. In both campaigns the missions are SO boring. Even when it's the huge attacks the only interesting part is when you can control the artillery yourself. Shooting does not work at all. It seems like the Stormtroopers are actually dead-eye hunters that put modern snipers to shame when you look at how bad everyone shoots in this game. I played almost 13 hours, now about 10 of those hours were on the Russian campaign: The Russian campaign is the best as far as I can see. However it's dull, uninteresting and has AWFUL voice acting. It seems this game was run on such a tight budget they took Sean Connery's voice from The Hunt for Red October and gave it to every bloody Russian!  Don't waste £4 for this game... oh wait... if you actually want to play this game it's £56.",
