            "review_text": "I spent my $8.50 not really expecting to get anything out of it, but i found this quirkly little spattering of games to be much more entertaining than I expected. My personal favorite was the mini-noir-like point and click 'Dectective Chirpums' which had a smooth and spicy feel to it, with a story intriguing enough to warrant a playthrough. The art style was also very appealing to my anthro side, with all charachters being birds - in my opinion an under-drawn animal. The other titles on the tape are interesting as well, but I have yet to dedicate as much time to them as Detective Chirpums.   A note with respect to LAZA KNITEZ - It seems many are unsatisfied with that game... I feel you guys are missing the point of it. It's a game that's more for comedic value than sheer gaming brilliance. It's probably not worth it's fraction of the tape's cost, but at a party it can be a fun and competitive title. Ya just need to get a few people together to properly enjoy it.  Anyway, I loved this little gem. Some who are not into the more retro side of gaming might not appreciate this game as much as I, and if you are such a person I'd advise against purchasing this. Reguardless of your taste though, even if you only get an hour or two's entertainment out of it, the Indie Mixtape is still a better entertainment value per dollar than an average movie ticket these days, So why not give it a go!",
