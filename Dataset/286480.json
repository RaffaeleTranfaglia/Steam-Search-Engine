Never heard of this series before, but I'm glad I found it.  Little disappointed at the rushed ending of #3, but overall I loved the series.  Wish there was an add on to play while rebuilding the castle and repairing the reputation of the Gordon clan while finishing the seemingly never ending job dropped on Adrian at the end.",

Overall the best game of the trilogy and one of the best adventure games that have come out in recent years.",

            "review_text": "On its own: A horror/comedy about being possessed and trying your best to solve that problem. As part of a series: a bunch of questionable decisions that could have easily been avoided with ONE PROPER, HONEST conversation, but NO, let me dig my own grave here, as it the only sensible thing to do.  As the finally to the series it manages to do what the previous two games were missing, Comedy. Yes, people still die and some scenarios were maybe not intended to be funny, but the dialogue is full of ham. There is an optional conversation with a fortune teller in every chapter that is top notch. It is made in the same engine as the second one and is mechanically identical, but with no QTEs. I grew to like the main caracter and feel sorry for him for his predicament, as he was finding his place in life. A good series with a flimsy plot, but still enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "Pretty much similar to previous part, except better graphics and less logic puzzles. I noticed many situations where I expected to solve logical puzzle but then there was none, on the contrary there was many situtations where the solutions to progress was to inspect+talk through everything in a scene, pleh. Storywise you must play previous game to get something out of this.  There's almost a game stopping glitch when you inspect Miss Valleys house. Eventhough you solve the puzzle Darren won't react to it. Fortunately it's worked around by using 'skip the puzzle' switch (activated from Additional game help in settings)  The praise: -even better graphics, backgrounds are amazing -badass Mordred-Darren seizures -find the crows 'minigame' -good voice acting and dialog -more grimsome -you die fewer times...  The nag: -... but you can still die (I see no point for dying in p'n'c, creates just needless save loading) -cawing of the crows becomes tiresome incredibly fast, luckily you can mute them from ambient sounds settings -too few puzzles, too much wandering -that one glitch",
