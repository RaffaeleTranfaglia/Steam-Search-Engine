            "review_text": "After playing this game, I just had to do a review! I'm a big horror fan and I knew with VR, these kinds of games would be great for it if done right. Well, I'm happy to say that this is one of the best out there so far for the Vive!   Pros - Great atmosphere and music. This is something a horror/suspense game needs and this one pulls it off! As for the scares, from what I played so far it does the job. I've been playing horror games for years now and never got scared or felt uneasy. This game made me jump and creeped me out. Great job! For the hell of it, I wanted to see how good of a job it does to make you feel like you're there in the world. I was very impressed with even the little things. When I was on a boat, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, rocking back and forth. The boat actually moved like it would in real life. Bravo for the small details!   Cons - So far the only thing I can complain about is the object interaction. Holding items feels weird unless you go out of your way to manipulate them until they fit in your hand how they are supposed to be. Then you have items that fall into walls or floors. If that happens with a key item, you have to restart the chapter. The other thing is room scale. It tells you that you have to have a certain amount of space, which I'm sure is true. It warned me my room wasn't big enough, but I continued anyways since it was just slightly off from the recommened space. It still worked well!   With the small cons this game has, you must play this! This is the right direction for VR horror and I hope to see more from this developer and others.",

There are still glitches within the game, especially if there are multiple objects on top or within each other that you have to pick up (boxes with books in them, planks on top of each other, etc) but that certainly doesnt make the game less enjoyable. The scare tactics used in the game are very well done. It builds up and you feel at times you need to say to yourself 'this is not real, this is not real...'.  Dont expect a gore-horror game, expect a thriller where there are some jump scares (at least I freaked a few times). All in all this is very well done and looking forward to more of the same.  Thank you developers for creating a thriller adventure game!",

            "review_text": "Well made, scary puzzle game that makes great use of room scale VR. Like many VR games it's rather short (I finished it in just above 3 hours) and quite expensive considering the short amount of time you're likely to spend with it (currently 22.99€). But considering the relatively small audience for room scale VR games at the moment, I guess the games come at a premium.  But if the price is not an issue, you get one of the most immersive and complete 'mature' room-scale VR games available. The game will creep you out at points, and scary stuff in VR -is- another level than scary stuff on your PC monitor, so you must be able to handle it. The immersion is so effective, in some scenes my thumb was hovering over the steam-menu button as an 'emergency exit' option, scared that something could happen that would really freak me out and fry my brain or something. :D Obviously this game is not for everybody, but if you are used to horror games, it's nothing really too bad.  The game has a nice variety of scenes and a satisfying ending. Sometimes it manages to be fun in a way that is not central to the game, as you can fool around with some of the more playful items in some of the scenes (building blocks!).   The one thing I didn't like so much is that it relies a bit too much on music and sound effects to put the player into a scary mood, especially towards the end. Of course music is a very effective means for this sort of thing, but towards the end I was getting a little tired of the usual sound cues (they were even starting to hurt my ears a bit, as there is a lot of 'beeping'). I wish they would have made more with visuals instead of relying so much on the sound design.  But with the overall experience in mind, this is a minor complaint. It's a short but well crafted psycho horror that will keep your nerves on edge at times. This game is also great for pointing towards the potential of psycho-horror VR experiences.",

The only one I've ever really enjoyed is Alien Isolation and that's only really because of my love for the source material and admiration for the world they built. But this game... holy ♥♥♥♥.  A friend of mine urged me to try it and I was admittedly curious to see how VR would change my perception of the genre and let me tell you... it changed it. And how.  I started the little small level you can access via the photograph of the girl on the door in the waiting room and then began playing like I always do in these games, somewhat non-nonchalantly trying to faff about whilst progressing to relieve the tension a little. But it really started to get to me. The atmosphere, the sense of presence, the use of roomscale... it all merged together to make a truly unnerving experience that now has me sitting curled up in my chair, lights on full brightness, still alert to subtle noises around the house.  If you were ever in any doubt about VRs ability to transform how you think about games... play this. If you don't normally get along with horror games and want something fresh... play this. If you have some cash going spare... play this. Now if you'll excuse me... I'm going to go make sure the doors to my house are all locked.",

Ocassionally I had an object on the floor just out of reach and I had to use some clever problem solving to use other object to get it within my reach. If you're just under the space requirements consider supporting a great game and give it a go. Just don't blame the game if you can't complete it because of space requirements.  Positives aside, there are some wonky things in the game as well. The physics are kinda bad in the game. Objects will go flying across the room or twitch like crazy. Not game breaking.

            "review_text": "Finished the game in 2 playthroughs and I have to say I'm quite reluctant to play it again, simply because it is the most terrifying experience I've ever had in my life after that one time I've seen the green frog on a unicycle meme come back to life in 2016.   I mean, the first minute was on point. This world is dark, it is too real even if the 'grhafux' aren't that good (Animations are just reduced to making objects slide or vibrate. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )). It is too small for me to ever feel safe. This world is disturbing. And since it is VR, I'm in this world. The immersion is total, when everything goes right. My room was missing like 20cm to fit in for the game, so it was a struggle of learning how to open real world doors to reach for virtual pills to progress from virtual rooms to virtual rooms. I had to do the first half of the game like this, until they patched in a teleport mode. Though honestly the real room scale mode made me feel way more immersed and helpless into these unknown places. I've never felt that trapped before to be honest   So then first 10 minutes, I dive into the story. This is pretty cool, a murder, mental illness, a psychiatric yard, some doctors with a broom in the ♥♥♥, flashbacks, some pills to trip with... It really sets in the character of the game, and helps you identify with him quickly. English being my 2nd language, I don't really grasp the story. But all I know is that I'm screwed in the brain and some pills make me go from room to room. These rooms vary a lot. Sometimes I'M ON A BOAT, sometimes in a corridor, sometimes in a cabin in the woods... These are neat. But all these rooms are dark enough to make you feel unsafe. Every noise, would it be the perfect placing of cue music to a simple clock ticking, makes you freak out.   I spend the next hour trying to resolve the mysteries unfolding before me. It feels like a point and click game, and can become quite frustrating since it is so easy to miss objects that are key to progression. The grabbing of the objects can also be infuriating : I struggled for like 3 minutes on the first release version with the UV lamps just trying to turn it in my hand . But all in all, these puzzles are really designed in a refreshing way. And by refreshing, I mean that you drop a huge sigh of relief everytime you manage to put a key on a door, not because of the mentionned control problems, but because it took some good effort to grab that damn key in the first place. Satisfaction and fun. Overall, the progression isn't that hard, but I've had some friends getting stuck for 30 minutes in some rooms, because the clues the game gives you through notes on your hands were written in an English too hard to understand for some. Still, it doesn't hurt the enjoyment to much as you roll through the doors.   And this is when the first 'jumpscare' happens. I'm here in this corridor, and... I can't describe how much manlyness I lost in the process, screaming like a little child while trying to pass through the physical wall of my play area. This is scary. These moments aren't common, but when these happen, you are in for a treat. These are not Pewdiepie level jumpscares. These are smart. As if you were put in a dark room, and a mask slowly fades in view and approches you. A game that closely reproduces this level and sensation of fear would be Fatal Frame. This is so mentally challenging I had to pause the game at one point to take a breath and regain sanity.   After 6 hours, I finished the game. The story was quite interesting, even though it is totally not as rich as a Silent Hill. But I'm glad I finally came out of this rollercoaster. Damn, what an experience, one of the best I've had in my life. And when I say this, it means it is better than sex. Not that sex gets me jumpscares... I mean, it depends on how the sex is done, and who it is done with... I mean... nevermind. Drugs are still better nonetheless.  Overall : 9/10, not enough chairs",

As a 27 y/o adult, nothing really scares me (unless it is something dangerous with realistic consequences), but this game gave me genuine anxiety. I've never had goosebumps so bad that all my hairs stood up until this game. I screamed out loud several times playing this. It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, but I don't regret buying it all as it provided a very immersive, emotional experience. I was sometimes too scared to even start the game, but I was determined to complete it. It does not rely on jump scares, it is much more genuine and the story itself is scary. There are parts where I just froze and was too scared to move or do anything. While I recommend this to most, I can't say it's for everyone. The puzzles are challenging, and if you don't have patience, focus, attention to detail, and problem solving skills, then this is not for you. My wife could not get past the first level because she got frustrated from not knowing what to do and would give up too easily. You end up getting stuck in a room and if you don't figure out what to do you could get stuck there for a while. You build a relationship with the room and you start to feel trapped, which for me added to the creepiness and immersion-level of the game. As a gamer I enjoyed the challenge and the determination to continue paid off. If you are a gamer who has the patience for puzzle games and wants to get scared, this game is for you. If you want to scare your friends, I recommend beating the game yourself first so you have all the levels available, then just throwing them into a scary part of the game where they don't have a whole lot to have to figure out, and the scares start right away. The game gets scarier the further you get so the beginning can be a little slow for people that struggle to solve the puzzles. Can't wait to scare my friends with this one!",

I'd like to see some of the content worked on though. The school locker lock was frustraitingly difficult to spin and see, when the solution would be to 'zoom' in on the lock when picked up. Infact, most of the text could use a little 1.5 zoom when looked at. I know it may hurt immersion, but we flat out skipped some text because it was just too annoying to stick the controller against our faces. Otherwise! The story and atmosphere was great.

            "review_text": "This is the second game I've completed in virtual reality, after  The Gallery  episode 1, that feels even close to being like a 'real game' with an actual campaign storyline. Both have been a revelation, yet containing so many flaws ( Greenwater  especially) that I struggle to give either of them a strong recommendation. Nevertheless, here I am recommending this game, and not just to reward the developers for taking a big risk in a new artistic medium.  This game's strongest and weakest points demonstrate what can be most challenging and most rewarding in virtual reality game design. First, room-scale VR can do horror like nothing else. Most horror movies and videogames bore me or even put me to sleep. But  Greenwater  puts you in small, claustrophobic rooms roughly the same size as your physical play space. Unlike in  The Gallery , there are no blurry far away objects or textures and no need for potentially immersion-breaking locomotion systems. Everything is right in front of you and within physical walking distance.  This also means that whatever is going to scare you, and you just  know  something is coming, it's going to be very close, and running is impossible both in the real and the virtual world. There were some parts of the game where I had to just stop and come back to it later because the suspense was driving me as mad and paranoid as the character you play. I found out after this happened a few times that this only makes the game  more suspenseful ; it's better to just keep pushing forward.  There are times when you need to move to a different room, and as long as the door is unlocked, you just press your trigger on the doorknob, and your virtual body fades out of one room and into the next. It's so simple, and works beautifully. Future VR game designers should take note of the techniques used here; mere level design could solve many of the locomotion questions that are still being asked about VR games.  Second, fear seems to make it easier to achieve presence, but wonky unrealistic physics destroys it, at least in games that aren't set in fantasy/scifi worlds. And this game's physics system is deeply awful. Even just picking things up, like the titular chair in a room, feels wrong and awkward the way it swings in your hand. When you pick up pills and put them in a mug, they sometimes fall through the mug. Drawers hardly ever shut perfectly, which is excruciating to me. It feels even wonkier than the buggy physics in Surgeon Simulator games.  This game is basically an elaborate escape-the-room, so having such broken physics occasionally feels like a deal-breaker when your progress depends on manipulation of objects. Perhaps this is good for some people, as it will add some comic relief to a game that would otherwise be so frighteningly suspenseful it would simply be unbearable. But I would rather not be shifting in and out of presence all the time.  The actual story and horror elements in the game are really rather shallow, depending almost entirely on the creepy setting, music (that always seems to be  judging  you), lighting, and occasional psychotic visions than on interesting characters. But it all works really, really well in this game, because you are playing a psychotic character. You feel it from the moment the game starts, that your mind is unstable and your perception of the world is unreliable, and that you are always being watched and scrutinized by the mental instutition you're trapped in. In spite of the disastrous physics system, this has been one of the most immersive gaming experiences of my life.  4/5",

I wouldn't hesitate buying this - you get a solid 3 hours of play time out of it - more if you try to experience the room as a room that you are 'stuck' in. Imagining yourself in that situation - well, it's something I haven't had to do before. I'm ready for the next chapter - cash in hand. If you buy this at a discount, you've done well. I bought when it was 20% off and feel it was money well spent.   If I had one complaint it's that it should have a 'disable chaperone' option because when you get close to the walls, it tends to wash out all of the graphics. I actually turned mine off for a better experience (you don't need the chaperone because the game places walls where your actual walls are...  Probably the best VR experience I've had.

You can't do much other than picking up objects. It places you in a room with the sound and trying to scare you. It looks nice in a room being able to walk around but other than that, there isn't much you can do. I quit after gotten to ch.2 and request a refund. It ain't good enough for $25 bucks.",

Some of the puzzles are unintuitive, and the rest are so easy as to not qualify as puzzles. Mostly, you just look around, read notes, and touch things until the next plot event triggers for 3-4 hours. You could likely speedrun it in under an hour.",

I dont want to describe too much for fear of spoilers but I will say that its the only game I have ever geniuenly felt fear while playing. All of this is achieved with very minimal use of jump scares. The environments are incredibly immersive and graphically impressive. I have never felt this immersed in any other game I have played.",

Makes great use of the physical space around you (ie. less reliant on teleportation, allowing you to be more immersed) and has a very solid production value. Graphics are great, sound is great, music is great and well used to enhance the experience. Overall shows what we can expect with the future of VR games.   Also, if you like to be scared and feel tense, this is a must-have (stop reading and just buy it!). It was extremely nerve racking to play alone without someone else being in the room to at least try talking to while playing. Better than any horror movie I've watched, since you are pretty much living it. Can't wait to see more things like this down the road!",

The visuals are very well crafted and realistic. The developers did an amazing job on this game, capturing the mood, building suspense, and making it a truly terrifying experience. So terrifying, in fact, I have yet to complete the game. It is simply too scary for me to play. I keep expecting to turn around and see something horrifying. You can find youtube videos of game reviewers cowering on the floor while playing this game. Is it really that scary to play that these youtubers would be shrieking in terror? YES. The answer is YES. If you're not a horror fan, you won't make it past the hotel room scene. Someday I'll finish the game when I'm feeling particularly brave.",

While playing it does immerse you very well while having very interesting puzzles. The game does have some rough spots and we had to restart a couple times after seemingly losing important parts to some.  If you want a well thought out horror game that doesn't rely on jump scares, then here you go. This is an amazing phycological horror game that is perfect in VR.",
