            "review_text": "(If you 'd rather not read this review, you at least owe it to youself to watch the trailer on the Safety First! Store Page.)  Safety First! is a surprisingly clever and well-designed twin stick physics game, as much a puzzle game as one based on dexterity. The premise is that the gamer must control a stick-figure character to fix electrical problems by using Magical Yellow Repair Liquid (MYRL) directed toward the damaged area through a tool hanging from the character’s waist. (In simple language, urinating onto sparking electrical wires to fix them. WARNING!! Do NOT try this at home! It does not work, and may get you arrested if done outdoors!)   Certainly, the most obvious aspect of Safety First! is humorous irreverence. But beyond that is a genuinely fun game with 69 levels (yeah, right) and 34 achievements (enough based on failure to make gamers of all levels happy.) There are three game modes, two of which need to be unlocked by successful gameplay. Included for an additional challenge is “DRNK” mode, or drunk play plus German profanity. The best part of Safety First!; failure triggers bloody separation (or crushing, etc.) of various body parts. While it’s a difficult game, the learning curve is reasonable, and some quantity of really hard levels can be skipped. (All these statements are based on completion of only twenty plus levels in the basic mode.)  Safety First! is a clever and surprisingly nuanced game in which a controller is strongly suggested. It’s a very inexpensive game (on sale for $2USD), and the first seventeen reviews give it a perfect score. Highly recommended, but seemingly with no great surprises either way if you like this type of game as much as this player does.   Thank you.",

            "review_text": "I saw the early version of this game released at Revision 2015 as part of the games compo, and it captivated the entire audience. The whole hall was erupting with laughter as players attempted to solve the puzzles. The next day I couldn't walk anywhere without seeing someone playing it, whether in the main hall, down in the tunnel, or anywhere else.  In this game your task is to urinate 'magic fixing fluid' into electric wires. Your controls are something akin to QWOP, with individual control of the separate legs. Each level requires progressively more and more precision and speed. Feel like you want a bigger challenge than the traditional modes? Try speedy mode! Still not satisfied? Try DRNK mode, where your controls are drunk and German swear words are randomly shouted at you.  This game is hilarious fun. It's simple, well polished, and silly. My only minor complaint is that without an Xbox controller the UI is a little awkward, since the control hints aren't translated for keyboard. Once you work them out (WASD for left leg, up/down/left/right for right leg, space = A, escape = B, C = cheat/Y) it still plays great on the keyboard though.  If you like puzzle games that don't take themselves too seriously, or just want a laugh, buy it. At the listed price it's worth every penny and more.",
