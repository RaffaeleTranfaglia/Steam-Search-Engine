            "review_text": "My first run through went pretty well, I didn't understand all this 'dark' stuff people were talking about. Then, after more runs, I understood what they meant. This is a great story, but it can be ambiguous. I really like the role of the kid, and the choices you get to make.  Now for criticism of the plot. Yes, this story is dark, and sometimes disturbing. It is written well to stab you right in the feelers.  If you are sensitive I reccomend you DO NOT buy this game, due to the gore/disturbing things that can (will) happen. However, for someone like me, I can tolerate the darkness just fine, and I don't get too upset/emotional over stuff. But this game hit me pretty hard too, so if you are new or a casual VN reader it might be a bit much. Overall I think the writing is very creative and intellegent, the music fits well, and the art is good. It is a good read if you want to release/feel some emotions.",

The endings and varied paths are marked by tonal and genre shifts. The writing is quite good, especially the dialogue. It really is a well-constructed VN.",

It is pointlessly long, so far I have gotten through 4-5 endings and all I can think of is how annoying and wimpy the main character is. I do not want to read 12 pages worth of text about how out of shape you are from living in the city now that you are visiting the countryside where transportation is not as easy every 5 minutes. Sure there were funny parts like the main character's grandpa loves wearing Hawaiian shirts under his hama and other things I will not spoil, but the main character got on my nerves that I cannot continue reading.This reminds me too much of the anime School Days, I thought this would be more like Mira Nikki or Higurashi.  So if you want to get this game, please know the main character is annoying and wimpy. ",

There's a wide variety of feelings to be had, and they are all expressed within a few characters and within a short time. This compressed format makes it a very fast and concentrated ride. Definitely recommend, despite the ' quaility ' character designs. Don't let that turn you away from this VN, which is at it's best, intense.",

It's too bad you can only have romance routes with only the two main girls in the game and not with the princess. I wish there would be someone who can make a guide to how to get all the endings to the game without spoiling anything. It is hard for me to figure it out and eventually I would love to get the best/special ending.",
