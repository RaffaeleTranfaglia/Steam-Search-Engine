            "review_text": "5/10 - 10 Minute Retelling of Robinson Crusoe and Hidden Object Game  The game is pretty average to it's core; the actual story really doesn't do justice to this classic though. The bulk of the game takes place within hidden object puzzles. This game is a little older and it shows on some of the scenes. Objects can be pretty difficult to see unless you have a ginormous monitor.  This game has approximately 30-31 different puzzles which average around 2.5-3.5 hours of game play. There is also a survival mode for those who dare to step up the difficulty. The $10 price is outragous for the age, length and overall story quality.   Worth $2-3; If you really want this grab heavily discounted!",

        {
            "review_text": "Old style hidden object game about Robinson Crusoe's adventures. The hard difficulty has a 60 minutes timer to complete each of the 6 chapters, you can skip puzzles paying a penalty of 15 minutes and miss-clickings cost 1 minute each, so 60 minutes for a chapter sometimes is barely enough and this makes the game very challenging. Graphics aren't very good and this makes spotting objects frustrating, there are lots of HO scenes but only a few puzzles (mostly memory games). It's certainly not a game for everyone, but if you don't mind low graphics and old style adventures you may like it.",

            "review_text": "I would not recommend. The quality of the graphics is too low to enjoy the game. The story is nice enough, but the puzzles are no fun because of the graphics. It gets too difficult to find objects when you can't decently look at it. However: there are some fun puzzles in the game.",
