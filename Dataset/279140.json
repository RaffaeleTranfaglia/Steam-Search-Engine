            "review_text": "This game isn't terrible, but it has a few problems that makes it a terrible Great War simulator. Here is the run-down:  1. Allied forces are HEAVILY favored. What do I mean by that? Simple, all the units on the different sides of the conflict are equivalent. A German infantry is equal to that of a French or Russian infantry. The German military was the best trained, the best equipped, and the best supported army in the conflict. Some would even put this military on par with the greatest militaries of all time. Russia, on the other hand, was supposed to be slow to mobilize and ill-equipped. I played a game where AI Russia was in Berlin before the end of 1914. Because the units are equal in strength, the Allies, with huge size advantages, will likely always win.  2. Serbia is too weak. Historically, Serbia lasted a surprisingly long time. In this game, Serbia doesn't have even close to enough resources to supply its comparatively huge military. Austria-Hungary rolls them up as a matter of course, because the Serbians starve to death and run out of guns.  3. Belgium is too strong. I played a game where Belgium completely repelled Germany (one of the greatest militaries in history), and even took ground in Germany.   4. The Allied forces start with Great Britain already involved. GB wasn't keen on getting in on this war, and only planned on doing so if Belgium's neutrality was violated. GB also only had the expeditionary forces on hand to wage a land war, in this game they seem to have a pretty healthy army from the start.  5. Austria-Hungary is too good. The Great War is the tale about how Austria-Hungary constantly did the exact opposite of what Germany wanted, and as a result, they were getting pummelled by everyone, including the Kingdom of Serbia. The only force AH knows how to fight is Italy, which leads to the next point:  6. Italy is too strong. Historically, Italy failed to take the exact same river 9+ times against Austria. In this game, it's only a little harder than taking any other position.   I'm sure there are other problems, but let's move on to mechanics:  1. The Great War was insane. Battles went no where, and the defenders always had the advantage. Hence, both sides would put up trenches, and fortify, fortify, fortify. Attacks were suicidal. This game doesn't do trench warfare well because the units and regions are too large. These trenches were separated by only a few hundred yards, loaded with barbed wire, and supervised by machine guns and artillery. Units would stand at a stalemate for months at a time, with no progress being made, constantly under a hail of shells. In this game, you have to commit massive armies to an attack, and the attack lasts until one side loses. Smaller units or smaller regions would help solve this issue.  2. You can always see all the units of the enemy. Observation planes and observation balloons only give your artillery bonuses to hit (which they need, because they can barely ever hit). This is not a good feature for a game where air superiority meant you knew where your enemey was, and they didn't know where you were.  3. Big, important advances (such as metal helmets) aren't commented on in the game. You also can't upgrade units (as far as I can tell), which makes no sense, considering the only different based on technology would be equipment. Upgrading a units defense by giving them helmets sounds pretty easy to me.  4. Diplomacy is difficult to achieve, because it takes place over lengthy, incremental time periods. Far longer than the scope of the game. I tried playing the US in the 1912 campaign start, with the goal making a Western Hemisphere alliance, but for some reason only Nicaragua was interested. I offered aid to many countries, and every couple of turns, they cancel the aid (why give up free money, I ask). The AI just sells you stuff until they run out of stuff, and they buy stuff until they think they have enough stuff. There is not indication of a desire to reach sustainability. Aside from war, that is every diplomatic choice you really have with them, except for the absolutely pointless support factions options. I say it is pointless because I couldn't find a point. I couldn't see any change over time whatsoever.  This is just a short list of what I found disappointing about this game. What I wanted was an accurate, defensive shlog that would reflect the Great War. What I got was a game where offensive movement is far too easy to accomplish.",

            "review_text": "The short TLDR version: it's a great, strategy 'world game' with high production values, great MP play and covers the period perfectly. It's what RISK would be like if a group of Professors and history buffs modded the hell out of it and pumped it full of steroids. In fact, that's not far from the truth. Muzzy Lane are without doubt *the* academic game developers with an undeniable academic and gaming pedigree for historic sandbox strategy gaming. Their line-up includes MIT grads, noted world-famous academics and some of the best coders and designers around. This is a well-researched, very well-constructed strategy game for thinking people and warlords alike. While it's possible to go-for-broke and unleash the dogs of war from the start, you can also roleplay your nation historically (or ahistorically) and fulfil your desire for world domination, domination of a sphere, or run your empire or nation benevolently and attempt to prosper and grow. The game covers economic, scientific, diplomatic and military areas with detail and puts the controls of your nation at your fingertips.  Each power has it's own sphere of influence, and if you start becoming involved in areas of the globe in which they hold an interest, then you will be warned and war might even follow. It's a game where you cannot just bludgeon through without facing consequences. Armies must be supplied and also fed. Food plays a vital role (which is not covered in other games of Grand Strategy) and transport of that food is vital if you ship it from abroad. This is where control of vital areas comes into play, and also trade warfare such as unrestricted submarine warfare. You really have to think strategically in broad strokes to achieve your goals. Also, the technology of the warfare of this period is unlike anything you may have been familiar with before. Warfare is in a new era that renders the old Victorian style of warfare (which didn't change much from Napoleonic times) obsolete. The machine gun changed all of this, making wars long, costly and with terrible attrition. A nation has it's War Weariness measured in the game, which affects the nation's will to fight. You can wrestle it out on long fronts, hoping for a breakthrough or you can try to end the deadlock by pouring troops into your meat-grinder and waging a war of attrition. Technology plays a vital role in gaining an edge, as new weapons and methods of waging war, like gas attacks, better artillery, assault troops and aircraft can turn the tide of battles. Eventually, one side will break and they will gain that extra territory. You need to make sure it's you.  There is also a wealth of demographic map overlays to satisfy the most obsessive map fiends. They cover amongst other things, religion, ethnicity, trade, infrastructure and so on. It's also worth noting that the economic and trade parts of the game are highly enjoyable and you can make a lot of money or gain precious resources this way. The market also reacts dynamically to supply and demand, so, you can do things like buy a lot of one resource on the market to drive the price up, and vice-versa. If you have the added privilege of owning major sources of that resource, then you can effectively destabilise other nation's economies without firing a shot.  The UI is typical for Muzzy Lane: uncluttered, easy to process, easy on the eye and with ease of access to all info in a very sleek and classy-looking way. You can go deep into the sub-menus for all kinds of interesting and vital info. The in-game encyclopedia is thankfully in-game and not online. This contains all info on unit stats, buildings, and everything else you would want to know. The manual also has extensive info on this and it's not a two-page leaflet with install instructions, a screenshot and key commands. It's a proper manual.  Finally, if you really want to create new scenarios, the editor will allow you to do this. You can recreate anything from the turn of the century to the inter-war period of the 1920's and early 1930's. This period is very ripe for all kinds of alt-history scenarios and with bit of research you could make something really cool.  Or, you can cheat and give your nation a huge army, air force and navy, all available tech and then steamroller across the world if you like.  You can share the scenarios online through Muzzy Lane's website.   If you play global strategy games, then this is a game you must own.  I'll give it 9/10, one point off perfect, because I want to see them make a WW2 game like this.",

            "review_text": "I love the concept of this game. The ability to use combined arms. I spent many hours playing this game. Trying to change history and Have the central powers of Europe come on top. The gas attacks. I love it. Most games of this type are usually the same. You simply move all your units to one province and let them have at it. But this game concept allowed artillery pieces to remain in adjacent provinces and rain death upon the battlefield. This was my favorite part of the game. The game actually built a realistic WW 1 battle strategy game. It is a pure slug fest of vast numbers of casualties. You can\\'t simply overwhelm a province or run throught it and the battle for europe is done in so much time. The amount of resources and men needed to take a province that is well defended is quite staggering.   No other strategy game I have played has better simulated trench warfare on a massive scale than this one. I have had a lot of fun with this game.  For the negative part of the game. Theyre are some very critcal flaws. No matter how much fun and enjoyment ive had with this game. You simply can\\'t recommend a game that has some severe problems. But if you want to enjoy some serious simulated trench warfare. The game is very available. Just do not have any grand visions of conquering the whole of europe.  Eventually the game will become unplayable. I have never finished a game before the game breaking flaws come in. Its a real shame that it is severly unpolished. Initialy the game will run smooth enough but due to the continued numbers of troops. The game simply breaks.  If these critcal flaws could have been addressed. This game could have been one of the best simulated strategy games of its kind.",

            "review_text": "I've played MH series games more then other game series. TGW is no different and i highly recommend it to any armchair general worth his salt. Muzzy Lane the relatively small and unknown studio behind this series is fantastic for customer support (i've exchanged direct emails with the developer team reporting bugs, they explained in great detail why these bugs existed and how they would fix them) They are professional and love the subject matter with a deep passion. The updates never cease as well, adding additional fixes and content with each new update. The forums are filled with passionate and friendly people dying to discuss history and tactics, overall a very welcoming and friendly community. Modding support is built into the foundations and this shows with the map Editor which gives you the ability to rework the game entirely as you see fit, with the built in option to upload mods you create directly to the steam workshop or to the making history website. Multiplayer is also available and is incredibly addicting to play with friends. This game truly makes you feel like YOU are making the history.  I recommend this game at a STRONG 11/10 for those wanting a serious and rewarding world war 1 RTS unlike anyother in terms of playability and satisfaction.",

            "review_text": "This game starts out with promise, but I find it quickly bogs down into dozens of small skirmishes, weird troop penetrations that are almost impossible to containt, including enemy troops that are hell bent on taking territory, logistics be damned. With some tweaks this could be a decent game, but right now there's too much to control for a large nation, trade is a train-wreck (the AI thinks nothing of taking 40 transport from you and then cancelling the trade a couple turns later), instead of nations focusing on a single front, they scatter and start many small battles, after a dozen nations do this you can have more battles going on than makes sense.  I want to like this game, but it has the same horrible interface as MH:II, there's too much to keep track of, making the game less about strategy and more about dozens of tiny stupid choices each turn, including pop ups that make zero sense, such as relations between minor nations, meaning you will spend more of your turn sometimes just closing notification screens that could all be put in the report field instead of slamming you in the face with a popup each turn.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I'm stunned from the story I was able to craft during my playthrough as France.  It started out with me, as president of France, bolstering the military power in case of any wars. Fortunatley, a serbian with a jumpy trigger finger was able to give me a chance to enact revenge for the Franco-Prussian war. Allies swarmed in to take over Germany, and eventually Russia ended up taking most of Eastern Europe, and I was able to take former Luxembourg and parts of West Germany. I eventually was the last country to fight Germany, and left my alliance to destroy the dogs. Germany was left to one small region, eventually becoming part of a new alliance...  Then, our friends from the east betrayed us...Italy declared war. Japan was first to get a slice of the cake and take over rome. I was able to take the remaining parts, and now Italy is a tiny nation north of Albania. Russia is now leading the Allied powers, and has started a war with America. America teamed up with Nicuaragua and Cuba, which the US would lose East Texas and Puerto Rico. Then, the second civil war starts, with the New Confederate States fighting the Union, Texas takes this as a perfect oppritunity to secede and becomes the New Texas Republic, fighting both sides in the conflict.  Africa would be taken over by Spain and the UK, leaving only our trusty colony of Algeria left.  Countless new states and rebellions would form to fight russia and their growing power.  As the world becomes unstable and war torn, France remains strong, though now a Regional power, France has settled down and became one of the last stable places in the world and settle down with their new land in Africa and what used to be Italy, as her economy comes back after being destroyed from the war. Along with the remains of Germany and Austria-Hungary, France would re join the Allied powers after leaving in 1915. It is now 1917, while the world is still at war, France strives to become a world power once again.  That is my story my friends. Because of army expansion, I caused the world to become a deadly place with empires pulling apart each other to gain power.",
