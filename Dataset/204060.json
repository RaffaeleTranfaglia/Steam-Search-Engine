            "review_text": "In Sword and Sworcery, you're a warrior, The Scythian, on a quest to get the mystic macguffin. You meet a few folks, fight a few beasts, and solve some puzzles (mostly by clicking at the proper time or in the proper order). This is all framed as some kind of 'therapy session', presented by 'The Archetype', a Fourth Wall-breaking, cigar-smoking quasi-narrator.  The major issue with this game is its far too pre-occupied with being quirky and self-aware. If it were a person, it'd be that guy who confuses the simple act of dressing in a suit and drinking martinis with having charisma and gravitas. He doesn't know etiquette, doesn't have any sorts of skills, has no refinement to his tastes, but covers for it by downplaying the importance of all those things. He's too cool to learn the rules but still thinks he can break them. That he's too good to know that stuff. He has no game, but think's he's a player.  That's what I got out of this game. The gameplay is extremely rudimentary and poorly designed on top of that. Skin pulled across bare-bones. Exploration consists of tromping across a simple path through several screens, very slowly. You click on things of interest to gain to be rewarded often with throw-away lines delivered in that Dudebro vernacular ('We saw a grave on the hill and wondered what was up with that'. Riveting).   Puzzles consist of going where the hint tells you. This isn't hard, it's just tedious and time-consuming, due to the aforementioned plodding walking pace. You only have a linear left-or-right path to take anyway. Once you arrive, you hold down the button for five seconds to make your Magic-Mode happen. You then click in an arbitrary fashion on things on the screen. Sometimes it's sheep, sometimes it's trees, sometimes it's birds. There's no logical connection to the objects and the puzzle. There's also no real logic to the order in which you must click them. It's just trial-and-error. It's about as difficult and as fun as stuffing a bunch of random toys into a toy chest so the lid closes.   Combat consists of a rythm game that's extremely rudimentary. You can block, or hit. Wait for the cue, hit the enemy, or block his attack. Sometimes you attack his attack so it's bounced back, and they might bounce it back at you. Repeat until someone screws up.  So on top of this gameplay we get a presentation that's way too satisfied with itself. When something pretends to be much more clever or intelligent than it is, that's the textbook definition of 'Pretention'.  Don't get this game, it's a waste of time.",

            "review_text": "It's okay for a game to be tongue and cheek about what it does, to lampshade tropes and poke fun at its subject matter. It's part of being self-aware, of understanding your medium and using it well.   This game is frustrating because it takes this to its illogical conclusion: EVERYTHING is lampshaded, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and you're never given even a second to immerse yourself without the game reminding you that THIS is what it is doing, and isn't it so clever that it's doing that and aware of it?  Coupled with bafflingly poor game design decisions (that you're perhaps supposed to appreciate for the irony?) like running across an entire established world several times for a quest, being all but required to adjust your date and time settings on your actual computer, and Twitter integration of all things, this game trips over itself to get in the way of your having fun.  The art is pretty, though. If they toned the smug faux-intellectualism down a notch and tried not intentionally designing the game poorly, it could've been a fun game.",

            "review_text": " Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP  is a kind of game that you may hate before you love it.   You play as a girl (that looks like a random pile of pixels) that explores a tiny mysterious world, fights deadly monsters and tries to make sense of it all.   It is a point and click adventure with several fighting sequences. Sometimes it gets very confusing. In-game hints are often not helpful. You end up wondering around without knowing what to do. The fact that some in-game events only happen during certain real life moon phases (the game checks the date every time you play) is not making things easier.   Use the guide or watch walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Judging by achievement stats less than 10% actually manage to finish the game even though it is just a couple of hours long. Things start making much more sense on the second playthrough if you ever get to that point.   This game is beautiful. It is funny. It is confusing. It is scary. It is sad. It is weird. Very very weird.  A review won’t do it justice. You have to experience it. And music... music is amazing.   Rating:  A piece of indie gaming art / 10.",

            "review_text": "I honestly had to think about whether or not to give this one a thumbs up. I loved it all the way through, but some of the negative reviews here have some points. For one thing the game is terribly short - though it says 'small world' in the game description. Another is that the click to move is often considerably slower and more clumsy than I would like, and finally the humor is hit or miss. Sometimes it puts a grin on your face, other times it's eye-roll worthy.  With that said, this is roughly the equivelant of an indie prog-rock concept album, only instead of lyrics you get gameplay. Most of the puzzles involve clicking and experimenting with the environment while 'meditating' and are all in themselves relatively simple. The combat involves some reflexes, but has set patterns which can allow even people with slow reflexes to survive it.   The star of the show is the music - play this with a good set of headphones and enjoy the atmosphere it creates, don't play this game if you like to rush, and don't go expecting shakespeare instead of beowulf. I found it a really fantastic experience that was definitely worth the price of a movie ticket. I would take a chance on it - there is always the refund.",

It was designed as an experiment to see how social media and gaming interact with one another. The quirky 2nd person narration and access to twitter make the game feel as if you're traveling with the main character to complete her woeful errand. It's very slow to start, but the game becomes very suspenseful towards the end and you'll be glad you've stuck with it if you make it that far. Perhaps this revitalization of the Adventure Game genre is ahead of its time and not easily understood by the more impatient or less educated, but I found it to be a magical story. I went in curious as to what this game was (I received it with Humble Indie Bundle 5), and came out with a heavy heart. The emotion at the end really struck me. Jim Guthrie did an amazing job on the Soundtrack and Capybara Games did amazing with the animation and beautiful minimalist visuals.",

            "review_text": "When you first fire up Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, you are greeted by a mysterious cigar smoking figure with the following introduction:  'We are profoundly grateful that you have chosen to participate in this experimental treatment for acute soul-sickness.'  That's as good an indication as any that this isn't your average run of the mill entertainment. While the core gameplay matches that of a classic 2D point and click adventure, the distinct elements that feed the whole are original and uniquely charming and the sum of their parts makes for an experience that is quite unlike anything else.  You will be presented with the option to tweet the messages that pop up throughout your quest, and as hinted at earlier, I guess this is meant to function as an experiment in social networking and provide real time feedback and meta-commentary while you play. It's a novel way of integrating real world social networks and to my knowledge hasn't been attempted before in this medium in such fashion. This is a game that isn't afraid to be self-conscious and sometimes poke fun at itself and at what it is trying to achieve. The ironic tone of the dialogue makes this clear from the onset, and although I enjoyed the wry wit and humour on display, there were times when I couldn't help but think what might have been if the developers hadn't felt the need to abruptly break the fourth wall so often and had taken this wonderful thing they had created at face value and just ran with it. Because there is real magic to be found here.   While playing Sword &amp; Sworcery, I'm reminded once again that aiming for fidelity in computer generated graphics can be something of a double-edged, well, sword. While there's something to be said for games that push polygons to their limits and dazzle and awe with their polished 'cinematic realism', what the developers of S&amp;S EP have achieved with simple 2D sprites and pixelated lo-fi is nothing short of... magical. Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is, without a doubt, one of the most beautifully designed and evocatively atmospheric games I have ever witnessed. The visual beauty and artistry of the visual landscape never ceases to fascinate.  It can't be stated often enough that a huge part of what gives the game its one-of-a-kind otherworldly feel is the stellar work of musical genius Jim Guthrie. The hauntingly atmospheric music and brilliantly minimalist sound design make this wonderful mystical world come to life. Sometimes, while wondering around, I would just stop and not do anything at all and just look and listen and just try to soak it all in.  But of course there's more to this whole strange and fantastic adventure, there's a mystery to be solved, secrets to be uncovered, moon phases to be observed, hidden things to be clicked on, places to be discovered, monsters to be fought, and a story to be told and experienced and remembered and cherished. I can't but recommend Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP in the strongest terms. It's a wonderful thing to behold.",

Superbrothers : Sword &amp; Sworcery is the kind of game in which every detail has been cared for, and not taking the time to pay heed for them would be blasphemy. Hell, I met Jim Guthrie's (game's musician) in-game avatar while dreamwalking by a full moon, and as he improvised a small jam session, I just laid back on my chair while listening to the music, just as my character did in-game. Talking about Jim Guthrie, I would like to personally thank the good sir/lady who made so that his album is gifted with the game.  Everything in S:S&amp;S is oddly satisfying, from the release of the sprites, to the rythm-based battles, and just wandering around, or, even better, dreamwalking in the mountain's people minds.  And don't even get me started on the moon gimmick, which is an absolutely astounding idea.  You quickly empathize with the heroine, a 'Scythian' whom nothing you know about, and you will care for her until the end of her woeful errand, if you are brave or heartless enough to lead her there.",

In many ways, it is more of art than game. And understandably, the people that dislike this, seem to miss that point more often than not. Chances are that you haven't played something like this before, and jumping into this can be more than overwhelming in various ways, depending on your expectations. Your best bet, is to not expect anything, which can often be said about anything new, but it probably fits this more than usual.  Despite the essentially awkward controls and playstyle (which may or may not apply to you,) it has a pull to it, so rarely found. Simply keep in mind that without real hand-holding, it will guide you on the journey, with some goofy/witty commentary and tweetability, mixed among the stylistic approach at story-telling via multiple dynamic blendings and clashings of various types of art, music, characterization, and lore.

            "review_text": "Superborthers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is exactly what it's shown to be in the title, an Extended Play. Let's give it a listen.  Well, dude, before we listen we need to think about what we are listening to. Superbrothers from a story perspective, follows the riveting and sacrificial journey of a warrior woman who isn't from around Migmi Taw. She has to place together esoteric constructs in order to defeat a dark force. In short, it's a tragic hero's journey through and through, but with a twist. During loading screens and within certain objects the game's administrator breaks the forth wall reminding us that we are playing a thought experiment with a twitter overlay. Overall the plot of this game maybe isn't moving or entirely grounding in solid logic, but it is very relaxing. It's a story that you will find yourself slowly slipping into just enjoying, even if you don't quite understand it all. In short, Superbrothers is thought provoking, complex, but most importantly just casually enjoyable. Compounding on that relaxing story line is the game's stellar presentation. The creators went the route of a beautifully detailed pixel art style and holy crap does it impress. Environments are vibrant and varied, begging you to explore every single inch. You'll move from a concert to a forest to a massive monolith in mere moments. Not to mention the environments show you how to solve the puzzles given to your character, which means you never feel completely lost or stuck. From a battle design standpoint, these locals are made for exploration and variable atmosphere not combat. Still no location in the game traps you into combat without giving you a chance to ready yourself, meaning that you won't die and flip a table. The game play in Sword &amp; Sworcery is really the only major weak point in the experience. Originally developed as an IOS application, the game's touch screen control system has been poorly appropriated to its PC counterpart. So many aspects of puzzle solving, combat, and movement can feel uncomfortable due to the constant feeling that you’re moving too slow or that your keyboard is uncomfortable. It greatly detracts from the experience on the whole and it's a complete shame, since it could have been fixed by simply allowing the player to move using WASD. Otherwise the puzzles are nicely integrated into the environments, the combat system is simple and rhythm based (which floats nicely with the sound design), and the twitter integration is completely optional allowing your experience to be as public or private as you want.  So now to the most important part of the EP, the sound. Superbrothers is quite literally the best sound designed game I have ever played. The tracks are memorable because of both their intricacy and connection to various areas we spend extensive time exploring within the game. Combat tracks are adventure tracks are bass filled and mesh extremely well with the timing based combat system. More esoteric tracks fit beautifully with the cut scenes and trigon collection moments. The music alone is moving, thematic, and overall excellently composed. And it doesn't end there; the sound effects in the game are excellent. Pounding waterfalls, light footsteps, water splashing, or logs falling Sword &amp; Sworcery will provide you an immersive sound experience. So then to summarize  Pros: - relaxing and thought provoking storyline - breaking of the 4th wall - extremely detailed pixel art - highly varied environments - Puzzles and environment mesh well - Excellent OST - Excellent Sound Design / SFX - Non-invasive social media experience  Cons: - breaking of the 4th wall - Poorly appropriated controls hinder experience - Social media experience?  Now for you completionists out there, I would not tell you not to give this one a go. Most of the achievements in the game can be collected by just playing the game, or doing 4th wall breaking things like setting forward your device clock. But there are a few more difficult ones. For instance you must use the megatome to kill 7 rabbits. This can be tricky due to the mechanic never being explained, but don't fret. You only have a few options at your disposal so it's not hard to figure out how to accomplish this. There is no completion bonus for this game, but it's also not that hard to complete so just sit back and enjoy it. With all this in mind I guys this game a score of 8.3 out of 10 and a completionist rating of Finish it! ",

As a PC user, this is less than thrilling or entertaining. Sure it's got good music and they definitely have an interesting art style (which I don't like but I'll give credit for the attempt) but there's little else going for it. The story unfolds slowly, and it wasn't enough to keep me paying attention. Dialog and descriptions are always either really weird and nonsensical or written as if you got a text message from someone else on an iphone, which strikes me as really lame. As you scroll sideways occasionally you'll get in a fight or a puzzle. Fights are a mess which probably didn't need to even be in this puzzle game, but whatever. Puzzles sometimes require different touches or gestures which would seem natural to an iphone gamer, but not to a PC user. In addition the puzzles often give no clues or really vague clues as to their solution. Puzzles are really obtuse. In fact, as I hinted earlier, the game is connected with your clock and calendar, and certain puzzles can more or less easily-or sometimes not at all- be solved at specific times of day or phases of the moon. Again, this would be more interesting if I was on a phone playing 15 minutes at a time, a couple times a day.  I dunno, some reviewers say it's a masterpiece, but the only masterful part about it is the music. Maybe I'm wrong, but even if a game is boring or frustrating, isn't the dialog and story supposed to keep me interested to push through? Well, didn't happen here.",

The puzzles were too easy and combat was lackluster and unchallenging, making it annoying and pointless to fight that shadow guy everytime you have to walk through the same pathway a millionth time. The writing was also irritating as it tends to make unnecessary self-commentary everytime something happens that takes away any meaning to the story in a shallow attempt to be funny. And let's not forget that annoying voice acting of Logfella when he tries to make awkward conversations with you; it's unfunny and out of character (no attempt to sound like an old woodsman and instead sounds like an awkward teenager) which loses any immersion to the game.

The game is presented in pixel art form at it's best and has a very unique look and charm to it. The music is great and is the best part of the game.  There is some combat, but it's not great. It serves it's purpose. Some people's reviews stated there wasn't much to do, but it's not that bad. It's a small adventure (so far), but I have a feeling it will become a larger one once I get deeper into the game.  Completing the first session was fun and I am only 17% done with the game. It took about 30 minutes and I didn't go everywhere I could. The story was cool and I suspect it isn't over yet! I think I just opened a can of worms so to speak! lol  Anyway, I got this on sale so I can recommend buying it at sale price, but I am not sure about full price yet… I'll let you know when I finish the game! :-) So far it runs great and have not had any problems on my iMac! :-)  Here are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.",

Speaking of the art, it's hard to hide that this game uses a sprite based style that is actually more impressive than you might first think. Animations are extremely fluid, and you'll find yourself captivated by pixel art that looks fairly mediocre in stills yet springs to life in motion.

However, if I had to find pick one gripe about this game it'd be the 'Moon Mood' system in Session III.

I'm not supporting The Choirboys, old man, I'm just saying that the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist ♥♥♥♥♥ucker puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer in the middle of his 47 minute opus 'The Silent Forgiveness Of The Pig-God' and belts out the chords to 'Johnny B. Goode' is the day I'll join you at the footlights of post-modernism.  Besides which, pop songs sell more.'   Just change the musical references to gaming references.   This is a neat 'Game'. I liked it. But you're probably not coming back to it after you've hit the credits.   Good to kill some free time and look at pretty arts and musak.",

The style was neat and the music is excellent, and the tone is a little off-beat; just when it seems to be getting 'in character', it throws some contemporary language in to mix you up. The gameplay elements based on the current (real-time) lunar phase was a neat mix. The one caveat I would add is that combat can be challenging; there isn't a lot of combat overall (it's mostly a puzzle game), but combat does require some good timing and was harder than I was expecting from an otherwise casual game. If you enjoy puzzle games, I'd definitely recommend trying Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, especially if you can catch it on sale.",

Although the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.  I believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.  At its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game. If you find yourself allergic to alliteration (or pretentiousness), then you might have a hard time with this one.",

The only good part about this game was the music/scenery, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing perfect, seeing as you have something pretty to look at /listen to as your fumbling arround trying to get your character to actually move somewhere.",

If you're new to the genre, don't be afraid to try this one out -- it's got a great balance of action, storytelling, and puzzle-solving. It's also beautiful and has some of the best music I've heard in a game in a long time. This one's a real audio-visual treat with a neat little game packed inside. I pretty much got an iPod just so I could play it and I don't regret that one bit. Now that it's available on Steam, this is a must have point-and-click for everyone. It's just that good.",

It is a very minimal games but I did not like the idea behind the lunar cycle or having to wait during certain key times to do some of the things needed to progress in the game.  With that said, I liked what they were trying to achieve and the soundtrack is just excellent.  If you are into Point &amp; Click games, this is probably one of the best out there that goes for the calm and satire feel.",
