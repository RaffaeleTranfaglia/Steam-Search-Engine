    "description": "QLORB is a puzzle game designed to take the simplicity of games like tetris and deconstruct it into something familiar but different. With QLORB 2, 2 sets of blocks must merge into 1 perfect block. In order for this to be accomplished the player must clear away all of the blue blocks so the red blocks have room.",
