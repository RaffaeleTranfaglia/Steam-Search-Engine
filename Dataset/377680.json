Through the way we get all our favoirte Cliche' VN/Anime tropes to get the fanservice that one has come to expect.   Cliche' check list. 1. MC is too stupid/dense to realize that the girs love him... CHECK 2. MC opens doors to find the girls half naked.....CHECK 3. Wardrobe Malfunctions that leave the girls exposed....CHECK 4. Girls OBVISOUSLY throwing them selves at the MC but he is too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to realize what is really going on....A THOUSAND TIMES OVER CHECK!!!  5. The two girls go straight lesbian in order.....to entice him......Well, thats sorta new well uhm...CHECK?   Overall, I do recommend this game to fans of the Sakura Series and or Avid VN readers, there is a simplistic joy that comes from the simple artwork and story, also it has Yuri makeout in and that was worth it for me.",

            "review_text": "THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS IN IT.   CHARACTERS  1. Seiji  Our MALE protagonist. A dense guy that loves the space more than girls.  2. Ayumi  A classic over-the-roof tsundere girl that always try to act mature. A good cook, and one of the smartest student at school, but has no swimming ability.  3. Momoka  A cheerful and immature girl that loves to tease the MC and make lewd jokes. A complete opposite with Ayumi (terrible cook, bad in study, but extremely good at sports, especially swimming.  They brought back a bunch of fan-service scenes that were literally just a copy-paste from Sakura Fantasy (and maybe the whole damn series), and even those scenes were so forced that made me just go 'wtf?'.  The story progression can be summarized like this: Seiji, Ayumi and Momoka came to this particular beach-side hotel on their summer holiday. As they were having fun day to day on the beach, the girls tried hard to make Seiji notice their feeling, and also tried to make him confessing the truth behind his obsessed with studying, which they found really unusual. Gradually, Seiji opened up more to them, told them about the thing that he was trying to cover up, his fear, and his true feeling toward his two friends.   MUSIC  After 5 minutes of playing, I decided to turn off the music and turn my youtube playlist on. &lt;_&lt;  Do something about your boring music please, Winged Cloud.  Pros:  - Decent plot (wait, is this even a pro?)  Cons:  - All-over-the-place plot developments  - Cliche fan-service scenes.  - Unexplained details.  - Boring-to-death music.  Score  Story: 5/10.  Character: 6/10.  Graphic: 7/10.  Music: 2/10.  Overall: 6/10.  Would i rate this game? I guess so. In the End it was still a nice game.",

            "review_text": "Let's have an honest review here, for those who are really thinking 'Do I want to eat lunch, or do I want to buy this game?'  Honestly, if you have two hours to kill, and you'd like a cute enough romance story, go for it.   What you will find in Sakura Beach:  A protagonist that's extremely blur, but also at the same time very smart and introspective. A functional storyline, at best. Some strangely insightful bits of contemplation. Two cute girls with (albeit very generic) likeable personalities. The art is good... enough. it's a sakura game, so yeah there's bewbies.  What you won't find in Sakura Beach:  A coherent tone or pace. Varied characters. A rhyme or reason for the yuri cg in the game, like seriously. A good soundtrack, everytime there's an ecchi sequence this obnoxious saxophone or tuba or french horn track plays in the background, and it's really cheesy. Probably laugh a lot about that. Amazing art.  On a serious note, I liked it. I mean, i'll be honest and was in it for the bewbies, but there aren't much of those so you'll simply be disappointed. Through the game I came to like the characters, however generic they are. It's a cute, fun enough VN for two hours, and it's not going to change your life, but hey it's good enough for the price.  And really, I would have liked it so much more if the tone had been consistent. I know it's anime and anime shifts tone like a racer shifts gears, but there's a scene where the protagonist is trying to be serious, and the two heroines start making out. Not only did it break the tone swimmingly, it was also uncalled for and had no reason. The girls didn't really talk about it very much and they were talking as if they weren't making out.  The ecchi in this game is random and really misplaced, and is really simply fanservice. There are points in time they don't even bother setting up the ecchi scene and it simply appears from out of thin air.   When the game isn't being completely inconsistent, it has nice enough dialogue that'll make you go 'aww', and the romance can be quite sweet. It's nothing too deep and you can see it from a mile away (although the protagonist doesn't seem to), but yeah. It's like, sufficient I guess.  All in all, I liked Sakura Beach. Really. It was fun, and I would just like to think that the random yuri scenes and outbreaks of ecchi that the game throws at you are simply a metaphor for Seiji's (The protagonist) repressed sexuality, because he's close to these two really hot girls and thinks it's impure to think of them that way, this manifests in his daydreaming getting out of hand and bam! They start making out. Which is probably why they don't really think about it that much. But then again, it's anime, not literature, so I'm probably thinking too much about it.   I hope that was the intention, though, then I wouldn't have to be dissappointed in the game so much.",

In Winged Cloud's popular game Sakura Fantasy part 1, is has 32 special slides, thats more than double the amount of Sakura Beach! While i am impressed with the improved art style, the lack in game content in addition to the weightlessness of the choices make this game insuperior to its predecessors and left me feeling dissapointed.",

            "review_text": "This is nothing but joyless exploitation. I thought that perhaps after the last Sakura game, the writer had learned that characters need some depth for you to care about them, but this was either myself being incredibly positive or the result of said writer being fired and replaced by his dead brother. With Sakura Spirit and Sakura Angels, you thought that a fourteen-year old was writing his first softcore pseudo-pornography and by the time of Sakura Fantasy he had learned that characters need some sort of feelings that don't feel forced to create an emotional connection with the audience. It was wrong of me to think this. It's just pulp fiction. It's a B-movie. It's cheaply made, cranked out and bought by people liking it ironically. There's no way they'd like it for the intended purposes, not when the women are drawn similar to giraffes and have the personality of a lolicon soundboard.  It's not like the Sakura Visual Novels are incredibly complex, but this is a new low for Winged Cloud. This is the visual novel a computer would create. Just feed it some art assets of busty anime girls and the dialogue to the previous Sakura visual novels and this would be the result. There is nothing unexpected. However, even though no effort was spared for the dialogue or characters, the scenes are quick and dirty. The pacing is similar to a Formula 1 car on a go-kart track. Just overkill. It's only a paragraph into the game and the protagonist is stumbling through doors and generally making an ♥♥♥♥ of himself. If these characters existed in real life, the girls would only let him hang around them out of pity. They certainly wouldn't be too afraid of being ♥♥♥♥♥ by the protagonist as he no doubt has trouble with complicated acts such as removing clothes and moving quickly. In the context of the game however, they're somehow attracted to him. Since they're on holiday and he's being guilt-tripped into moving their luggage upstairs, I can only assume he is extremely rich and he has become their hostage.   This is being sold for ten US dollars. Ten whole dollars. That could probably feed about forty starving familes, but is instead going towards a visual novel that doesn't even try. I can only imagine it was either written to test the waters with a new artist, who does a competent job, or to fulfill some sort of financial or product quota. If it's the latter, that's disappointing. In the visual novel scene, you generally feel like even if the dialogue is cheesy, the story is cliched or characters flat, at least the developer made it because it was the cheesy, cliched, flat shlock they wanted to make and they loved making it. You feel like they had fun.  With Sakura Beach, you don't get the feeling it was made for a love of cheesy stories. It was made because they wanted more money but they didn't feel like putting in so much effort. So this was produced in an afternoon and sent off to the war. Johnny Turk gunned it down, Winged Cloud got their ten dollars and I got post-traumatic stess disorder.",
