I'll go through this game simple and fast  +Actually very easy to pilot, all controls are done by mouse +Looks nice +Plays nice +FREE +Kills time +Quick turorial -Bad UI -Cutscenes at beginning of levels makes control seem unresponsive -No fullscreen -No graphic options  Final score... 7/10. I would recommend, mainly if you dunno what to do or are on a roadtrip and have a good laptop with you.",

            "review_text": "Looking down and seeing a fighter jet below me through the HMD was cool, but the way camera control is taken away during the mission start cut scenes as well as the change in camera during shooting are horribly nauseating and break the good use guidelines for momentum in VR. Potentially a fun game down the track if the issues are resolved.",
