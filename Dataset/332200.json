            "review_text": "Now after finally beating this game after I got lost so many times through the world. Time for a review!  Story goes you place as Trace, a scientist in the near future who wakes up on an alien planet after your laboratory explodes, and after contacted wireless by giant robotic companions, it is now of course up to you to solve what is going on and get yourself back home. I will get this out of the way, yes it is a throwback to old school 8-16 bit games like Metroid as you wander through the hostile areas on the similar map structure, game is very nice and captures the old school feel, just that some of the enviornments do feel plain sometime.  Going through the worlds enemies you will have a whole array of weapons, health &amp; power nodes, upgrades, and pages to collect through the game to make your arsenal stronger and yourself to get to the next part of the game. Weapons come in all sorts from lightning to fire weapons. All provide a nice punch to it. You can even change the way the monsters controls with a hacking device to make it easier to navigate through the world because some of the rooms and enemies can get a little frustrating in tight quarters if they are in groups and others are just firing directly at a distance.  Music is nice and once again gives the foreboding feel as you traverse through the game. Not really many problems I had with the game, just in some cases while collecting powerups, the controls as you learn a new ability does take time to get used to as there are some almost seemingly impossible items to reach that require 3 button combos and moves to get to, still nothing keyboard breaking. Another little thing that got to me was the boss fights, although very creepy in design, they all were too easy as there was a way to beat all of them in a certain position where you could just stay at and keep firing at them.   Still overall it is a very nice game to get the nostalgic feel of the retro age in gaming, this game will probably take you 10-14 hours depending on the first playthrough if you do not know what you are doing or just collecting and finding all the secrets. Another great recommendation for retro and platformer fans alike. Or if anyone wants to try something new, give this one a look.",

            "review_text": "Axiom Verge is another game for which I wish Steam had a neutral ranking. I'd call the game 'tentatively recommended...with many caveats'. Lacking such a rating category, I'll have to lean on the side of not recommending it.  My number one complaint about the game is that the secrets, of which there are many, are handled in far, far too archaic a manner. Basically there are tons of blocks which appear solid but can be passed in one way or another; some are telegraphed visually, but many are not. This makes upgrade/secret hunting an excruciatingly tedious process of trying your several wall bypassing abilities on nearly every wall in the game. This isn't fun. Upgrade hunting in Metroidvanias is rewarding when it's obvious you can come back and get something later - and you remember it and do so. Stumbling into a hidden room because you exhaustively tried every ability on every wall in the adjoining area doesn't make you feel clever, it makes you feel like your time is being wasted by a developer who has no concept of fairness.  I finished the game with barely half of its available weapon arsenal, which I only realized upon consulting a guide after the fact. Some were hidden so fiendishly that I'm surprised a developer would go so far out of their way to discourage the average player from getting to experience some of the more entertaining weapons that said developer surely put good effort into creating. Even if you do find some of them, most can only be obtained so late in the game that you never really have much time to play with them anyway, which is a shame because they are all pretty interesting and fun to use.  Many details of game's story are similarly buried in hard to find journal entries, and from what I gather it seems like the developer is a bit too enamored with his grand designs there as well. It's overly complex and too obfuscated for the passive manner in which its delivered and I once again can't understand the logic of putting all that effort into it, only to then hide it except from the most obsessive of players.  Now that being said - you can ignore the secrets, ignore the story, play the game in a straightforward manner - and it manages to be a decent Metroidvania, although even then not without foibles. Primary among them is a type of dash ability obtained roughly half-way through the game. This is activated by double tapping a movement direction which, when playing with an analog stick (an absolutely fine input method before that point) is often accidentally activated when you don't want it to, and annoying to pull off with appropriate timing when you do want to use it. A button dedicated to the dash would have been preferable.  The tile based graphics are also a little too slavishly retro for my taste, to the extent that I'd even call the game ugly in parts, and on several occasions I had trouble distinguishing between foreground and background tiles. In my defense, this is because there are places the sames tiles are actually used for both - which is another of the misleading methods by which paths to items are hidden.  The difficulty can range from infuriating to a breeze, completely dependent on what weapons you've found. While the ease with which some bosses can be dispatched with optional weapons would be a good reason to encourage exploration - as a new player experiencing the game for the first time, you have no idea that these weapons are out there to be found.  Ultimately, I had some fun with the core game, but took no joy in the exploration and backtracking because of how things were hidden and that's pretty damning for a Metroidvania. There are far better examples of the genre in recent memory.",

            "review_text": "Short story: if you love Metroid you MUST have this game, it's awesome (especially since it's not like we're gonna see a Metroid anytime soon because someone in Kyoto can't manage their brands)  - - -  A slightly longer story: Axiom Verge is a real beautiful and well thought game, especially if we consider that it has developed by a single person. High quality 2D retro graphics and on point music take you on a journey on this strange world, a fantastic mix of organic and cybernetic that made me constanstly wonder on the true nature of my surroundings. There are a lot of creative ideas and the game is challenging enough even for Metroidvania fans: you can see all the love for the genre poured in this game.  There are a couple of downsides though: there are too many secrets... Don't get me wrong, I know it's the point of the Metroidvania genre, but I feel like Axiom Verge takes it to an extreme. Normally there are a majority of easy to guess secrets and a certain number of secrets that are a real pain to find. In Axiom Verge, there are way too many secrets that are a real pain to find. I'm all about thinking outside the box, but sometimes I found items for dumb luck and even then, despite being an avid collector, I scored a 72% on my first run: too many way to interact with the surroundings, too many things to check, too frustratring in the end. Combined with no way to fast travel (a running power-up or a teleport between areas), it discouraged me from aiming to 100%. Going back to the roots of the genre it's cool, but I think you can take a couple of pages from modern games too: Metroid Fusion marks the rooms with items to find, but even then you have to struggle to get it. I think this would have been great for Axiom Verge.  So:  &gt;&gt;Pros&lt;&lt; +Graphics +Music +Atmosphere +Story +Cool ideas +Challenging  &gt;&gt;Cons&lt;&lt; -No fast-travel -Too many controintuitive secrets -Too many items for interacting with the surroundings, risulting in lack of focus  It's not perfect, but it's a great game, altough I can't see myself completing at 100%  8,7/10",

            "review_text": "I can't keep comparing games to other games, I'm getting too old and out of touch for that. This game is a side-scrolling shooter with tight controls and mechanically rewards players for exploration. Players with incredible attention to detail will enjoy the way items are hidden. The way some secrets are concealed can be incredibly harsh, but if you discover them, it'll feel even more rewarding for overcoming the challenge.  Even though I felt like I was excruciatingly thorough, I do not feel cheated by the secrets that I missed, and I am glad that they are used so cleverly. I guess to criticize it, some of the solutions felt very rare or like surprise one-offs that added to their sense of excessive difficulty.  The game itself is not actually punishing however, and while many of the guns are cool to discover and, agreeing with the developer, provide life-blood to exploration through very fun rewards... Most of the discovered guns are far from required for completing the game. Upgrades that improve your general abilities, such as damage per shot and max health are hidden as well.   Again, this is an exploration game as well as an action game!   Some of the easier to find weapons are placed in map areas that seem to suggest a Zelda-inspired(whoops) approach to game mechanics, where the area will often contain a wepaon that seems to be designed specifically to defeat a nearby boss. This isn't *always* the rule, and all of the bosses can be defeated in a wide variety of means. That really adds a lot to ... letting the player approach combat in creative ways.  The story is pretty good as well, and I won't talk too in-depth about its details, but it manages to weave its narrative in with its artwork and mechanics very well! The digital effects, the subversive effects in a not-quite-16bit world, and the biomechanical all work well together to give the game an alien atmosphere.  The music is enjoyable, too. Loads of synth. Probably my favorite track is the title music. It gave the correct first impression that it was a very electronic, oppressive atmosphere, but that you'd be READY for it.  My complaints with the game are minor.   Sound design only fails with hitting invulnerable armor. The sound effect stacks loudly.  There is a small issue with not having enough tools to identify whether or not you missed secrets regardless of the reminder system (you place waypoints on map regions that persist until replaced) because it's possible to miss secrets that are in plain sight by tiles that may not respond to the tools you had 2 hours ago. That doesn't happen very frequently, it should be noted, and most of the secrets can still be discovered by being thorough, and being gated by map access (blank spots in the map mark obvious ways to continue exploring as you upgrade). And again: The secrets I missed were ingeniously hidden.  Also there's a speedrun mode and a silly reference to Metroid if you're into that sort of thing. It's always interesting to look up such things after playing a beloved game and exhausting it of gameplay.",

            "review_text": "At first glance,  Axiom Verge  is just another Metroidvania game made in the mould of the many that came before it, but what sets it apart is how well it exemplifies the key components of the subgenre. Exploration and upgrades are handled very well, with each system feeding into the other. You explore to find upgrades which you then use to explore previously unreachable areas and find more upgrades, all the while fighting off alien creatures and battling large bosses.  The map is thoughtfully designed in a manner that removes the need for tutorials. When you acquire a new upgrade, like the Laser Drill, the game naturally shows you how to use it by introducing obstacles that require it. Then later on when you see a wall that may be destructible, for example, you will know how to handle it. The player's time is also respected with enough save points and methods to get from one side of the map to the other so that you seldom feel like you are wasting time when you die or need to get to another part of the map.  The production values are high, and the graphics and sound contribute to a good atmosphere. However, the story itself, told through a combination of cutscenes, dialogue, and collectible items, is lacklustre, though serviceable. You will probably not be motivated to play due to the plot, but fortunately the gameplay itself will drive you.  The control is tight, and combat is fun due to the many weapons you can find, many of which are optional and require careful exploration. Unfortunately, you will probably stick with using just a few weapons as most have niche uses at best and are useless at worst. Some boss fights are underwhelming, particularly some of the later ones, which can be too easy with enough upgrades and the right weapon. This is a common problem with Metroidvania games when a player collects most or all of the upgrades and becomes too powerful, and can be offset by simply not collecting everything to purposefully increase the difficulty.  Where  Axiom Verge  distinguishes itself is where it is at its best. The Remote Drone, a controllable robot that basically replaces the Morph Ball from  Metroid , is extremely fun to use and its upgrades provide for a number of interesting puzzles. The ability to 'glitch' enemies, thus changing their appearance and behaviour, adds an extra element to both combat and exploration. Finally, the several teleportation upgrades make traversing the world more enjoyable and also add another factor to exploration.   The Good",

Be warned though - the backtracking does not hold your hand. Make notes if you think the 2-flags per area are not enough. Some times it's obvious what upgrade you'll need, but this game did surprise me a few times with what it brought to the table.  One other small downside is the lack of teleport option. There's only a central hub 'tunnel'. Which is even worse if you, like me, didn't try standing on the giant heads there, which act as vehicles.",

Axiom Verge  is deeply rooted in the 2D action/platform adventure genre. Aside from excelling in every area, what sets it apart is a compelling intrigue and a wide range of pretty unique mechanisms, which I will do my best not to spoil here.  The first right note that the game hits is the atmosphere. The visual design might not be everyone's cup of tea (it surely wasn't mine at first), but the somewhat crude colours of this alien world in which you find yourself stranded play their part in creating a deep sense of immersion. The sounds and music are on point, and set the perfect mood for the 12-15 hours you'll probably spend exploring and backtracking across the different areas on a casual playthrough.  The sense of progression is extremely satisfying throughout the adventure. The level design teases you along the way with a good number of inaccessible areas and/or pickups, which you'll be encouraged to revisit once you've acquired new tech. Aside from lore logs and the usual upgrades (health, range, weapon damage), a good number of the items you will find are inherently specific to  Axiom Verge  and will have unique consequences on the gameplay. The movement upgrades really redefine the platforming, and the rather sizeable pool of weapons will leave you with a lot of options when it comes to combat.  The difficulty balance was just right for me - some of the end-game rooms and bosses are pretty brutal, but exploring and acquiring enough upgrades will make it possible to push through without too much grinding and frustration. With a clear mind and a bit of experience with the genre, finding your way on your own is perfectly possible (and I would deeply recommend doing so, as it is infinitely more satisfying than following a guide). The more hardcore-oriented players will be glad to know about the inclusion of a Hard mode as well as a built-in Speedrun mode, complete with global/split timers, reduced RNG and leaderboards with separate categories (any%, 100%, low%)! Nonetheless,  Axiom Verge  is perfectly suited for casual gameplay as well.  Did I mention one person did all of this? Yep. The coding, the art, the level design, the music (!)... all the work of a single man, Tom Happ, who created  Axiom Verge  as a personal project in his spare time over the course of five years. For a game this close to perfection in every area and a product far above the industry's usual finishing standards, this is truly impressive.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those cases where I wish steam had a 'meh' option because for a game like this, it's sorely needed. Okay. I don't usually do this but I'm just going to break down everything separately.  First off: I will quite frequently bring up this game's contemporary Environmental Station Alpha multiple times, since a comparison to this game is how I found ESA originally, and then what brought me back to this game was a comparison of this game to ESA, and since the games came out in the same month both heavily aping Metroid, the comparisons are almost begging to happen.  Story: It's pretty good, actually. I wouldn't say it's a huge factor in the game, but the story and the collectible lore are pretty intriguing, leaving just enough ambiguous to keep you guessing. I wouldn't say the story is the main draw of the game, but I definitely can't hold it against the game.  Graphics: Hmm. This is tricky to rate. On one hand, the pixel art is gorgeous to look at. On the other hand... it's a bit of a sensory overload sometimes, since there are so many bright colors all the time. It doesn't help that the only really noticeable graphically difference in most areas is the color. The game doesn't have very well defined 'enivironments' like ESA, and though this technically has better 'art' than that game, I dunno, I feel ESA just has a better aesthetic than this game. I wouldn't say the graphics are bad by any means but it's amazing how bland I find them for how well they're done.  Music: It's alright at first, it's very game-y music, but by the end of the game I was utterly sick of it. I dunno, it's way too blaring and in-your-face most of the time. Metroid had more atmospheric music, ESA has more atmospheric music, it added to the mood instead of overpowering it. I wouldn't say it's bad music, you'll probably enjoy it your first time through the game, but not for much longer.  And now... here's where things are really gonna fall apart. Gameplay: Uuugh. I should love this so much more than I do. But. Okay, here's the key problem: This game is stubbornly rooted in Super Metroid, in almost every aspect. A lot of its mechanics are quite similar, for one, just 'modernized', and for what it's worth, a lot of the 'modernized' mechanics are good. The grappling hook is an utter travesty though, worse than any in Metroid and an absolute trainwreck compared to the fantastic grappling of ESA. It's just... thank god this thing barely sees any use because it's utter trash.   But that aside... the game design itself apes Super Metroid far too heavily, especially when it comes to collectibles. I did not enjoy hunting for secrets in Super Metroid and never bothered to get 100%, but I wanted to here because achievements etc. I did not get past like 75% without consulting a guide because there are just so many obnoxiously hidden secrets in the game... Some of the passwords in particular are total 'how would you ever figure that out on your own' moments, and. Okay, maybe this just annoys me in particular, but sometimes... secret locations are shown to you on the map via the wall of the room not being finished. But other secrets aren't. There's no consistency for stuff otherwise hidden in the exact same way, it's just really strange. You have a fair share of pure fake walls that you can't find until you're touching them, and there's a ton of things you need to drill, a few strange glitched enemies you need to take advantage of, and absolute no item-finding tool to assist you, unlike Super Metroid. There is, amazingly, both indication of 100% map completion and 100% item completion for each specific area, but you'd never know until it showed up for you the first time, and even then you probably wouldn't know what it means.  I will be the first to admit that, yes, ESA did have a lot of the same stuff to it. But here's the thing. The way that game's map is designed turned an annoyance into sheer brilliance, because the map was 100% tightly packed. You could figure out where secret rooms are 9 times out of 10, because the entire map is solid as a rock. There was also a hidden map item that mapped out most of the main secret areas, too. And even with the secrets on the outside of the station, you did have a fairly limited scope of things to search. Stuff was hidden, but it made sense. In Axiom Verge, it just doesn't make sense. Add to that the fact that there's no 'secrets' necessary to just complete the game, no fake walls, no maps lying to you, and you'd never know there were supposed to be secrets like that until you accidentally stumbled upon one, or noticed how low your item % was at the end of the game.   I've rambled on about this one element enough but this is legitimately the biggest deal I could ever have with a metroidvania: Exploring isn't fun. Any metroidvania that fails this is fundamentally doing something wrong, no exceptions. I loved exploring in games like ESA, Guacamelee, La-Mulana, Knytt Underground, heck, even games like Dust and Ori where exploration is stupidly easy. Here though, it just ain't fun.   Onto the rest. Sigh. The platforming is generally alright. I actually dig most of the movement mechanics in this game. The coats constantly upgrade your ability to move through walls, and by the third one you have this cool dash attack that speeds up movement considerably, and it's just really fun to use. The drone is far, far superior to the Metroid morph ball, being much more flexible and once you have the drone swap allowing for a lot of cool movement options. I'm legitimately excited to watch the run of this game at AGDQ as soon as I finish watching this review, because while movement in this game is a bit stiff at first, as it tends to be in most metroidvanias, it gets really fun later on. There's no real tough platforming challenges in the game, though, a few instances of grappling hook shenanigans but they're rare, and everything else isn't any harder than completing the first world of Super Meat Boy. Heck, probably even easier than that.  I have mixed feelings on the combat, though. For one, there are too freaking many weapons, and so few of them saw much use. Especially once you get one of the god-tier weapons that basically invalidates all the other weapons before it. The lightning gun feels like cheating, almost. Basic enemies start out pretty manageable, but by the end of the game they are waaaayyy too strong and waaayyy too durable, and possibly even waaayyy too prevalent. I guess, the game wouldn't have any challenge at all with the higher-tier weapons unless the enemies are this way, but it reeks of fake difficulty. The bosses fare a little better, though they're also fairly unmemorable. There aren't very many of them, they're all very standard in design, no clever tricks, just shooting and dodging stuff. Snore. The final boss is atrocious, by the way, being basically an RNG boss unless you're a god at dodging tons of projectiles and three huge hitboxes while also trying to hit one specific section of the ceiling. Seriously, who the hell thought that was a decent idea for a boss. It doesn't even feel rewarding to win, it just feels like 'Oh, I got lucky with the health drops this time so I won. Okay.' And it's just really anticlimactic. Though honestly the entire game feels really anticlimactic. The story itself is fine but never seems to go anywhere. I didn't realize I was approaching the end until the game was like 'Oh hey by the way you're approaching the end'. Ehh. Some of the guns are fun to use though. For a primarily combat-driven game though I really feel like this could've been better. Granted, I've never really liked combat in Metroid games either, and the bosses in Metroid games are even worse than the ones here in my humble opinion, but whatever.

Although this description is certainly true when glancing at the game's surface, it is misleading as to what this game is truly about. Axiom Verge is about the atmosphere of the world rather than depth of gameplay.  Axiom Verge was created entirely by a single man. That man has done a phenomenal job on the aesthetics of the game. But just beneath the veneer of beautiful pixel artwork and retro techno music lies a game that falls short to deliver a challenging and ultimately satisfying experience.   Most of the game's enemies are pushovers that do not have the numbers or intelligence to pose a serious threat. The only time that they become dangerous is when the player gets impatient and tries to rush through a particular section of the game. In addition, the boss fights are completely repetitive once you understand the boss's weakness, requiring very little thought or skill. All of this amounts to a game in which the player's responses to new areas of the map are more or less the same.   The story is shallow and trite. The developer of this game should not be writing for anything, let alone a video game. I wager that he could have paid any amateur with a modicum of hobby writing experience to flesh out a skeleton storyboard and they could have come up with something better. Some reviewers have said that the story is interesting. While the setting may be interesting, the writing and overrall narrative structure is cliche at best and just plain bad at worst.   All of that said, the artwork and atmosphere are still quite beautiful. That alone justifies at least a 5-15$ price tag depending on how much that means to you. Indeed, I myself originally bought this game for the artwork and was not disappointed on that front.   In essence, Axiom Verge is an atmospheric Metroidvania-style 2-D sidescrolling shooter with good artworkand smooth gameplay mechanics that could have used significant input from a more seasoned game designer.",

Unfortunately, around halfway through the game, it takes a turn for the worse and the whimsical exploration from the early game is replaced with spamming every metroidvania ability on every surface to make sure that you aren't missing a deviously hidden main path.  (If you're going to play it: Use the disruptor on the slightly pinker goo than everything else that 2 fishlobsters jump out of)  Another problem is the controls (I played using gamepad) become overburdened with half-baked exploration mechanics that never quite feel good enough to pull off what the game is trying to get you to do, instead just putting you in a nightmarish loop of repeating the difficult parts over and over until you get it right by virtue of chance... and then you get killed in the very next room and have to do it all again.

The game itself: + good mechanics + clever weapons and tools + soundtrack, but not coming close to Metroid Cons: - The most important part of Super Metroid: Level design. Levels are really, really boring in Axiom Verge and not atmospheric, with few exceptions. Most of the time, tile colors change. - Plot is clever, but the storytelling is horrible - Exploration feels ... unrewarding (see level design), except for frequent items.  Developer should have taken some steps back and consider what aspects made Super Metroid a timeless classic. The actual effort in Axiom Verge is the game engine - it's a good Super Metroid engine.  Would buy for 5$ on sale, not worth 20$ at all.",

            "review_text": "11 hours, 34 deaths. 77% items 96% map   This is a good game. This is an awesome game. This is something that feels like it came straight out of the early nineties. Something that could almost have existed on the SNES with a bit more of the harsh pixels of the NES. A soundtrack that is electronic; Dark and brooding that still somehow seems like it could also be coming from one of those old consoles.    It plays and control in nearly the same way as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, and Super Metroid. Running around collecting items and equipment to run around again, getting farther, deeper, to collect more items and equipment. The game can be grueling if you aren't an explorer. Finding weapon damage power ups as well as the weapons themselves can be hard. Some of them much more well hidden than others. Maps, and the 'cheat codes' are mandatory for some pickups. Searching the web for secrets made me feel like I was back on dial up just hoping I could figure it out.   I recommend a controller. I found it the easiest way to pull off some of the harder 'jumping teleporting pet lobbing teleporting again and then again' jumps. The game can be beaten in under four hours with a map and a plan, but it's much more fun to go it yourself. When you get stuck, get help with that part and then continue. You can always come back when you miss something.   The only two things I might gripe about are the asking price and the myriad of weapons that are either useless or bothersome to use. I would have been a bit more solid on the price if it were 15 or closer to that. Many weapons are specialized. None seem to be 'super effective' against any one kind of enemy, nor are there really any types of enemy. They all seem to just have a base health pool, and you deal damage until they are dead. No shielding, no regenerating and no armor. There is a hotswitch button to change weapons without opening the weapon wheel. This is underused completely. I simply stuck to the most powerful gun in the game until I found a more powerful one.   If you're having trouble progressing, a power upgrade or two can let you breeze by. I found particularly the last boss to suffer from this. It seemed near impossible with my weak weapons. Even the enemies leading up to the boss were giving me trouble. I went back and collected a few upgrades and a weapon I missed. Returned swiftly to the boss and there was no difficulty. I simply destroyed him. Unlike most of the bosses there was no pattern, nothing to learn. I just shot the weak spot and I won in seconds. Sadly a weak ending gameplay wise.   This is still an amazing game, beautiful to look at, slightly upsetting sometimes as well. With it's near gore style in some sections, mechanical biological machine in others... the 'friends' that you meet on the way are also terrifying monsters in their own right. You should get this game, maybe wait for a sale? but it's nolstalga that plays amazing. A joy to control and bomb around in.",

If you're into this genre or have a craving for a game filled with exploration, powerups, and rewarding backtracking, then look no further.  Pros:   -- Do you know what metroidvania is? This is a near-perfectly executed game if you're into the genre. -- Challenging gameplay (you must set it to hard for the true experience!!!) -- Fantastic weaponry, powerups, and upgrades do what you hope they would: expand your abilities and open up new areas for exploration.  -- I especially liked that your upgrades didn't suffer from the 'grapple hook' phenomenon where the only thing you can do with your tools is use them on tiles specifically marked (like the grapple hook tiles from the Metroid games). The game probably won't stump you completely with the platforming puzzles, but it won't make it stupidly obvious with grapple hook/power bomb tiles. -- Great, difficult level design will have you praying for save points. Really satisfies your urge to explore and backtrack. There are scripted sequences, and often times when you're going through a new level that you'll have sections between save points you'll have to retry many times until you figure out how to tackle the enemies. -- Disturbing bio-mechanical themes (think Geiger without all the sex).   Cons:  -- The color palette was often abrasive and muddled to me. There were times when I couldn't distinguish background from foreground/boundary tiles. This isn't a deal-breaker, but I would love to see someone mod this particular aspect of the game. The concept of the art is great, just not the color...in my humble opinion :)",

The gameplay is solid and feels good with a lot of the same challenge and reward as the NES era of video games.  The story is intriguing and interesting. It is told partially through interaction with other characters in the game, partially through the levels and surroundings as you explore, and partically through notes you find laying around. It was interesting enough that more often then not I would spend quite a bit of time just trying to find the next hidden note with more story, I wanted to know what else was going on in the world around me.  The gameplay and combat mechanics feel VERY strongly like 2d era Metroid. Its very satisfying with a large array of weapons that work better against different enemies under different situations. The enemies are varied and interesting. You have the ability fairly early on to 'glitch' enemies which causes their behavoir to change, and this can be both helpful and hindering depending on level circumstances. The bosses all feel very well done and are often challenging trying to learn the patterns and proper method for attacking them.  The different items in the game all grant some level of improved mobility through the game, from grappling hooks to teleporting, and the mechanics are not always straight forward which in this case actually adds to the puzzle and challenge in a good way.  And the soundtrack... The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and I could double the length of this review just praising the music. So rather than do that, just trust me, if you like Chiptunes and old video game era music, this games soundtrack will blow your mind.  I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic metroidvania style games. This one gets passing marks on all aspects and should go right along side the classics.",

I'm not a huge fan of the indie scene, but lately there are some real gems coming out of it and Axiom Verge is one of them.   The 'Contemporary Man in Technical World' plot doesn't really do anything for me. It builds some intrique, but hasn't given me any extra incentive to go forward. The only good thing about the story is that there is no voice acting. Who plays a game for the story anyway?  Also, changing weapons is more of a chore than it should be. Why not just cycle through them? It breaks the flow and is just clunky. However, with the rest of it being so good, it's more of a nitpick, but should be mentioned.  The terrible Steam controller doesn't work with this game (what does it work with?), so if that's all you have, I'd suggest using a keyboard instead or getting a Logicool controller, they seem to work with everything and, unlike the Steam controller, feel good in the hand.",

This is one of those moments when steam's requirement to recommend a game or not grates on me, because this is a good enough game, but it's not great, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to everyone. I guess, since I do recommend it to some people, that's a yes.  For the most part, this game has solid gameplay. The fun and aesthetic of metroid are captured well, and the game has enough hidden treasure and a harsh enough difficulty curve to make 100% completion worth striving for. However, if you want an interesting, compelling, or even intelligible story, I suggest looking somewhere else. The characters are poorly constructed and have personality traits that contradict their actions. Why is it that Trace has no qualms about slaughtering mutants with a flame thrower, but once he's facing a mass murdering psychopath, he suddenly gets gun shy? The whole world is very confusing and the fact that all the characters are hiding things and keeping secrets gives the game a very 'I could tell you, but I won't' vibe.  As I said, though, the mechanics are mostly good. Mostly. The main problem with the gameplay is that it is possible to get stuck in area that you are underleveled for. I got trapped in one and had to turn on cheats to stand a chance in it. For the most part this shouldn't be too much of a problem, because it's usually necessary to pick up upgrades or equipment from one area of the game in order to progress, but it can still be an issue.  This gameplay issue actually exacerbates problems with the story, because the story is already convoluted and all over the place, and is very unclear about its chronology, and the fact that getting to certain areas early can allow you to watch cutscenes out of order makes it even more confusing.  Overall, get it if it's on sale, if you really like metroid, or want a challenging game without much need for story.",

Just like in metroid the players main weapon has many different modes to it that dramatically alter gameplay and can change the entire experince of the game.

Having the odd but blissful soundtrack ringing in your head and knowing each stage by it's music.  I recommend going through this without knowing a thing about it. It makes each milestone you do even more rewarding. So far I'm a few hours in and loving it. I'll update once finished. But the weapons are bad ♥♥♥ and almost feels like cheating to be using such power. The original puzzle mechanics are quite refreshing for a metroidvania game. Also if you're lucky to find a hidden stage, the old monitor effect is quite neat too. The weapon ideas are pretty new and awesome. Along with the 'tools' used in various ways, you can tell a lot of thought went into this.  Nintendo needs to throw this team some money and the green light to make us the 2D metroid we want and not this 3D garbage they have been putting out.",

Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was. But it's certainly miles ahead of the rest of the pretenders.  Axiom Verge has unusual items in its library of powerups that do well to reintroduce an element of surprise for people who've played too many of these and know what to look for. The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions. Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.  Metroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger. Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself. It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.  The game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying. This, and fairly stiff, accelerationless movement controls, probably curtail any hope of it becoming a great game for speedrunning.",

Cons - The music is grating after multiple repeats. - The boss battles were uninteresting for the most part. - I didn't get the same sense of exploration I would have liked as from other Metroidvanias. There was too much of a requirement to use items against walls with no indication that anything was hiding behind them, so I simply didn't do it. - Controls were decent, but some of the advanced mechanics were clunky and I didn't enjoy navigating the game with them. - Too many weapons also means too few uses for many of them too.",

The music has some really high quality tunes, though some are just plain annoying to listen to, and since it's a metroidvania game you'll be hearing each region's music quite a lot.   The mechanics are fairly straight-forward for the most part of the game. You run, jump and shoot. It gets old fast, but once you've gotten a fair chunk in to the game it starts to losen up with additional move sets, and nearing the end the flexibility in movement is quite fun. It never gets to Super Metroid levels of variety, but they've got some fun ideas that work well. As far as the weapons go (there's a lot of them), most of them range anywhere from highly situational to useless. The first few are more or less glorified keys to open locked doors.  The world is large, but it's deceptively linear. You can go to a lot of places, roaming around looking for secrets and whatnot, but the actual progression though the game is more or less straight. There are plenty of optional weapons and upgrades you can pick up whenever, but each essential item is required to get the next at every point.  It's a good game and I had fun roaming the world of Sudra. Wether it's a game for you depends mostly on if you like the old metroidvania games, since it's just that.

            "review_text": "I bought this game on a whim during one of Steam's many sales because I occasionally like to play retro platformers for 30 minutes or so a month. Usually they don't hold my attention much longer than that because with a lot of them if you've played one you've played them all. Axiom Verge sucked me in for hours on my first play. My initial impression was 'wow, this is a Metroid clone right down to the map and enemy style' but it very quickly deviates and becomes its own game. Obviously it was heavily inspired by the original NES Metroid but the developer has added a ton of his own original ideas to make it both more challenging and more interesting.   I'm not very far into the game because it is actually pretty freaking hard at some parts so I'll just give my initial impression and why I think it grabbed me so quickly:  Plot: The plot is interesting from what I've seen so far and although 'story moments' are few and far between, they give you just enough to keep you wanting to see the next 'cut scene' and figure out what is going on. Aside from dialogue before boss encounters and at certain points when you discover something important, you're left alone to just play the game... which is nice but it is certainly different from modern games where you always know where you're supposed to go next. There is a lot of independent exploration in Axiom Verge.  Combat: Combat is pretty straightforward if you've ever played an action-platformer. It is, as I have already said, very reminiscent of Metroid but there are some key differences. For one thing as far as I have seen you don't need a certain weapon to defeat specific enemies. Which weapon you use is completely up to which ones you like to use. Thanks to modern systems that have more than two buttons on the controller, switching between weapons is easy and quick. The main difference between Axiom Verge and Metroid's combat is you can lock your character in place with one button so that you can freely aim your gun to hit targets at weird angles you wouldn't be able to hit while moving. I didn't use this a lot at first but let me tell you it is almost essential during some of the boss battles.  Controls: For the most part the controls are fantastic but I am using a steam controller and some of the default button bindings are messed up. If you're holding the left trigger to lock your characters movement and using the joystick to aim your gun, it keeps switching weapons because I guess that is also the way to quick select guns. I'm sure you can fix that yourself I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  Graphics &amp; Sound: Both gloriously retro Nintendo. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I must say. The art is decent. Most of the enemies are smaller so there's only so much you can do with a handful of pixels but the bosses and character animations look great.  Overall: I really didn't think I was going to like this game this much. It was like a dollar and I just wanted more games in my library that I could play with my Steam Controller. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'd recommend checking it out even when it's not on sale.",

Reminded me a little bit of when I was a kid first learning to skateboard, and suddendly everything around me looked like something I wanted to skate on. The world in Axiom Verge has tricks across the map that I didn't realize were in front of me until after being granted the freedom to see them for what they are.. If I saw them.   I have deep appreciation for Tom Hess, the one credited dev who designed and created such a complex experience, beautiful, good music and sound. I had fun, even when I was running circles completely stumped, admittedly frustrated, lost, hoping providence would grant me to see the next waypoint.",

The controls and mechanics are really fun and with a little creativity it's possible to combine them to go faster or avoid enemies. At first the weapons didn't seem quite interesting but after half of the game became lot more useful and I ended up switching them a lot more than at the beginning of the game. As a SoTN and Metroid fan, I had a lot of fun with this game and might play a little more.",
