You have a short story mode (2.5 hours) and then you can do some puzzles and other things. I played coop and had a great time. My friend lives overseas and we did experience some lag for the person not hosting. That makes some of the puzzles very tough but they are still doable.  Buy this on sale, grab a controller and a friend and enjoy.",

            "review_text": "A great puzzle co-op game, and is even more ridiculously fun with 4 player couch co-op, especially on challenge modes. The humor in the game is quite good, and the art direction is very good as well.  There is also a hardcore difficulty, where you get a character with all of the abilities, but can't respawn for all of those people looking for a challenge.  Be forewarned, don't get this for full price if you only intend to play the main story. As this game is less than two hours in length if you have a good grasp on the puzzle mechanics.(story mode only, challenge modes and hardcore difficulty ramp this up significantly i'd assume)  Overall if you have at least a friend to play this with, i feel it's worth it if you can get it for a decent price. It's a great romp while it lasts, and the challenge modes(the ball challenges specifically) are highly entertaining with 4 people.",

After waiting four HOURS just to download it, my friends and I had to wait thirty minutes just to start playing. After going through the elongated and repetitive tutorial, we all decided to just claw our eyes out with forks instead for entertainment. After finishing the first level, (and suffering through endless lag spikes), Our screens went white and forced us back to the home screen. No offence to the creators, but next time get game programmers to make your games. This is all for now, just please don't get the game unless you are ready to end it all. Thank you for reading.",

On top of all of that visual glitches occuring during the final encounter made it far more difficult than it actually was, on top of wonky physics. Nevermind the fact that the controls in general are bad. Aiming the powers is a nightmare half the time and switching characters isn't good either.  I only spent 99¢ and I regret it!",

I’m not the only one who has experienced this; it’s a known issue, which has apparently fallen upon deaf ears.  It’s a mighty shame, as there’s clearly a lot of care and effort put into the art style, which is easily the most (and, perhaps, only) enjoyable aspect of this game.  I absolutely cannot recommend Tiny Brains, even at sale price.",

In the forum some of the people seams not to be able to set up a coop game, but it seams those are eather wrong or for an older version. We had no issues. The difficulty level goes up during the second chapter. At a point on chaper 3 we had to give up where you apperently had to swich a char in a mid air jump, but maybe we are just not skilled enouth for that :-)  Game compairs to Portal2 and Trine. Its fun to play with friends. I would recomend to pick up a controler to play.",

I can not imagine playing it alone, so make sure you have someone with you, as the game is not just for two players, it is pretty much only enjoyable this way.  Anyway, you control four mice that have unique powers(Push, Suck, Switch-positions, and Freezing) and all their powers combine to help you get through the increasingly harder levels. The game has a cute look and the puzzles are usually quite satisfying to solve.  However, the game does lean towards being very rage-inducing. Some of the puzzles involve keeping a little critter alive while it is being attacked by waves on enemies. It's not fun and can drive just about anyone made. Other puzzles involve pushing a ball through a complicated hole-filled maze. They are not fun, either.  The majority of the puzzles, though, are wonderful little rooms(think of Portal) that require solving something in order to open the exit. These are all great and a lot of fun to solve with a friend. If they make a sequel, they should focus on these kind of puzzles exclusively.   Room puzzles - 8/10  Non-room puzzles - 4/10  Overall, this game is worth 6/10 to me.",

The puzzles would be less complicated once there is more than one person playing, but still, you can still complete the puzzles alone, as you have access to all four rodents.
