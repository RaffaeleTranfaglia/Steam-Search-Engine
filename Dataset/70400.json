            "review_text": "Finally a game where I can live out my fantasies of becoming a merchant who crushes hearts and dreams under the weight of his fat profit margin. Y'all can keep your Poorly-Lit Life Forces 2 or whatever the f♥ck it's called, Recettear blows that all out of the water.  Ok first of all you play as a loli. Don't be deceived--beneath her cute, naive exterior lies a heart as black as coal and a mind as shrewd and cunning as they come. This little sh♥t will bleed you for all you're worth with mark-ups that would make Best Buy blush. And she will love every minute of it as she watches you carry your broke ♥ss out the door with a ham sandwich. Thank you and come again mother f♥cker.  Recette's rise to power begins when her piece of sh♥t dad racks up a dickload of debt and skips town or dies or something I dunno I kind of spaced out at that part BUT THE POINT IS he's an ♥sshole and Recette don't need that sh♥t in her life. So Tear, this really unprofessionally dressed loan shark fairy with a personality as vivid and exciting as a piece of corrugated cardboard, comes up and is like 'yo I'm takin your house.' Long and short of it is that Recette has to open an item shop and earn some money to keep her house from being seized, because Tear is a soulless harpy.  That's how the story begins. And there's a decent amount of depth to the economic aspects of this game. I mean you can't check on the DOW or whatever but this is f♥cking Recettear, not Wolf of Wall Street: The Video Game (someone should get on that tho c'mon nintendo). There's buying, selling, taking specific orders, taking orders IN ADVANCE (take some time to collect yourself, I know this sh♥t's amazing), and upgrading and changing up your shop. The fun comes when you can take advantage of a crash in the price of goods to stock up, then wait until their value's jacked up later to sell them off at 250% of their price or higher. I basically gave up masturbation because making bank in this game feels so good. Different customers have different purchasing behaviors, including limited funds and a certain percentage mark-up they're willing to deal with. Common visitors to your shop include: Finicky House Wife from Hell, Crusty Old Man, Rich-♥ss Regular Guy, and the lovable Broke-♥ss Little Girl.  There are also dungeon crawling segments which you need to hire adventurers for, and to hire them you need to get their card by doing some specific sh♥t to make friends with them. The first dude you get is a lovable street urchin named Louie, and he's....ok I guess. He uses a f♥cking sword like a scrub but whatever you can unlock other people. Dungeon crawling is how you get free sh♥t and ingredients to make even cooler sh♥t, but you can't really bring much back with you because apparently a f♥cking knapsack is not considered standard issue gear for adventurers.  Overall, this game is exactly what the title tells you it is, and maybe a little more. I highly reccommend it. Play this sh♥t.  also f♥ck this steam censorship we're all adults come on",

            "review_text": "Recettear is essentially two games rolled into one, and neither is particularly deep, though the store management aspect is still pretty fleshed out. What it does, it does well (minus a few gripes) but somehow manages to both drag itself out and rush you to the 'end' of the game. The problem with the end-game is that, while it has plenty to offer, it arbitrarily bars you from it with unnecessarily padded goals.  So the shop sim is the meat of the game. There's no point detailing the mechanics, so I'll just point out the failings and oversights I didn't care for.  Patrons have a finite amount of money when they enter the store. This value is influenced by how much they 'like' you, or what 'patron level' they are. The maximum amount of money they have when entering your store is a very important number and it is also  completely invisible  to the player. So when a patron says 'I don't have that much money!' there's no option to say 'Well how much do you have?'  Buying items: some patrons will sell YOU things. You have no option to politely decline; you either make a reasonable offer for something you may or may not want, or you make a terrible offer and ♥♥♥♥ them off. Patrons also have their own dialog style, and occasionally it is unclear whether you're buying an item from them or selling an item to them.  The goal is to do a capitalism until you pay off all your debts. This happens rather rapidly and they kind of rush you through this section of the game so that your time limit is over and you can go at your own pace. This is particularly good for the dungeon-crawling portion of the game, as entering a dungeon will consume most of an entire day and leaves little opportunity for vending.  The dungeon crawling plays very smoothly and each of the playable characters has enough uniqueness to their playstyle to give them all a wholly different feel. There's a considerable number of dungeon and environments. And they're all the same randomly-generated box rooms and hallways given fresh paint at regular intervals. After a short while, it gets stale, and as much as I enjoyed the gameplay, I did not feel compelled to complete even the Obsidian Tower. They just don't keep it fresh or interesting, and that kind of killed the game for me. There's lots of end game content and no motivation or reason to experience it.  All said, I'd still recommend the game if you can nab it for a few bucks because the first 5 to 10 hours are a pretty fun ride.",

            "review_text": "I'd like to start by saying, 'Capitalism, ho!' That's the catchphrase of the main character. It's also this entire game in a nutshell.  EDIT: I always forget that it censors my words. Replaced censored words with the cute stuff Recette says.   Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale  is a game about running an item shop, as the name suggests. Meaning, y'know when you're playing an RPG and you find a city with a shop that's full of high powered items so you sell your car and put a mortage on the house so you can buy everything and be really powerful, and then it ends up the next dungeon has a ton of items way more powerful than all of the things you just bought? Well, fear no more! Now it's your job.   Recette, our main protagonist, and half of the name of the store  Recettear , is on a quest to pay her father's debts by running an item shop (as running an item shop (even though she's like, ten years old) is the best way to pay off debts, and doing so would prove Recette a strong, independent woman of color). Tear, the  'Pie-kay!'  fairy/debt collector who's forcing Recette to pay for her father's negligence, is the other half of the name of the store. As Recette is ten and has no idea how the economy works and how to pay back debts, Tear decides to help her start and run an item shop, acting as an advisor and a tutorial teacher. Other than that, she's just a jerk, which is pretty typical fairy behavior in Japanese games, so I'm not that surprised.   The game is entirely about finding items in dungeons (you dont do any of the fighting yourself, but we'll get to that) and selling them for around 120%-150% of the original price, depending on the person you're selling it to and how much they like you. There are also daily and weekly economic changes, so food prices might go up and weapon prices go down, things like that. The way you organize your store is very important, and you wont be able to stock everything on shelves, which is important to note, because even if you cant stock something on your shelf, there will still be that one  'Yayifications!'  who's like 'Hey, do you have this thing, I didn't see it on your shelves.' You better be happy this isn't the real world, because most of the time, if it's not on the shelves, we dont have it. Lucky for you, Recette has infinite coffers to hold all of her capitalism, so yes, I do have that back scratcher you wanted so much. And back scratchers are listed under the 'treasure' category in this game. So that's a thing, I guess.   Anyways, to the dungeon thing. You dont do any fighting yourself. You're ten years old. Sorry, but you aren't  Tengen Toppen Recette Tear . Though that  'Yepperoni!'  would be  'Easy as pie!' ing radical. I'd do a review of that fanfic. You pay explorers and let them use your equipment, and in return, they give you items from dungeons that you can sell in your store. It's easier to just sell them the equipment you want them to have so you dont have to equip it every time, but most of the time the  'Capitalism, ho!' ing dungeoneers come into your  'So! I have an item shop! And stuff!' ing store, they dont buy the  'And it's cool and awesome!' ing weapons you put on display for them to buy. Instead, they'll  'Stained-glass yayness!' ing buy a  'Aww, but I wanted to leave through the window, like an action hero!' ing orange or some stupid  'Holy Carp!'   god dammit why dont you just let me give them the items. I dont want this  'A HOODLUM'S GONNA STEAL MY CUUUUUTENEEEEESS' ing knife. I'm not gonna go shank some  '...I sold stuff. Like. To people.' . TAKE THE KNIFE YOU DRUNK HOE . Every dungeoneer is different, starting off with a poverty-striken swordsman, and moving on to wonderful characters like an alcoholic rogue who's constantly trying to sell you  '...I wonder if I can survive with only two internal organs?'  she stole to a creepy-but-hot golem chick who has big fists that she fists things with like Vi from  League of Legends . Oh man, I know I'm going to get  '...Maybe if I eat a lot of spinach, that can replace my blood'  for talking about  League of Legends  on Steam. Come at me.  Oh, and by the way, you actually play as the characters in the dungeons. Yes, there is actual gameplay, folks. You get to  play  as poverty and alcoholism. In perspective, it sounds like a metaphor for capitalism, but hey,  it's just a video game, and I'm too shallow to read in to that kind of stuff .   I do have some tips for you, though, as it might help your first play through:    The man (there's only like, four NPCs in the game. He's just a normal looking dude) usually buys for the highest, typically being around 125%, but you can go a bit higher, like 130%. The old man does 130% occasionaly, too.    When buying, paying 30%-40% is usually a safe bet. If not, go up to around 60% just to be safe.    Alouette is a girl much like you, who also runs an item shop. She a hoe. She has a fairy, too, named Prime. They'll both occasionally come in and buy things from you. Alouette is willing to go up to around 140%-160% typically.    Dont worry about deadlines. They'll catch up to you and  'You need to pay me some money y'know!'  you over, most likely. And if they do, you restart the game from the beginning. Dont worry, though, you keep all your items, so you have a pretty big advantage. My first run through, I restarted around 3 or 4 times.    Oh yeah, there are cash deadlines in the game that require you to have a certain amount by the end of the week. Should have probably mentioned that before.   The little girl is an  'Totally a tree'  and typically wont buy anything over 110%. Just hope she doesn't go for anything expensive if she goes into your store. When she sells, you have to go around 60%-80%. She a crafty  'because I'm bigger, I'm the big sister, right?' .    While your usage of the dungeoneers depends on your play style, I pretty much exclusively used Louie (the swordsman you start out with) and very rarely ever played the mage character because he's fairly difficult.    There are some resolution problems, as it was originally a Gamecube game, so I recommend playing in windowed mode and keeping it in a square instead of full screening. Otherwise it looks kinda  'But I don't wanna be a sailor!' . But that's up to you.   9/10. It's a solid game, and I got a lot of play time out of it. It's an honestly surprisingly fun game. You don't really expect an item shop sim to be fun, but hey, it is. I dont have much else to say about it.   Keep on capitalizing.",

            "review_text": "In most RPG settings you clear out dungeons, then go and sell the unwanted items to shopkeepers. In Recettear, however, you are the shopkeeper. Forced into opening a shop by a loan shark fairy to pay off your father's huge adventuring debts, you need to pay off increasingly huge installments each week or lose your home as collateral.  The game starts of simple enough, but as you progress the game will introduce new features, such as customers placing orders for you to fulfil later, and market fluctuations that will allow you to both buy low and sell high, increasing your profits significantly given the right situation. You can even sponsor adventurers to explore dungeons for you, and during these sessions you'll control them as they fight monsters and explore ruins. The main reasons for doing this is to give you ingredients to combine to make better equipment for the shop, and to unlock more adventurers to play as. Some of them will even come to your store and buy better equipment and weapons for themselves, increasing their effectiveness in the optional combat sections of the game. You'll probably even end up giving huge discounts to the adventurers you hire the most just so they'll be powerful and keep coming back for more deals. It's this kind of thing that really adds to the game's charm and helps you care about the side characters as you learn more about them.  The game is actually very forgiving and failure to meet a payment will send you back to the second day with your inventory, adventurer levels and store reputation intact. This makes something that could have been a very frustrating experience stay fun and oddly relaxing, although it is possible to beat the game in a single run if you feel up for the challenge. Completing the game unlocks the ability to start a new game +, survival mode where you need to pay off increasing amounts of debt each week until it becomes impossible to pay back, or simply carry on where you left off without needing to worry about a deadline each week. Combined with the large amount of items you can discover and create this results in a good replay value, especially for completionists.  As for downsides, the game is bad at explaining itself from the first tutorial. Tear will start the game off by telling you to set the prices for around 130%, but this will actually anger most of the customers and will cause less people to come to your store from the very beginning. You're actually better off selling for 106% - 112% until the public start liking you more, causing the shoppers to eventually warm up to buying the later and more expensive objects you can unlock, and raising your combo to speed up leveling. Neither the level combo nor town reputation are mentioned in the tutorials, which is strange considering they're actually very important to succeeding at the game and it can be frustrating until you realize they are both major factors in your progress.  The dungeon exploration is also very repetitive after a while, but is necessary in order to unlock more of the side stories and characters to come to your store. Since merchant levels are more important to success than your adventurers' combat levels you'll probably ignore the dungeons after a certain amount of time to play the markets, especially after you unlock items in the market that make the payouts from these sessions seem small in comparison.  If you're looking for an original take on the traditional JRPG setting and like the idea of running a store in a fantasy realm then I'd strongly recommend picking Recettear up.",

Your dad is a low-life who left you with his loan having to pay it off with large sums of Pix (game currency) otherwise you're homeless. This snarky Fairy (Tear) bosses you around and you have to pay her so much money at the end of each week (if you don't have the money at the end of the week, 'Game Over'). You have to go out which means your shop will have to be closed for a period of time, going to town to buy/delve further into the story takes up some time but going dungeon diving takes up a lot of time and the number of things you can carry are small... Don't Die (kind of die).  Once you beat the game... beat the game? You don't beat the game, you still have to make money to keep food on the table and logs in the fireplace, you keep your shop running and you progress through the story on Endless Mode, heck you can go through it again on New Game+. You most likely won't get all the Adventures your first time through (did you think you were fighting, you're way too dainty for that). Just a note, if you notice you're not going to make the loan payment by the end of the week get all the stuff you know will sell and go dungeon diving like crazy, you'll keep those things when the game pretends you were just dreaming you did all that. You'll also keep your Merchant levels and 'basically' everything else except your money. You're able to change the look, size, and layout of your store, plus vending machine so you can sell more items during the day.   I absolutely love this game, I wish I could play more and hopefully soon I will have a chance to get the rest of the adventurers. It's rather short if you play it hardcore like I did, it feels like I played a lot but the number of hours I played doesn't match up to the number of days that sped through my mind (talking game time, not real). At first, I was surprised by the amount of Pix I needed each week but I managed to get the game clear after the second go through. The game is cute and sometimes Recette can be annoying when she repeats the same phrases or a customer says things that is rude to her then she's all upset with herself but it was the customer who was in the wrong, 'Sell something to you for below it's base price? Woman, you don't risk your life for me, get out of my store!' I do believe Tear will tell you this also, if one of your adventurers come to buy an upgrade sell it cheaper than you would to someone else. You can't just give them gear, you can buy gear and put it on them while in the dungeon but they have to come to the store and purchase it themselves to own, giving it to them to wear while in the dungeon swaps what they currently have on for the new gear which takes up space in your bags.  So go now, build your item shop for the townsfolk and adventurers, be the person they turn to to get everything they need, send people into battle to fight for your items, and for goodness sake don't forget to save!",

Be careful, this game gets pretty hard pretty quickly, but after losing there is a sort of 'new game plus' where you get to retain all of the stuff you had previously, which makes it easier. It's easy enough to beat on your second loop through the game, but trying to beat it without ever getting a game over is much more of a challenge.  There's also a whole top-down action-adventure game embedded within the capitalism simulator, which is pretty fun.

The game revolves around running an item shop, and the challenges that brings. It also has adventure opportunities where you can play in some very basic Legend of Zelda-like game play (better example would be Neutopia on the TurboGraphics 16) from the original NES days, although with better graphics, in order to acquire rare and cool items for sale. There is a ton of content it seems for this game, but most of it you will likely not use during the main course of the game. The reason being that taking advantage of such usually requires risk, and since you have to meet monetary goals within a certain amount of time in the main story, you may choose to go a safer route. Nevertheless, this game offers quite the charming gameplay despite it being repetative at times. I highly recommend this game if you can manage to get it for $10 or less. If not, then it really depends on how many hours of gameplay you expect at minimum to get per dollar you spend.",

In the game, you run an item shop in an attempt to pay off Recette's father's debt with the help of the fairy Tear, who also works for the company collecting the debt. In the game you will meet many adventurers, whom you can hire to go with you into dungeons to look for loot to sell in your shop. Micro-management is a big factor in this game, as you need to make sure to have enough money at the end of the week to pay off your debt. Each day is set into four segments, and each time you open the store or leave the shop costs a segment, while going into a dungeon will cost three. If you don't have enough money when your debt is due, then you will need to start at the beginning but with character progress getting carried over. Overall, this is a great game that JRPG fans should definitely not pass up.",

Recettear....an adorable little RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, because it doesn't need to. While it may be short, with a story mode easily completed in 4-6 hours, there is a surprising amount of depth for those who seek it.  For completionists, the main goal is to complete the item encyclopedia, which seems simple enough...however, even after a playthrough of the story mode, you may only be left with &lt;25% completion, especially if you never went through the dungeon. You may have also missed many cutscenes, and missed several potential unlocks. Luckily, the game provides an endless mode for you to clean up any loose ends, and start going towards that 100%!  Pros -cute art style  -Dialogue is well-written, with many subtle jokes and references you may not get your first way through.  -Recette and Tear are a very likeable pair, and they all have unique reactions to other characters.  -Surprising amount of depth, with dungeoneering, crafting, and a small meta game of equipping your adventurers with the best gear.  -Simple, yet effective game mechanics  -Soundtrack is nice  -Offers a fair amount of post-story content, including an endless mode (continue playing without having to worry about debts), New Game+ (With new content. Start over from day 1 with levels and items intact and repay the debt again) and survival mode (where you have to keep paying back the debt, and see how long you can last).  Cons -Art style, especially in dungeons, can be inconsistent. Some mobs are 3d, while your player characters are always 2d sprites.  -Game will either be extremely easy to get through, or RNG will doom you into a situation where you are failing to pay off your debts  -You don't need to do any dungeon'ing or crafting to complete story mode  -Time management can be a bit troublesome, since going through dungeons requires you to give up almost an entire day in your schedule.  -Small frustrating issues, such as being unable to see outstanding orders without speaking to Tear in the shop. (If you leave to go purchase wares, you lose a share of time, and you can only double check what items you need by returning and wasting another share.)  -Dungeon combat is pretty simple, and can be very grindy   Neutral  -Game lies to you, and fails to tell you about important game mechanics. (do NOT sell for 130% base price)  -Why are you selling knives to children...?  -New Game+ is incredibly easy. The amount you must pay never increases.    Overall I actually really like Recettear. It's cute, enjoyable, and can certainly be stressful sometimes. There are a few issues, such as major game mechanics being more risk than reward during the story mode. Still, I would recommend this game not only because it provides for a surprisingly absent genre of game (running an RPG store), but it provides it in such a way that is very appealing and cheerful.",

While the base of this game is the management of the item shop in an attempt to make money, how you get stock is left up to the player. While they originally allow you to buy stock from the Merchant Guild, this will quickly fall away and you'll begin to dungeon delve with one of the various adventurers (starting with Louie the Swordsman) in an attempt to get large amounts of high priced items to sell.  This game is a balancing act, attempting to balance the amount of cash your selling things for in an attempt to pay your debt while also not overcharging for items and losing customers. On top of that equipment sold to your adventuring friends makes their gear within the dungeon better, so do you sell Louie that sword for 130% or do you charge him a mere 110% to ensure he buys it and gets a better weapon next time you enter the dungeon.

I'm going to only explain why I personally think this game turns from good into great.  Dungeon crawling is considered awful and/or boring for most people I know. They like shooters or some sports games. A few actually like RPGs. And Recettear is definitely a good RPG with a fair amount of simplistic dungeon crawling. It's also interesting how its simplicity aids the game's concept, because if you're anything like me you'll actually like more the character's shop management than going into dungeons to sell the crap out of what a monster unwittingly thought was fun to be lugging around for no reason.  In other words, I think the whole shop management deal is what makes Recettear a good game. If I were to judge it solely on the dungeon crawler aspect I'd tell you that I've played many considerably better dungeon crawlers. Heck, I'd even tell you that Rogue and a great part of it's infinite spawn of clones and wannabes is a better game on dungeon crawling alone. But the shop management, from what goods you'll display on that particular day, the kind of display furniture you're using, and even the little feeling of having sold the junk that some monster considered valuable enough to carry for astronomical values to the masses of curious customers... is only 14.99 away from you.  Let me sweeten the deal here. Carpe Fulgur, the publisher, is one of those that normally has its games featured on discounts on Steam. It's not uncommon to drop around 60% of the price from time to time. And you can't say that the cute-as-kittens-and-fun-as-(games I suppose?) protagonist and its struggles don't capture your heart to the point where you will want to help her get the funds for the next loan she NEEDS to pay, and then see the story evolve gradually with the other characters she gets involved with.  Also, you get to see the witty translation of whatever the original game had in its original language of (I assume) Japanese into 'Capitalism, HO!', Recette's happy money-making battlecry, among other instant classics. There's plenty of humour to read in the dialogues, and sometimes you'll think that you're also paying for a comic book with all of the grins, smiles and even laughter that you'll find yourself performing. Do you still think 14,99 is too much?  There's also a demo for the unbelieving masses to try. That's, of course, the safe approach. Try that demo and you'll see you'll want to buy the full game. If you're worried about the investment, wait for the sales, often Midweek on Steam, or maybe even the big summer or winter sales. You can thank yourself for the investment later.",

It also has an overview-grid action RPG-mechanic that isn't as interesting and at times gets pretty tedious, but it's still head and shoulders above average.   The real draw here is the store. Not only is the shopkeeping gameplay plenty addictive for its beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, but it's also very understanding about difficulty. Every time you happen to fail your quest to save your store from bankruptcy, you get to keep your experience points from the previous go and the next attempt will be a whole lot easier afterwards. You simply cannot fail if you just keep failing long enough, so experts will complete the game in one go, while beginners will slowly learn by getting stronger from failure. A very balanced system for all kinds.  Plenty of replayability if you know what's good for you. Capitalism, ho!",

The game is about a girl name Recette that is living all by herself ever since her father ran away. She originally created the shop in order to shoulder the large debt that her father had built up over the years. Tear, the other character the game gets its name from, is a debt collector that helps manage the store so that you can maximize your profits.  While this seems like just a boring management game from my description, it actually does have moments where you can go out and fight monsters. Recette can hire heroes to help her collect items to sell in her store. The game turns into an action RPG for those moments with gameplay that's not dissimilar to the top-down entries in the Legend of Zelda franchise.  This game has colorful characters that populate the city. While most of them are kind of cliche, it fits with the game's atmosphere. This is supposed to be an action RPG from the eyes of Recette, the girl who runs the item store.",

Take that, economy!  Cons - Selling items becomes a bit formulaic; most new shop-related stuff (custom orders, etc.) show up early and don't introduce anything new later on - Dungeons can be a grind for XP and items, and the limited bag space (which is upgradable) is a chore - Music is fun at first, intolerable in large quantities - Recette's Japanese exclamations when she does anything are incredibly obnoxious - I pressed 'Esc --&gt; Skip Scene' more in this game than maybe any to date - Made me feel like the Wal-Mart of the fantasy world when I would only sell severely marked up junk to housewives just before the market crashed and everybody was poor - I hate little girls  Conclusion If you like shop management sims with a lot of min/maxing, dungeon crawling, and the never-ending grind of leveling with a fun, addicting backdrop, this is a great game for you.

While normally I like the idea of devestating failstates in a game (really enjoying XCOM, for instance), I didn't really want to sludge through another bunch of hours of this crap. In addition, it feels like the game was designed for the player to fail once- unless you can beat the game on your first try, the only benefit that doing well on your first runthrough is that you end up wasting more time playing this game.

But there are no counter-offers - not even clever dialogue hints as to what price they're willing to pay (that I was able to figure out, anyway). Instead, they tell you exactly how to beat the game in the tutorial - 125% for selling, 50% for buying (plus or minus 5%). High price items will be 3x the base cost. Low price items are roughly 1/2 the base cost. The Little Girl can't afford anything. Knock 10% off for heroes.

            "review_text": "Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale, or Recettear for short, is a very intriguing time/money management game with some interesting mechanics to boot. Essentially, you play as Recettear, a young woman living alone in a home that apparently has a huge mortgage on it. Your father took out the mortgage (or loan, whatever) but has yet to pay it back – and he mysteriously vanished! Yeah I didn’t really get that and could have probably thought of a better back-story myself, but hey, it doesn’t really matter!  A fairy comes to pay you a visit one day to take the home away from you (Hey I thought Fairies were nice?!) because the loan is outstanding, but then takes pity on you (Oh right, yep, Fairies are nice) and develops a plan for you to pay back the loan – Turn your downstairs into an Item Shop. Apparently you live in unnamed (Maybe it has a name and I missed it) RPG village where all manner of NPC characters live! How convenient! The intention is to buy cheap goods from the local Guild Master or market, when things are on sale, and resell them at your Item Shop for a markup. Using these funds you’ll of course buy more and buy and sell more and more. An endless circle of buy low, sell high.  But wait, there’s more! Should you be so inclined, the RPG village also has a dungeon! Should you choose to enter the dungeon, you’ll take an adventurer with you (And you’ll unlock more as you play the game) to slay monsters and descend deeper into the depths of the dungeon. Essentially you’ll get free items from killing the baddies, assuming you make it out alive. The dungeon is a very neat feature, and you need to use it in order to unlock more parts of the story line or other adventurers – however I found myself not using it because I could make a much greater profit from buying cheap goods and reselling them normally. You would think that getting something for free and reselling it would be better, but in my experience, I was getting rather junky items even when I went further down the dungeon in any later play through. Also it doesn’t help that it uses 2 pieces of the “daily pie” so to speak (A day is not endless. Going to market, opening the store, adventuring the dungeon or progressing the story takes a portion of the day) and also I really sucked at it. I am a video game pro, but found myself frustrated at the difficulty of some of the boss battles at times. But hey, that’s the challenge and charm of Recettear!  So as you earn money, at the end of each week, you have to pay back a portion of the loan. It starts out small, but then becomes exponentially larger! Week one you may have to pay back 40,000 (Not exact figures, pulling from memory right now…) and week four you find yourself needing 1,200,000! Say WHAT!? It’s achievable… …once you play through another time! If you fail to make a loan payment, the game ENDS! Game over, done, finished, ka put. However, not all is lost! You may get to start the game over from day 1, but you get to keep all the items you have in stock. So when you lose the game, you somehow go back in time (Not really, just my way of thinking how this works…) and have a huge stock of expensive items that you wouldn’t have had on your first play through. It took me three game overs before I was able to make all the loan payments and finish the game. I think it’s a very nice addition to the game, a handicap if you will – if you lose, not all is lost and you can try again with a little help.  Overall, Recettear has an extremely cute (I can’t believe I used the word ‘cute’…) visual appeal and has a great sound and music score included. The story line is interesting to say the least (Some of the dungeon adventurers are odd, but hey, that’s part of the charm!) and has lots of replay ability (Not just replaying when you lose, but once you win you can continue to play and unlock more items and upgrade your store to be better yet!). Overall great game, well worth a play through if you’re interested in JRPG’ish style stories and business sense.",

The buying/selling aspect of the game, and the dungeon crawling part.   The game story is that you have to repay a debt, or Tear the Fairy, will throw you out on your ♥♥♥ to live in a cardboard box. I was a little shocked too at first, to see her throw away this adorable eight year old girl to live in a cardboard box, the word ♥♥♥♥♥, came to mind. So you buy low, sell high to earn money to pay back the loan.   I'm sure that some people are so good at this game that they didn't even need to use the dungeons.

            "review_text": "The object of the game is to acquire a certain amount of money by the end of the game's month in order to pay your rent. What an exciting concept for a game!  Money is earned through one of two ways, either going into a dungeon and killing things to get money and things to sell or by playing the shop-keeping minigame. You buy supplies from other vendors and than try to sell them to random villagers. This consists of sitting around and waiting for a customer to come into your shop and than haggling. Haggling for 20-30% higher seems to be the best so you just do this all day. It's as braindead as it sounds. It's as braindead as it sounds and the only real challenge is to avoid falling asleep. Sit at the counter wait for an npc to walk up to you, set the haggle amount to the same value you always use and press the confirm key, repeat until credits roll. The good news is it's pretty much impossible to lose doing this so your boredem ends quickly. There's only about 5 different looking shoppers that come in and each only has about 2-3 lines, being stuck in the same room with the same npcs is nausiating. I should mention that this is the core of the game.   The dungeon crawling stuff is better buy actually getting to it is hidden behind annoying crap where you need to talk to some random npc after doing some obscure task on a certain day in order to even unlock the ability to go into them. There are several characters to play as in these sections and they all require a different find the npc puzzle to get. In addition each dungeon must be unlocked by yet more tedioum. The dungeons themself are short, offering nothing interesting, with boring enemy design and gets repative really fast. The quality of the dungeons and combat is comparable to freeware flash games. Since the object isn't to clear the dungeon but to grind everything feels unrewarding and tedious. You'll probably want to do this rather than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shopkeep mini game but gives less money for a higher risk and requires you to spend half the game talking to npcs to unlock dungeons.   This isn't a serious game and has no bussiness charging $20 or even $2 for what is essentially a flash game. The only people that like this are ♥♥♥♥ eating weebus that have no standards and will play anything with an underage anime girl.",

This game is super fun and *incredibly* addictive. When I started playing this, when I was off work ill, I played it non-stop, and actually dreamed about it for a bit. It gets into your brain.  The mechanics, however, are quite repeatative, and the process of acquiring items for your store is very tedious. The story, though, is charming and enjoyable (if you like JRPG sorts of games, you will appreciate it).  My main criticism is that after 10 hours of play, I failed the game at the last hurdle, after being asked to complete *an impossible challenge* (I think it is anyway). The only way I can deduce to complete the game is to play it *twice*, and fail the first time. You prepare tonnes of items in the first play, really good stuff, and sell large the second run through.  This, to me, is incredibly annoying game design, and is the reason I have not completed, as I refuse to put myself through another playthrough. For this reason, I'd avoid it, but if you can put up with that, then go ahead!  Nilesy",

The first adventurer you get is very slow, too. Time your swings well. If you die you lose all the items you collected and even brought with you, save one.  Running the shop would be fun, but customers have a set price range in mind (it differes depending on their sprites) and if you get it right on or close to what they want you get a bonus. If you get it wrong they're likely to walk out and you only get so many sales a day.  Don't even think about selling expensive items early on either. No one will be able to afford them. They'll just get angry with you and waste a customer spot.  I'm sure the game gets fun further on, but I haven't been able to earn enough money to make the first week.

However, you can get so attached to the game is doesn't even matter.  Gameplay: 10/10; This game offers you a chance to step into the world of capitalism. Learn the consequences of charging too litttle or too much. While, at the same, time, build badass characters to go dungeon raiding with and craft even better items that go for huge prices. It becomes even better when you can buy stuff to customize your shop: new floors, walls, and carpets. There is no way this game can bore you unless you suck at dealing with Japanese dubs and repetitive selling of apples and cakes.  Story: 7/10; A unique, but casual storyline. Each hero is different in good ways, and there is a lot of option for new dialogues as you replay the game. Anime people may have no problem and love the storyline, but others may refute it. That is fine.  OVERALL: 9/10 It is an awesome game despite it's lolicon looks. (Not that I have a problem with that.) You adventure, get items, sell items, make money, and spend money on better equipment for heroes. You learn to run a shop. And you have fun while doing it. Gameplay is innovative and suspenseful, storyline is a good emphasis on pressure for a child left with debt by her far-away father, and graphics are mediocre and good enough to appeal without making the game look bleak. If you are a stickler for sharp and extreme panoramas and amazing looks, you'll be disappointed. However, most will dismiss it and appreciate the game's excellent play.

I went to the dungeons maybe three times in total. The shopkeeping part of it is that much fun.   On my second run of the game in new game + you can keep all of your items and heroes whose true card you have. This gives a good replayability aspect as you try to unlock all of the characters. With all of your previous games items, you have a much easier time with your economy and don't have to work so hard to make payments.  There is also endless mode where you can just continue playing without having payments at all but know that you cannot unlock everyone if you do endless mode after your first game.  Overall this game was great. Again, I wasn't too into the fighting part of it because I'm not into dungeon crawl/hack and slash. What I will say is that the interesting bosses, free loot and interesting ultimate moves of the different characters were enough for me to actually enjoy that part but I mainly liked the economy portion of the game.   Very fun overall, worth the money for sure.",

            "review_text": "I once sold a sailor-suit school girls uniform to a man 'for his mother-in-law'. Um... yeah. Another time, I bought a beef bowl off of a woman who 'found it in her attic'... and then promptly resold it at a significant mark-up. I'm sure it was tasty...   I'd recommend this game to someone just off of those experiences, but if you want a more traditional review:  Recetter is a combination time-management game and Zelda-esque dungeon crawler. Both halves of the game start out seeming pretty simple, but there is surprising depth to be found in each--making the overall experience a unique and enjoyable one.  You start off with a large debt to pay off, and a fairy companion who suggests you do so by turning your house into an item shop that serves the numerous adventurers in town.  There are three ways to earn the necessary money to pay off your debt:  1) Buy items at the local merchant guild or market and sell them off 2) Hire an adventurer to take you into dungeons to find treasure. 3) Use the various monster parts picked up in the dungeon to craft expensive items  The more time spent selling, the better a merchant you become, and the more higher quality goods you can buy from the market and merchants guild. Conversely, the more time spent adventuring, the more different adventurers you will meet and unlock, the better gear you will find, and the more powerful weapons and armor you can craft (either to sell, or to give to your adventurers to make the next dungeon run easier).  The limiting reagent here is time. You only have so many turns to sell items in your shop or to adventure out into dungeons. Use your time well, and you'll pay off your debt... at which point you can keep going, to meet new adventurers, see new dungeons, craft new materials, and try to make obscene profits.  It's an addictive game with fun, cutey graphics, a great sense of humor, and a lot of interesting (and important) choices to make. And that's besides, the whole sailor-suit incident. What more could you possibly want in a game?",

            "review_text": "Ever played an RPG, walked into a store and asked yourself what it's like on the other side of the counter? Here's the answer.   I bought Recettear: An Item Shops Tale some time ago and had great fun with it. I downloaded the demo first, because the description and cute art caught my eye and I was curious what to expect from the game. I was amazed and bought the game. Since then, Recettear has grown one of my favorite games of all time.  The story of the game is that a little Girl called Recette Lemongrass wakes up one morning in all kinds of trouble. Her father is long gone and now a fairy tells her, that he left her all his dept, which she has to pay off or her house will be taken.  The game offers you a good combination of two different modes to play. The first one is the shop managing, where you play as Recette, who has turned her house into an item shop in order to be able to pay back her fathers dept. The game lets you do that at weekly rates, that increase every week. So to pay them you have to buy and sell items to the local people and adventurers. This sounds easier than it actually is because you have to pay attention to factors that influence the customers willingness to buy stuff. That is mainly the price, which you can set for each item individually, once a customer wants to buy it. With every successful sale, your skill as a merchant increases, opening new possibilities for you to explore.  Speaking of exploring, there is another mode in this game. That is the exploration of dungeons. Recette can either buy her stock at the market or merchants guild, but she can also hire an adventurer to go into one of the many dungeons to loot it. There are 8 adventurers at your disposal each with his/her own way of fighting and set of skills. Thanks to the easy controls, it is not hard to master them. The dungeons on the other hand can be tricky at first. They are randomly generated and you can't leave whenever you want to. But it is great fun to explore and loot and slay monsters. The bosses are challenging enough to keep things interesting, even if you complete a dungeon for the second or third time (the bosses don't change even if the rest of the stages do).  So the game might appear cute and relaxed, and in some cases it is, but it is also complex and challenging. It may not be a perfect game but with its fun gameplay, good story, nice characters, easy controls and cute graphics, this game is definitely worth a try.",

I've only played through the storyline once, but it took me approximately 13 hours to beat.   There are multiple activities you can take part in within the game during the day. And each day is split up into 4 parts. Certain businesses are only open during certain times of day, or on certain days.  - The activity the player will likely spend the most time doing is running the shop - which includes stocking your shop, tending to customers, haggling, ticking off scam artists, and making a profit. - The player can go to the town and buy supplies from the Market or the Merchant's Guild. - The player can interact with various characters during random events, which will generally increase their liking of you and may earn you a new customer or adventurer. - You can hire an adventurer from the Adventurer's Guild to go into a dungeon and gather loot for you. During this time, you control the adventurer and must fight enemies, avoid traps, and find lots of treasure (or be incapacitated trying).  There's more to the game then just these previous activities, but that's for you to find out for your own. When/If you beat the game, you unlock a few new game modes, such as  - Endless, where you can continue to play your game endlessly without worrying about payments - New Game+ where you start over with your current items and Merchant Level - Survival Mode where you start over and your debt never ends, but constantly increases and you have to play until the debt overwhelms you and you lose your home!
