            "review_text": "This is a fun game when you play it for what it is. I really enjoyed the time I put into it. The game plays much different than any of the current Motocross racing games and it shouldn't be compared to them because of this reason. You can't play this game expecting it to play like the MX vs ATV series or MXSIMULATOR, this is a racing game on dirt bikes, not a simulator.   The single stick driver controls feel dated when comparing it to MvA Reflex, but the controls work for this game. The scrubing feature feels great, even though the animation does look a little wonky when it comes back. But the way it plays is nice in the game and you'll be spotting your landing on the way back not staring at the animation.  I never got a chance to play online against other players, that would have been very interesting. The AI gives you a good run from time to time, but nothing like another human player would.   If you're looking for a fun, good looking dirt bike racing game I would suggest this game. The Tour mode is like a career mode where you level your rider up, get new gear, better teams, etc... I really enjoyed playing this mode. My only complaint is that you're not able to put your name and rider number on your rider, these are assigned for you.   Overall I would give this game a 7\\10 and I suggest that any fan of dirt bike videos games give it a chance.",

If you love MX vs ATV Relex surely you're going to be a little disappointed with this in comparsions ,apart from that it's quite good actually !  After being played a couple of weeks, i really like it a lot...:)",
