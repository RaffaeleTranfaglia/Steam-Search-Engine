            "review_text": "RTS/Tower Defense game with simple mechanics but with the potential for a high level of strategy, with resource management and the way buildings interact with one another. Gameplay is mostly survival based, where you just try to to not lose for as long as possible against ever increasing numbers of enemies.   Also unique in the sense that as far as story goes, you are sort of the antagonist, stripping resources from alien planets for money, with the local alien populations understandably irritated about this and attacking you.",

Theres around 7 buildings solar panel - generates power transmitter - transfers power harvester - harvests rocks, slowly. laser tower - shoots lasers, can be linked to increase range n damage missile tower - can be upgraded to another two towers, one basically incrases AOE, other basically increases range  Overall it doesnt really give you much options. I cant even be bothered to play the first planet enough to unlock the second planet. Which by the looks of it is just the same crap with a different terrain n harder enemies. Yawn.",

Here you are tasked with defending a space colony where you need to build energy networks to keep your resources flowing so that you can build increasing amounts of defense to handle the onslaught of ufo's. The game supports the Steam Overlay but the widescreen is clearly stretched to fit a 16:10 screen. The graphics are a little below average and the sound design is minimal. Since I am not a tower defense fan the game didn't really grab me, but there is enough here that serious fans of the genre should consider it if it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "I've fallen in love with this game :)  It's a low-cost, low-tech, small-scope game from an indie developer that I'd never heard of, who has a very small stable of titles to their name. That said, the game itself is well-executed and above all else, FUN.  The object of the game depends on what play mode you select; modes include a normal 'gradually increasing waves that will eventually decimate you' mode, Wave (which gives you time to plan your defenses then trigger enemy waves when you're ready); Creative (which lets you play with everything the game offers, to try out different strategies in a sandbox) and a few others.  For $10 you could do far worse, but if you're a fan of RTS resource-gathering games or tower-defense titles, you'd be doing yourself a favor by looking into this. Watch the trailer to get a sense of what's involved. Steam does not currently offer a demo of the game, but you can download one from the developer's site.  Enjoy!",
