            "review_text": "Please read this all text for an understanding of why I recommended this game despite its current deficiencies. This is based on a very short stint (the tutorial, plus a few minutes outside of the tutorial). So with that qualification:  While the premise is promising and there is definitely potential, the game has a very unfinished feel to it. The very first tutorial aircraft I encountered pushed back from the the St. Thomas terminal like a proper airliner... wow, neat.... except for the fact that it was a Cessna. OK then. Then on the GA ramp that typically would have hosted the Cessna, a Dash 8 type turboprop taxiied right though the farm of its fellow turboprops to get to the taxiway. The game took a slight hit to suspension of disbelief there. And the Cessna thing seemed pretty darned obvious to me.  Rushed. But could be fixed.  Pros: Promising mechanics, aircraft behave more or less as they should when commanded. Cons: Rudimentary graphics and textures. Aircraft movement is not terribly smooth. View control is poor; zoom functionality is not terribly effective.  This has the potential to be a really good and engaging sim, but it's not there yet.   My advice - buy it to support the developer and encourage them to keep working on it. Try it out. You'll probably be disappointed. But come back in 6 months and I expect (or hope) that it will be signficantly improved from its launch state.",
