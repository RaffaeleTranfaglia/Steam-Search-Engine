            "review_text": "This game is a reasonably enjoyable casual game. There isn't much to it, and gets repetitive fast. The main reason I can't recommend it, is because it's very buggy. Sometimes you'll fall through the tracks or a rope randomly, causing you to drop to your death. On occassion, the next sector doesn't load and you just disappear into the void. The hitboxes for the barriers are way too big; you could jump high over a barrel but still get hit. There aren't any exciting power ups, and skill doesn't mean that much in this game, so you end up just grinding for achievements.",
