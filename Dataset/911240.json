    "description": "Super Streaker Plus is a tongue-in-cheek homage to classic sports simulation games of the 16-bit era like Fifa Soccer '93 &amp; John Madden Football '95 - the twist is that we've added combat and action elements to the mix so that instead of playing soccer or football you play the role of a streaker.",
