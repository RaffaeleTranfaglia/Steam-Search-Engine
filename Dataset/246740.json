            "review_text": "It's rare to find a horror game that has no blood &amp; violence but the prob with this game is that I don't like it. (I'm going to post my thoughts on why I don't like it).  Cons:   1. It does a terrible job at making you nervous since the game's antagonist moves way too slow &amp; does a lame life sapping technique if you look at him (Doesn't that sound familiar?)  2. Your main character moves slow and your always tapping Shift all the time just trying to run (The running in that game feels like fast walking)  3. The lack of names on the graves makes it annoying &amp; time wasting  4. The lack of exploration sucks too because the orphanage is too small in my opinion which has a short basement, 2 short floors &amp; that annoying hedge maze which takes forever to figure out  5. Finding Treasure and setting them on a certain grave kinda reminds me of a matching game except a more boring version of it  Pros:  1. Really good voice acting on each of the characters  2. The story is decent  Overall I personally think this game is terrible but some people might like a creepypasta based game with no blood or violence but don't bother wasting $15 on this game (I'm sorry about the negative review but I just didn't feel it).",

            "review_text": "I bought this for 2.99 on sale. If you get it for free, good for you, if not, don't bother paying for it.   I like the story idea of the orphanage and hunting down the parts for the kids but that's about where it ends.   The game play is glitchy, you have to figure out how the keyboard is configured (fairly easy) and no options.   Given time in delevopment, this game could have been a really good horror game. I'm sorry to give this game a thumbs down.",

            "review_text": "I thought this game would be scary. Turns out its really not. At first the atmosphere is a little creepy, but theres not much to interact with. Finding the first key to get to the maze was a huge pain. I searched every room in the orphanage and I still didn't find it, I had to look up the location of it online. The Huntsman is a windup-Spider-Puppet-Guy, who is really not very scary at all. If he is in the house, he usually doesn't move from one spot. You can always tell where he is because of the clicking noise, so it's easy to avoid him. He moves very slowly and He basically doesn't attack you or run at you. When you are too close to him for too long your screen just starts fading to black. So you lose if you stand next to him for like 15 seconds. The reason I don't find it scary is because he doesn't seem very aggressive towards you. He doesn't attack you or anything, I never feel threatened when playing the game like I do when I play other scary games. The developers said that they made it this way because they wanted a different, less violent approach than most games, but I think that was just an excuse so they didn't need to put anymore work into making the AI smarter. Overall, the graphics are pretty bad, you can't interact with much, and the game is not very scary. Definitely, not worth $15, I'd say even $5 would be stretching it.",
