            "review_text": "I laughed my ♥♥♥ off at this game. Apparently the humor is not for everyone; it's not exactly high-brow, but it's not, say, South Park. The timing, writing, and delivery are all above-par.  The thing of it is, Episode 1 is 15 minutes long, and episodes 2-4 are vaporware; the developer has disappeared, and this is very likely all we're getting.  If this game was free I'd rate it 11/10. For five bucks I'd say to seriously consider grabbing it. For fifteen USD? Absolutely not. Do not buy this game, at least until there's some proof that the other three 'episodes' are actually coming.",

            "review_text": "I mean the game is good and all but for 10 minutes of gameplay and bugged achievements that never unlock the game is not worth its pricetag. It would be a lot better if these further episodes came out. SO far there is basically 1 that lasts around 10 minutes. Despite the game being about a detective I didn't solve any crimes or puzzles.   3/10. Might get better with updates, who knows?",

Writing, voiceacting, jokes, style, noir-ish feel. I don't know what made devs abandon it, from what I saw it looks really promissing. But sadly we have what what we have and also achievements doesn't seem to work for me - got only one somehow.  Can not recommend unless devs continue the work or you want to have few laughs and got it from a bundle or on a HUGE sale.",
