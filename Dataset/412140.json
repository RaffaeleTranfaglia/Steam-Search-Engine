Also, the synthwave music and all the other soundeffects just fit this story to a T. Great work, i definitly recommend this.  Short notice to the authors: Keep up the good work!",

The soundtrack is also great. Moreover, the game is free. To be honest, I even thought that this game worth paying for. At least, it's possible to buy its soundtrack XD Be careful, however, because it does feel like an acid trip when you're playing it. I believe that's a good thing because of mental borders breaking and something like that, but it does make your head spin, literally.",

As someone who has loved video games ever since Pong, I stll love the older, cleaner 3D worlds in games like Red Faction, Heretic and so on. I am only up to the 4th world, or so but I'm looking forward to more. I got this game for free, but would easily pay for it.  Things that I especially like:  - Clean, 'realistic' 3D world where everything you can see is an object in the world. Vastly superior to jaggy 'pixel art' junk that is so popular now. I know the design is fantastical. By 'realistic' I just mean that the world's and your behaviour are as though it were real.  - Creative puzzles with old school clues in the environment. Puzzles are challenging and fun too.  - Creative use of textures and environments for world elements, wall textures, lighting and so on.  - Intro story, art and music make this feel like an 80's game that somehow I just missed playing.  Thank you to the devs for making such a cool game!  PS: I am also buying the soundtrack.",

It also had surprisingly little backtracking for a game so centered around navigating through maze areas, which was a relief. Some of the later sections got a few laughs out of me as well.

Graphics will take you back to the Dark Forces/Quake/Duke3D age where assets that are not environmental geometry are 2D sprites that constantly rotate to face you. Visuals are original and feel well-loved and handcrafted, if not basic. It's charming and never stands in the way of the overall experience, which is basically a modern retalling of the LSD scenario. You are constantly shifting between psychadelic worlds which while they look and sound very different, all play by practically the same rules. Existential flavor text permeates the game, and is arguably faux-philosophical nonsense, but is inoffensive and never patronizing. It's as if the developer actually wants to leave the question open as to whether or not any of the 'message' of the game is to be perceived as sincere or a parody of its genre.  All in all, throw in the half hour to see the developer's vision. Or not. I don't think they'll mind either way.",
