            "review_text": "It's a puzzle game and it's NOT revolutionary. You manipulate the world around you by shouting to distract guards, push and pull objects to manipulate your shouts. Steam achievements are an essential addition,   I wouldn't say it lives up to SOME of the reviews I've seen, I'm definately enjoying slowly progressing through the campaign and the puzzles are becoming more and more difficult, as you would expect. Other than that I really can't think of much else to say.. I guess the atmosphere is ok, I'm not getting the full benefit playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop though.  The only controls I've come across so far is UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SPACE BAR (SHOUT), E (PUSH/PULL) - nice and simple  Not sure if it's worth £10.99 to be brutally honest though - although still early days  If you can get it on offer go for it",
