I've been looking for something as cool as this gamne for a long time. He comes running to me, dad the robot killed me, halarious. In fact I'm so old school that I love it myself. I switch between Borderlands, Far Cry and the man in a maze! Although I wish they'd make more levels for some hardcore wanna be :).",
