            "review_text": "Well after playing this game for what seemed to be around half and hour I can summarise this game as a game I expect on Gamejolt, this product should not be on steam due to it's terrible lacklustre quality and here are the reasons:  1.) The textures on some of the levels are stretched and sometimes don't even fit the entire screen. (Big black and white circles and lines can be visibly seen). This makes the game look untidy and unfinished.  2.) The platforming is no where near enjoyable. It is quite frankly a joke. First person platforming games are hard to make from the get go (Mirrors edge can be the only exception because it did a half decent job) However, when I have to spend a good proportion of the game trying to get past what looked like a simple platforming level (The one with the giant mushrooms) only to slip off at the slightest adjustments leaves me thinking there wasn't much thought put into this game.  3.) The ending, I won't give much away but the screams seemed to just been thrown in there to make some form of cheap jumpscare. Plus there is no exit to the menu screen... Games on gamejolt do this and those games are for free!  The premise is good but the execution is poor. This should have been published on Gmejolt for free and not pushed through onto steam because quite frankly it's a lacklustre attempt.  I would highly reccomend not buying this game.  Edit: I do realise this is your first game but for the love of god next time if you do publish another game on steam make sure it is more polished than this one, otherwise publish on gamejolt instead.",
