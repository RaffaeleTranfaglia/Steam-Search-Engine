Bullets are lethal, and you will die, over and over if you do not stay still, silent, and quietly pinpoint an enemy as soon as they are within your sight.

It is also perfectly balanced in order to allow a multitude of gaming styles, such as patient campers, kamikase runners or jedi snipers. It is a pity that most people do not see that. But the game is mercyless to the newbie. You get be tough and persistent to endure the first hours. It is a total carnage where you are going to die several times without even understanding what happened. But after this grimm beginning, you start to realise the hard facts that this gaming valhala is a much more complex world, with lots of room for subtleness, skills and wit. I hope you can see beyond this harsh learning curve and the dated ,yet, somewhat elegant, graphics. Valve should definitely work on a sequel.  What a game...",

However, in its current state of relative obscurity, I would not recommend this, especially to newcomers. People who are good at this game (presumably veterans) seem to be fairly rude and not very helpful; the elitism is strong with this community. There are more grenades than World at War. It feels kind of spray-and-pray-ish to me (although I am a novice so I'm probably wrong). The recoil is crazy on the guns, which I guess is more of a nitpick than anything, but it's annoying. I think the biggest problem is simply that it gets no love, which at this point it will probably never get, and that leaves it in this state of obscurity.",

Unfortunately, most of the game's community has moved on to other games, leaving only a small subset of players behind. In terms of gameplay, the maps are well designed and the weapons are varied but balanced. The game has aged, but still looks acceptable.

For people that don't enjoy having to wait to respawn in a game like CS, DoD:S offers the ability to respawn right after death, making the game faster paced and (in my opinion) a lot more fun.

            "review_text": "I was playing on the Wehrmacht side against the US alongside with my brother on dod_flash. The americans captured the middle flag and pushed us to the last 2 remaining flags. Shortly after they captured the fourth (farm) flag and we only held our spawn flag. We were on the brink of defeat because everybody in our team were dying over and over but then the two of us stood up and started to push them back. I went around the road through the farm flag and managed to capture it, killing 3 enemies along the way while my brother cleared the houses up to the middle flag. We met up in the middle , shot everyone who where trying to get there and we took it back. Then we finally received reinforcements from our team and we were ready to push the fight to the americans. Our team charged both of their flags and won the round in just over a minute.  Moments like these are awesome in this game and they alone are worth playing the game.  Strategy in DoD:S is more than important and it's so awesome that this FPS game even allows you to do that, ie: well selected classes, good positioned MG's and snipers, smoke grenades - all make a difference in this game. Although alot of strategy may be involved in this game, it still kinda feels like a classic FPS arcade game with good graphics and source engine which makes it play great. The only shame is that alot of people don't want to try to play as squad or a team to capture or defend flags, in most servers there are like only 3 - 4 people of total 8-10 ppl in your team who try to work together while others are in their own little worlds.  Day of Defeat: Source is a great game, much better than most modern shooters in this day and age and I rate it 9/10",

Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have 'Source' at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.",

Pros *Easy to learn controls and within 5-10 minutes a n00bie can be well on their way to experiencing the joy of lan gaming *Overall great balance *Smooth and realistic game-play *There is no better feeling than 'Shovelling a friend or three'   Cons *Only 6 official maps, although there are plenty of community maps but it can be a bit of a pain to filter through them to find the good ones *Dwindling online player base   Overall, DOD: Source is a classic fantastic WWII fps and scores 9/10 ",

I cannot remember the last time a game made me shout, yell, kick, sweat and curse with such intesity. Some games are just made to do that, even if they have to wait for years to be discovered, and that's a quality worth praising. DOD Source will steadily, but securely, ascent to the title of 'veteran' and be worthy of hosting fabulous evenings with friends. The mechanics are simple, the objesctives of the game are clear and the imprecision of weapons make every kill a delight. An absolute surprise and a welcomed addition to the 'always lit' games in the Steam library.",

Well this isn't the game for you. this game rewards skill and teamwork rather than 5 year olds with overpowered AKs SCREAMING I banged you mom at you. Here are the reasons I recommend it.  1. it has no leveling or unlock system so every player whether your a noob or a MLG PRO GAMER you will be using the same guns. 2. maps are well designed and feel authentic (all take place in France so sadly you can't fight in Russia or Germany). 3. I got this game for free but I feel that $9.99 for a FPS is a great steal. 4. This game will run on just about anything for expamle I have a 1 ghz motherboard, and 8 gigs of ram and I can run this thing on high graghics and get 30-40 frames. 5. Theres no DLC all content is on the game. 6. The weapons are feel so authentic and fun to shoot I still can't get anough of the garand ping. 7. There are still servers tho most are modded (I play on a server called DoD AXl) 8. The classes all serve a perpose to the team's survival 9. There are very little bugs and glitchs 10. This game was made by Valve and we can all see that Valves got a good track record  9/10",

You can choose between the following classes:  -Rifler: Both the German and US soldiers possess a different rifle which is good for long and mid range combat. The German rifles kill in one shot, but are bolt-action, the US kill in two but are faster. Both also have rifle grenades,  -Assault: Has an smg - good for close range combat, apart from the usual explosive grenade also has a smoke one.  -Support: Has automatic rifles good for close and mid range combat, but still useful in long range, has a massive recoil you need to compensate for, but its pretty simple since it only goes up. Has a grenade.  -Sniper: Self-explanatory, good for long range, doesn't have x-rair when unscoped but can still be used in close range like a rifler would.   -Machine Gunner: Has a machine gun which can deployed with a bipod and used to defend flags and other objectives. If not deployed the MG has a GIGANTIC recoil.  -Rocket: Has a Rocket Launcher that mostly kills in 1 shot. Needs to be deployed to shoot, good for eliminating snipers.  Some classes are better all around than others but each have their uses. There are numerous official and custom maps and its a fun game. The problems is there aren't many players. Furthermore, quite a bit of servers have dumb rules and you may as well be kicked or banned.  I would recommend this game if it's on sale.",

Its quite difficult to find people who play on the official valve servers and not some neon filled maps (even though i kinda like those) but the biggest gripe with this game is the community. If you get on a map thats quite populated you will get kicked off for pretty much anything negative you do. Talking on the mic or playing badly will get you kicked off the server quickly.

DoDs has more drama than a group of rabid wild teenage girls and the distribution of pornography of minors is just astonishing. Other than that you will meet your friendly no life hackers and trolls who take pictures of you, photo shop them and spread them out like the sexual diseases they have contracted.  Though the best part of it is the WWII fictional pretend power hungry units where little kids think they run the world because they have 'earned' a fictional rank in the 'military unit', with administrative powers that give them the abilities to rage and magically make everyone disappear from the server for span of a couple of minutes to permanent.   Females will be sadly be thrown into the front lines of various horny, sexually frustrated virgins and suffocate under the constant begging for nudes.   I recommend this game to anyone who is definitely looking for a drama filled environment and looking to assimilate into the norm of power hungry, sexually frustrated, horny males of all ages who cheat on their wives, girlfriends, boyfriends etc... and have absolutely no respect for themselves.    -Only happens in realism community  everyone else outside of that is cool as a cucumber :D",

Just read, it'll make sense.  I regret to inform you that this game has a very low server population. Usually, it's down to 5 servers, none of which are full. The most played map is an Orange map, with excessive MG and ladder camping. Sound fun? Didn't think so.  There is an exception, of course. You can find a Steam group that holds events for old games such as DoD:S. Play with them. So maybe you can't just pick it up whenever you want, but it's still worth the money if you can get into matches.  TL;DR: the game itself is solid and it's a lot of fun as a WWII shooter. It also has massive improvements over DoD, which are easily visible. In some cases, DoD classic won't be an option, since it has quite a few compatibility issues (at least for me, it does). However, you'll need to find a Steam group or play with friends, or you won't ever get to have fun with this game.  Final verdict: 8/10, but doesn't have players.  =UPDATE= So yes, I originally said 'don't get the game' simply because it didn't have players. While I still say you shouldn't get it unless you're willing to do a bit of setup and scheduling for matches, the servers you DO get on randomly can be a lot of fun. On this premise and the experience I've had with the last few matches I've played (not on that orange map, thank God) have been great.  Overall, maybe an 8.5/10. Not for everyone. You might occasionally have no server to play.",

The gameplay and the mechanics are copy and pasted from TF2, servers either are full or are totally empty. Don't trust to the reviews below mine, you'll have to TRY to find playable servers (and by playable i mean that there isn't an extremely masculine voice that every 2 second shouts 'first blood headshot monster kill score ♥♥♥♥♥' and that there are 10+ players still not filling entirely the server). In-game you either get killed by rats that spend their time finding a hole into the map to get some 'ez killz' or you get godsprayed by a rushing Thompson. Bots are even worse here, and by worse i mean THERE AREN'T ANY. Like really ? I know that every single game that Volvo did lately is multiplayer based but on a game that runs on the engine that ran the most innovative game ever i'd expect AT LEAST a pratice section where i could pawn some bots, but nevermind. Movement is so classic and regular that it's barely necessary to mention it. Guns and gunplay in general feels clunky as sin, you will often get oneshotted by like the least damaging gun in the world, just an example and aiming down the rifles' sights is so unnatural and mechanical, and i could keep on for hours staight. Let's talk about updates : each update that Volvo releases fixes things that no one cares about or even breaks the existing strenghts of the game... Yes, that's confirmed, Volvo puts a lot of effort on their most succesful and well-known titles (and with success i have to admit), but from what i experienced they give ♥♥♥♥ about less played titles, even the ones that had pretty good predecessor (just like the first DoD which is probably better than Source).  To conclude this review, i can say that this franchise had an unexpected and most importantly undeserved finish, and unless you are willing to pay money for even the lowest tier titles, for God's sake, don't buy this unless you find this on sale but take a look at the first DoD, which in my and most of people's opinion is far better, balanced and fun than THIS.   -13492490890325/10 IGN Volvo pls fix asap",

Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.  In it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.  Out of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account. I am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.  I have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.  If you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.

I do miss being able to play as the British from the HL1 mod, and a lot of the weapons are absent like the M1 carbine, the M3 grease gun, the FG 42, K43, Lee Enfield, and the Bren gun, and the Source version doesn't have quite as many maps from what I remember. I do like the alt-fire modes on many of the weapons, and the weapons feel nice and punchy like I remember, but compared to some more modern trappings, if you're looking for more realistic weapon behaviour and functionality like in Red Orchestra you may be left wanting.   Ultimately, it's still a fun nostalgic romp from a time where you'd be surprised at what you remember if you used to be a player, but you'll also be reminded why a lot of modern FPS innovations are taken for granted these days. End up on a server against people who haven't stopped playing since this game came out and you'll probably remember why you stopped playing in the first place.",

I lost a lot of friends today from German MG fire, we burried their bodies and carried on.   Page two: October 9, 1944 We liberated the a French town last week, after being dropped in by plane. The French people were nice, they gave us food water and shelter after we liberated them. It was a good week, not to many casulties.   Page three: January 2, 1944 The Germans were trying to take back the French town, It was the middle of winter too. We tried to hold them off, but the our moral was low, we were outnumbered, and sickness was spreading. They had us pinned with a MG and sniper, we couldn't move up. We pulled out of the town after our casulties were to high.   Page four: January 5, 1944 We were able to take back the town, but at high casulties. We destroyed one of their Tiger tanks and captured one of their AA guns. But at high costs, we lost 10 soldiers for every 8 Germans we killed, and we lost one of our M4 Sherman tanks.   Page five: July 1, 1944 We took another town from the Germans, I saw my good friend Jonathan take a German grenade to the face. But he was still alive, bleeding out. He died shortly after... They knew we were coming, that's when we realised we had Spies and traitors in our uniform. After the battle we sang 'When Johnny comes marching home again', and executed the prisoners.   Page six: July 7, 1944 We took the train station leading to the Berlin, we took almost no casulties in the battle. But the Germans luanched a massive counter-attack. They destroyed what little defences we had, so we pulled out.   Page seven: September 5, 1944 Our unit became airbourne again and was flying over the city of Paris, to liberate France once and for all. I was on MG duty, those things are damn heavy. I set up shop in a window, and cleared a path for our boys. But the Germans had two MGs and a highly trained sniper on the other side of the gate, our boys couldn't get though. We fought all day until nightfall, then the remains of the 112th Airbourne Division went into hiding...   Page eight (ZERO HOUR): It's only four of us now, everyone else is dead or turned. The dead are rising from their graves, and they crave flesh. We found a radio, and some weapons 'N' ammo. The voice on the radio said they will have a EVAC ready at dawn, If we survive...   Page nine (Finale): We did it, we survived until the break of dawn. The EVAC arrived and they're bombing the city now, I heard that we're being shiped back home now...

There are little bad aspects to point in this game, because it is in fact a game that all gamers at a point should try out. Also, and I have to point this, the price is very cheap compared to today's games wich is another tipical caracteristic from Valve.",

            "review_text": "Day of Defeat Source is an official sequel to Day of Defeat mod for Half-Life. It's a WW2 based multiplayer competive team-based FPS with classes. And aiming and headshots and dieing as you are peaking the corner from one bullet.  Multiplayer community is still alive. You will find at least few full servers that play same popular maps 24/7.  If to say about it short, then imagine Counter-Strike, but more balanced, with classes, more fun and without having to wait until the end of a round. In WW2 setting. And amazingly enough, it has interesting non-symmetrical maps, which is quite a rarity. Not sure if it's as balanced for both sides, but it makes it much more interesting to play with both teams. More team games should do this.  And yea, it has system where you lose energy if you sprint of jump, so if you plan on getting somewhere far away as fast as you can, just walk there, losing energy gives a huge temporary penalty on your speed. You also can run, walk, crouch or go prone, all will decide what kind of accuaricy you will have. Actually camping is a legit tactic there. But watch out, shootign gives you away, with all the muzzle fire effect and big light they give off, so don't expect to camp for too long, relocate. Or push. With teammates.  And it has two modes: 5 control points and detonation. Not much should be told about control points, though the last ones tend to be won by a sneaky person, tend to be too close to the enemy spawnpoint to really push with whole force. And I never got to play detonation maps, not popular enough, sorry.  So, what Source improved over original? Well, you guessed it, the most important change is the inclusion of ragdolls! Well, fine, not important, still nice. Graphics look more clean, less muddy.  They did some good work on class system, streamlining them and making them all more or less unique. In original, each side had 9 classes with seemingly random equipment, and there could be big difference between each side. In Source there are only 6 classes now, balanced and each made to have something that others don't have. Even better is that you can tell away what you are fighting against.  Anyway, let's get to it: - Rifleman are made for fighting at medium and far ranges. And short ranges. Can kill with a single bullet, but they don't shoot fast and their accuaricy is too lacking on the move. They are support to the main force, as well as sniping. Not going to do good at the very front of a force. They can now aim down iron sight, but seeing how they are accurate when standing and aiming down iron sight makes you crawl like turret, it's kinda useless. Can also shoot grenade out onto quite far distances.  - Assault classes are good only at close range and only if you are moving, otherwise you may use Support instead. Recoil and accuaricy losses on his main gun is minimal, it's just that it's not accurate to begin with. Has grenades. And importanly, has smoke grenades, that he can either use for himself, to get into smoke and use his close-range gun at advantage. Or he can use it to team, for tactics, like covering place which is dominated by enemy machine gunners.  - Support class is actually the main class around there. His automatic gun is kinda average, for medium ranges. Have to learn to aim with this one. Can shoot one bullet at a time in alternative mode. Also has grenades. Has pistol.  - Snipers are like rifleman but with sniping scope that makes them accurate. But without grenade-shooting. No, you still don't camp, machine gunners do better job than you. And rifleman do better job at you. You should be at far away but still moving and starfing a lot. Switching to scope mode is instant and accurate fully even when you are standing, so use it to full advantage.  - Machine gunners are the people who defend and clean streets and open spaces until there is nothing left inside. Can defend rooms too, but that asks for a nade. And can do better job than camping snipers. They really kill anything at any range, you have to know where they are and to come out from unexpected angle. Good thing there is a limit on them. You have to go prone to set up machine gun, but you can use any ledge you find as well. At least they can't shoot much while undeployed at least, the recoil and accuaricy loss are gigantic. There are however some players who use while travelling through small rooms, when you can just 'shotgun' anybody, having learnt to compensate recoil. But at least there arent many of such players. Also have pistols.  - Rocket class has rocket launcher and autoatic little weapons. In original they were just there to have 'random' selection to troll you, being useless, only there to blow some objectives in very few maps, I heard. In Source, the explosion of bazooka was buffed up, having bigger radius. It's actually good at taking out machine gunner spots. Some of them. the thing is, you have to put them over shoulder to shoot and that makes you crawl, so it's still kinda weird support class. But hey, at least they have automatic gun as backup weapon, not pistol. Those are actually good. So yay source!  So yea. Still addictive, still campish. Still good. Or better. It's more streamlined and feels more sane in balance for sure.",

I'd call it Semi-Realistic as there are some things you can do which really kill the realism vibe it tries to pull off. But hey it's a valve game, when was true realism ever a thing?  I picked up DoD:S primarily because the reviews made by other users said the game was still very active.. I'm proud to say it's true, and this games population is still very vibrant and alive. When I first booted up the game I saw 12 servers full with 32/32 players and many more nearing full capacity which isn't something you'd expect from such an old game.  Gameplay wise, if your someone like myself who played Medal Of Honor Allied Assault on the Gamespy multiplayer servers when you were young, then you will definatly find that feeling when playing this game. I'd call it a cross between the original Medal of Honor games and call of duty 2-3.  The first community server I joined was 24/7 SnowBridge and they set a high example of the kindness and compeitive nature you can expect from this games community.  Big +1 for DoD:S highly recommended.  I'm always accepting friend requests from players who play or plan on playing DoD:S regularly.",

By sticking to its roots in the original DoD, it remains an entertaining game while also providing us with a nostalgic feeling. As a piece of art, DoD puts out all of the stops in its design. The weapons look pristine but follow Valve's usual FPS rules, allowing for great gameplay akin to the Counter Strike series.",

The gameplay varies significantly between classes, for instance the rifle and sniper classes are more for long rang combat (which is not common in the urban style maps the game features, but can sometimes be found in alley ways for instance the 'tank alley') while the Assualt and support classes offer a more action packed hand to hand combat expeirnce type of gameplay.

The game is meant to be mainly for TEAMplaying but if you are playing solo you won't see that much of a TEAMplay. TEAMplay in DoD:S is simple - there is one flag that requires 2 people to capture it. And 2 ppl go there. Simple as that. You can't play as Machinegunner or Sniper if you have bad pc, because if you are not fast - your bread is eaten. That's some life advise for you actually. In my reviews i mostly mention Sniping/Machingunning. I don't know why, i play like 2 mins on those classes in class based types of games (except of TF2, sniper is 22 hrs of gameplay). Killing in this game is satisfying af if enemy team has a noob machinegunner or pro sniper. Those types of people kill you like 5 secs after you respawn. So if you killed a guy who was prone with no ammo and he was AFK - you are lucky. Gameplay part is simple - every team is balanced (by valve logic) and have fun.  9/10 as a game 9.2/10 as valve game (it's better mp shooter than every that there is because of unique for the game mechanics)",

What did change down the years was that I started to mainly play the 'gun games' version, where you basically start with a 'level 1' gun and work your way up via kills, first to get to final weapon (knife) and kill is winner, basically. Much fun.  The graphics were never 'top notch' but the thing with that is the maps can range greatly, especially with the very simplistic 'lego' kinda look many (custom) maps use. Still frustrating at times mind, especially compared to the original (non-Source) when 'kill-shots' seemed to be a lot less 'random', but that's maybe just me being crap at it despite the time spent on it - but I do prefer dying 3 times if it means I get to clout you over the head with a spade, most enjoyable.",
