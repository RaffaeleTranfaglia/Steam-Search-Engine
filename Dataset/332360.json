            "review_text": "READ BEFORE BUYING AFTER MY POSITIVE REVIEW!!!  Okay, lets start by telling that Spriter Pro is a nice program that allows you to make your animations that you can import into various engines (including Unity3D, which is why I bought it myself). It takes a bit to get used to Spriter Pro, and before you know what bugs and glitches are there and how to work around them. But the result are smoot animations for your game engine.  Bugs/glitches I have found:     The program is full of shortkeys you can use (CTRL-C / CTRL-V to copy/paste just to name one), but they do not work. Instead you have to use the program's pulldown menu.   *SOLVED*  after an update     Duplicating bones is not possible. This means you have to create each and every bone before you place them to the right position. This means that for a spider you have to make 16 bones instead of 2 and duplicate them 8 times.   *SOLVED*      Speaking of bones, the moment you have linked a sprite to a bone, you can not remove this link to correct the bone position. Whatever you do with the bone (resizing, moving or rotating) happens to the sprite. Oddly enough, you can move the sprite without influencing the bone. The work around I have found for this is move the sprite to an other bone and then modify the bone as I wish.   *SOLVED*      So far I haven't found an option to 'lock' a part of my animation in place while the rest of the animation flows. You have to set that same animation again on the spot where you want to add other animation options. As mentioned above, copy/pase is not working here, so it's manual labour.   *SOLVED*     From time to time when you're working on your bones, sprites and bones just glitch away from the hierarchy. You have to click around on random parts to get them back.  According to author I'm the only one with this problem    As said, I like the program, and knowing these bugs/glitches it can be a very good tool. Honestly, I don't think it's worth the full price asked on Steam right now and I'm glad I bought it during the Steam winter sale.",

            "review_text": "I am by no means a professional artist/designer/anything in particular, and in the past have only used design software as a hobby. I have no real technical knowledge, and have only dubiously poked at animation software/sprite design in the past. For this reason I can only review this as a casual user, and can't speak for anyone representing large game projects.  Despite being a newbie in regards to this, it must be said that this software is excellent - it is fairly intuitive to use (granted, I still have a lot to learn), and there are countless tutorials available that are relatively simple to follow. It's been great to have the freedom to import sprite puppets from external software (in my case, opencanvas), and thus far it's been quite enjoyable to bring concept characters to life.  This software is fun, I heartily recommend it for anyone wanting to dabble in it as a hobby, too.",

If you are familiar with Flash Pro, then you should have no problem using the timeline interface. Bones were particularly helpful with my animations, especially for animating my realistic cockroaches for Conk The Roach!  Cons? I'd prefer officially supplied class libraries, rather than community-provided APIs, just to insure the latest features are available. Otherwise, the tool works great.  I might provide a more detailed review later.",

However, one suggestion i have for this fine tool. I would like to see a layertab in the toolset where you could arrange your spirtes more easier and a hide function, when a sprite is covered from an other. This would make the work less complicated.",
