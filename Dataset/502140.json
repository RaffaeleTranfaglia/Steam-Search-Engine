(Also, this is me writing a review before getting on the ship) Pros: - Love the soundtrack - Addictive at fighting enemies (Well isn't that for every rpg?) - Many places to go too - It's an rpg - Easy Grind - Other things... Cons: - Hard to follow quest (Maybe add a quest section in the menu or the hud?) - (From what I've seen) The fishing is fun, but I've only seen fish that give you potions, worms, and the monster battle (Jelly Fish). If it's only those things you can fish, could you add more. (This is from what I'VE seen so far, so tell me if there is more to fish). - This is annoying sometimes but not always, the encountering system. Sometimes I would encounter an enemy, kill it and encounter another one a not even a second later and sometimes a second later. (This isn't always happening) Other: - Did you remove the Lamia fight? That was my grind man. Conclusion: Love the game, it's fun, but it could have more improvements for the future. But that's not stoping me from playing it, it's still a very fun game nevertheless.",
