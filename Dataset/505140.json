            "review_text": "I can't really recommend this game.  I admit, I haven't played it for the 15 hours or whatever is the accepted standard around here for a review to be credible, but it is my opinion that first impressions are everything. And my first impression with this game is not good.  You control a tribe of stone-age villagers and take care of them, building shelter, collecting resources like wood, furs, and food, have them make tools and weapons to defend themselves from neighboring tribes and make their lives easier, etc.  The premise is good, where it falls apart is the execution. I'll confess, the whole time I've been playing the game, I was thinking to myself 'This is essentially Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld, but with far less variety in things to do.' And that's what this game is to me, more simplistic Dwarf Fortress, or Gnomoria, or Towns, or Stonehearth, or whatever village-simulator game you play.  The graphics for this game are, to put it simply, terrible. 2d sprites that bounce around the screen and bounce off each other to simulate fighting. And yes, I play Dwarf Fortress, which has NO graphics to speak of, but in my opinion that allows one's imagination to fill in the gaps, whereas this half-hearted attempt at graphics is depressing, everything is either a dull shade of green, or blue for water.  The UI is a lot like Gnomoria or Towns, which aren't very good as far as user interfaces go anyway, not much to say there except theres a lot of digging through menus to get to the thing you want to do.  The pace of the game is very slow, and villagers never seem to get around to doing something that you want done quickly. There doesn't seem to be a 'priority' system in place, and your food will sit on the ground rotting whilst your villagers shamble over and collect that 500th piece of long grass that just HAS to get collected now.  Combat in the game is very simple, make sure your villagers have stone spears (more menu digging to make sure of that!) and then enter combat mode, right click on target, and they go and kill it. Your villagers don't typically lose to animals, especially if they team up on them, but the animals seem wildly aggressive, how often do you think a giant sloth goes sprinting into your camp attempting to murder everyone? Yes, giant sloth, sprinting, you read that correctly.   The TL;DR version: save your money. Dwarf Fortress is way more in-depth, has graphics packs that look way better than this game, and is completely free. This is a knock-off that dares to charge 9 dollars for the 'privelege.'",
