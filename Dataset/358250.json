            "review_text": "This is one of the most Bright, Cute &amp; Colorful Toned MS-DOS that Apogee Software has made in 1992 which is aimed at Young Audiences. I played the Shareware Version when I was a child and it was very enjoyable to play the First Episode, as for the Registered Version, it's still fun to play but challenging when you reach Episodes 2-3.  As for the Storyline, it's really Simple for Kids &amp; Adults for all ages: Tomorrow is Cosmo's birthday and the one thing he wants for his birthday is to go to Disneyworld on Earth. However, Cosmo's Parents didn't notice a comet crash into their ship forcing them to take an emergency landing on an uncharted world. While Cosmo's dad begins the repairs, Cosmo goes off to explore and play but returns to find that his parents are missing. It's up to Cosmo to rescue his parents from who or whatever it is that kidnapped them.",
