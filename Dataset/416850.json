            "review_text": "PROS:  - Easy to pickup and play - Interesting weapon and ship combos - Cheap while still being able to prove a solid game - Local-coop - Decent amount of maps  CONS: - No custom keybindings - No online multiplayer - Maps are very similar - Lack of bots or training dummies so you can at least do something by yourself.  You pretty much get what you would expect for two dollars, a quick and fun game that obviously didn't have a ton of money put into it but is still a good game. I would like to see it expanded upon, add more maps that differ from the current 'Don't hit the white space.' Online multiplayer would be nice, no matchmaking or anything like that, just the ability to invite your friends. The lack of options and no custom keybindings is basically the only major problem with the game, the key layout isn't good.",
