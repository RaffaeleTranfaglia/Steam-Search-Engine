Story was well done and weapons, enviroments and sound effects were top notch. It still remains one of my favourite games to date and set the bar really high for FPS games to follow which in my opinion have failed to do.",

Although who cares about how the levels look when the gameplay is so solid. I just played this game now in 2015 and it's still an awesome game. My one complaint with this game is even on the hardest difficulty it is still a bit too easy. The reason people love or hate this game is because its focus is the same gameplay over and over in different variations so if you don't like the shooting mechanic you will pretty much hate the whole game.",

Flanking, real time stratagy and tactical choices by the Replica's really make the First Person Shooter aspect original and unique even today. The story is simply fantastic and completely original, theres really nothing quite like it. As for the Horror aspect, well not even the original Dead Space game ever make scare me as badly, and may or may not have made me ♥♥♥♥ my pants a little as this game. Ladders man.

            "review_text": "My first experience with FEAR was way back in 2007. It was my friend, who iintroduced me to this classic. He bought it as a bundle with his new PS3. He said the reason he picked it up was beecause the cover looks cool, and it looks like 'some fun action FPS game where he can turn his brain off and relax'. until that is he played it and some quite creepy stuffs happening at first 30 minutes, looked back to the box art and realized there is a ghostly figure on top. and be like 'Well, damn, I guess I'm going to invite my friends, we're in for a thriling ride'.  And well, there I was, with 3 others, playing this game regularly on weekend, and I must say it was one of the most memorable and 'fun' game I've ever played, all the screams, pauses, controller-dropping, and 'taking-a-fresh-air' moments definitely leave a mark.  Now, 9 years later, revisiting the game. I'm surprised that F.E.A.R still managed to surprise me, not just with the horror part, but also the fact that it aged really well. It is still one of the scariest game ever, and the tightest, most solid shooting mechanic. And uh.. I'm out of introductory words, and it becomes quite lengthly at this point, so let's jump in.   Story (9/10)   The story follows F.E.A.R, a special force, countering supernatural activity. In this operation, you are the Point Man, tasked to neutralize a psychic commander and his army who is gone rogue. Well, that's it. That's the main plot throughout the entire game, and it remained it focus until the end. It's as simple as other action FPS, it doesn't try to be all grandiose, dramtic, and stuff, and that makes FEAR have a tight grip on it's story, focused, and well paced, carefully building up tension so it can reach a maximum impact at the end/    Gameplay (9.5/10)   A perfect blend between psychological horror, heavily influenced by Japanese horrors (or eastern horror in general). relying on disturbing imaginery and constant feel of uneasiness, and a really satisfying and tight shooting mechanic / action sequence, that combined with a REALLY intellegent A.I which will make combat feels more intense, tactical, and 'epic' battles. The guns is your standard old school FPS arsenal: One type of handgun, shotgun, rifle SMG, and some unique weapons. I particularly like The Penetrator, because reasons. Oh, and how can we forget SloMow / Reflex? One word. Badass. It's not just a gimmick. it's an esssential feature, the fast paced action sequence, mixed with numbers of enemies and level design that put you on disadvantage at later stages, you'll find yourself on situations where you just have to go out of your cover and bicycle kick those fellas and blast the other ones' head with a shotgun afterward,    Sound (9/10)   Great voice acting, awesome soundtrack, and overall great sound design. Now, why I rate it so high despite my very minimal explanation? Because it's all comes down to this..   Graphic (9.5/10)   If you feel like I left out many things on previous aspects, you are right, I do. Because everything comes down to this. Graphic, or more precisely atmosphere, this is what ties all aspects of FEAR together, the thing that makes it regarded as a classic. The atmosphere on FEAR is pitch perfect. Story, gameplay, sound, level design, all of it is build around atmosphere. And until this day, it's atmosphere is the one that makes it holds up even after 11 years. I will break down several aspect of it: - ]Visual: The lighting was (and is) fantastic, great contrast between light and dark. The lighting alone is pretty unsettling, and with it's attenttion of detail and well thought out level design make even a well lit and neat offices doesn't feel less disturbing than it's more messed up counterpart. And then we have the hallucination, which is simply mind♥♥♥♥ery and downright mental. Also, F.E.A.R might have what I like to call 'Half Life-tier level transition', it's varied, smooth, and feelss natural. It also has a very nice stylized gore and slow-mo effects, it makes shooting someone with a shotgun in the head more satisfying (especially with the guns recoil, and sounds, make the weapons deliver a real punch when it hits)  - Sound: Cracking walls, child's laugher, rattling metal, and any sound effeccts that will plays out in the right place and time, that makes you question your sanity. Oh, can you guess how many times I got a mini heart attack when I accidentally kicking a soda can? It's 4. I counted.   - Story: As you progress through, you'll find voice mails and intels scattered around ATC, and this is why I score the story highly. It's immersive, they told you only what you need to know at the moment, progressively revealing darker and more disturbing side of the story, as you moved to the core of Armacham.    Overall (9.5/10)    FEAR and it's classic status is well deserved. A game that so ahead at it's time. A horror game that will send chill down your spine, that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares (I don't say there are none, it has it's moment of course, even that is quite clever), an action FPS game that make your adrenaline rushing, and a tactical game that actually demand you to think and plan before you drop your first bullet. A seemingly linear game by design, but it actually encourage some exploration to get some boosters (HP and reflex) and tactical advantage over enemies. Overall a timeless classic that even it's sequel fails to emulate.   Short DLC Review:    Extraction Point (8/10): - Story: 'I know, it doesn't make sense. Not much does anymore.' - Paxton Fettel. - Gameplay: Same, fun gunfight, more gory, and more mental hallucination, especially the fifth interval, oh God the fifth interval. The new weapons are cool. Less explorable maps, and mostly a rearranged version of the first half maps of the base game.  Perseus Mandate (6.5/10) Uninspired. Could've been a really interesting side story, if it wasn't for the bland writing Why do it feels like I'm going through the last few intervals of the base game and the first few areas of Extraction Point again?",

            "review_text": "F.E.A.R. or First Encounter Assault Recon, is a psychological horror first person shooter, amazingly well designed and one of the few games that always made me feel uneasy while playing it. This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it.   You play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created.   The story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable.  F.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more.   Alma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself.   The game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart.  F.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget.  The Good  -Creepy Atmosphere -Amazing story -Visuals, Sound and Particle system -Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games -Enemy AI is brilliant -Good selection of weapons  The Bad  -Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing -Could have used a little more variety in the environments  9.5/10",

            "review_text": "***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2005... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*  At first glance, F.E.A.R may seem like any other FPS with features that have 'been done'. Well its based on a modified Quake engine, 'can't possibly be any better'. 'Nothing will be as creepy as Doom'. 'Bullet time, pfft…what is this Max Payne?'   Sure at first glance F.E.A.R has everything any other FPS has to offer; . F.E.A.R - First Encounter Assault Recon a secret military agency which you can probably guess by its name was assembled to deal with unexplained phenomenon situations.   It is extremely difficult not to spoil this game by describing the plot outline. The opening cutscene explains the game’s antagonist, Paxton Fettel loses his mind and takes control of hundreds of military cloned soldiers. (Why are they cloned? I have no idea). Fettel and his army of cloned soldiers go on a rampage through a small town killing dosens of civilians and seem to be looking for someone or something. Of course it is up to you, the player, to search the city, wipe out the cloned army and stop Fettel.   The kick to the story is sometimes Fettel will be talking to you from a ghostly apparition. He will appear suddenly at the end of the hallway, but disappear as soon as you turn the corner; there is also some strange connection between a small child in a red dress, creeping you out by appearing and disappearing in the strangest places while laughter and crying fills your ears.   The best feature of F.E.A.R is the weapon control and gameplay. Most FPS have a variety of weapons you can lug around throughout the game but usually do not distinguish recoil, change in ammo or a feel for power and weight. F.E.A.R's engine allows the player to feel all these features on every weapon. A simple right click on the mouse will allow the player to aim the weapon (much like Call of Duty) and at the same time change the speed of the character to a slow walk, becoming a silence killer. When an assault gun is fired, the recoil is felt, obviously not through the mouse, but on screen; the bullets penetrating plaster walls, wooden boxes, paper, fiberglass, tile ceiling, glass windows creating a cloud of dust and debris right in your face.  Among the series of weapons you can find during the course of the game including several assault weapons, dueling handguns, a nail gun, shotgun, rocket launcher and some sort of laser rifle, all carry very unique firing recoils and bullet wounds effects to your enemy. You cannot keep picking up weapon after weapon and continue your away through the game. F.E.A.R only allows three, including your handguns if you choose to carry them (I don't :)). You also carry along a series of grenades which all seem to come in handy at one point or another. A standard HE grenade, a proximity grenade and a very cool remote grenade. Use them wisely, they are scarce. If all these weapons and grenades weren't a lot to choose from, you are given the option of hand to hand combat. Whether it is the simple melee with your rifle, slide kick, punch or jump kick you can kick the crap out of your enemy instead of riddling them with bullets. However, be prepared to face well armored opponents who will not flinch to a weak kick to the face. I got a little jump kick happy and found myself falling out of a 50 story building because I thought I was jumping into the next office. Oops.   Aside from this enormous improvement in weapon control, F.E.A.R also gives the ability to the player to slow down time. Yes this is a beaten to death feature and can be seen in Max Payne 1 and 2 and The Matrix series, but when you combine the previous feature with slowing down time, you can almost see every single dust particle rendered by your video card. Also be very prepared when you use the time button and place your shotgun an inch away from your enemy for a giant red cloud of…well you know.   To go along with bullet time, F.E.A.R carries a great soundtrack with most impressive sound effects. How about hearing every single shell that hits the ground when you're firing your assault rifle while at the same time hearing the bullets pierce your enemy and the wall? Well that is exactly what you hear… but don't be freaked out by the whispers coming from the dark hallway when your flashlight goes dead and your radio hits a wave of static and your turn around to see a child crawling on the floor towards you.  The AI in F.E.A.R is not bad. Enemies will react to certain situations which I was very impressed with. If you throw a grenade, one of the enemies will call out. 'Oh ♥♥♥♥ grenade.' And the team will scatter. Same situation if an enemy throws a grenade, the rest of the team will prepare for a 'fire in the hole'. Also if they hear you running down the hall, they will turn towards the sound of your footsteps, but you can just as easily walk in a different direction, sneak up behind them and see them all staring at the original spot they heard you from.   The cons? Well there isn't much, but one thing is for sure, you better have AT LEAST an X800 to run this game on high. I've said this before about Doom 3 and HL2, if you're playing these games on low or medium quality; you are not getting much out of these games compared to what you see with a top of the line card, especially if you are turning off shadows. F.E.A.R is a CPU, memory and graphics HOG will truly test your system.  Bottom Line: F.E.A.R is quite easily one of the most unique, freaky, best looking games to date. With a combination of today's horror qualities most resembling the Ring, graphics that utilize today's best graphics cards and the best use of gameplay in FPS, F.E.A.R will fit in your collection with ease. I wish the surrounding environment changed more throughout the game like HL2; changing the time of day, or setting instead of the same warehouse, office building, sewer maps that even still look the same, but I hardly notice when I'm trying to figure out where those whispers are coming from.",

Using its Advanced engine to thrill its audience, liturally Hold them in suspense, forcing players to peak around corners when unsure what was beyond. This game spans so far 2 sequals plus the expansions included with this game. The Developers for F.E.A.R what they need to do, is Remake it using F.E.A.R as its center piece Using instead of a 2005 engine throw in the latest to date as software can go, because this game itself is a master piece.

I've replayed it a couple of times and it's best played on a higher difficulty in my opinion.  Pros    Fun gunplay, the bullets have real weight.    The enviroment is full of bits and bobs that move around so an intense firefight will feel that more awesome because of it.    The sound design is incredible and always make you feel on edge even when there isn't happening anything.    Very advanced AI that flank you, throw large objects around as cover and have a very large vocabulary to always shout and tell eachother where you're hidding or if you're about to shoot or are aiming towards one of their team mates.    The atmosphere is very good in all the various areas you go to throughout the game.  Cons    The game isn't very scary, even on my first time playing the game i wasn't ever really scared.    The shooting in slowmotion can sometime feel a little finiky.    The AI are very predictable and you can in certain circumstances force bigger enemies to become stuck making the fights too easy.    The slowmotion makes you about twice as fast as the enemies, this is a little too powerful and does allow you to clear several areas in the game without being hit a single time.   As a small disclaimer I never really become scared of any horror game so you might find this game super scary. Definitely recommend that you pick up F.E.A.R if you're ever looking for an awesome fps.",

            "review_text": "When I first rented Monolith Productions’ F.E.A.R. on Xbox 360 back in 2007, I was very impressed with the singleplayer campaign. Despite not being able to complete F.E.A.R. before I had to return it to the video store, it left a lasting impression on me and I considered it a modern classic. The recent inclusion of the game as part of the Humble WB Bundle provided the perfect opportunity to re-experience the game and see if my initial impression of it holds to my more refined standards of today.   One element of F.E.A.R. that impresses more than even most newly released games is its beautiful visual effects and physics. Just about everything smaller than entire desks and tables, from office telephones and spinning desk chairs, to paintings on the walls, are physics based. Occasionally, this causes some issues (most of which exist in all games with lots of physics-based objects) such as corpses becoming embedded in walls and floors or clutter bouncing around when they should not, but for the most part lends itself greatly to the experience. It can be terrifying when you are walking down a dark hallway, trying to sneak up on an enemy, when you accidentally walk over a soda can, kicking it down the hall with a silence-breaking twang. The first time you enter a large firefight, enable SloMo, and begin exchanging fire with the Replica soldiers is breathtaking: dust fills the air as bullets impact nearby walls, creating actual holes in the walls rather than just placing a decal; stray bullets knock boxes of papers and electronics off shelves, breaking them; a grenade goes off nearby, knocking the hanging lights around, the game’s marvelous dynamic lighting and shadows changing the entire look of the battlefield; and the opposing forces’ soldiers react realistically, with custom animations dependent on where they are hit that are integrated well with ragdoll physics. Another soldier, panicking, runs away but stumbles and falls over while he attempts to call squad for backup. While these sorts of features are not a new creation for F.E.A.R., they are all used extremely effectively together to create impressive and satisfying scenes that leave a lasting impression, defining F.E.A.R. and setting it apart from other games in people’s minds.  While F.E.A.R. manages to wow with its impressive physics, lighting, and effects; intense soundtrack and Japanese-horror inspired ambience; and solid gunplay and fair difficulty, F.E.A.R. is not a perfect game and many of its elements and tropes undermine the level of immersion needed to truly be disturbed by a horror game. There are a significant amount of attempted jump scares that are ineffective and cheap feeling. The enemies, unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, lack the power to instill a fear of death in you. Because of this playing on the hardest difficulty is an absolute must, even on a first playthrough. The highest difficulty is the only one that has fair and interesting feelings gunplay, since on lower difficulties enemies are just too weak and easy to kill. The improved gunplay and stronger enemies add both enjoyable skill-based gameplay and intense ambience that greatly improves the overall feel of the game.  Overall, F.E.A.R. is an overall great game that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys first person games. Despite its age, it is of much higher quality than much newer first person and horror games. F.E.A.R. is a classic that everyone should experience as an important part of the history of modern gaming, regardless of your interest in the genres.",

The enemy AI in particular was rather challenging at times which is excellent, definately better AI than some of the newer games, including F.E.A.R 2 and F3AR. Obviously being an older game means the graphics are a bit dated but when maxed out they are comparable to some of the cheaper or F2P games on steam. This is also be a good thing for people that don't have amazing PC specs or are laptop users as pretty much any modern machine from 2010 or later can play this game on medium graphics (some higher intergrated GPUs such as the Intel HD 4000 or the AMD hd 6550d can max out the settings on this game).  This game does have some basic jumpscares (it is called FEAR for a reason after all) so be wary about buying this game if you are prone to easily getting scared, however most people should have no problem playing this.  I recommend this game to users who are looking for a fun game packed with action. The game itself is fairly cheap already at £6.99 but I often see it at £3.49 ( sometimes less) during the sales. F.E.A.R is one game definately worth picking up.",

You take the role of First Encounter Assault Recon's Pointman where the mission is to kill a man named Paxton Fettel. The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman.   There are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use 'bullet-time' that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties.   The biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.  Amazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game. It even comes with both expansion packs.",

I played this game way back in 2005 when it was first released, and I had an absolute blast playing though it again. It has a nice mixture of fast paced game play with some horror tossed in it. And it’s not cheesy 'American horror' either. None of those lame sudden movements or gore that tries to gross you out. The game's horror was heavily influenced by Japanese horror movies, like the original 'Ring.' F.E.A.R. does an excellent job in making you wonder about what is going on all while keeping you on your toes as you progress through the story.   The game is a visual treat as well. F.E.A.R, being a game that first came out on PC back in 2005, has definitely aged but it has aged well. Some parts of the game just look fantastic. The designers have done an excellent job of using the lighting to their advantage. The shadows and overall dark environments of the game help to enhance the atmosphere. Even the small things, such as lights flickering, lights of a phone that has a voicemail on it, and empty offices where the only light source is a computer monitor just help to make it that much creepier. You’ll find yourself constantly using your flashlight, and dread walking through long dark hallways.   I highly recommend this game, even if you're not a big fan of first person shooters. It’s definitely a must buy if you don’t have it already, and a great game to add to your collection. It goes on sale constantly on Steam, so don’t hesitate to pick it up if you’re interested. F.E.A.R. 2 was also a pretty great game. I personally liked it a lot, but I found the first one to be a bit better. The expansion packs for the first game were just pretty average. I have not played F.E.A.R. 3, but I’ve heard that it’s the least well received of the trilogy.   You’ll be perfectly fine with just the original F.E.A.R.  ",

Maybe im just a cold human being or mildly psychotic even but nothing in the main game honestly bothered me much, there was one or two jump scarish things that i guess got me but it was mostly just the Metroid Prime room to room feeling that put you any form of edge. Hell i found myself laughing at the game than being scared simply due to the physics and the the ability to pin 'Test Tube ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s' to walls. So far havent quite finished Extraction yet (adendum) but so far Extraction has some honestly scary ♥♥♥♥ comparably, made me question progression or even how to move on.

There is a noticeable squareness to the environments but this feels more like deliberate art direction than a limitation of 8 year old technology. There is a beautiful simplicity to the gameplay too - compared to a modern game such as Far Cry 3, this is a tightly-focused stripped-down elegant shooter where the only thing that matters is blowing bad guys away. While the environments are fairly linear, this fits well with the horror theme. Like the classic bad dream, your only option is to walk through the door at the end of the corridor even though you know you aren't going to like what you find there. The story is so-so but largely superfluous. The environment builds tension on it's own. The horror is less the visceral in-your-face variety of, say, Bioshock, more the subtle psychological horror of Silent Hill. Instead of chainsaw-wielding maniacs leaping out of cupboards at you, there are flickering lights, unexplained footsteps and phantom photocopiers. After a long session with FEAR I really had to concentrate to relax the knots that had formed in my shoulders. This game is an absolute classic. Buy it!",

Pretty solid 5 hours for an expansion.   Something I forgot to mention in the original review. The game runs fine at max settings at 60fps. For some reason, after some time playing, FPS drops to around 54fps. Quiting the game and restarting fixes it. Pretty weird. Happens in both the main game Extraction Point.  EDIT:  Busy playing Perseus Mandate and figured out that if you switch on 'Force Restart' in the display settings, it reloads the video memory with ever start of the map, which stops the FPS drops. This take about 1 second and is well worth it.  EDIT:  Finished Perseus Mandate, solid expansion. Actually pretty long considering it only took about 2 hours more to finish the base game.

The game tells the story of an anonymous operative known as Point Man, who is part of a team, called First Encounter Assault Recon, sent in to investigate the goings on at a site in the Auburn district, with reports of gunfire in the area. It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.  This isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.  There are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.  The only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it.",

Some parts legitimately scared me, and not in a cheap way like with a half-baked jumpscare. It's not in-your-face with the horror elements, which makes them that much more gripping when they do appear.  It's also an excellent example of how limitations of the time were used to invent new mechanics (especially in implementing 'horror' aspects).

            "review_text": "Take the linearity of Half-Life, but create a game that's actually fun and you have FEAR. Actually, this game is more linear than Half-Life, if that's even possible. It's entirely understandable if you grow tired of corridors and start to feel like you're just going down a conveyor belt with enemies ocassionaly popping out of the darkness in front of you. It's telling when even in a vehicle during the game's intro you're going down an incredibly narrow path whereby there's barely any space between the car and the walls. It's as if the developers refused to have any sort of open areas present in even the most sensible of places.  But linearity isn't bad. In fact, this game is a strong showcase of how linearity can be used to craft a strong single-player experience. While the corridors may make you feel constricted, at the same time they are conducive to brilliant enemy ai that knows its surroundings and moves accordingly. Linearity also allows a developer to craft an experience that ensures certain events are experienced a particular way and come about in proper order. Linear progression in level design means that you are strapped to a roller coaster and ride through all events in a manner that leaves no doubt in the creator's mind that you got the specific emotional ride he/she was looking to put you through.  The game is littered with many events where something 2spooky happens which is only possible through a constricted experience whereby the developer knows you are looking a particular way or going down a particular path. While getting the exact reaction out of you is only possible through linearity, it's a positive that quickly falls back down to neutral due to the negatives that weigh it down. You see, because all the 'scares' are crafted in a linear experience, you can often see them coming. It doesn't help that you get a little 'UNKNOWN SIGNAL' prompt at the top left of the screen whenever the little girl appears somewhere in the map trying to scare you. It aids in letting you know that an event is occuring and you might miss it, but that defeats the purpose of surprising/scaring you.  Not that the 'fear factor' in the game is that great anyway. Personally I wasn't frightened by the title, but it does do a fantastic job at crafting some good atmosphere. Remember: you don't actually have to succeed at scaring people to create an atmosphere that is eerie. Theres excellent use of lighting throughout and great pacing between the game's more hectic moments that leaves you wondering if a firefight is afoot or a 'jump scare'. Trying to create an FPS that is also horror-based is a tough balancing act, and this game pulled off that tight rope walk admirably.   It's a shame that the plot itself couldn't have more meat to it. It feels a little bare-bones, with the story feeling more like justification for the little girl character and all the creepy shenanigans. It's as if they created the game and characters first, and then realized they needed a plot to tie it together; story came towards the end of development, essentially. But something tells me they had the plot down, and then got down to level creation and just kept on creating more and more until they had to stretch the already thin plot even thinner to last through the constant stream of levels. So I guess it's excusable, if not a shame. After all, gameplay comes first, even if plot is the motivator for me to keep progressing.  All said, if you don't mind linearity and a rather simple plot it's a great experience that is held up by its atmosphere and enemy ai that is carefully balanced between eerieness and enjoyable firefights.",

But, overall, this was a fairly fun shooter.  The game is advertised as a horror shooter. Whether it's because I'm desensitized to the point where my soul is layered in titanium or not is up for question, but I've only had a couple of times where I've been uncomfortable or 'scared' of characters or environments. There is quite a bit of near-future scifi going on though, so I'm willing to forgive it for that (especially the weapons). However if there's one thing I will take away from this and honestly say that I will miss from this game it's the slowdown mechanic. Making enemies suddenly talk in deep, slow baritones and watching bullets fly matrix-style towards my face has honestly been fun, however I do feel like that I will have a hard time walking away from this game without expecting similar mechanics in other shooters only to fall flat on my face. I sincerely hope that this is a mechanic that's kept in the sequels.  Story was intriguing; it wasn't perfect, the ending wasn't as heartbreaking as it could have been, but it was fun overall.

Another nice thing is that it does not require a very powerful computer to run and it will work on Windows 8.1 perfectly so no compatibility issues. Controls are nice and tight too and fully rebindable. While it is older and has aged some, it still can look fairly good when the graphics settings are a maximum. Only thing is these days the MP no longer works, but the SP is more than worth it. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played.",

Just recently I picked up the entire collection, and have already played through F.E.A.R. 1 and its two expanion packs.   The atmosphere is probably the single best thing about this game. F.E.A.R. gets right what 2 and 3 fall short on, which is the execution of horror. You never know if the next corner you turn around is going to have medkits, enemies, or something more sinister. I loved that feeling of uncertainty, and it kept my on my toes the entire time I was playing. I felt legitimate dread a few times while playing this.   The only bad thing, in my opinion, was the repeating environment. Around a quarter through the game you're thrown into an office building, and that is where the rest of the game takes place. Close quarters combat, complete with creepy airvents and elevator shafts.   Nothing beats activating the slow-mo feature and busting through a door, slidekicking an enemy to the ground, and having just enough time to shotgun another two straight in the face.   9/10!",

            "review_text": "One of my favorite shooters of all time, and the game that desensitized me to most horror when I was a lad, FEAR is a wonderful, if not exactly groundbreaking, thriller-esque romp. The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay. The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments. There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis. Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new. The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart). The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.  Oh yeah, there's those. While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind. Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.  Which is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline. It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously. You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist. Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome. If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend.",

            "review_text": "Fear was the system hog of its time. It was also touted as one of the best FPS titles of its time. Does it hold up to both those titles today.  Well, yes and no. Yes it's one of the best FPS titles of its time (and still an impressive shooter nowadays), no it's no longer a system hog. Let's look deeper into that.  FEAR puts you in control of Point Man, the newest member of a government team meant to combat paranormal threats. You're sent out to stop a crazed cannibalistic solider who's taken telepathic command of an army of clone soldiers. Meanwhile, there's this creepy girl stalking you through the whole thing and making people explode into meat splatters with her telepathic abilities. The whole game is pretty much you tracking down the cannibal freak, killing clone soldiers, investigating the situation's backstory, and discovering all the dirty little secrets. It's a mildly intriguing story, but i'll admit it's never really hooked me. The gameplay on the other hand...  Woo boy. This game has some of the best shooting i've ever come across, even by today's standards. If you've ever watched a John Woo film, you know what you're gonna get here. the gunfights here are cinematic, frenetic, fast-paced encounters where bullets tear chunks out of concrete, glass windows are shattered, bodies fly around like ragdolls, blood splatters, smoke emanates from gun barrels, dust clouds your vision, and furniture is obliterated. Despite the near complete lack of enemy variety (they're all literally clones), the action never gets old. All this is made even better by the smart enemy AI. Clones pin you down, shout orders to their squad mates, flank you while the others keep you in cover with gunfire, throw grenades your way, jump over ledges to avoid your bullets, run away from your grenades, take defensive positions, crawl under tables for cover, notice your flashlight, and even hear your footsteps if you don't crouch. The AI here was ahead of its time and still impresses today.   The game's also pretty scary and atmospheric too. I wouldn't call it terrifyin, but I will say it managed to give me the chills and jolt me many, many times. Disturbing hallucinations, that creepy ghost girl stalking you, chilling music, and things moving on their own all work together to unsettle you whenever you're not locked in a fierce firefight with enemies.  Like I said though, the graphics have already been eclipsed tons of times in the years following this game's release. It simply isn't all that demanding anymore. On a mid-range laptop, you can easily run it at max settings with 60 frames per seconds. The visuals themselves are very sharp at max settings, but not exactly impressive. Textures are... all right. Water effects are fairly basic. The two places the graphics are still fairly impressive are in the lighting effects and, especially, the particles. Remember what I said about how the environments just come apart when you're in gunfights? Yeah, the particle effects actually add to the gameplay here and turning them down deals a serious blow to the enjoyment in my opinion.  Overall: recommended. It's a solid, exciting shooter worth your time and money. Not for the graphics enthusiasts (though the game isn't what you'd call ugly), but definitely for shooter fans and anyone who wants to see some terrific AI at work.   Pros:  Frenetic, intense, satisying combat Impressively smart AI Great music and sound effects Genuinely chilling Not hard to run nowadays  Cons: Visuals aren't all that impressive anymore   ",

On paper, I'm sure none of this would've made much sense: Let's make a high-octane action game/first-person shooter, keep it MOSTLY straight, but with a constant HINT of something altogether spookier going on, with only the occasional foray into full-blown 'horror'. And somehow STILL manage to be one of the tensest and spookiest games ever made. Loonie tunes, right? Except that they PULLED IT OFF.     It's hard to say how or why, but for some odd reason this game FEELS like a horror game almost the entire time, despite the fact of you spending the vast majority of the time running about maps shooting, well, dudes. 'Super-soldiers' they may be, but they're still relatively ordinary DUDES. But herein lies the game's genius, as you really just don't know WHEN the ♥♥♥♥ the supernatural is going to invade the otherwise relatively familiar - if admittedly still atmospheric - 'action' trappings, and temporarily turn the game into something else altogether. Then, just as suddenly as it came, the weirdness disappears for a while again and you can safely get back to shootin' bad guys (at least until the very, very end, where the horror takes more fully over). What this all means is that the game is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, and arguably all the more effective as a 'scary' game than most other horror games where you just KNOW there's gonna be some weird-♥♥♥ monster or what-not lurking just around the next corner. If you're still dubious as to how this could all possibly work...PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING THING.     Oh, and F.E.A.R. teaches you another valuable life lesson: DON'T TRUST FAT PEOPLE. The NPC in question is at least twice as evil as the character played by that Newman actor in Jurassic Park. NOTHING is what it seems in this game. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.   Verdict: 10/10.

Now that I finally scrounged up the courage to sit through the entire game, I discovered that hidden behind the 'horror' genre this game's title would imply, is a well rounded and excellent shooter game that reminds me of the good old days of PC gaming like Max Payne. So to anyone who's nervous to give this game a try, don't be! There are a few jump scares here and there, but the gameplay is just so much fun that it shouldn't really bother you.   The gameplay is pretty solid in this game. You're given a gun, some health packs, and the ability to slow down time which never gets old. The level design is pretty stale which is pretty typical due to hardware limitations at the time, so the environments can be pretty repetitive. You'll fight in warehouses, a large office building, and then more warehouses throughout the course of the short 6 hours campaign. The pacing of the game itself is appropriate as enemies will become more numerous as you move room to room and will test your abilities more and more until they introduce a new enemy type. The variety in enemy types is pretty limited though. You'll fight standard guards, some slightly more heavilty armed guards, heavies, and eventually you'll go toe to toe with some big mech-based contraptions that will take a lot of firepower to take down. But never did I feel like the game was too hard. In fact, I blew threw the game without much difficulty at all (having set the difficulty only at 'normal'). FEAR also appears to be a shooter ahead of its time, with hidden voice recordings hidden throughout the world in the form of answering machines that help create a sense of immersion in the world. Overall, the gameplay is excellent but the level design and environment can feel pretty stale even with the inclusion of nice touches like radio broadcasts and answering machines.   The story of the game takes a backseat to the gameplay, as it's incredibly simple and straight forward. You are a soldier part of a special team called 'F.E.A.R.' that is tasked with capturing some bio-terrorist that likes to eat people (something that I don't believe was ever explained). Your specific soldier appears to be special with enhanced reflexes (which explains your ability to slow down time at will during the gameplay), and you continuously throughout the duration of the game have visions of some horrible scene that presumably is from your dark secret past. In addition to these visions, you randomly see some little girl named 'Alma' that only you and this bio-terrorist guy seem to even know about. All of which is explained towards the end. The ending is definitely a cliff-hanger, making room for the inevitable sequel that is 'FEAR 2: Project Origin.' So the story is interesting, it's not fantastic, but it's interesting enough for to me to be able to remember it so I guess that's something.   The graphics are pretty damn impressive for 2006. There are dynamic lights setup in the environment that when shot will actually react realistically to the environment. There is some impressive physics work also that really shines when you're in a slow motion gunfight in a clustered room (like in the office building levels). TV's will shake on the wall, debris from the desks will fly everywhere, bullet casings will independently hit the ground randomly, and enemies and their body parts will rag doll all over the place. It's clear that the graphical limitations of the time limited the developers to some pretty boring environments, but they really made up for it with the fantastic physic effects.   Overall, the game is a ton of fun and looks great especially considering when it was made available. The story is interesting and mostly explains what's going on, although it's not fantastic as there aren't really any memorable characters other than the creepy little girl that continuously haunts you throughout the game. It's definitely worth the playthrough and I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the series.   ",

As usual, it’s hard to decide whether to recommend or not when I know others will not be as bothered by certain things as I am, but it is my review after all so here are my issues with FEAR:  1. It did not age well. The sky looks terribly flat and the level design consists mostly of gray corridors.  2. The game clearly has 2 gimmicks which it wants you to see as soon as possible: the slow-motion effect and flashy gun particle effects. That is its thing, its selling point and it’s not enough to make a whole game. The game becomes boring after a while. 3. The girl from The Ring. The story of FEAR is actually not that bad but the antagonist is clearly the little girl from The Ring horror film and, again, it feels too on the nose. 4. The gameplay is the ultimate example of a classic PC first-person shooter where you have a health bar that goes down as enemies hit you, and the enemies WILL hit you the very moment they see you from a mile away, which feels unnatural. In a shooter like this, the game becomes about the health bar management and I hate that gamy feel.   The good stuff: well, some of the jump scares are quite creative and overall the graphics are not the worst I guess.  The AI, despite the annoying super-accuracy and reflexes, is quite smart. Enemies will throw grenades at your last known position and jump over obstacles (smarter than some of the modern AI in games).  IN CONCLUSION, I bet it was cool in its day but I am getting incredibly tired of this game. And to prove that this is not just about this being an old game, I am also playing Doom 3 that was released a year earlier and it is a way more interesting game despite having many similar problems.  Update: I uninstalled the game and feel sooo much better now. I was forcing myself to give another try because it is a well-known game, but holy moly, am I happy I don't have to play that grey goo anymore.",

At first the combat was fast and intense and had a really cool slow-motion function, until I realized that the next five hours were exactly the same. The game became blisteringly boring. The horror isn't scary, the graphics are mediocre, the combat is repetative (slow-mo, shoot them all, back to real time), the story is painfully under developed with so much potential, the maps are confusing and almost maze-like, its easy with no dificulty increase. Overall I would give it a 5/10 simply because it became so repetative I just got too bored to be interested. I also want to add that I hve no idea why this game would be tagged or considered a 'horror game.' The atmosphere is non-existent, mostly due to poor lighting, there are no scary enemies or monsters. The only thing that scared me was...wait...nothing scared me. The 'horror' aspect was entirely made of jumpscare...al three or four of them. The amount of shooting the same 2 models of guys un the same corridor in the same building with the same guns for over five hours made the 'scary' parts so insignificant I can't see why they didn't just remove them. No to mention Half-Life 2 came out a year before this and is better in literally every aspect, I can't believe this game is so popular.",

It's not a bad game, I am just glad that I got it in a HumbleBundle instead of paying for it full price. I admire the effort in trying something new, instead of just going all out on a Call Of Duty clone, it's tough these days, but ultimately I feel like the game fails.

People don't like you for digging into that while still going after Fettel, and Fettel has is own 'army' that is also trying to kill you.

On the other hand, the game does do a great job of setting a dark atmosphere for the player; it's scary in the same way that Half-Life was scary.  It's also a bit repetitve - sometimes I swore I had already been through certain places more than once. This is a fairly long game these days as well, at about 10 hours to complete, so this problem can be really annoying, depending on your tolerance level.   Another MAJOR thing you should be aware of if you think about buying this game: Logitech products cause it to massively drop frame rate for no reason sometimes. This is a well-documented issue, and it does have fixes; however, with my setup, the only thing that worked was to play for about 20 minutes before the frame rate really began to degrade, then unplug the mouse and plug it back in. Only took a second to do it each time, but was mildly annoying to have to put up with.  Overall I would recommend it - just don't expect horror from this one. Expect a shooter.",

I can't recommend this game enough, especially for it's price and the fact that you also get Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Do yourself a favor and buy it, or cease oxygen intake.   12/10 would fly kick replicas again ",

            "review_text": "This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made. A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it.  But I just don't see it. I have tried to get into this game. I want to like it. But I just can't. I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it. Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing.  That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points. The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today. The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at. They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover. They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen. And the game should be played if just for this alone. (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers. When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window. I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me. It was hilariously pathetic.)  But there are also problems. There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit. Your life goes down, and that's it. So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death. Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not. Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you. That severely hurts this game. (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator. But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.)  They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic. In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second. However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine. Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before. You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like.  Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems. Disabling 'HID-Compliant Device', and in my case 'HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device' is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS. So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished.  There are other problems. The game forces 'Letterboxing' when it does cinematics. Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution. So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image. And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides.  So what about the story? Well, this was before the 'scary little girl' trope was completely overplayed. But even so, nothing in this seems to work. There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, 'spooky' scene. But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before. (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.) And to a better effect. In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago. It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist ('Bullet Time' - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well). But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough.  There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can. You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message. You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again. There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be. And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released.  The game shows its age now. But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out. F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist. They may have had a grander goal in mind for it, but they didn't put the effort in to see it through.  The game also used Gamespy for its Multi-player, which means the Multi-player aspect of the game no longer functions at all.  So, no, I can't recommend this game. I find nothing in it that makes me want to keep playing it, so I don't feel comfortable suggesting anyone else try it either.  Update: I am still trying to play through the game, and oh god, it is getting worse and worse as I play. I think I submitted this review way too early. And I will probably have to keep updating this as I play. This game is bad. Downright incompetent in many aspects. There are updates above to what I mean. But here's another: The interactivity, the phones with messages? Absolutely no thought was put into where to place these phones. Now, remember, you are hearing voice mails sent to specific people. Early in the game, the phones are actually in offices. But when you get to the office level, these phones are hanging off the walls in common areas. And the first piece of actual information you get from a phone is one hanging in a wall in an area with three desks. THIS is who you call with the important information, not a CEO, not security, but three desk jockeys sharing one phone. The game designers, and level designers, did not put any effort into this game at all.  Update 2: I have finished the game. The last couple levels were better than the rest of the game in that they had a hint of creativity to them. But only a hint. And you had to wade through hours of filler to get there. This is the video game equivalent of an Asylum movie. Another game I forgot to mention above, in the 'games that were out first and did it better', Doom 3 beat this game by a year, and did the spooky corridor shooter - with bits of information parsed out through personal messages - better. This game is just a slow, painful drudge of a boring, poorly paced, generic shooter. Avoid it.",

Over time, F.E.A.R.'s lack of diversity in both its gameplay and its environments begins to wear, and boredom creeps in. But the game is nonetheless a welcome break from the oppressive glut of static and uninspired, albeit visually impressive military shooters.

They are cheap cash ins on the original games success. They were created by timegate studios, a company that have never made a good game. It lacks the quality of the original and they just feel like cheap knock offs. They ruined the story of the series so much to the point where monolith says they are not cannon. The scares are cheap and not effective and feel very rushed. The gunplay is mostly the same as the original but are nowhere near as fun because of the lack of good level design and enemy placement. However i still think fans of the original should at least play through them once because the amazing mechanics are still the same it just lacks the quality.

After playing Mike for about an hour and a half, I'm finding it hard to find anything seriously wrong with the game, because when you get down to it, it's a hell of a lot of fun, no matter what your original opinion was before opening it up for the first time.",

The story is nothing like as strong as other FPS games like Bioshock or Metro 2033 and you may get bored listening to other people's ansaphone messages - you can always do the old Ace Ventura, and drop their voices down an octave using slow-mo.

I played the crap out of it too. At the time I had probably the worst set up ever for this game. The desktop was on the ground and my monitor was on top of it. I had to use what little space was left to place my mouse atop of the desktop and of course I had to set the keyboard on my lap (what better place?). And I had to sit in a miniature lawn chair that had the seat lifted from the ground about 6 entire inches. Not kidding folks. But would I change a single aspect of this memory? You better think again if you believe I would. This was the highlight of my gaming life. Especially for PC gaming. I enjoyed every single nanosecond!  Overall this game is incredible even all the way into 2014. As everyone has said, the AI is insanely well constructed. Hell it won the award for the best AI of the year for a reason. They work and attack similar to a real military combat unit. They even try to call out to their team and give info on what you are trying to do. The only part I didn't like was the end. The enemies you have to fight there are pathetic and just a plain bother. That would be the only thing I wish would be changed.

The way the AI behaves and works together to try and take you down puts games today to shame. Another thing is how fluid your combat can become. Firefights can lasts from a few seconds to a minute and there is never really anything that slows your progress ( cutscenes forexample). The playtime of Perseus Mandate is 7-12 hours, but you can beat in 3 hours on your first playthrough. Perseus Mandate revolves more around combat, than horror compared to the two other games. Personally I found the plot to be very interesting, although perhaps a bit cliche. If I could change one thing about this game I think it would be the plot.

Additionally the graphics, especially some wall textures look particularly bad now, even for a game from 2005.  Nonetheless, F.E.A.R. is quite scary for those unacquainted with the best of the survival-horror genre. Its story is also interesting enough to capture one's attention. Though it is often hard to follow its many twists. Without ruining anything, the end is slightly underwhelming, and to such an extent that it really feels like it was rushed. It is a good game, however, and well worth picking up for anyone interested in a paranormal FPS. 8/10.  Its expansion, Extraction Point, although blessed with a laughably poor (verging on the non-existent) storyline, and few minor tweaks to the original game, is about half as long as the original campaign and actually manages some of the best combat and scariest moments in the whole game.

Even worse, the scares completely fall flat and the game is a cakewalk on anything other than the highest difficulty, which still feels too easy at points.  Despite all its baggage, when F.E.A.R finally hits its stride, it's excellent.   F.E.A.R Extraction Point: ------------------------------------  This is the best F.E.A.R has ever, and will ever be.   If you're looking for classic F.E.A.R gameplay with good pacing and fantastic encounter design, this expansion is better than the original.

You play as an unspecified (so you can project yourself as the character) special forces operative, recruited by F.E.A.R. the First Encounter Assualt Reconnaissance. Your main mission is to hunt down an AWOL commander in charge of an entire battalion of mindless commandos. However as you get closer and closer the mission becomes less about one of Capture-or-kill, more Prevent-the-apocalypse.  The graphics are better than minecraft and the soundtrack really secures the ambience of the game. Despite its age there are virtually no problems with the game.

            "review_text": "I have never played F.E.A.R. before, but when I saw the game for $2.50 a while back I had to pick it up and put it in my backlog. Now that I've completed the series I'm writing reviews for each game.  Performance/Graphics: Tons of video/advanced options available and the game is not intensive at all with current hardware. You'll more than likely be able to crank this game to 11 and enjoy it at butter smooth 60fps(or higher) with no drops whatsoever. Of course the graphics are dated at this point, but for a game that is over 10 years old at this point it holds up pretty well.  Extra Content/DLC: The extra content is 'worth it' if you end up liking the game and want more backstory. Technically the extra content isn't 'canon' so if you're looking for more canon backstory then don't bother, but if you just want more to play then go for it. I personally did not play the DLC so I can't comment on them performance/combat wise, but I did read the wiki about the plot for them and I'd say they're both great additions.  Combat: The game itself has very good weapon mechanics and varying weapon choices, also it has armor and health management, so use your medkits wisely and look for armor pickups when needed! You can hold four weapons at once and various grenade types. Fighting is fluid and the slow-mo(bullet time) the game features is a nice touch and it really helps when things start getting hectic, or if you want to see explosions in slow motion.  Atmosphere: There is a horror atmosphere to the game and plenty of jumpscares/scenes that will make your heart skip a beat and body tense up. Definitely turn off the lights, put on a pair of headphones, and play at night to really make your skin crawl. Or don't and play in the middle of the day like a sissy, your choice not mine.  Story: The story itself is interesting and definitely makes you wanting more. I'm not posting spoilers, but I can guarantee you this game has a great story behind it and is definitely worth a play.  Price: Like I said I got this game and it's two DLC's for $2.50 a while back. For $9.99 I'd honestly consider woth picking up, at $4.99 definitelty pick it up, and if you see it for $2.50 you're definitely missing out big time if you don't buy it at this price point.",

            "review_text": "FEAR is like the Breaking Bad of first person shooters. Yeah, it's great. Now shut the hell up about it. Gamers seem to forget that the title was blasted upon release for its repetitive environments... but only by journalists. Yes, contrarian clickbaiting-- posting negative reviews to appear edgy and increase site traffic-- has been around since AOL, and those rags had some pathetically fanatical followings too. The only positive outcome of this is when I finally got around to playing it a year or so later my expectations were low enough that I was very pleasantly surprised-- mostly in the story department. I love horror, and FEAR is a very scary game, a strange fusion of action and terror that somehow manages to mesh perfectly. Not surprising, seeing as Monolith are legends of the FPS genre, up there with Raven and Id. These are the guys that made Blood, NOLF, Shogo, Condemned and other envelope-pushing titles before gaming was taken over by suits and ties.  So what is FEAR? It's a highly atmospheric shooter with fun guns and a fluidly reactive melee system. It's lauded as having some of the best enemy AI ever, though I've never really noticed because I've usually wiped out everyone in the room before they have a chance to do anything 'artificially intelligent'. This was one of the first (not THE first) shooters to implement slow-mo bullet-time, which you can upgrade throughout the game (along with health) if you have sharp eyes and a knack for exploration. It's highly satisfying, gruesome, and gives you an opportunity to admire the gorgeous particle effects. The campaign segways back and forth throughout its runtime with frantic bouts of action interspersed with sections of unnerving silence and exploration. Many have criticized the story and horror elements as distracting to the action-- 'I just wish the game would stop trying to be scary so I can get back to killing stuff in slo-mo'. These people were probably potential school shooters at some point, so their opinions can safely be discarded.  FEAR has one of the best horror atmospheres ever, if only for it's minimalism. Because the story starts at dusk and carries on deep into the night, and because you are spending most of the time in empty office buildings, abandoned tenements and construction sites, there is a deliciously unnerving silence inundating most of the game. FEAR is actually one of the quietest games I've ever played, which you wouldn't expect-- the combat is over so quickly, the music so restrained, that this is hands down the best 'after-hours' game I've ever experienced. What I mean is there is a sense of being in a place you're not supposed to be, a place that is a bustling center of human activity during the day, but because it's the middle of the night, and everyone has gone home (or is dead), and all that's left is the dim glow of overhead fluorescent lights and the pitch black corners they fail to illuminate, there is the uneasy sensation of being an invisible trespasser. It creates a potent feeling of loneliness, accentuated by the subtle, throbbing soundtrack, with only the occasional friendly radio update or enemy chit-chat to break the silence. This makes the jump-scares (and they are good jump-scares) all the more effective. Once, a stealthy ATC grunt gave away his position to me because he knocked over a bottle of pills.  The story is also quite minimal, needling it's way into your subconscious through a combination of exposition in the form of radio updates, computer laptops, and answering machines (whose red lights blink invitingly in the darkness) giving you tiny bits of insight into the lives of the people who use them. There are also some very creepy 'hallucinations' that add to the mystery, and as long as you are paying attention, all the pieces will fall into place by the ending of the game, and what a shocking ending it is.  Oh, and you can LEAN.  There is plenty to nit-pick here, but just to thumb my nose at the wannabe-journalists who knocked the game a decade ago I'll keep it brief. There is a fat, out of place comic-relief character. There is very little on-screen indication of damage, with your HUD being so tiny as to be practically invisible on higher resolutions. This means it's very easy to go from full health to dead before you know who's shooting you or before you can smash the Z key with your pinkie to use a health pack. The OP shotgun is considered one of the best weapons ever by FEAR fans, and it is indeed fun to use, but it's still OP. Pointman only has to rack three shells in a row to reload the 12 round chamber. Also, you can carry, like, a gajillion shells, which makes no sense. (I prefer the dual pistols myself.) Some of the reload animations and weapon models are a little lazy. There is a very annoying 'drone' enemy that thankfully only makes two appearances in the entire game. Also, for all the love the melee system gets, I only found myself using it maybe half a dozen times throughout my last play through. It's just easier to blow everyone away. Which is fine, to each their own, but don't go off criticizing the sequels for not replicating the system to a fault just because the developers wanted more shooting and less fighting.  A definite must for shooter and horror fans. The sequels are good too, but none of them ever did it quite like FEAR.",

However, there are some tropes that get really irritating and repetitive: -The American military not only has an infinite supply of helicopters, but they also can't train their pilots to properly protect them. Bottom line: 1,000 helicopters were harmed in the making of this game, and only one of them ever returned to base safely. -Everybody hates you and does everything in their power to get seperated for you, even if it means dying. Seriously, the Point Man has no friendships that last for more than five minutes. -The Point Man has never read the old 'In case of emergency, do NOT use the elevators', and as a result, experiences many 'from Floor 20 to -200' moments.

If your looking for a game to scare the s*** out of you while you kill soliders like your neo in the matrix you should 100% get this game. The game never really changes the style of the gameplay though through out the levels, its normally: Your by yourself, do these orders, kill these guards, get scared, next level. But beside the repetitive levels, I still recommend this game, it's a fun and exciting experince for people who have never played this style of games.",

The other aspects of the game such as the AI, gunplay, arsenal, and overall game design are not only fantastic, but are better than many modern competitors. Also, while not the most important aspect of the game, it does an effective job of being a horror game. It has a few jump scares, but a lot of the horror also comes from a disturbing and ominous atmosphere. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS games.",

            "review_text": "My favorite first person shooter over the last ten years. This game is the first FPS I have played which features a planner as AI component. It used an amazingly easy algorithm derived from the classic STRIPS planner, but surprisingly efficient. The AI opponents are tactically intelligent: the know when to ambush, when to flank, when to flee, and when to throw a grenade and flush you out, they can even take advantage of the environment or execute some simple team tactics which may amaze you for a moment, this is truely brilliant for a game made in 2005.   Enough said about the AI, the other elements are also great: guns are fun to shoot and really pack a punch, you can actually feel the impact of bullets when they land on the enemies or even on the environment; slow-mo feature is fun to use and the visual effect for slow-mo is really cool (for an 2005 game, of course); the levels are cleverly designed, they are complex enough for AI opponents to execute their tactics, as well as for you to take advantage of; the length of the game is just right(it takes me a little over 10 hours to beat on hardest difficulty setting); and, of course, everyone's favorite girl Alma will freak you out(well, not really if you played some real survival horror games, this is an FPS afterall).  The visual of the game is also amazing for a 2005 game. This game uses shadow volume just like Doom 3, which is hard to find in today's games, if you have ever saw how the shadows are like in Doom 3, you can expect the similar effect in FEAR. The colour tone and lighting is just right: a contrast between brightly lighted areas, and shadows lurking around them, and blood trails everywhere.For the horror parts, unlike Doom 3, this game takes advantage of some tricks usually found in Japanese horror movies, it is better for you to see it yourself, they are neatly executed in the game.  Please try this game if you haven't yet, you will get much more than you expect.  Last, just a few warnings, there are two expensions come with the original game, they are not developed by Monolith Games(developer of the original), Extraction is okay, but definitely worse than the original; while Perseus Mandate is not worth your time, it is really bad. For the two sequels, if you like the original game, you can try FEAR 2, but don't expect the same level of quality from it; and please, by any means, avoid the third game.  Update: For those who experiencing low fps issues, there is a high chance that you are using Logitech G series mouse or keyboard, the game engine has a known compatibility issue with these devices. Just go into the device manager and disable all devices with 'HID' in their names under 'human interface devices' and you'll be fine.",

Too much good stuff to pass up for such a price.",

The multiplayer also deserves to be mentioned as I spent countless hours playing it back in the old days. Too bad there are no official servers now...  As for the expansions: Extraction Point continues the story separately from Project Origin and has some pretty good moments (like the invisible creatures which take the horror level of the game way higher). Perseus Mandate on the other hand is just too uninteresting to play through.",
