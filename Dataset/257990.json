This is because it can be difficult, If you like achievements and want a challenge this game will do it for you as they can be very annoying due to the simplicity of the game yet you get caught out often.   The Pro's  - Laid back 2D game with time consuming levels.  - Gamepad compatible - Hard achievements - Challenge modes that will challenge you   The Cons - none. ( A great game that seems to have no issues )  So dont let the young style/look trick you into not playing this game. It will get you hooked and you will find yourself coming back to it over and over. 5/5",

            "review_text": "This game is really one of the best platformers I ever played. It starts off quite easy, but you'll soon have to use various tricks in order to avoid your enemies. Talking about enemies, there are quite a bunch, different in nature, which makes the game feel a lot interesting. You won't get bored while playing this.  Also notable is the fact that you can see your friends as ghosts while playing. This is really useful if you want to see how they performed at a certain obstacle. 10/10. One of the best games you can play here. Surely worth the full price!",

            "review_text": "To some, it may look like just some so-so title that isn't worth a glance due to its small-time nature. But to me, I think it is a little (and I do mean LITTLE) gem in a sea of games of various qualities and polish.   Oozi is a humble platformer about a Rayman Wannabe who crashes his ship on a random planet, and thus is thrusted onto a quest to get his stuff back and return home. Storywise, it isn't much, but in this day and age, I suppose a simple plot is better than the overly dramatic stuff you get nowadays.   Once you get into the first level, though, the game certainly does start to charm you, with its lovely art style, its decent soundtrack (That is forgettable, but still nice to listen to throughout the game), and its easy to learn gameplay. It isn't a hard game persay, but it isn't a walk in the park either. I had times where the game did surprise me with some challenging platforming, which kept me interested and provided some satisfaction when I managed to survive past a difficult challenge to the next checkpoint. The game also throws out some interesting (if short lived) gimmics at you as well to spice levels up as you continue on your quest, from rock titans that can only be killed with short-fused bombs to security systems that require timing and smart jumps to avoid in order to progress through a part of the level. Sadly, many of these gimmics are often one level only, which is a shame they don't use some of these gimmics more often, because some of them really are interesting.   In the case of Bosses, there are four worlds each, with a boss in each of them. Ironicly, the first boss might be the hardest, because every boss I fought afterwards (even the FINAL BOSS) was rather mild. They still kept you on your toes, but they didn't seem awfully threatening. Really, the levels before the boss is where all the fun is, what with all the secret stars you can collect in each level to unlock challenge levels you can play to, well, challenge yourself, so there is at least a bit of replay value after the story is complete.  Sure, this game isn't the best platformer out there, it isn't gonna get any 'oooohs' or 'Ahhhhs' or even '11 out of 10s' out of you, but if you are looking for a decent little platformer that you can easily get into that'll provide a satisfying experience for a low cost, this is worth checking out. For anyone expecting something more intense, though... Look elsewhere.",

Oozi himself looks pretty creepy, and the sound effect when he dies doesn't help. Again, might not bother others as much as it did me.  That said, solid platformer, simple as can be. Completionists and classic gamers will get their money's worth.",

Every new challenge is presented in an approachable and fair way, so if you get hurt, it's your fault, not the game's. It's extremely inventive, with creative levels, themes, and overall good level design. It also doesn't stay the same difficulty throughout, it does get more difficult the further you get into the story, as it should. If you like old school platformers such as Mario or old Rayman, this should be a definite purchase. I've had more fun with this game than most games I've played.",

            "review_text": "Oozi is a funny platformer with great gameplay and some of the most awkward challenges and achievements I have ever seen. It's biggest deficit is the lack of variety. The enemies and their abilities/behaviour in each stage are similar to each other and it seems like the developers just lost track or were not in the mood to add some more. The boss fights are too easy, either.   But the Steam achievements will keep those awake who want to make it a '100 percent game'. Only 4 out of 1000 players have got the most rare achievement in the game and after hours and hours of trying I wonder how the hell they achieved it. I cannot even come close...  Hope this review helped you out =8o)  Cheers, Trouble",

I've been playing on hardcore and it's not too challenging, although I've died plenty of times from silly things like accidently sliding into an enemy or falling into water. With all the respawn points, it doesn't take long to pick up where you left off. Love this game!! Highly recommend it especially now since it's on sale for the week.",

            "review_text": "This is a very good looking platformer with a relaxing soundtrack. However being that it is a platformer, it needs precision controls, and the game's physics are entirely too floaty (Think Super Meat Boy if you actually needed to stomp on enemies and couldn't wall jump). Let's say you're jumping to the right over a pit to a small platform. In midair you let go of the right direction to land on the platform, but the physics continue moving you slightly right for a half second before stopping horizontal momentum.   You also have a high jump and a low jump. There didn't seem to be any in between, which makes precision jumping even harder,  Additionally, I landed on multiple enemies from above but would be hurt, the hitbox shapes must be rather strange. And the sneaky snails that dash at you for some reason can't be jumped on at all, which doesn't make much sense.  tl;dr - It's hard to control precisely, you will die a lot and it will frustrate you because the controls are too floaty. I played through 2 levels and a challenge stage before I had had enough.",

            "review_text": "Oozi: Earth Adventure is a very simplistic and visually appealing platformer, which will appeal to both casual and somewhat hardcore gamers because of it's features ranging from a mode where you can't die to challenges where even the easiest of mistakes can make you lose.  The gameplay is what you expect from a platformer and it's pretty enjoyable, but it does get repetitive after a few worlds. By that, I mean the same kinds of enemies appear, doing the same attack patterns but differing in their visuals or amount. The hardcore mode isn't what makes the game hard for me, it's the harsh checkpoint system. Checkpoints get very scarce later on in the game, and you'll be quite frustrated with how rare they become and how much you have to accomplish to reach the next available one. That being said, if you are decent at platformers, know the game mechanics and have at least 2 levels of health, you should be fine.  The levels drag on for quite a while as well, and I'd say each one (Excluding boss fights) will take at least 10-15 minutes. That being said, the game is definitely worth the price (Though I'd recommend waiting for a sale if you don't enjoy platformers too much) because of it's longevity, as well as the '100% pure classic platforming fun' that is in the game description.",
