            "review_text": "A brilliant peace of software and must have for CG hobbyists! Curvy's strongest point is it's drawing feature which has a semi-steep learning curve (get it? 'curve' ?). It's not so much instructions that needs to be studied, over and over, but management of the curve and drawing tools takes a while to 'stick.'  Once you get the hang of it, however, it's a lot of fun to play around in and even more so if you own a graphics tablet. Obviously far more developed than the free Sculptris or MeshMixer; I've been playing in this app for about four years now and still learning something new each day.  When I have to whip up an illustration quick and don't have time to waste in box modelers - I turn here first.  There are some current fallbacks however but hopefully Simon will update those soon.  1. Bump doesn't work if using an older AMD video card.  2. The GUI and viewports are not near as customizable as I would like them to be nor will Curvy remember what you do mange to customize. (however standard four port is still included)  3. When using the Curvy map there seems to be no way to apply it to only parts of the model there for any imported textures apply to the whole model. I believe this can be circumvented even using the free version of Project Dogwaffle Which Simon has implemented a link to in the Curvy menus.  Ultimately, however, this is by far my favorite 3D tool when it comes to 3D software outside of standard poly/vertix/edge manipulation.",

            "review_text": "Very small program for simple 3D modeling. It might be a little hard to use, but the tutorial in the video section helps out a lot on the basics. One thing I really like about the program is it doesn't bombard you with a lot of popups like most 3d model production software of its kind, which leaves you with a very clean environment to work with.",

Almost any free 3d sculpting is better. The fact that I spent money on this fills me with regret and makes me sick to my stomach. Software like this is why I wish there was some kind of refund policy on Steam.",
