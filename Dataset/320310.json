I do not recommend.  -----------  Выглядит как треш и ездит как треш (по крайней мере на клаве). Ну, возможно, при достаточном терпении можно привыкнуть и получать какое-то удовольствие.  Но в целом не могу рекомендовать.",

I live in Australia and we have the right to money back on broke &amp; 'not as advertised' products. But this game is so pathetic I won't waste my time.",
