            "review_text": "stay away from this game. i'm serious. it's horrible.  for starters there are a few things in general you should know: 1. the game was abandoned by the devs quite a while back so nothing is ever going to be fixed. 2. i didn't test it myself but people say controller support is really bad. 3. about half the achievements are broken and cannot be obtained.  so much for that. now about the game itself.  - you are stuck in this horrible iso view and can't change the view mode. most of the time you have no idea where the heck you are actually going when you race around with full speed.   - game physics are really, really bad. very often your car turns and flips in midair for no reason. or you scratch the wall of a perfectly rounded 90° turn and suddenly you hit a dead pixel, stopping your car from 200 kph to 0 in an instant and doing a 180° turn as well.  - all powerups are placed just in the middle of the track allowing you to pick them all up and use them without leaving anything to the players behind you. so you should be able to stay on 1st place from start to finish. right?  - wrong! the rubberband AI cheats all the time. you own the best car, you have bought all the upgrades, you use nitro all the time. but suddenly someone catches up to you, casually drives by and heads off into the sunset leaving you way behind. how can he possibly go faster than you? where did he get all the nitro after you picked the road clean of powerups for miles? bullsh!t!  - the tracks are as boring as they can get. there are 45° turns, there are 90° turns, there are straights and there are ramps for jumping. that's all! it's like a five-year-old put together these tracks with lego!   most of the time you are not really playing this game but fighting the game itself and dealing with horrible controls, horrible iso view and horrible car handling. stay away from this piece of sh!t.",

            "review_text": "Very dissapointing no wonder it's always on sale, the original store page sold it for me, first time playing and i instantly got the feeling of micromachines. now it says 'full controller support' this is a borderline lie as most of the menus you have to use the keyboard and mouse, also its a pain after every race you have to go to the garage again and rebuy your ammo, also it doesn't even give you a chance to get up to speed it's instantly 1 lap and you have the slowest car even no matter how much you upgrade it your still going to come in 8th place.  Another issue is the graphics i have an Nvidia 630 2gb graphics and yet the screen cant seem to keep up as its trying to advertise other games on its billboards.  Nice artwork .... but not what it seems when you see the micromachine track and no directions of which way your supposed to be going lol",

For me, it is not playable with a joypad in this state. Fix this, and I will give this game another go.  Edit:  Even with the controls mapped to the gamepad the way the developers intended, this game plays horrible. I'm a huge 2D top down / isometric racer nut and can't recommend this game to anyone that wants a fun game to play.",

            "review_text": "This is literally one of the worst games I ever played.  Controller support is partial at best, making it not only impossible to use menus but hasn't even mapped weapons making it useless for play. The A.I. seems to be very hard, wich is something people could want, but also seems to conspire against the player. But all that could be forgiven, if after you inevitably lost the race the game wouldn't assault you with plain smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. I get that this wants to be Mad Max like Machismo but this is an 16 year old edgelords idea of banter.  I was really happy to play this, since I loved isometric racing games when I was young but this is little more than a string of frustrations broken up by the occasional insult and if there was any way to delete games from ones library I would.",
