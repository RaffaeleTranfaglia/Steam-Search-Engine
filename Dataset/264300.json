            "review_text": "This is a solid little top down/twin stick shooter! It has some bugs here and there, but the game play is pretty great. If you like the twin stick genre.  The gunplay is accurate and you'll notice some differences when you upgrade your weapons which makes it rewarding. The turret system didn't interest me much at first, but it's growing on me. The graphics aren't mind blowing, but they make for a fun atmosphere for running around and blowing up zombies! The story is skippable, I haven't paid much attention to it. I'm just here to shoot stuff in twin stick style, which is ace.   As for bugs, I've noticed on a map or two where it doesn't register the end of a wave. That's kind of a bummer, because you have to quit your current game. There's at least one invisible item I can think of so far that I've ran into as well, which is difficult mostly becase there's a perk achivement attached to it. Otherwise, I've had nothing but fun with this one. There's also online co-op supposedly, but I haven't attempted it and the boards state there's a lot of problems with firewalls. Be aware if that's your primary goal for this one.   There's an upgrade system in which you can buy better weapons, stats, etc. and it all works pretty well. It serves as a good carrot to go back and replay maps to grind out levels and beef up your character for the later maps. However, there is no real tutorial that I found that shows you all of this stuff. Not a big deal, you can figure it out easily enough. You just may be confused for a bit.   For it's current $1.19 price tag in the Halloween sale, GunsNZombies is a steal! For the full $8, I may not have jumped on it so quickly, but $5 feels like a great price for it. If you like twin stick's, come play it'll be fun.",

            "review_text": "For people who played a game called Dead Nation on PS3 putting it shortly believe it or not even though they are the same price this game is the 'poor man's' version of that game.  Now for those who didn't play Dead Nation. This game is pretty repetitive and not challenging. For the time I played it was repetitive wave after wave 'zombie' killing (half of the creatures are even aliens, maybe it's from the DLC but I played main campaign so I guess DLC adds just new enemies to main campaign or maybe it's not that). All you do is just hold left button and run around and pretty much that's all you do, nothing else mission after mission and the upgrades of the guns are very, very simple. Not challenging? Why? Well because as I said you just run around and hold left button. Why? Because the zombies barely do any damage to you, even the 'special zombies' don't do any damage so you don't even have to care about them and you also don't seem to run out of ammo, you just reload infinite ammo so you can just hold the button constantly and that's how you finish waves to complete missions. There is a thing called 'special ability' that doesn't even add anything to the game. On top of everything the graphics are meh. I got bored quickly and so much that I just couldnt continue to play any longer. I personally cannot recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "If you think the zombie theme has been played to death, you are perfectly right on that account, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find small gems like this game every once in a while. The graphics and game play is solid though nothing inventive I’ll be honest, the price tag however, made it all very worthwhile.  There are 19 stages of which you can blast through with 2 characters in the core game, each stage has their own difficulty slider and objectives, so you’ll be grinding for a while to complete everything in full. During my 20 hours worth of game time, this did not feel dull for one bit as I unlock different tiers of equipment and abilities.  As for the down side the game is unpolished in some areas with its typos and grammatical mistakes, the biggest gripes I had surprisingly were the stage sceneries, made too small and too dark to make out on the map but just big enough to block your path completely. These inanimate obstacles were more deadly than the zombies themselves, the only real annoyance I had to suffer with.  I would recommend this any time of the day, even more so during a sale, just don’t buy this expecting a big budget title.",

I finished 19 levels of main story and here is my 5 cent:  Good: - shooting and explosions look nice - game is very cheap - lots of different weapons and upgrades to try - length of the game is just enough not to become boring and repetitive - you can play with Xbox 360 gamepad or with direction keys and mouse Bad: - difficulty is not in good measure, some levels are too hard, some levels too easy  - when moving you get stuck behind everything, movement is not fluid - game can slow down when large number of enemies on screen (minor issue) - when I try to play side quest level (The swamp), game crashes. If this is DLC why offer it here to froze the game? - story is totally lame and not important, just skip it - bugs - no local co-op  I must recommend this game because it is worth the money as it is. It's a shame although that Guns'n'zombies is not considerably better as it could have been…",
