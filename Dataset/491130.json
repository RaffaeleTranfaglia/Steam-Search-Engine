The game's not long (one of the achievements is 'beat the game in under 10 minutes'), but for its price tag of exactly zero Botswana pulas, it's a good way to waste a few minutes.  There are a few bugs, though. While playing it I found that, if you jump and sprint at the same time on a pillar extending upwards, you fly ~5x as high, allowing you to bypass entire levels.",

Its to bad that this game is rather on the short side, because I had a lot of fun playing this.  If you like Kreedz climbing or Defragging in Quake, you won't be dissapointed by checking out this one. Also check out a rather recently released game called 'Climbtime'.",

Do not take me wrong it has some frustrating moments because of bugs and such  But it has it fair share of moments that either gets your adrenalin rising or making you scratch your head while trying to figure out how to solve some of the fresh and overall fun puzzles  The games art style is basically just like mirror's edge's all white except for the things you kan use which is red style which is not to original, but it's not a problem  The fact that just one guy made this in 15 weeks is totally insane for the quality it delivers  I honestly really like the fact that the game is about 40 or more minutes. 40 to 60 minutes is long enough to not feel to rushed and short enough to not drag the puzzles out  Red Trigger is a 100% free game that really isn't for everybody but the people who likes games such as portal will surely have fun with Red Trigger",

I completed the game in about 10 minutes. So while not very long by any means it made me think for the short while that I was playing. Possible in a couple months I could come back and replay it fresh without quite remembering how to solve each of the eight levels.  So to summarize, very small game with few mechanics, but those mechanics are done well. Good pickup for someone just wanting a small puzzle game with a little bit of action.

Long(er) Review:  Red Trigger is a fun little puzzle game you can complete in under an hour at your leisure. There’s not much of a story to it, however it provides sufficient entertainment with the puzzles you need to solve to advance levels. The puzzles themselves are not overly complex but they do require problem solving therefore the general rhythm of game progression is nicely balanced and smooth. The visuals are interesting though perhaps a bit tiring after a while with the bright white landscape causing somewhat of a strain in the eyes (at least for me), however it’s not too bothersome. Although it’s not on a similar level as the better known titles Portal and Portal 2 (due to the lack of a compelling story and extremely short duration) I do recommend Red Trigger to anyone who enjoys this genre as it accomplishes what any self-respecting video game should: provide entertainment. Did I already mention that it’s free?",

I may not have an up-to-date PC but IK what games should run good and what games won't. With this game it's using little to NO textures (well atleast high res) The problem that I think may be the issue is that the WHOLE area is rendered even when you aren't looking at it also it seems to have far render distance. I can walk into the building and it renders everything in and out of it. I sugest toning that down ALOT. Also why is it that when I activate a platform the game hangs and or freezes and causes even worse framerates. I swear with a game that looks like it can be ported to PlayStation 2 why does it do this? This review is harsh I know and I'm sorry. I don't think the simple 'well just upgrade your PC' willdo since I can play some modern games with high res textures at better framerates. I want toenjoy this game but it's broken atleast on my end. I won't suggest this game to anyone until the problems are fixed.  (Just incase you wanted to knowonmy second monitor I have the task manager running and my PC's CPU usage doesn't even go above 50% and the memory doesn't even go above 60%)  So sadly right now I give a 1/10 (for looking cool but unplayable)",

Lag aside, the graphics are.......sub-par, and the actual mechanics are nothing special. The puzzles themselves are ok, but far from enough to redeem this game.",
