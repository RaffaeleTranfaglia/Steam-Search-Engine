            "review_text": "I don't really play games like  Torchlight . The style of action RPG proliferated by titles like  Diablo  never really interested me. It's mostly just a repetitive slog of killing and looting identical enemies who changed only statistically, becoming incrementally more difficult so as to retain the same amount of effort required for their deaths. While  Torchlight  is all that and more, it managed to keep me entertained for quite some time through diverse enemy types, artistic direction and engaging skill trees.  The gameplay hardly needs explaining--it's like  Diablo . You control most everything in the game using the mouse and some hotkeys. I chose to play as the 'vanquisher' class, focusing on ranged weaponry and magic related to it. The abilities of this class mostly serve to complement her ranged weapons, and I managed to completely finish the game without even equipping a melee weapon. I did find that the class benefited significantly from having summoning spells, allowing players to fire powerful ranged spells at enemies while minions keep them at bay. A lot of the more powerful weapons felt great to use, and I was impressed by the game's lenience toward players interested in multiple gameplay styles--nothing stopped me from summoning an army of skeletons, even though I didn't choose the class focused on that at the start of the game.   Torchlight 's balancing feels fine, though later levels do feature some enemies with huge damage output that were a pain to get past. I really liked the way the game's entire story takes place in a single dungeon, with the player's gradual descent into the earth beneath the titular town slowly revealing different fortresses and ancient ruins all lying beneath the ground. The game begins with entry into the mine upon which Torchlight's economy is reliant upon, but before the game's end you'll see a sprawling necropolis, colourful, flooded ruins and a fiery dwarven fortress. The graphical diversity keeps things interesting, and everything's quite pretty too. I liked the cartoony art style, but I found it quite curious how many enemies were simply recoloured, buffed up a bit and reused.  On release, some criticised  Torchlight  for it's lack of any form of multi-player component. I personally found this to be a good decision, as a single-player game tends to be more focused.  Torchlight , despite the admirable streamlining of UI and gameplay still contains a large amount of engaging content, even after the final boss. I just don't know if  Torchlight  will be one of those games that the average player can get a huge amount of mileage out of--while I found the content to be sufficient, it certainly does get old after a certain point.",

I finished the main story, but the random dungeons still hook me to this game. Really an indie gem that lead to an even more polished sequel. Fully recommended if you're into action RPGs.",

It has a more vibrant color palette than Diablo games, making it more cartoony and more accessible to young children, but the gameplay is solid and fast enough for anyone to enjoy. I'd rather play the sequel Torchlight 2 because it is twice the game this one is, and it has multiplayer which this one does not. The story is pretty bare and simple here. Basically this is a good game and I would say worth a playthrough, but if you want your money's worth then get Torchlight 2 over this one. However if this game's style is not to your liking then I would recommend checking out Grim Dawn which is graphically superior and mechanically similar to this and the Diablo series. If steampunk is more your style then give The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut or Victor Vran. If you want something more anient gods style then check out Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition.",

            "review_text": "The best Hack 'n' Slash between Diablo 2 and this year's boom return of the genre. Torchlight and Titan Quest were pretty much the only Hack 'n Slash during this period, at least that I can think of, and Titan Quest weren't that similar to Diablo. Torchlight have a similar atmosphere to the Diablo classics, even though the art style and graphics are more colorful and high-res that those of Diablo 2 - They still have very similar atmospheres.  A few guys in the Runic Games studio did work on Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, and therefore have a professional insight of what made the original game so great. I wish to prevent using the term Diablo-clone, because it casts a negative shadow over a great game, but Torchlight is a obvious success of cloning. In some regards, Torchlight is even better than Diablo 2 because of it's added genuinity.  As every Hack 'n' Slash and RPG, you get to choose your class. In Torchlight there are only 3 classes; Vanquisher, Destroyer, and Alchemist. All three with different perks and advantages. Vanquisher is Range, Destroyer is Melee and the Alchemist is a Mage. Clear focus point for the three classes is speed, strength and magic in that order. You get to modify each class heavily though throughout the gameplay so each class can look very different in the end. There are a lot of different types of Weapons and Armors in the game, as expected from the genre! Loot is the most wonderful of things, see.  One unique addition is the pet system, where you always have pet with you. This has a few advantages; for example can the pet go back and sell your loot, for non-stop hacking and slashing. The pet also helps out in the fights, and can never die only flee and run around like an idiot. You can boost your pet with armors and jewelry, as well as bind scrolls to the pet that it will cast by itself. I never upgraded my pet too serious though, I always forgot to give it new items - so it's not a game breaker. Just a neat feature.  Sadly Torchlight lacked in a few areas as well, Multiplayer mostly so. Hack 'n' Slash is most enjoyable in co-op, where mowing through hordes of monsters become more of a sport. Luckily this year's sequel, Torchlight II, has improved the series greatly while maintaining the renowned Diablo aura. Torchlight offers rogue-like gameplay with the Hardcore difficulty settings, if you get tired of playing like a wuss.    Worth picking up if you like Hack 'n' Slash and mindless killing, just be prepared to do it alone. Very good atmosphere and art-style    Note: It might be worth checking out  Torchlight II  ( Review ) as it only improves the original in all ways. As well as Free to Play game  Path of Exile . ",

It isn't too hard to get past this but it's a pain in the beginning.  - Instead of phasing out a wall when you go behind it, you get outlined awell as everything else behind the wall.",

            "review_text": "Single-player Diablo-like game (action role-playing dungeon crawler, isometric clicky clicky with randomized loot drops) that came out in 2009. The world was still waiting for Blizzard to deliver the next Diablo, and so, this was well-timed. (Runic went on to release Torchlight2 at around the same time that Diablo3 came out.) It also has a pretty deep mod community, though I'll admit that I played the game vanilla on my playthrough.  The game is polished: graphics aged fine, clean audio helps the game feel immersive and responsive, and the game runs smoothly on my high-end gaming rig. Did not try it on anything else, but I suspect it'll run just fine. The story is nothing new, but then again -- you're not really playing this game for the story. It's a game where you diablo diablo diablo til you diablo diablo diablo, while you diablo diablo diablo... diablo. In that aspect, the game entertained me 'til the end. According to the in-game panel, that was about 12 hours.  One point of emphasis: the game difficulty runs easy. If you want a challenging game in which you engage all the mechanics, I'd highly suggest you nudge the difficulty up. In my playthrough, I didn't touch any of the optional map-fragment dungeons; simply the main dungeon and the ones that Hatch opens for you, in his Quest For Many Things. My character's levels almost always matched the number of the main dungeon floor I was on. Though I do have a habit of clearing each floor completely, I shouldn't have been overleveled for any part of the game. And yet, I never had to use a mana potion or any of the various mana shrines. Didn't touch a health potion until L25, and even then rarely. Never had to fiddle with my pet's form -- simply used him as a carryall back to town to sell my items. (So, that took the need to fish right out of the picture.) I had no real use for my currency. (Game only has one -- gold.) I was one-shotting enemies with the gear I found on the ground. I cannot imagine the devs intended for you to three-shot their bosses. At some point toward the end, I just decided to put 100k gold into enchanting a single item, you know, for funsies. I suspect the devs had intended for the enchantment system to work as a gold sink, but I simply didn't need the stat boosts to make the game less challenging. I'm afraid it would have become boring.  I never once used any spells. I also didn't bother learning any non-passive class skills outside of the first available frost shot. Once I learned that, that's what I left my secondary attack on.  Perhaps it was simply because I'd built up a ranged, spike character and the dungeons are designed with bottlenecks galore (hallways and corners everywhere, weeee), but giving the ranged player a NPC tank, a single-target spike, AND a piercing crowd-control projectile so very early in the game may have been overkill.  Even if you haven't played a Diablo before, turn the difficulty up a bit.  Other small notes: Pet pathing. I realize this is sticky for many devs to get right, but boy -- my pet did not know how to go up stairs when the stairs were perhaps seven feet away from him. It's a small irritant, of course, since I could simply spend the 5 seconds moving around to manipulate his pathing algorithm. Replayability. Once you beat the game with any class, a new 'Shadow Dungeon' opens up. I fully admit that I will not be playing the game again (I have far too many other things to get to!) but that along with being able to 'retire' a character to pass along a heirloom makes it seem as though the replayability is solid. And again, there's a pretty decent mod community.",

The storage system in this game amazes me the fact it doesnt have expansion but, it teaches you how to manage to give to another character. The stash and shared stash is something that also raised this game to my liking.  So say you beat the game hurah! and u want to play on hard mode and not lose all your weapons there u go the shared stash will allow you to redo the game but keep ur kick butt weapons. Hud- well the hud i do not completely understand everytime i try to put an abillity inside it doesnt all i hv is a health potion an a pre-set abillity i dont even want! that plays a factor in the losing .5%. the fighting in this game is a little off perfect there is a bug that will make your character stand still and not move and you wont be able to drink a health potion either truly something the ruins the immersfulness of the game.  lastly the pet, the pet u get is something that seperates the game from other you start off with this pet and hes with you all the time when ur in a sticking sitiuation your dog/cat/etc.. will come and save your butt. if you equip your pet right with the right spells it will help A-LOT. this game is something i play on the side but i will complete it i very much reccomend buying this game and once i get torchlight 2 i will review that thanks id you read this all.

I don't need to tell you what 'sort' of game this is. You should already know, should already at least have heard of Diablo-styled games if you weren't living in a cave. However, I review this game as a gamer, and not a hardened veteran of the genre. I think I've only played this game type less than five times.   The game is colorful, that's for sure. The best way to characterize it is that it gives a feeling of polished Warcraft 3 graphics. Most things are visually pleasing, but you cannot customize your character - at all. Many of the bits of gear are shared templates. The soundtrack is suitable but completely forgettable. The voice acting, what little of it there is, is pretty good. Now on to the meat.   You have your pick of three classes: an alchemist, a destroyer, and a vanquisher, and they are all genderlocked. That is, a mage, a warrior, and a rogue. Each class has three skill trees, but there aren't that many actual skills, and the variety only goes up to level 25.   This is important: you cannot respec. This is a problem because many skills either do not scale well, or become obsolete. Both Torchlight games are moddable, so I assume SOMEONE must have included a mod for this, but if you're going to play vanilla, you'll be stuck with whatever you've got. You can look up builds, but I'm going to be up front here - if you're on Normal or Easy mode, you can probably completely screw up your character and still make it through.  Your stats generate base values for certain abiliites of course, and determine what kinds of gear you can wear. More on this in a moment.  You can also learn up to 4 spells from scrolls, and are able to unlearn and switch them out with better versions/different ones once you find or buy them. This was important for the alchemist, because he HAD NO HEALING SPELL. I bet that since the mage didn't have one, the other two classes didn't either.   Your pet, whom you pick at the beginning of the game, serves several functions. He attacks, of course, and you can feed him fish to turn him into various other creatures temporarily. Fishing as a mini-game is amusing for all of five minutes, and in spite of what it does I never needed it. He can hold as much loot as you can, he can learn two spells, equip two rings and a necklace, AND you can send him back to town to sell whatever he's got in his inventory. Once I figured this out the only time I went back to town was to pick up more quests. If you shift-click you can have him pick up items (I typically had mine loot 'grays'), but there's no way to have him pick up anything by himself.  As I trudged through the main dungeon's innards during the game's woefully simple plot, several things became immediately apparent. The first is that if, like me, you prefer to do sidequests before the main quest, you will be massively overleveled. Normal mode has been written off as too easy by pretty much everyone, and the sidequest mechanic doesn't help. Through most of the latter third of the game I found my mage running around with his small army of minions basic-attacking things with a wand and shield and positively steamrolling EVERYTHING. Which brings me to my next point.  Sometimes limitations are there for a reason. Each class has 3 trees, but since the gear is stat-based, you can have mostly any kind of character you want. My mage was fairly balanced between offensive spells and minions. I basically ran around with my two golems, the pet, two imps, 6 zombies (three from the pet), occasionally 6 skeletons (all from the pet), firing overpowered thunderbolts while teleporting around with a damage absorbing shield. With each wave of that wand I stole both health and mana. I'm fairly sure I wasted several precious skill points on abilities that were out-leveled or simply not very good in the first place. The fact that I was doing it all in half-warrior gear was the icing on the OP cake, and frankly the game just wasn't up to the challenge.   The interface was a little... quirky. You cannot rebind keys, and you only get one quickslot bar for skills and potions. Left click and right click can be designated as well, with a third Tab-accessed function for right click. By the end of the game, at least half of my skills could not be used, because you apparently cannot use them from the skill menu and I had no space for them.   Sometimes, when re-arranging inventories (there is no auto-sort), I'd accidentally stick a gem into an item. Using most of the items from the inventory screen requires a RIGHT click, but apparently not gems. The only way to get them back out is to destroy the items. You have two inventory pages thanks to the pet, one bank, and a storage bin that's shared between all characters. It's not a lot of space considering the game is about loot.   The vendors are what you'd expect, with one exception: the enchanter. His sole function is to turn whatever item you give him into a better item, which can mean either stats or gem sockets. Although I hardly used it, I thought this was a pretty nice feature. There's a % chance of the item become disenchanted. It's a nice way to upgrade generic gear that may have better base value than older gear, though the process is hideously expensive.  The clicking frenzy of battle works fine for a warrior, I'd imagine, but is a bit messy for a mage with minions, and probably a ranged rogue too. Some skills go right where you click them, some require only pointing in the general direction of a mob. Attacking with a ranged weapon when there are many mobs is frustrating, and since left-click to move is a thing, I frequently found my mage running headfirst into groups of mobs whenever he'd use his wand. The key point is that basic attacks do NOT activate unless you click right ON the mob, and if you have minions this can be a real mess. Sometimes skills can be used up or down staircases, and sometimes they can't, often times for the same skill. This sort of randomness is not a major gripe, but it's definitely noticeable.   AI companion pathing is reasonable. Many times my minions would be stuck in nearby areas because the levels are packed fairly tightly with many turns. If you want to be cheap you can hit enemies with ranged attacks in other areas of the map because they're not smart enough to find their way to you.   Speaking of those levels, one of the talking points of the game is the randomized environments. Truthfully, you'll notice some repeated designs, but for the most part you either won't notice or care.   The difficulty in the final few floors ramps up dramatically, even if you're five levels higher than the mobs. It's hard to know what combination of possibly gimped character stats, and a couple of cheap monsters created the difficulty, but it was the only time in the game where I died. And the last boss? Oh, you better be ready for that cheapness. The final battle was completely unimaginative to boot.   If you complete the few long-running sidequests along with the main story, you'll probably look at somewhere between 15-20 hours of play. Some people blast through it (especially on easy mode) in 6 hours, and some people blow over 60 hours on it. To be honest, the real game felt short, and since Torchlight II is out (and reputed to be superior in every way), the only reason to play through this title is because the story is continued (although it's painfully simple) in T2. Unless you're a hardcore fan of the genre, do NOT pay full price for this game.",

I've been playing the Diablo franchise since it was first unleashed opon the world all those years ago. It has everything I could want in a good game and Torchlight, being a Diablo clone (and very competent one at that) does it all just as well. Sure Torchlight has a more cartoon like feel and is more comic book like in its graphics, but that's not a bad thing. It deos everything right. Quests, gear, challenge..it does it all just as well as Diablo ever could.   If you don't haver the money to get Diablo itself, Torchlight is a great substitute.

The pace is quick with lots of enemies to fight through and a decent number of customizations and skills for each character class. You level up reasonably fast to get to new abilities. With what seems to be almost unlimited side quests and then deeper dungeons after finishing the main 'story', there should be a decent amount of replayability, though it does seem that it can get repetetive if you really wanted to delve farther and farther. The Steam Achievments also make continued play a decent possibility.  The biggest thing on 'roids in this game, though, is the insane amount of loot and coin you will come across on each level. It just keeps coming and coming as you are constantly looking at newer equipment as well as enchanting options to constantly work to get your character that much more powerful.   Too much loot? Not really. Except on special quest levels, getting back to town to sell your extra stuff is almost no problem. At first I would send my pet back to town to sell extra stuff, but it didn't take long and I had enough teleport scrolls to quickly send me back to town. I probably spent as much time going back and forth between town and the dungeons to sell my extra stuff. It is the perfect OCD action RPG as I almost never had to drop anything to make room for something better. Pick it all up and sell what you don't use. You can use the coin to get some of the gems and other enhacements you want to work with that you can't find lying around.  I've played better and spent more time on others, but it is still a satisfying dungoen crawl that will probably call me from time to time to go just a bit deeper or a level higher so that I can see what's more I can do with my character. For it's reasonably quick main quest playing time, it seems almost obligatory to start it over again with a different playing class to see how it changes the experience.   Once again, not the greatest, but more than entertaining enough to make it worth a play through for action RPG enthusiasts.",

It does not show minions, stairs, etc. It is just whine lines. Sometimes It's impossble to see how the map really is because of the structures. -) There are no additional guide tips for the quests on the minimap or whatsoever. It is really easy to overlook.

Even the bosses were very easy, with the exception of the final boss who was entirely unbalanced with the rest of the game.

This may be a turn-off to some, and very welcome to others who are tired to the standard dark and brown color schemes in games these day.   If you're unfamiliar with Diablo, Torchlight is still a very accessible game. ARPGs are quite easy to get the hang of, as far as controls go (clickclickclickclick Q 124356 etc.) It's rather slow-paced, which might bug some people as it starts to feel boring after a few hours in a play session. Having a pet companion helps make the single player descent less lonely/ Pets will fight by your side, and also sell any excess items you give it in town for you. Dungeons are somewhat randomly generated. Loot drops also varies.  The game is quite easy on Normal difficulty due to the abundance of potion drops, and the ability to just spam the potion button when you are in trouble. You shouldn't expect to die very often at all. Although this might give the game a bit of a casual feel, it is still an enjoyable single player game that isn't overly lengthy. You can get a good 25 hours in. Don't expect much on the story front; it's rather bland and not very memorable. Besides, the core of the game is centered on loot.   While this game is worth the price, you may want to shell out an extra $5 for the sequel, which, in addition to fixing how rigged potions worked, the slow pace, adds much more to the game with regards to loot, classes, monsters, skills, and importantly, multiplayer.",

This game actually have a few great idea for adding to game to make it easier for you, this team of Torchlight know how to do it, that for sure!  The so-called great idea I said when I mean to level up of your character, higher weapon and armor as well however you can actually retire if you wish and therefore to make new character again! In return for the benefit to grant you ONE item per on any of your armor, weapon or accessory for higher damage or higher resistance and such after this, your character will wear the one item per called Heirloom which your previous character forged it and pass it on to your new character. What interesting me is having your own pet as companion although it only has cat or dog... BUT the companion will take your stuff back to town and sell it then return without even set up the portal to enter and sell it yourself! This team of Torchlight popping up the idea have been evolved to made this game much fun and not even Diablo have yet to add in gameplay.  The vertern team didn't make this game for nothing!

If you understand the difference between rogue, roguelike and roguelite then you probably already own this game, and if you don't, you will still enjoy it.   Simply put, this is an enjoyable dungeon crawler game with no downside. You pick one of 3 classes, akin to a tank, wizard, or ranger, and you go dungeon crawling to improve your gear and items so you can go deeper and deeper. That's it. Everything (grinding, levels, shared stash, socketed items, color-coded gear) here is fun and familiar if you've played any Blizzard game ever in the last 12 years.   Do try all three classes for each character, or at least as many as you like, until you find the one you like best. (Though if you do it like I did, with everyone at once, then you'll find inventory management to be a mini-game all its own.) You can adjust the difficutly setting and whether it's hardcore so you can tailor the game to be as hard or casual as you like. And if the price bothers you, wait for one of the ever-present Steam bundle sales and get it at half off!   I recommend this game. Every time I play it, I feel like I'm on the verge of understanding a deep mystery. About horses.",

Combat was So simplistic and So repetitive. - -I found three spells that worked together and the rest of the game was too easy. - -My brother actually made fun of me because I was TOO over powered!  I didn't fight through these dungeons, I walked through them at a slightly slower pace than I could have if there weren't mobs to slow me down.  Weapons and armor were lacking in variety and the levels of item (required to wear the equipment) Rarely correlated with stats. (Eg. lvl 40 necklace: +5 Dexterity)  Spells lacked in variety too. There are about 10-15 spells Total, and came in levels. There was little to distinguish one from the other.  - - Conclusion - -  This game kept me Mildly entertained, but I felt like I was grinding the Entire Time! Even bosses were boring.. I beat one without even realizing it was a floor boss!! I thought it was just a big tree.  I had a Lot more fun playing FATE.",

            "review_text": "Torchlight: a dull glow  I played Torchlight way back when it first came out, circa 2009. I enjoyed it, but there were some things that just nagged at me while I played it. Unfortunately, the more I played it, the less I liked it. Going further and further into the game did not increase my enjoyment. And I ultimately stopped playing.  Sadly that perfectly describes my most recent experience with Torchlight.  Iâve tried to figure out just what it is that I donât like, but every time I formulate my thoughts I come up with the same conclusion:  The game feels hollow and generic.  It doesnât seem to have itâs own identity or stand out as unique from other games in the ARPG genre. Hell, Torchlight is essentially an âHD remakeâ of Diablo from 1996â¦ without the âHell.â The game follows the same basic progression and is, in many ways the same game, but with less of an edge.  I feel that really hurts Torchlight.  Plenty of games can be fun without a cool in-game world or a âgrittyâ story hook to pull you in. Itâs gameplay that matters in the end, right? Sadly I think that Torchlight also falls flat here as well.  Torchlight is pretty a pretty shallow game, to its detriment. Killing monsters is fun in its own right, but only for so long. Other ARPGs alleviate this by giving you things to work for: new more powerful items, more powerful skills, harder challenges, etc. Torchlight does have all of these thingsâ¦ theyâre just not interesting. So although the game does have the âcarrot on a stickâ incentive to continue playingâ¦ Iâm, sadly, not interested in the carrot.  I found the gameplay to be rather lackluster and boring. Torchlightâs art style does not appeal to me. The environments lacked feeling, and ultimately felt sterile. The items in the game were shallow, and only the âuniqueâ items had any flavor. The various character skills werenât very impressive, and didnât feel very powerful.  But letâs break down the individual pieces of Torchlight and critique it against the five points I mentioned previously.  Atmosphere and Story  Atmosphere  the pervading tone or mood of a place, situation, or work of art.  Torchlight has little to no atmosphere. Certain areas in the game look pretty darn cool, but carry absolutely no feeling.  My favorite areas are a necropolis found underneath the mines beneath Torchlight (Yes, thatâs the name of the town) and the underground jungle-temple ruins beneath the necropolis. Why I like these two areas over all the others? Probably because they have the most âflavorâ. But even then itâs spread pretty thin.  There isnât much to be said about the gameâs various locales other than that they donât make much sense and require a bit too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.  Story an account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.  I consider story to be tied very closely with atmosphere, and like Torchlightâs atmosphere, there isnât really much to be said about the story. Itâs pretty generic and could be summarized in two sentences: âTorchlight was built over a corrupted source of magic caused by an ancient evil deep within the Earth. Go kill it.â  More accurately: The town of Torchlight is mining a substance called Ember, which allows for the various forms of magic in the world, but it turns out the Ember under Torchlight is corrupt and will turn anyone who comes into contact with it evil! This is because the Ember Vein runs over an ancient evil, later revealed to be a dragon. You are called to Torchlight to help the mining operation, which is being attacked by monsters, but are promptly betrayed by the man who summoned you. As it turns out he wants to revive the dragon sleeping beneath Torchlight. And you, the hero, have to stop him by traveling deeper and deeper into the Earth uncovering older and older civilizations that fell to the corrupting allure of the Ember.  Pretty good ideas! Not going to lie, thereâs definitely a cool story in there. But itâs really only used as an occasional spur to remind you to continue murdering monsters as you travel what seems like miles into the earth. A shame, really.  There is very little involvement in the story, and to be honest the voice acting is pretty hammy. If you like that sort of thing, then good on ya! I had to skip most of it.  But hey, atleast you can skip it! Actually all of it! Which is nice.  Enemies the persons who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.  Unfortunately, the enemies in torchlight are boring. There isnât any way around it. I donât like their designs, and none of them really seem to have any interesting mechanics to differentiate them. Theyâre all just bigger and bigger punching bags. Some will revive their comrades, and some will leave noxious fumes after death. But by and large, the majority of them are meat sacks that fling their bodies against your weapons.  It doesnât help that the enemies have massive spikes in difficulty towards the end of the game. There is a LARGE increase in enemy health and damage in the last area. And every time Iâve played, it has come as a shock.  Iâll be doing just fine, then Iâll walk into the last section of the game and be murdered. Only to find that Iâm unable to deal significant damage to the enemies. Their scaling seems to be off, and itâs just not fun.  Your Character  the representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.  Torchlight utilizes the typical stat system. Your RPG standards are all present: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Life, and Defense. Every time you level, the game gives you five points to allocate to each of these different parameters. Unfortunately it seems like the various stat points are really just a way of directing your progression. It didnât seem as though loading a bunch of points into Magic made my Alchemistâs magic any more powerful, despite it being his main damage stat. It seemed as though it was just a holdover from previous games. âDiablo had them, so Torchlight will too.â  Really the stats just felt like numbers I had to inflate in order to put on different armor. My characterâs power seemed to be located in the weapons and armor he was wearing rather than the character himself.  Skills  skill or expertise in a particular activity or field  Torchlight also follows a rather traditional skill tree format, present in almost every ARPG. Ever. Thatâs perfectly fine. Skill trees are used so commonly because they work. Sadly, the skills in Torchlight are boring. Plain and simple. The coolest spells I got for my Alchemist were Chain Lightning and a laser. Everything else rather boring.  I think that is was a major contributing factor to why Torchlight felt boring to me. The three different classes all had pretty boring skills. Nothing really stands out, and everything felt pretty lame.  Itemization  the balance and distribution of items, their types, and the various effects, powers, and statistics attached to them  Last but not least, the items. Again, there isnât a lot to say. Torchlightâs items were rather lacking. Most items are of the, â+10 fire damage,â â+20 lightning damage,â â+5% attack speedâ variety. Nothing to write home about.  This is probably the one aspect of the game where Torchlight tried its hardest to please me.  I received about 7 unique items before reaching level 15. Unique items are Torchlightâs highest rarity item, apparently. They were all decent, and some of the unique wands I found had cool effects that altered combat, like shots bouncing and releasing arcs of electricity on the ground. But they were little more than more powerful versions of the base items. Not particularly exciting.  Boring skills, boring monsters, boring items, boring combat.  Very sad indeed.",
