            "review_text": "Mindless satisfying fun.   Its hard to review a game seriously that doesn't take itself so. But there's a solid and fun game here with a great presentation. Broforce is an intense patriotic (USA) fueled side scrolling shoot'em up with heavy influences and inspiration from over the top American action films. Each character or 'bro' you get to play is a caricature of a hero of a film. RamBRO, BRO Dredd, BRO in Black, BROnan the BRObarian, etc etc. Each one is unique in their standard and special attacks and some even have some extra abilities. This variety keeps things interesting during this hectic shooter. You'll be fighting everything from terrorists to aliens to the undead. And all while dealing with the fully destructable tiled environment. Gaps, explosives, and falling stones will spell your doom just as much as the enemies firing at you. The campaign mode made for a great 5.4hrs of massacring fun. And there is other difficulties, arcade mode, and co-op/multiplayer compliments to all of it. Sprinkle in some level editing with Steam Workshop support and there's really something you can dive into here if you were so inclined.   Just with the fun of unlocking the bros and the campaign alone I think I got my money's worth. I'd still recommend a sale or bundle as its a safe game to place on the wait list. But while not a must play, its well worth it when you do. Fun and funny. Recommended BRO!",

I instantly fell in love with it's classic-inspired asthetics and mechanics and I was fortunate enough to be able to experience the growth of the game and community throughout the development process. All I can say now that the game is complete is that I could not be happier with the results.  This game is essentially Metal Slug directed by Michael Bay, literally on steroids, as all the characters are almost comically musclebound. Fast pased, with a high skill cap and tons of strategies for each Bro, you'll be spending hours messing around with the different characters to find your favorite. Myself being a speedrunner, I find endless replay value in games like this and I won't be stopping any time soon. I look forward to any expansions or community contribution in the future. BUY THIS GAME.",

But after a while you will just play it for the gameplay. -Gameplay: This a game is sooo hard. But it is sooo fun, the levels are made for the Replay Value. -Replay Value: There are at least 20 Different ways to complete the levels with each characters. -Characters: You unlock characters by rescuing other characters (Ex. 12 more rescues until next character unlock) All the characters are Movie Characters (Ex. Rambo) but they have 'Bro' in their name (Ex. Brambo). Each an every character is unique (Ex. You ;D) for different gameplay techniqes -Stabilty: Haven't experienced a crash yet, and I played the beta, still no crashes. -Local Support: You can have up to 4 people play on the same computer, I would recommend the Steam Link, Multiple Steam Controllers or Multiple Keyboards. -Controller Support: Full Controller Support. I recommend a controller. Seriously.",

Before I start my actual review, I would like to say that I have been following this game ever since it was still a web browser based free demo. I bought it as soon as it went onto steam, and have been a fan for an extremely long time.  This game is a side scroller like you have never seen before. Seriously. The entire premise of the game makes it one of the most fun games you can play with friends, with quick, decisive combat and characters that make you keep coming back for more. Playing on your own is challenging, but still extremely fun, something that seemingly is missing in most games of this genre. Playing with friends ups the ante, with coordination being a must to being succesful.   The constant update stream from the devs have brought us new levels, new bros, new game modes, online play, workshop support, the list goes on and on. Seriously, if you have 15$ right now. BUY IT. If you don't like it, you have steam refunds, so there is no worries anyways, but trust me, you will not put this game down for a while.",
