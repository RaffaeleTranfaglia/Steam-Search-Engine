            "review_text": "Honestly I feel like I found a diamond in the rough. Truthfully, this game honestly made me feel like an idiot, because word puzzles are perhaps one of the biggest things I struggle on. If you're great with word scrabbles then you'll breeze through this quickly. If you suffer like me, there is a steam video guide to help you out.  Visually this game is amazing. Everything in essence is simplistic, done very cleverly, and it changes suddenly when it comes to the final boss. Everything is fairly clear to see (with one or two things here and there), and the 'quotation' collectables aren't super hard to obtain or really fustraiting.   Gameplay-wise I have a few problems. Jumping sempt to be a little finicky at times, and its hard to tell what ledges you can and cannot grab; as well as seeing how FAR you can jump (protip, jump off of a ledge or you'll just drop straight down)  All in this game is beautiful. The soundtrack compliments the game VERY well. If you have a few hours to spare and want to do a type of puzzle that most video games don't really touch (and if its on sale), then I would HIGHLY recomend this game.",

If you enjoy games like Limbo or Inside, you will no doubt like this. The word puzzles are the most stand out feature of the game. Their functionallity has not changed between versions, but the additional words you can now make add a little flair to an already great game mechanic.",
