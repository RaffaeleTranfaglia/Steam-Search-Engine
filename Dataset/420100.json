            "review_text": "  (x-post  Anime Backgrounds )  CLANNAD Side Stories features 16 short episodic chapters on most of CLANNAD's diverse character cast. The stories are largely standalone, so while you don't necessarily need to have played CLANNAD to understand what's going on, personally I would still recommend playing CLANNAD first for maximum enjoyment.  On loading the game I immediately noticed a tremendous improvement in art quality. The CGs look absolutely stunning! If I'm not mistaken this had a different illustrator from the original CLANNAD game, but I must salute him/her for preserving the uniquely recognisable character designs of the game's heroines.  It is important to note that CLANNAD Side Stories has no save feature or skip function. Instead, you have to play through any one of the 16 episodes in a single sitting, hence I recommend only playing when you know you can have 20-30 minutes of uninterrupted gametime (each episode is about as long as your standard anime).   A feature which I felt this game badly needed was a CG gallery, with all the brand new beautiful pictures of the CLANNAD girls. While a standard feature in many VNs, this was not implemented in CLANNAD Side Stories. To counteract this I'd recommend taking Steam screenshots while playing the game, for your own litle keepsakes!  If you're a fan of CLANNAD, no doubt buy this game. It offers a modern polish to the original's arguably dated, crude artwork, all the while offering insights into the backstories of the characters, and taking them on brand new, albeit short adventures.",

It contains 16 short stories, each centering in one character's perspective. There's even one for Botan! Some explain little details which fill some voids from clannad.",
