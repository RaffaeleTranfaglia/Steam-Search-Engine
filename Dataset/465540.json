            "review_text": "While this game is certainly not 'bad' per se, I still cannot quite recommend it due to the simple fact that it is another game on steam which had its content removed for censoring reasons. I think that to be unforgivable and cannot recommend games that do this. What makes the matter worse is that the devs offer a patch that adds/unlocks the nudity artworks of this game, but they charge you extra for that. I find that to be quite the scumbag-move to say the least. People have already bought your game, so the least you could do is offer them the uncensored version for free. This kinda DLC mentality is really cancerous and needs to stop.  They only charge you $1 for it, but I have made it a policy to never pay for porn, so I got the patch from a different, free source. After looking at the content, I can wholeheartedly say that it ain't worth the money at all. I dunno what kind of images the official dev patch includes, but the one I got were all censored in typical Japanese manner with mosaics all over the place. If you wanted to pay for porn, you could surely do better with that $1 somewhere else.  The game itself is quite alright. It won't win any awards and isn't really deep, but it can entertain you for at least an hour or two. Since it is quite repetitive, though, it will become boring afterwards, unfortunately. I personally would wait for a sale since 5 bucks isn't something I consider to be this game's worth. At least the art is pretty and nice to look at.",
