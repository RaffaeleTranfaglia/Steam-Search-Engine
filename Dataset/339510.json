            "review_text": "Psy High is a solid piece of interactive fiction. Good, and worth full price, though not _great_. I found it an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half, and may replay it in future.  For those who haven't played a Choice Of game before, it's basically the natural evolution of Choose your Own Adventure Books, a few decades on. They're MUCH more refined than the CYOA books of the 80s, though. They're Wolfenstein: the New Order to the original Wolfenstein 3D.  You're given a short novel in which most important decisions are up to you, the reader. Whether the plot twist you decide on succeeds depends on the choices you've made so far - staying in character is rewarded, while out of character actions are less likely to work.   The character in question is the sum of your past choices. If at every turning point in the story so far, you've chosen to act like a selfish loner, don't expect to be able to successfully give an inspirational speech to rally others to your side. I've you've chosen sports over academics whenever you've been able to, you'll almost certainly succeed at physical challenges (or those involving swaying the sports team or its fans) while not necessarily having a good chance of passing that crucial history test.  The story of Psy High is exactly as described. If it were a live-action TV show, it wouldn't be (much) out of place on a DIsney afternoon line-up, or playing just before Charmed or Supernatural.  The writing is good enough to have often made me forget I was playing a game without graphics. The characters are your usual high school stereotypes, but handled competently. Choices have a satisfying level of consequence, but the game seldom presents you with unfixable mistakes.   In my playthrough, there were some strange jumps in the story near the end. I can't tell if this was a deliberate editing choice, or if a few 'pages' were missing in error. Though the jumps were a little jarring, I was still able to follow the story. (Imagine an episode of 24 not accounting for fifteen minutes of the 24 hours, near the end.)   There were two pretty noticeable weaknesses to the story - first, the central plot was completely predictable from just a few minutes in. A mystery to the reader, it certainly wasn't.  Second, although I think I chose the 'main' romance (kudos to Choice of Games for providing tons of tasteful choices for all preferences, as usual) it still felt pretty tacked on - almost as if most of the scenes and details had been added after the rest of the game was written.  Worth full price, but best for younger players (12-16).",

On the other hand, I won the Kingsport Scholar Award, I started dating in college, and life got better for me.  I have to admit, I was adamant about trying this game. After playing it, however, I'm very impressed by it. There was a little to be desired (graphics would have enhanced it, but imagining my own scenes and settings and characters with limited details was very appreciated) but overall, the game approaches the 'suffer your own consequences' angle very nicely, and I'm excited to play it again. Totally worth the money.",

That being said, as much as i really liked it it could have been a lot better. it felt like a story that i would write in middleschool, trying to shove all my fictional and logical ideas and detail into one very short story. There was almost no room for character development which was a huge dissapointment. For example i had the option to date a cgharacter in the story but had no option to learn more about them other than the fact i had a crush on them appearently. The story would benifit very much with extra revisions but in general it was a good story filled with romance, fantasy, and desision making which i love in any game or work of literature.",

It's worth the money, but if you don't like games like this then it's best to save your money rather than buying and regretting.  10/10",

            "review_text": "I've previously played Tin Star by Choice games and LOVED it. I totally reccommend it to anyone who's bought any of their other games.  Anyway, onto Psy High. It is definately not the worse interactive novel I have ever played, but not the best. I enjoyed all of the 5-6 hours I played it, however, and I believe I will play it again. It's an easy read, with a choice on every page but maybe a dozen. The writing is simple but not insulting, and the characters you interact with aren't bad. There's some suggestion with teenage stereotypes, but that's mostly directed towards you, and the path/dialouge options, which can be very direct and hand-holdy - though it isn't BAD, necessarily. I'm coming from playing Tin Star, which is much different and more detailed.  Anyway, the long and short of it is that the game IS good and is pretty original. It's another high school setting, but the story is pretty interesting. There's the option to be straight, gay, bisexual, and the ability to cause a lot of trouble around school by various avenues. It's worth the 2.99 I paid for it. If you want an interesting, homey/casual little adventure that takes place in a magical Massechusettes town, go ahead and pick the game up.",

            "review_text": "I've read through it once and I found it to be a really fun story although not groundbreaking and some parts were freaking rushed. Some scenes really needed more detail and the characters should have become more memorable throughout the story, sadly they didn't. I didn't really mind the absence of graphics and music or soundeffects. It still was a nice experience.  In general I really appreciated the tons of options one could choose from throughout the story, although some sounded very much alike. It weren't answers that could lead one to either victory or dead randomly ... the outcome made sense. I've played enough interactive stories (visual novels) to be able to tell that this isn't always the case.   Erm... What I thought was a bit off, was the money... Did one only have to save it up for the prom? How superficial. What I also didn't like was, that I really couldn't understand how the stats would change. Sometimes I chose options I thought would boost my magic stat for example... But it either didn't increase or it dropped. Whuuuuut. Maybe my character just slacked off too much, don't know.  What's more? Last but not least I liked the general look and feel. I don't know if the UI of the game is totally basic or not or if it's just considered basic but I liked it. One could check the stats and the achievements and oh well... it was nice.  So... I'd definitely recommend it. I mean, the story is nothing out of the ordinary but it is nice enough so it's definitely a game worth purchasing, even more so, since it's really at a fair price.",

            "review_text": "It's an... ok game. The first type of game I've played in this genre and I have to say it was underwhelming. It was really obvious what my choices would lead to and there weren't too many meaningful choices. I understand with the high school setting the most popular subjects to experience are popularity, romance, and friendships, but this game doesn't do well with any of these. Its a story game man with nothing but text. Theres not even a soundtrack. So what the game does present must be top notch. Romance is very linear and predictable because if you generally pick the 'flirty' option then you're gonna get the girl; but if you pick the 'awkward' option, you won't and it's pretty obvious which is which. Same problem with the friendships; very linear and most of the time fairly predictable. Also, at the start of the game, its very easy to gain altuistic points because you're helping people with stuff that you didn't even choose to do. The game just throws you into the world which is kind of cool, but there was no real background information. Like I have super powers man! Explain that ♥♥♥♥ for more than a few paragraphs! The characters are hardly memorable because they're the sterotype people you meet in high school; the childhood friend, the bad kid, the mean kid, the cheer captain, the football captain, the popular mean girl, ect. No one has a really unique story and its a shame because there was potential for them to be really fleshed out. Overall, this game is a good read if you're just bored as hell and have nothing else to play. Nostalgic because its high school but unimmersive because some of the dialouge is just weird and kids would never say that ♥♥♥♥. Fun because you can date multiple girls at once (which was the primary reason i played this game), but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because those girls don't ever seem to have interaction between each other. Final score: 5.5/10",
