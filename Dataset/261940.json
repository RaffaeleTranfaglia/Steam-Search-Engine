BUT even though it may seem to totally represent the early 80s cartoon, this is in fact based upon the NEW MCoG that is currently showing on tv of their adventures in China! So DO NOT expect the same voice overs, show intro, and locations...even though a huge majority is still intact from the 80s cartoon show. Now that that's said, let's get to the actual game. It's a puzzler. Based on 3 kids alternating to solve puzzles. The puzzles are not difficult at all and doesn't take more of an elementary level of knowledge to solve. I would definitely recommend this for kids, but for grown ups I would only recommend it for people who remembered and loved the early 80s show.  Rating: 5/10",

This is a children's game so the puzzles are simple and charming. Full grown fans like myself will like to play it to see the story unfold as our three brave heros search for another City of Gold in a far-away land, but I did grow bored of the simple puzzles after time. However, they are just the right level for younger fans! Nine stolen cheese wheels out of ten, mainly because the animation, but lovely, is kinda... off.",
