            "review_text": "I've caught a glimpse of the game, it caught my eye, and so I gave it a try. It seems my instincts were correct to see that the game kept my interest as I played through it. Keep in mind, I have not finished the game, but I have played through enough to give a good word for the game. This will be a first impressions, not a full review.  The game delivers exactly what the developers put on the game's description, so I have no need to repeat it, but just for fun...  This game features: - Unique,  innocent  evil monsters to  brutally murder  slay. - Challenging puzzles and fights, not frustratingly hard. - Iniquitous and vile wizards. - A corrupted, demented child you play as. - Completely legal practice of the dark arts of Necromancy. - Kidnapping. - A cute pug   that you murder because you're an evil child, but its okay, it'll be your undead friend now.   - Spooky skeletons. - Completely friendly families of kobolds. - And more...!  The general gist I get from this game is that it's an unique and charming take on the puzzle genre. The gameplay works exactly as intended, and each level brings different challenges so that it doesn't feel monotonous. The visuals and sound are fairly decent, they serve their purpose and don't sound and look terrible at all. Personally, however, while the menu music is amazing, the level music is a bit repetetive, but that can be easily turned off in the options menu. Speaking of the options menu, there's a slider for the master volume, the music, and the sound effects; video options for full screen, resolution, showing damage, and the language; and lastly controls, where you can enable keyboard and mouse with some rebindable keys. I'm not entirely sure how long the game will last you, but I've been at it for about two hours and still going. Lastly, the developers are very kind and has taken into consideration the bugs and suggestions that has been made.  Overall, this is a nice little charming gem of a game, I do recommend giving it a try if it seems to pique your interest. I will edit or add anything to this review as I play through it accordingly. If I missed anything, or if you are curious about something, do point it out.",
