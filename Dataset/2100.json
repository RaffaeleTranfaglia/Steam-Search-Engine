            "review_text": "I'm confused as to how this game received mixed reviews. This is simply one of the best videogames I've ever played. Sure it's story is generic but it is executed pretty darn well. What really stands out in this game is it's combat mechanics and I love games with an in-depth combat system. In all my experiences with combat mechanics in games, nothing tops this masterpiece of a game. It it truly satisfying to pull off different moves and have variation in what you do all of which affect your enemies in the slightest but most unique ways. Harness the potential power of your environment with throwable objects and traps to use against your enemies which is the most enjoyable part of this game. All of this is made possible with the SOURCE ENGINE! So not only do these abilities and such sound good but are executed equally as good!  What I also admire is it's Immense replayablility for a game that seems so linear. The game presents you these three playstyles that you can go full out on one or try and experiment between them and create cool hybrids. There are no boundaries, no 'choose your class' type ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it just gives you the game and goes 'go nuts'. And the repayability that this creates is awesome! Speaking of replayability, you can also find secret areas along your travels and the game also sports multiple endings!  All of this is played in FPS which adds onto the immersion. Not many fantasy games play out in FPS which makes this game pretty unique in that sense.  The game is more feature rich than you would think. But my only gripe about this game is the voice acting. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING...at least from the main protagonist. If you can get past it like I did, you'll have a bomb of a time.  Note: Do not buy this game for the multiplayer, I've tried it and absolutely NOBODY plays it.  9/10",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell: a very good (and different than the mainstream) game, with some flaws. Highly recommended, and the price is very low; give it some initial love, and you will be rewarded by several hours of enjoyable gameplay. Want details? Read below.  When I first heard about this game, I thought 'Come on, melee fighting in... first-person view only? Ridiculous.' It turns out it is way better than I thought. The game actually manages to be very enjoyable, despite the fact it has its flaws. Yes, the first-person view is a major flaw because you can't see much, as a big part of the screen is covered by your shield, your daggers, or even your own hands when using some spells. However, in practice it is not as bad as it sounds, and in some ways first-person view makes things more interesting, provided you get used to the hitboxes of your weapons.  The learning curve is rather steep in the beginning, but it gets better soon. The game is not an RPG really, but has some RPG elements. There is no experience or stats; you earn skill points as you complete your objectives, and you can use those skill points to learn some abilities or spells; neat and simple. There are no classes; instead, there are three skill trees, somehow representing the typical fighter, rogue/archer, and mage classes. However, the player is free to distibute skill points as he/she pleases, so it is quite possible to be a warrior with some magical or stealth abilities, and such combinations actually work very well in practice. I personally found the sword fighter + archer combo quite enjoyable, and probably the easiest way to play this game. A 'thief' build is also interesting, and it is actually quite possible to go stealth for the most part of the game.  Melee fighting is probably the most interesting aspect of Dark Messiah. You have some fighting moves, and using them you can make your opponent walking lame, or you can decapitate him. Fighting is far from being the usual, boring click fest. It needs player's skills instead. As usual in similar PC games, the controls are clunky, and some players will probably quit playing early because of this. For example, hold left mouse button 'for a second' to activate power attack; hold direction keys while holding down the left mouse key to activate alternative power attacks; additionally, hold space bar for a jump attack. All that when you have a bunch of enemies in front of you. Seriously, if that's not clunky controls, I don't know what 'clunky controls' means. Things would be way better if you could use a controller instead of mouse and keyboard. Nevertheless, once you get used of the controls, melee fighting is really enjoyable. It has not the nice controls of Dark Souls, but it is still quite enjoyable. Most players will probably pick a warrior combo because of this, despite the controls.  As in Half-Life 2, you can use the environment to get rid of your enemies. Shoot a loose supporting beam so that the barrels above fall on a bunch of bad guys; cut a rope so that a rock pendulum hits a mighty cyclops that blocks your way; kick your enemy so that he falls off a cliff, etc. Physics reminds Half-Life 2, and that's not a coincidence, as Dark Messiah uses the same game engine. Using the environment is just another nice aspect of the game.  The plot is nothing innovative, but it is certainly interesting. You are a guy, trying to get an ancient artifact from the bad guys. Nothing new so far; however, there are two hot girls hitting on you. Leanna is the 'good girl' who will fight on your side in many cases, and eventually falls in love with you, although she is too shy to admit it openly. Xana is some kind of a succubus, a demonic creature that lives inside you, gives you useful information depending on the situation and, most importantly, comments on what's going on. Xana's commentary is actually the funniest part of this game: she is jealous about Leanna, and always has some ironic and quite funny comments about her. A spice of humor is spread all over the game. It's not only Xana's comments mentioned above, but also NPCs talk to eachother, quite often in a funny way: enemy soldiers talking about their boss ironically, goblins discussing if they should eat the orc they just killed, and several other things that will make you smile. There are some nice cutscenes, but luckily the developers didn't overuse them. I am really tired of today's ridiculous 'AAA' games with a cutscene every few seconds and zero gameplay. Dark Messiah is definitely not one of them, and I am quite happy with that.  Eventually, you will have to take decisions, which leads to a few different endings of the game. However, the game is basically linear; personally, I prefer that instead of the chaotic gameplay of Elder Scrolls, for example - although a lttle more non-linearity in Dark Messiah would be nice. Not to mention fighting in Dark Messiah is actually way better than the simplistic fighting in Elder Scrolls. Hard to remember a similar, but non-linear game, that managed to keep me playing till its end.  Graphics are typical for the Source engine used. Although not that realistic as in modern games, graphics certainly serve their purpose very well. I also liked the music of the game, and in general sound does its job: no complaints, no awards. Voice actors also do their job, with Moon Dailly performing very well as Xana.  There is also a multiplayer mode for Dark Messiah. I imagine this would be quite fun, but sadly it is non-existant in practice. Official server is down, probably because this game was first released 9 years ago. Unless you have friends interested to play, forget about multiplayer.  I read some people had techinical issues with this game. This was not the case for me; no issues in a mediocre laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. No FPS drops, no tearing, with maximum quality settings on - very good performance, typical for the Source engine used in the game. I had a few game crashes, especially when running other programs in the background, but nothing really serious, and probably caused by the laptop's low RAM.  The game is rather easy in 'normal' mode - provided you pass the steep initial learning curve. There are some annoyingly hard enemies, but in general you won't have serious problems beating the game, including bosses. Expect a 20-30 hours of gameplay in your first playthrough, if you want to explore everything and find all secret places in the game. Replayability is rather low: once I beated the game, I started over using a stealth build and tried a different ending but, other than that, there is no more replayability to talk of.  Final verdict: I don't give a positive review easily, but Dark Messiah definitely desrves it, despite the flaws mentioned. Taking into account its price, I'd say it's a bargain, and highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "A cult classic from the creators of Dishonored, Dark Messiah is an interesting game. It's listed as an RPG but that's misleading; it's like calling Dishonored an RPG. Both have skill trees, both have a very small amount of decision making which results in low chaos vs high chaos in Dishonored. Without spoiling anything, Dark Messiah is similar in that regard. It's not truly an RPG, you don't have control over your character's physical and personality attributes and there are no dialogue choices or anything like that. There are simply three major plot decisions.  One particularly interesting aspect in this game is that you don't necessarily play as the good guy. I'll just leave it at that without spoiling much.  This game is known primarily for its gameplay mechanics, combat in particular. It's a first person action game that has separate skill trees for melee combat, magic, archery, as well as some miscellaneous skill trees. Furthermore, there are different types of melee weapons to choose from: twin daggers, swords, and staves. Each has different properties, pros, cons, and combat animations.   One of the best features of this game's melee combat is that you have different swings/strokes depending on your movement. Holding W and releasing a power attack for example delivers a different attack than holding A + power strike. This is something I've demanded for years, and this is one of few games that offers it.  Most spells are offensive and elemental based but there are some exceptions. The player is expected to go down every weapon skill tree apparently, since archery is too useful in boss fights.  This being a source game, it's almost entirely physics based. Arkane Studios took advantage of this and emphasized using the environment to kill your opponents. Knock down a bunch of heavy debris on them, kick them off of a cliff, impale them on spikes, you name it. Combined with the ability to chain spell effects and other things together (e.g., spill oil on an area and light it on fire with a fire spell or arrow, or shoot a lightning spell into water to electrify it), Dark Messiah seems to provide more ways to kill opponents than any other game, and you can see from my library that I've played a lot. Even more ways to kill people than Dishonored, which lacks the environmental emphasis.  People often say that The Elder Scrolls games should have this game's combat. They are absolutely right. Conceptually, this game has the best combat mechanics of any action game. However, despite everything I just said, the gameplay/combat is riddled with flaws/oversights, the game lacks an engaging story/plot (RotFodder's pizza analogy is spot on), and it may be a bit too long for its own good.   The combat is fantastic on paper but has flawed execution. First of all, the game is quite rough around the edges and clipping issues are fairly common which is extremely annoying. There are some stupid delays when blocking attacks and counter attacking, or using daggers, and other situational things like that. Also, unlike most first person action games, you actually have to be very precise with your swings. It seems like the player's hitbox with melee weapons is actually the weapon itself; this makes sense, however it's not good in practice. This type of thing only works in a game with very precise swinging and more fluidity, like Shadow Warrior and Dark Souls games. Reach/range is really wonky in this game. Goblins seem to have the same reach as humans and orcs.   At the end of the day this game comes across as quite clunky by modern standards, but by 2006 standards it must have been a gift from God (I didn't play it in 2006 but I've played plenty of 2006 games in 2006, Red Steel was the best action game I had played at the time). Because of it's clunkiness I find it less enjoyable than Dishonored as an action game. Dishonored's mix of advanced action mechanics and unbelievable, flawless fluidity is only matched by Shadow Warrior and Shadow Warrior 2 as far as first person action games go. But then Dark Messiah has so many advantages like the environmental uses, spell/effect combos, and more varied melee attacks than Dishonored. As usual, we'll never get it all.  Dark Messiah is known to be challenging, but it has that old school unbalanced challenge where if you raise the difficulty, enemies just deal far more damage than you even when using the same attack. It will take around ten flame arrow spells to kill a regular human opponent for example, but they can kill you in four (and that's with upgraded max health). If you like unbalanced no holds barred difficulty then perhaps you'll like this, otherwise I recommend sticking to Normal mode which is more balanced. I favor balanced difficulty with smart AI. This game's AI is functional enough although hilariously bad at times.  Dishonored is known for its stealth, and that's one area where this game lacks. It's far more linear than Dishonored, the climbing system is awfully clunky and barely works (clunkier than Thief Gold's even), and you're generally unable to one hit kill enemies from behind even with backstab. This game is clearly meant to be an action game first, stealth game secondary. Dishonored and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided are the only games I've played that are equally proficient at both.  In terms of atmosphere, this game bears an uncanny resemblence to Thief at times. Some sections even tricked me into pressing Thief's key bindings! The resemblence is so strong at times, particularly in crypts. This game also has a Rope Bow for shooting rope arrows into wooden surfaces... sound familiar? Although Thief's rope arrows are less restricted and work more often.  It's no secret that this game relies entirely on its combat. The plot and all of the dialogue are pure cheese. It's cliche after cliche. Character development is mostly non existent. This is all intentional though, the game is not meant to have an enthralling story or serve as a drama of any sort. It's just meant to provide a challenging but very fun killing experience. It mostly does that, although its clunkiness and lack of polish makes it frustrating at times. Plenty of times this game would get tiresome and repetitive, but then I'd unlock a new ability and all of a sudden it's fun again until I use that ability many times.  TL:DR - This game is all about killing things and it has very good killing mechanics overall, the best on paper as far as action games go but the fact that it's somewhat clunky and very unpolished can make it annoying. It's meant to be fun and challenging, and it mostly succeeds but with a number of hitches. It drags on a bit and gets tiresome toward the end. Decent game, I'd love a sequel on Source 2.  I did not proofread this review.",

            "review_text": "This is such a great game. Everything about it is so cool! I'd place it near the pinnacle of first-person fantasy combat in all three archetypes: melee combat, stealth combat, and wizardry. The movement is rather unique among fps games in that your character has weight that you can see and feel, and it makes you have to think as you move through combat. Also, YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF; your body is rendered, and your choice of armor and equipment show. It looks nice for an older game, and, since it is older, it runs beutifully on a new system. The atmosphere is excellent, and the story is clever and well paced too. You even have story changing choices! Player agency! I can go on and on about how much I love this game! The environment is interactive. The character progression is great, picking perks in the different archetypes: melee sword and sometimes board, Legolas archery, ninja stealth, and powerful sorcery. You can specialize or mix and match to suit your playstyle. This adds so much replayability. I'm playing through again as a Wizard after a cool run as a Warrior type, and I'll go again. It's such a great game! Buy it! Play it!   10/10 Two enthusiastic thumbs up!  This is a gem of fantasy fps gaming.",

            "review_text": "This is the first Might and Magic Game I've played. So my review will be based on that.  First of all, THIS GAME IS SHORT. You can probably beat in &lt; 10 hours meaning one day of zoning out on the computer and bam, the final boss is down. The game is divided into 10 chapters with each chapter representing an area. Secondly, this game is as linear as it gets - there is an order for every place and you can't go back - just like FFXIII.   The leveling system is also a bit weird - everything is done in skill points which are obtained by going through the storyline. There are a few optional skill points as well - for finding secret areas or completing optional quests but those are few and far. You determine your characters 'class' by spending skill points.   Another thing to note - THERE IS NO TRADING. You can keep items in your inventory, use them, or drop them. That's it. The only healing you get is either through magic or healing items and mana restoration is only available via mana items which can only be found. So be very careful on how you use what you have.  On an overall note this game is different, it's short, linear, and kind of limited, but it was still fun to play. So if you are looking for something and this game is on sale for under 10 bucks then this may be the game for you.  RATING: 6.5/10.",

There are those who get tired of all its bugs, poor programming, and loading times, and overall lack of polish, and hate the game. Then you have those who endure; stick with it despite its shortcomings and love the game. This is reflected on ModDB (Mod Database) where the game has an overall score of 9.5 out of 10 at the time of writing. Ironic then that the game doesn’t have much in the way of mods – only small ones which are more like fixes that aren’t highly publicised. But I can’t think why anyone would want to mod it actually. Because even though it is flawed (and completely bearable compared to the console version developed for the Xbox 360), it is a fantasy-themed action role-playing gamer’s dream come true. It couldn’t really be improved that much more gameplay wise if you tried. If you’re the type who ate up the likes of Diablo and its sequels, then you should probably try this. It's highly underrated.   There’s a very good reason why it goes on my list of best games I’ve ever owned. Because it is a bloody blast to play. And that’s what really matters in the end. ",

Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (DMoMaM) is an offshoot of the Might and Magic series (likely most known for Heroes of Might and Magic) that uses the Source Engine, and like any good source game of the time, DMoMaM takes full advantage of the engine's physics capabilities. Unlike other Might and Magic games, Dark Messiah places the player in the first-person boots of Sareth, apprentice of the Wizard Phenrig, and sends them on a perfect lengthed adventure.  In Dark Messiah, combat steals the show. There are three main styles of play, Stealth, Melee and Magic (though one may be able to keep some middleground between these). All three styles have their advantages and disadvantages, which you play and use your skill points on ultimately comes down to the player's personal preference. Combat with all three is a sandbox. Sword combos stagger and send your enemies flying, watch foes fight their charmed comrades or just throw a barrel at someone as they run towards you. Almost any object in the game world that isn't nailed down can be picked up and throwed, or for magic users, used as an even more deadly projectile. Every time you play Dark Messiah, the physics based combat and combinations of playstyles always brings you a new and extremely enjoyable combat experience.  No matter which of the three 'styles' you play, there is one shared mechanic that is not only essential to certain combat situations, but just damn fun, that mechanic being the F key. Kick an unsuspecting guard into a conveniently placed wall of spikes, kick a shield to stagger your opponent, leaving you a few moments to strike, kick your foe of a cliff and watch his friend come in for the kill. Your boot in Dark Messiah is a fantastic weapon, and an excellent bit of fun in such a physics orientated world.  The story is boring and ultimately ignorable, with a few decisions throughout, but the gameplay makes DMoMaM an excellent experience.",

The story was interesting, and some of the characters are pretty memorable (your psycho♥♥♥♥♥ guide). Music is kind of forgettable.  The combat is where most of the fun comes from. It feel right. The impact of some of the swings, the kicks(which you will be doing a lot), and some of the traps look realistically painful. The physics are wonky, but this is early source. Just kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of those damn goblins and send them flying off a cliff. There's not much loot, but the loot you get looks pretty badass. ",

            "review_text": "Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic was a game I had played the demo for at roughly 10 years old. I passed so many hours kicking orcs off of high ledges in the sandbox area provided in the demo and finding it amazing how nice the game looked in comparison to Half Life 2. Recently, with some cash left over from the Winter Sale, I picked up a copy of it and spent two ~7 hour sessions playing through the entirety of the campaign and laughing my ♥♥♥ off.   Describing this game as an RPG feels somewhat disingenious, at least by my definition of an RPG. Those expecting a thorough, immersive high fantasy experience will (probably) be disappointed. If you're looking for some dumb, hack-and-slash, first person sword/magic combat, you'll get exactly what you want. Dark Messiah perfectly blends a mid-2000's E3 FPS tech demo and a hack-and-slash RPG. Kicking orcs, goblins, guards, and ghouls around is immensely satisfying. Hell, the sword-and-board combat itself feels nice and meaty. While I didn't focus on it too much, and only placed a few points into magic abilities, they do feel a bit lackluster, but Telekinesis is endless fun. Overall, the game makes up for its few faults by being immensely satisfying, fun, and rewarding  A word of warning, however. While now nearly ten years old, Dark Messiah is admittedly dated. Running on the 2004 version of the Source Engine, (I believe, at least, I know that it certainly isn't running on the Orange Box engine,) patch after patch has made the game a bit unstable. I experienced about 15 crashes between these two sessions, but considering the game's now low requirements, getting back into the game is just a minor inconvenience, this along with the rapid climb in difficulty will ensure you're saving quite frequently. There are a few things that don't quite play as well as they did in the unpatched, 2006 version of the game, one of my major gripes being the few boss fights speckled throughout the campaign. Some of them just are not particularly fun from a gameplay perspective, but luckily are few and far between.  Altogether, my run of Dark Messiah: Might and Magic came out to about 12 hours or so, playing on Hard. I imagine the game can range from about 5-20 hours depending on your difficulty and speed of play. Overall, if you enjoy physics combat gimmicks and kicking orcs off large cliffs, and generally just 'running up on fools,' and don't mind some early Source Engine jank, Dark Messiah is a game for you.",

Jesus quickly adapts to this fantasy environment, and after taming a dragon, you will spend much of your time freeing the populace from the dominion of the evil Pharisees, led by a mirror-universe clone of Judas, Jesus' closest ally back in the true world. Although the game overuses your ability to turn water into wine and raise the dead, it's a very strong game overall, and by the time Jesus is telling a newly-decapitated orc 'let he who is without a head cast the first spell,' you'll be happy you bought this game.",

            "review_text": "A first-person hack n' slash RPG made by a bunch of people who had the balls to try something a bit different, and in my opinion succeeded for the most part. It won't hold your hand and you will start off under-powered and fighting uphill for a long while. However, this means that when you're hacking off heads left and right in the late-game and the characters comment on your growth in power, you actually understand what they mean.  The combat is one of the best parts of the game - the swordplay is fairly intuitive, the shield blocks effectively, and there's no weapon or armour degradation getting in the way of fun gameplay. Also, once you work out how to score a headshot with the bow, stealth attacks become fun and effective. Yes, there's a bit of kicking - kicking people off ledges or into spikes or down stairs, but I didn't feel I was oversaturated with this option and I felt that it aided me when I needed it.   It is, however, somewhat baffling that a game operating under the 'Might and Magic' umbrella railroads you into choosing the 'might' path over magic on more than one occasion. I feel sorry for the poor sod who threw all his experience points into spells, and then has to fight the orc warlord under the condition of 'no spells'. The fight is hard enough as it is without having to battle his 5 cronies at the same time while awkwardly switching from one spell to another as you can't equip more than one spell at a time.   Similarly, to utilise armours (of which there are 3 very specific types - warrior, stealth, and mage armours) the game forces you to level very specific traits up. Meaning that you are, once again, railroaded into making certain skill choices which makes you realise that the game would be the same if they'd simply asked you if you wanted to be a warrior, assassin or mage at the start and that the concept of organic skill choice in this game is mostly an illusion.   That said, I'm talking a lot about little niggly things - overall I had a lot of fun, and the game does allow a fair degree of freedom when it comes to your choices in the story, so I would highly recommend it, especially for a sale price.   PROS:  * Responsive and fun combat that utilises the environment well and genuinely provides a varied and free experience.  * The texture detail is quite good and I felt the Source engine was used to good effect.  * A story you can actually follow.  * The difficulty can be genuinely challenging, forcing you to think rather than just hack about.   CONS:  * Occasionally frustrating platforming elements.  * The characterisations of the women are grating, as they constantly fawn over you in what seems to be rather creepy wish-fulfillment for the developers. * Those that like to be a jack-of-all-trades will be disadvantaged. * The difficulty can be frustratingly punishing, resulting in multiple restarts because of tiny errors.

There's a basic RPG framework built into the game that allows you to choose specialisation in three different primary areas of mastery. Stealth, Magic, and Weaponmastery. The enemy variety is mixed up enough to keep you from getting too bored, but the formula is pretty much the same for most humanoid enemies. The game includes a kick that has the ability to knock back a lot of enemies, and the game liberally places hazards for you to take advantage of, so most often it's a lot easier for you to just kick someone off of a ledge or into spikes than actually fight them. I feel the game is geniunely very difficult without taking the heal spell from the mage tree, but other than that, you can play the game without there being too many necessary skills.

            "review_text": "This is one of my favorite games ever, and arguably the one that has the best 1st person swordplay action to date, including The Elder Scroll series, Chivalry, War of the Roses and the like.  There's three basic classes: Warrior, Wizard and Thief. This sounds restrictive at first, but apart from the fact that you can play the entire game 3 times and get a totally different experience out of it every time depending on your class, you can also just distribute your level-up points in all three skill trees as you see fit and mix it up. Even for a warrior, it's pretty useful to be able to turn enemies against each other or to spot traps or hidden doors; Even for a mage, it's useful to do more damage with your staff or sneak around more effectively, and even for a thief/assassin, it's useful to be able to disarm enemies or create magic invisible fire traps.  The story is cool and intriguing with a couple of big optional choices and side missions that affect it, the locations beautiful and diverse (although the graphics are a little outdated, of course), exploration and sneaking fun and immersive, boss fights pretty unique and against several pretty BIG enemies, the RPG mechanics balanced and the fights badass and VERY satisfying - and this is the meat of the game. You can disarm foes, dismember them, burn them, shrink them, zap them, freeze them, stealthkill them, kick them into spikes and fires or off cliffs or into other enemies and use the environement in all kinds of other creative ways (cut/shoot ropes to have large objects drop on or swing at enemies, or to collapse bridges or pillars to crush enemies, create fire arrows by simply holding an arrow into any fire, and shooting into oil puddles or at enemies directly - sometimes after you picked up an oil pot and threw it in their face for that extra-crispiness. You can of course use firespells for that, too.). The cool implementation of the environment into the combat always has you looking for opportunities at any location, which makes both planning fights from the shadows and thinking on your feet in hairy combat situations a lot of fun, and you feel like a proper badass after a huge fight that was so awesome that it could have been featured in a movie. This game makes you feel badass, and you feel like you EARNED to feel badass. Enemies include humans, goblin and orcs (warriors, archers or wizards of all sorts), zombies and skeletons, quasi-dragons, spiders, trolls and more, and they often require different tactics.  Oh, and you get *SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, SORT OF (because you can set 'change form' in the key bindings anyway)* the ability to turn into an 'Alien'-like demon form later on, which I hardly used, but well, if you're into that sort of thing...*END OF ZOMG SPOILER*  You'll also do a lot of freeclimbing with the ability to grab ledges and the use of chains and ropes (You get Thief-style rope arrows later on, too!). All of this in 1st person, which is very immersive and simply works well, especially since you have full body awareness, meaning the model that exists in the world is also the one you see from your perspective - and it throws a shadow. You're not a camera on a stick with fake arms on the side, you're ♥♥♥♥ing IN there.  I was a bit disappointed in the MP back then because it was too fast for my taste (and in comparison to SP) and didn't have any objective maps - or co-op. No mods to speak of either, which is unbelievable for a somewhat unique gem like this, especially since it's a Source game.  Dark Messiah was made by Arkane, btw, who later made DisHonored. It is rather linear, so don't expect anything like Skyrim - but that's not a bad thing since Dark messiah is a different experience altogether, in a good way. It does have its flaws, but overall, it's a great experience.  Damn, I just wanted to write a sentence or two... Anyway, I just installed Dark Messiah again to play through it for the 7th time (I think), despite having some awesome new games I haven't played or finished yet.

If you turn the difficulty all the way up, it's just like playing Dark Souls but in first person! Even a single zombie can kill you. If I didn't use all the combination of weapons I had (swords, daggers, bows) and also magic, I couldn't get past even the 3rd chapter. This is NOT a game to go hack/slash in. You will die as quick as you start fighting.   + The RPG elements are fun and although aren't as deep as any traditional RPG, they are fun to mess around with. I played as a pyromaniac swordsman and it was definitely fun! BUT read the final negative below point as well.  + Lots of ways to set off physical traps and kill you enemies with. For example, cut a rope holding up a bunch of logs and watch it fall down on your enemies. Never gets tiring.  + The game is barely more than 10 hours long. First playthrough anyway but because of last point, there's moderate to high replayability.  +You can kick enemies into spikes and pits.  - There are lots of bugs. I encountered a lot anyway. Graphical, like black boxes appearing over my spells when fired. Controls, like assigning a spell to a number on my keyboard and not having the spell come up even though I pressed the corresponding number several times. This gets very annoying especially when you're in a tight situation and want to change your weapon or change to a spell. It just doesn't work sometimes. Sound bugs, as in voice overs repeating or missing or playing in the wrong places which could mislead the player. As I said, lots of bugs.  - Platforming is CRAP. It was bad in Half Life games and it's still bad here. And the fact that there's almost a high amount of it in the game makes it the more painful. You even have a bow which extends a rope down for you to climb and this gives possibilities to explore more of the world or just get past levels but the jumping and walking controls are so loose that it just doesn't work in an enjoyable way.  - Most of the time your objective becomes VERY obscure and I personally got lost a lot in most of the maps simply because the exit to some rooms were so out of sight and unlikely to be where they actually are that I needed to look at walkthroughs in some places just to know how to get out of a certain dungeon.  - The story is almost non-existent. Don't come into this expecting any cohesive, attractive story or ending. Even though there are 4 endings, they are alll equally predictable and not worth playing the game for.   - multiplayer is long dead. Unless you have other friends who have the game on steam. But it's nothing special. Passable.  - Most of the time, the game throws loads and loads of enemies at you which seems more like what a shooter would do than a game like this. Soon it becomes such a chore to manage a crowd of 5 ferral ghouls who are attacking you from all sides.  - The RPG elements are fun but really unbalanced. You find so many weapons from the 3rd chapter on that you can't equip way into the game unless you were super pin-pointed towards a certain role (fighter, archer,white mage, black mage, thief). If you want to spread out a little like, say, be a white mage/thief, you're not going to accumulate enough upgrade points to truly be that until the very end levels of the game. That seems pointless to me as well as the fact that some classes like archers and thiefs will never be strong enough to take on most of the enemies in a game which is so close-combat oriented. The fact that you don't get any experience from defeating enemies but only from story checkpoints is a very bad choice to me.    As you see, I can say the game has much potential and I am going to give it a thumbs up even though it annoyed and frustrated me as much as I enjoyed some of its better moments. If you're willing to risk, give it a go. I'm sure you'll find your own reason to like it. It tries to be deeper than what it is and sometimes that's both a blessing and a curse.",

            "review_text": "I bought an hard copy (DVD) of this game around 2008 and indeed I had much fun with it. It's your standard 'Action RPG' and the gameplay is mainly focused on melee combat, however you can use bows and magic projectiles as well.   By progressing trough the game, ie. completing the quest (which are in linear succession) and killing enemies you earn experience and skill points which you can put into Combat, Magic or Mixed Skill trees. You also aquire objects. Some of these require you to have a particular skill, so choose well.  Although usually the game is a first-person 'hack and slash', you also have sections where you are unharmed (and muct avoid enemies) or you must chase an enemy through rooftops etc...  The gameplay is fairly linear, this is not a sandbox or open world RPG, but it's fun. Sometimes the combat can get a bit repetitive, but it is satisfying overall.  One of the main perks of the combat is the variety of ways you can kill your opponents. You can used situational hazards like fire or spikes and kick your opponents into them to kill them. You can also pick up objects such as crates, vases or shovels to throw at them, you can kick them off ledges, rooftops, etc.  There is some witty humor in the game and the story, although perhaps not innovative is quite interesting.   GRAPHICS: very nice... still hold up to this day... it has aged fairly well. Only problem often things are too damn dark (which is easily solved by the 'night vision' spell you get at the beginning at the game and uses no mana)  AUDIO: nice music and voice acting is decent. Only complaint is your own footsteps. If you are wearing earphones it sounds like someone is banging at the door when you walk... you simply can't immerse yourself into a stealthy gameplay when you sound like that when walking...  GAMEPLAY: nice combat system, fun and satisfying, although a bit repetitive sometimes. Might be a bit tough in the beginning (getting the healing spell REALLY helps), but it's not a very hard game (not on normal difficulty at least)  Also the game offers a variety of locations, which is nice.  TECHNICAL: Worked fine on Windows XP and Windows 7 (when I played w my physical copy) and works fine with windows 8.1 too. Not sure why some people complain... Maybe Win10 is screwing this game too? ((many negative reviews on older games indeed relate on the fact that they are unplayable on Win10))  It's quite stable (never run into big bugs)   ---  So overall I am recommending this game. I re-bought it on STEAM (although I still have a physical disk somewhere) for like 1 US dollar or so... truly a bargain. Normal price is like 4 dollars anyway... still a bargain!   If you like action RPGs Dark Messiah is right up your alley!",

            "review_text": "I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.   One Hour Reviews #38 - Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic  I played a number of the very early Might &amp; Magic Games. In particular I remember playing a ton of Might &amp; Magic VI. I remember it as a role playing game before the Heroes of Might and Magic series overshadowed it with a completely different type of gameplay and focus on strategy.  Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a different beast altogether. It's not a turn based strategy game like Heroes is. But it's also not an RPG like the original games either. This is more of an action RPG, with an emphasis on the action. You do have some RPG aspects, for example the game provides 3 skills trees, one for melee, one for magic, and a third for other skills. The early skills are cheap, so it's easy to dabble in each of the skill trees. I found this to be good because I was primarily focusing on melee, but early on I found it extremely helpful to train a heal spell. I noticed I wasn't really healing on my own, but I would slowly get mana back, so being able to trade mana for health made things a lot easier.  Even with the skill tress and RPG elements, I still consider this game pretty RPG-lite. If you are looking for an open-world type game, this isn't for you. The story is linear and really the game feels more like an adventure game with an emphasis on combat than a typical RPG. This may sound like a turnoff, but the combat is actually a lot of fun. I really liked the feel of combat. It isn't just smashing buttons or turning on auto-attack.   Another nice aspect to this game is the interactivity with the environment. The game encourages you to kick the crap out of your enemies, either into a fire, or into a convieniently placed spike rack, or over the edge of a railing. In fact arguably your foot is the best weapon in the game, at least from what I saw.  Probably the most fun I had in my hour of play involved a chandelier. I cut a rope which caused this chandelier to start swinging around. Meanwhile I had about 4 guards chasing me. I'd run past the chandelier while it was on it's upswing, and the guards would stupidly follow me without paying attention and get smacked as the chandelier came back down. It was kind of ridiculous as I'd watch the guards body ragdoll it's way across the room as if it was hit by a wrecking ball. After about 3 laps around the room, I had killed all of the guards by chandelier.  My only complaint about the game was it was rather crash prone. It crashed 3 times on me in the hour I played. Once it crashed on startup, once it crashed as I was quitting the game, and once it crashed in the middle of the game. Perhaps this is from me running Windows 10 (the game came out for Windows XP). Looking at other reviews, this doesn't seem to be a common issue, so it may just be something specific with my setup.  Overall, the combat alone is enough to make this game fun, and to earn my recommendation. I did not check out the multiplayer version of this, so my entire review is only based on the single player game.",

        {
            "review_text": "At the right price, it's an OK buy.  Combat is too easy in the beginning, but too wacky in the end. For example, staffs are great at the beginning, but they require magic affinity later on. Eventually, they're awful since enemies move way too fast (such as ghouls and vampire knights), so those magic affinity points are wasted. You don't really need them even for casting spells since mana potions recover mana at a fixed 50 mp/potion. Daggers are the weapon of choice later on, but early on, you really can't assassinate everyone, especially when playing on hardcore. Going stealth really doesn't yield many combat options aside from equipping stronger daggers and armor, but later on, you don't care anyway since you're just slashing like crazy to land hits on those fast enemies anyway.   Archery's mad weak. Don't even bother going for headshots. They don't count.  Magic is only good in the mid game. In the beginning, spells are too weak. In the end, they're strong, but only against individual enemies which means it doesn't help against packs (until you unlock inferno and sanctuary which are way OP, but only if you land the initial hit. If you miss, then you might as well just reload your quicksave since you'll be dead before you know it).   The story's kind of interesting. It makes you really think about good and evil since the plot isn't straightforward. Good guy orcs that fight against not so bad demons is a neat angle, and in between is a powerhungry necromancer leader who's trying to stop a prophecy from coming true. You can really think about why you're doing what you're doing. The story never really explains why your father is locked away by dragons either, and it makes you wonder if his 'demonic' heritage is only opposed based on what he looks like. There's no real indication that the demons did anything 'bad' to deserve getting locked away.  Also, the rope bow gives a lot of exploration options, and combined with the burglary skill, you can find a lot of helpful loot. Actually, you'll end up throwing a lot of gear away just to make space for future discoveries.   The game seems to offer the chance to play through in many different ways, but ultimately, you really can't. You use staffs in the beginning, daggers later on, and a few support spells (freeze, charm, and heal) to carry you through...  ...and all the while, kicking enemies off a cliff, into a fire, or into a wall of spikes is still your coup de grace.",

I figured for sure a second playthrough as a fighter-mage would be even more epic, if thief ended up so well done. But really, I'm on chapter 9 now with that character, and it's pretty bad. For the most part, the magic is incredibly impotent by end game. For being called Might *AND MAGIC* it's a pity to see magic really only good for healing. On the contrary, I find myself increasingly just bashing enemies to death left and right with the fighter abilities I took and keep on trucking against the hordes.  Overall, worth a playthrough or so. Just don't go in expecting to be some kind of omnipotent mage by the end - that WILL NOT happen.",

The game's melee fighting system was first of its kind and very sophisticated, better for example than of The Witcher 1.  Some remarks of critique. The choices one makes could have had a huger impact, but thinking of the post-HL2 time it was released, multiple choices still is worth, maybe of an another playthrough. The ending was a bit dissapointment. It was short and a bit 'flat' after all the big expectetions one had built during the playthrough.

            "review_text": " A first person action-heavy RPG set in the Might &amp; Magic universe, which I've never played any of the games of.  The game's generally linear but there are plenty of areas to walk around to for secret areas with useful items and a few possible optional objectives with a few that can determine the ending.   The RPG part plays in with having a skill progression system and finding items &amp; equipment from wherever, like on enemies and treasure. Skill points are acquired through story progression and doing optional objectives. You've got a small skill tree in the inventory to look at for deciding preferred skills, which there aren't actually many of. Most varying equipment in the game will tell you in the description that they require you to have a certain amount of skill points invested in a certain skill before you can equip them, which can be a decent incentive on picking what skill you want to put points in. There's not a whole lot of variety in equipment and the possible stats &amp; effects they give off either. You don't sell &amp; buy things and your inventory's relatively limited so you'd just be dropping stuff that won't serve any use most of the time.  Throughout the game you can use magic, stealth, and general melee. Unless you're pretty well invested in the stealth area via skills and equipment, you'd just be engaging baddies with melee weapons &amp; trap-setting magic more often, which can be a lot more reliable &amp; fun.  When you do have decent points in stealth though you can practically bypass most fights and eavesdrop on more silly dialogue. It could also make the game far too easy; when you start using the best stealth armor you're practically invisible when stepping on even a speck of darkness like in the Thief series, which the game sometimes references. Even the climbing mechanic is practically like Thief's. You can be a foot away facing someone in the dark with full stealth and they won't see you. With that you can just as easily circle them for a stealth kill backstab. Fascinatingly you can do a backstab against someone from 5 feet away so long as you're behind them since you're supposed to be quickly grabbing their neck and stabbing &amp; slitting their throat but prior to the brutality it just looks like you telekinetically moved the enemy to you. You can only do backstabs on common humanoid enemies that are capable of speech.  Magic's pretty fun when you get the chance to use them whether they be from natural MP usage or one-use magic scrolls. The traps and telekenisis ones are probably the most enjoyable due to their usefulness and the way they show how silly the physics of the game get. Although it costs loads of MP to cast spells and there are loads of of those one-use magic scrolls laying around so unless I wanted to use magic a little bit more often than I already am, it's not entirely beneficial to put too many points in the magic area as opposed to something more helpful for the long run like passive stat-raising skills.  As you start investing skill points into the melee combat focused skills you get more features and other cool stuff you can do with melee combat which they seem to have put a lot of thought for. For example, if an enemy's down and they're still alive you get a chance to perform a down impalement for serious damage, though it usually kills 'em instantly. If you and an enemy attack at the same time with a charged attack you clash weapons and the loser gets stunned for a bit. You can block most melee attacks with most weapons by themselves and you can block most any attack with a shield once you're able to use 'em though almost all shields in the game have durability to look out for. In the beginning it's simply just making use of normal attacks and charged attacks with whatever stick you can whack someone with. Down the line you'll be able to acquire and do the abilities to do cooler stuff. There's some archery but it's as simple as it gets; only one archery specific skill that can be upgraded twice more and it doesn't bring a whole lot new to the bow &amp; arrow usage outside of the usual aim &amp; shoot stuff.  Something fascinating thing about the combat in general in this game; you can pick up virtually anything sensible and throw it at an enemy and it'd stun 'em a bit. If it's something like a barrel or a pumpkin sized rock they'll likely ragdoll right then &amp; there. There are also plenty of conveniently placed natural traps for you to make use of such as ropes that holds hanging chandeliers, fragile cielings that hold heavy objects to drop on baddies, wall spikes, and other nifty stuff. And then there's the infamous kicking mechanic. The game uses the Source engine so they decided to use the stamina mechanic here for sprinting and kicking. Kicking's meant for a quick stun against an enemy, especially when they have a shield, and knocking them into or off of things. Kicking pointlessly eats up stamina if it's not used properly. The best thing about this mechanic though is that if a large enough fall, wall of spikes, some raging fire, or whatever else hazardous is sandwiching an enemy then your kick instantly turns 'em into a ragdoll and launches 'em forward to the hazard whether or not they actually reach the designated target.  The levels and their design are great, even if the Main Point A to Main Point B is linear. Most objective locations aren't obvious which does encourage one to look around a bit and there's often more than one way to reach 'em. They're typically made so that you usually have to do some Half-Life-esque platforming (small platforms and such) to get to where you want, at least in places like caves, catacombs, and especially secret areas.  The only serious problems I have with this game are the loads of bugs and glitches included. The game crashes pretty frequently for whatever reason, strong focus on physics in a 3D environment typically means frequently buggy physics &amp; this is no exception, shield durability can reach negative numbers which for whatever reason means that you can't drop it thus leading to inventory space being wasted for the rest of the playthrough, if your climbing is a bit off then the climb can keep failing until you're positioned properly. There are plenty more that can even impede story progression. The only saving factor of that is that you can save almost any time, even during the non-pre-rendered cutscenes.  When it comes to the difficulty settings it's pretty unbalanced. On Normal it's too easy but on Hard &amp; Hardcore most anything kills you in only a few hits and they themselves take ages to kill if you don't launch 'em to a pitfall or spikes or something of the like that can immediately kill 'em. Some attacks are I think so glitched that you can die from what seems like one attack. An example of that would be one of the zombie's arm swings. One swing is supposed to take half your health but if your positioning is a bit bad then the one attack can count as two thus killing you instantly. They're a bit slow but they can catch you off guard in multiple ways such as them spawning right behind you and not seeing them because they were in an extremely dark spot.  There are 4 different endings to see that are hardly different from one another and you can always start a new game with a different build so there's definitely some potential replay value. It's a slightly dated game in terms of graphics and just how the engine's used sometimes but getting past all that it's real fun.",

I think this is important, it somehow adds a lot of 'friction' to the world (think: Arx Fatalis)  Sound: Okay. Has oomph. Little music in this game - which is a good thing (think: Dark Souls).  Story: You are a hero on a quest to save some part of some world. I don't think there were any rats in a basement to kill, but there is a succubus manifested in your head that'll talk to you occasionally, resulting in some funnily greasy moments. It's nothing special all in all - but the succubus gives it a decent twist.  Gameplay: This is where Messiah shines. Luckily - who gives a damn about graphics and story in an ego-fantasy-rpg-hackfest? Well, lay aside the rpg, there isn't much roleplaying to do apart from some character development. This character development will decide whether you'll be casting, shooting arrows or close combating your way through the world, and with the given physics and environmental dangers in level design this gives for some really awesome fights. I love the fights! I love the kick, i love the brutal finishing moves and i love the kick. Yea, you can kick people off high places in this game, and you'll never grow tired of that since there are about a million ledges to kick people, orcs and other monsters off of... of?

Dark Messiah is a PC game, meant for gamers rather than mainstream turkies (gobble gobble!).  Comparisons aside, this game has its moments but the AI is rather simplistic. Combine this with highly linear mapping and progression, and you have something very close to a late 90's-early 2000's, relic. Still, the distinction between the 'classes' is well done. Magic, however, is feeble through most of the game without certain gameplay 'tweaks'. Typical really, as most devs have little vision for such things. Once you get a certain upgrade, however, you become untouchable. That's abstinent, rudimentry balancing if I ever saw it. The main problem lies with the adrenaline system and why magic had to be tied to it.  Like most medieval-based games of this nature, Dark Messiah is catered primarily towards fans of swords, shields, and gimmicky action. I will say they did a good job of it, though. Progression and mapping may be simple, but the environment itself can be a lethal weapon. Magic may be feeble, but it's done just well enough to be enjoyable.",

It's still one of the best uses of Valve's source engine. Its not a lengthy ride, and its not a huge world, but what it sets out to do, it does very well. Theres reason enough to play through twice, perhaps once as melee/magic type and once as stealthy type. The first person combat is pretty excellent, and using your environment to take out your foes is always rewarding. I know nothing of Might and Magic so I can't say much about the storyline meshing well with the universe. It felt like a big budget campaign. Great acting and soundtrack. I didn't get around to the multiplayer.",

Conspiracies and such follow, but suffice to say that the game's emphasis on physics and a realistic first-person perspective (you ride into town in a wagon, which makes for a really nice intro) more than make up for its short-comings.

Combat feels more responsive than Oblivion, and you have the mighty kick of ragdolling foes or off ledges, into traps, etc. Magic is super empowering and I had a blast freezing the floor, watching enemies slip and then stabbing them while they were downed. I kicked orcs into spike traps, goblins off ledges, people into fires, slit throats with daggers, cut off zombie heads with swords, blew up enemies with fireballs. It's crazy good fun.  From the developers of Arx Fatalis, who later went on to develop Dishonored, this first person, medieval fantasy is incredibly overlooked and I do not understand any hate that people give it. Sure it's not something that's particularly amazing, and it's way too linear to have an incredible time. But you get to make choices that matter. You make a choice, your ending is going to be changed. You even get the power of adrenaline to automatically behead an enemy or use magic that is more powerful. IE: Shrunken enemies stay shrunk, fireballs are more powerful and explode enemies, ice permanently freezes foes, and more. Not only that but you can turn into a freaking DEMON and that's fun as HELL. Get it?!  AND -- as an added bonus -- it's all in the world of MIGHT &amp; MAGIC!  + Source engine is used well + Kicking is a lot of fun + Environmental kills + Might &amp; Magic + A welcoming mature title to the world of Might &amp; Magic + Demon transformation + Smooth, fun, intense combat + Magic + Rope bow + Fun with physics + Adrenaline mode + Easy to grasp lore even if you aren't familiar with Might &amp; Magic + Good voice-acting + I can see my character's body in first person + Listening to conversations between enemies + Boss battles + Non-linear character progression + Choices that matter + Multiple endings + Secret areas + Special armors and weapons to obtain, including swords to smith  - Some areas are too dark - Some VOs feel phoned in - Standard physics glitches - No towns between certain missions to buy and sell items - You can't be kicked into spike walls or slip on ice so combat sometimes feels one-sided - Rope bow doesn't always work properly - Rope climbing often ends in frustratingly inaccurrate jumping",
