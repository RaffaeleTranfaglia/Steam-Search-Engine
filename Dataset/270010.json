            "review_text": "You know how every other puzzle game has the timed clone mechanic, where you record your actions and play them back so that a clone performs them while you do more actions? And how these puzzles are so often obnoxiously difficult and mind-bending? Proton Studio takes that mechanic, takes out the puzzle part and replaces it with an FPS. The result is a short but fun arena-based arcade shooter. It's like a multiplayer game for a single player.",

Also, theme colors and music are nice and match with the game mood ... : ) ,, ...  I like this game and it is kind of 'Fun and Competition' type game in my opinion. A colorful FPS-Arcade game.   I hope they make Version 2 or add extra levels.",

It is amazing how i can play this game for hours and feel good. i played the demo for quite a long time, and you always wanted to replay the trickier levels, because you wanted that perfect score, , this game kinda nails it, i think the stylized, more abstract nature of the game presentation is responsible for that.  Some very challenging levels later on making you wish you would have 2 more turns , the levels have high replayability factor, you always look for that right combination of weapons and tasks for each of your turns.  If you have a rift, i very much recomend this game.",

Incredibly fun, addicting, and frantic with the action arriving in appropriately bite-sized chunks. Completely recommend to anyone with an Oculus Rift (I only tried with a DK2, though).  Congratulations to the devs on a job well done!",

            "review_text": "Ok straight up, this game is cool. Im not gona spend too much time trying to explain it... i think there is a lot of info out there already trying to do such. But basicly its you shooting blocks, and then you play with your ghost who is helping you shoot blocks.  I just loaded the game up and didnt stop till i got thru all 3 eps... then i recorded for multiplayer. and played my multiplayer :P Its a lot of fun, easy to understand, diffacult to master. Visualy its clean and polished... and then you get cave stages where its all atmospheric and creepy. So its not the same thing over and over. Controlls make sence once i just start pressing buttons (i played with my controller) altho i immedately forgot that you could double-jump... didnt realize that untill 2 stages at the end of my TESTING my multiplayer. They also have this hidden emphasiss on 'escapeing' wich after a bit of playing around is really neet. Like hidden stuff after you play thru the game.  There is no story here... so dont expect much that will change you inside... but what matters is that its fun. My only gripe is that its too short... im gona be doign a little bit of multiplayer before i aucualy put this down, but i think its really cool that even when i put the game down, i can still play with you... yes YOU the one reading the review. You can totaly look me up and play with me in game. And its my 2nd playthru... so im not awesome.... and i try to explain it to those that havent played yet... so dont feel discuraged to try the multi right out the gate!  If more stages get made for this it can be one of those games that anyone and EVERYONE should be playing.",

Fairly short but loads of replay value - and I imagine they'll be releasing a lot more content for it.  I have no idea what this is like without a Rift but as an alumnus of the 2013 Oculus VR Jam, this is built from the ground up for VR, and it really shows. Absolutely phenomenal, can't wait to see where they take it next.",

            "review_text": "I followed this game in its early stage of development, played the demo from the website... and loved it  I don't like how there is no real sense of progression, advancement or achievement, in the demo your weapon upgrades would be saved from arena to arena, now you have to build them all over again  I also have the simple problem of it being too short, played through all the arenas (15 lasting 4-8 minutes each) | you could make the point of keep trying overa and over again to get higher up the leader board, but as stated in the previous point, if my weapons didn't reset I would keep playing as I would get a higher score each time  I do really like the interaction with the steam workshop, being able to record 2 out of 4 of the players to help other players complete arenas, with audio recorded for simple comunication and advice   I can't think of much else to say except, the game is a lot of fun and does have decent replay value  TL;DR Good for a single playthrough  (Insert joke about playing with myself)",

Yet it is still incredibly fun.  If you are like me and enjoy FPS games as a fun and relaxing experience shooting stuff, and wish you could play a multiplayer game with yourself instead of a stoner, an 11 year old, and one guy who is afk, this is the game for you.  10 out of 10 for the concept of 4 player coop with yourself. If they don't add more features to the existing game, I certainly hope there is a more fleshed out game as a sequal. A full FPS campaign, with enemies that shoot back, and a story, built around this awesome mechanic, could be one of the best games of all time.  That said, it IS a pretty basic game. Some arcade like shooting gallery levels, and user generated content for longevity. You will inevitably find yourself competing with yourself for a better score on past levels after the first few hours. For the price point though, 4-5 hours of great fun is totally worth it. And I would say it is a very replayable game.",
