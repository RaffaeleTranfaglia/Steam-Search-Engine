            "review_text": "Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. Although I am a sucker for story plots and backgrounds, this game doesn't have the faintest trace of that. For evil to be destroyed, the light must be kept from the darkness. Pretty much your average plot.  I've played the first mission (which is the tutorial) twice, because the game decided not to save my progress. It happens, not complaining about that. And played the second mission too. There are no variety on the towers. You get a wall, fire, ice, a teleport tower which works by 'filling up' a teleport bar on that enemy, and when the bar gets full it gets teleported back to its spawn point, a lightning tower that must be 'enchanted' to work and a resource generator. And that's it. Of course, there's this new feature which allows you to  stack  towers one on another, so you can create your own combo, so that can count as an 'upgrade' system alright.  The enchanting system, however, is interesting: As long as you have a line of same-coloured towers connected to your core, they'll get energy from it and get boosted. Since you can build on top of other towers, you can play a bit with three dimensional paths to take your core's energy further.  Issue is: You'll spend 20% of your time trying to stack the tower on the tower you actually wanted, and having it being placed anywhere, but where you wanted it. The camera it's fixed at a weird angle, and you can only adjust it's height.  And you get that for 11 missions (not counting the secret levels). After that, you have a hard mode, and then an even harder mode, which I can only guess it's the same, but with tougher and beefed up enemies.  =====  It's your generic simplistic tower defense, with no standing-out features. On top o' that, there are no achievements, nor Steam TC, so I think this one could be passed.",
