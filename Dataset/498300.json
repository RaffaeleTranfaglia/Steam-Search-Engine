            "review_text": "I love visual novel and choice stuff. Here's my summary of this game.  1. Story, I kind of like this story at first. Intriguing plot. But it's more like a novel than role-playing novel. For one thing if you're writer for this kind of game, you shouldn't describe how your character feel(which is too many lines for this). You should describe what your character see, taste, touch, smell and everything. You let player feel all emotion and moral consequence themself.  2. Choice, not much of them. Mostly all you can do is clicking 'continue'. Choices only affect minor change but not ending, it's a BIG disappointment. If it's only one ending it shouldn't be visual novel at the first place. As far as I play through the end I don't see any skill training (Riding, shooting and so on) affact to any line of the game, then what it's for. You can't call it minor change, if it's just extra page to read.  3. Typo, lots of them.  I want to support writer but seriously this is not a game, it's more like a printed novel.",
