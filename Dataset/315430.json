But I think that the game isn't finished because at the end of the story's levels, there is a level called 'story 2' so I hope that there will be new levels... And I also hope that the game will have ONLINE multiplayer cause it's not so simple to play at the same computer...",

At first it was another game in my library, but once I actually installed it and tried it out, it was extremely awesome! The main game idea has lots of potential for a sequel as well as Steam Workshop support! Even though some people think this game is just a rip-off of Portal, it's not! It may be a First Person Puzzle game like Portal, but the concept of the game is unique in its own way!   Pros",

Imagine Portal without portals and humor. It's the most basic 3D puzzle game you can imagine. It's not as boring as it sounds. It's super-short, for one thing. It's not a game you pick-up and replay over and over again. It's one of those ' I've got nothing to play ' kinda game. Everything seems alright, but after diging in I've found some flaws. Controller support is clunky and it doesn't always work. The menus are glitchy unless you disable the gamepad in the settings. For most people this game would probably bore you to death, but not me. I've sat through this thing and I actually found some impressive puzzles. For a game all about picking up things and throwing them, that's quire an accomplishment. I launched Vs mode just out of morbid curiosity. My brother just died in front of the monitor. It's not a fun multiplayer game to play. The rules are easy and there's no challenge. Combine that with gamepad controls and you've got yourself a nice nightmare session.  The best thing about this game is the soundtrack.  Spectrosconomy  is probably the best track on the whole game. It's in the trailer and it deserves some recognition on SoundCloud. Go look it up and show Ludiotic some love.  For the full price, avoid immediately. Wait for a crazy sale to make this game pay-off. It's not a novelty, but I think I could let this game pass.",

Yes, without any friends, yes, i played the coop alone, it's possible and it's damn easy. At Bonus Level 7 i just glitched through the walls, so i thought, hummm, well, happy i don't need to do this in the right way.  But hey, it's .19 Pens, so just buy it, it`s great for that Price. You will be entertained for the three hours, or more, dunno. And don't buy the game, when it's not on sale 5 Bucks are way too much for this game, but thats just my opinion.",

The physics on the cubes are not the greatest (some clipping into things, cubes sometimes get stuck on things) but it doesn't get in the way of solving the puzzles.",

Jumping on [Y] and on... It was just weird and uncomfortable, that's why I decided to play the multiplayer on my own with controller for Player1 and Keyboard for Player2^^ Well, Polarity was TOTALLY worth the 20cents (don't know if it was 20, could be 14 aswell^^) I bought it for. About 3 hours of fun^^  Well, the game is VERY easy, think that's why it took me less than 3 hours :D RECOMMENDED :3",

Co-op This game only has local co-op so I played it by myself and the last few levels were a nightmare because I had to use a controller and keyboard + mouse at the same time, still fun, but took me longer due to not having another friend though.  Worth Buying? Get this when it is on sale!  I got this during the Developer Alliance Bundle was on sale for $1.49 and I felt like it was a good bargain.

The story is almost non-existent and is just a bunch (~20 + 10 extras) of really short levels (5min max if you want to get everything in each level). I'd say that the concept is kinda cool: instead of Portals, you have you manipulate your own 'polarity', between red or blue if you don't want to die from lasers of that color, if you want to be above platforms of those colors and even transport cubes of those colors without desintegrating them.  As a puzzle game, I didn't find it hard, only slightly on very specific segments that you have to get some items to unlock the ending. It should be more as an introdutory puzzle game to kids ages 8 and lower rather than to teens and adults used to more complex games like The Talos Principle and PQ (the psp exclusive). If you fall on the latter category, this game should be just one or two hours long.  On the other hand, this game often comes *really* cheap, like dirt cheap (some 50 cents... no pun intended), so the price/game hours ratio isn't that bad. The experience itself is bug-free and the visual is simple and a little retro, so it's nice to relax if you want something for that. Visuals are quite simple as well, but don't strain the eyes.  Overall, it is a fair game... I mean, fairly standard. Short, cheap, soothing, but nothing more. Well, it has multiplayer, but it's not that entertaining as other puzzle multiplayer games. So, just don't expect much.",

            "review_text": "  This game... I don't know where to begin. It can be a fun timekiller for a little while, but it's never worth the full asking price of 9,99€. It's on sale right now for 0,99€, and I think that should be the normal price, because clearly there didn't go a lot of work into making the game.  I guess the devs went for a clean and minimalist look, like Portal or Q.U.B.E, and I guess it's ok, but it looks rather dull and like something that everyone could piece together in some game construction kit within a couple of minutes.  All the puzzles are very easy, and not very well designed. If you have ever played user made puzzles for Portal 2, you probably know what I mean. They work, and you had to think a bit about how to solve it, but all in all they seem designed quite badly, compared to the dev-made puzzles. Alle the levels in this game feel the same.  Most of them don't even use that Polarity concept all that much. It's more about taking a blue or red cube to a receptacle of the same colour and activate something that helps you through the level (platform, acceleration ramp, opening a gate etc.). Sometimes you have to throw the cubes at the receptacles, which works reasonably well.  The controls are fine, though the air controls seem a bit off.  The main reason why I think this is worth more like 1€ than 10€ is that the main game consists of 11 (extremely short and easy) levels. There are also 10 bonus levels and a coop campaign, but... come on, really? At about level 8 there suddenly is this new mechanic where you can change the colour of your cube by throwing it through a green force field. This mechanic isn't introduced in any way, and the only reason it's still quite easy to figure out by yourself is because the level design is so bleak that there aren't to much possibilities. It's like 'ok, here's this red cube, there's a blue receptacle, and there is nothing else in this room except that green force field over there', so your options are so limited that you soon arrive at the correct solution.  Oh, what I didn't mention so far: you also have to collect 3 green glowing things (aka 'Datasets') in every room for no apparent reason. Yes, the story tells you why, but they just feel like this arbitrary thing you also have to do that has nothing to do with solving the room's puzzles. Sometimes they're hidden, but that doesn't really work either, because of the empty level design. If you are at the end of the level and you're missing one of them, it's just like 'well, then I'll have to go over there where it's probably hidden and where I didn't go before because I had absolutely no reason to'.  TL;DR: Puzzles too easy, just 11 levels in the main campaign, bad level design. It's like the easy first few puzzles of other puzzle games, in length as well as in difficulty.  I wouldn't recommend buying this even at 0,99€ unless you also have someone to play the coop campaign with. I got mine for free, if you can get it free, go for it. It can be entertaining for a short while.",

The whole description feel way too pretentious, if you didn't noticed.  The story is basically a sad attempt to put a goal for the characters. It's almost non-existent, and I pretty much forgot about it right after the third level.  Level-design is really bad, bland, and don't expect challenges, unless for like 2-3 levels.  Almost no indication on how certain mechanics works, which is a real pain. I spent the whole single player campaign on resetting levels when I couldn't get a cube before learning that you can click on the arrow to make it respawn.  The only thing making the game really difficult, it's the number of bugs in it. Also, the physics. Jumping on a moving platform makes you go faster than the platform. Even when you don't want to move. There's a whole level about moving and jumping and a moving platform, and it's easily the worse level of it.   Are a little selections of bugs: Getting stuck under platforms, between platforms, no button response, and the worse of it: while playing as Player 1, you can make player 2 drop their cubes with a mouse button. Like.. Why?  Those co-op levels are a real pain to play with someone, it's way easier to do it by yourself with a keyboard and mouse + a controller.",
