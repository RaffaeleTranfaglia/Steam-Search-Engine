            "review_text": "Draw a Stickman attempts to occupy an area between Scribblenauts and Drawn to Life, but by subsidizing its biggest selling point with a plethora of terrible design decisions it completely misses the mark. This is not a game for those looking to flex their creativity as there is little needed or allowed, and it is not a game for fans of point-and-click adventures as the puzzles are anything but and the story non existent. So who exactly is this intended for? Well, I would have to say nobody as it is just not fun and far more trouble than it is worth.  For a game seemingly based around drawing there is a shockingly low amount of it here. You begin the game by creating your own stickfigure, a task which somehow evolved from a mundane diversion on restaurant napkins into a frustratingly imprecise procedure, as the pencil takes on a mind of its own and places itself at random several points from where you intended. Considering MS Paint did it better more than a decade ago, I have no idea how the developers managed to screw up such a basic and integral part of the game.  Once you have your character you are placed into a sketched out world and given a handful of different markers with which to get past obstacles and enemies. The problem is that while you are encouraged to draw something resembling the item that will come out of your chosen marker (for example a raincloud or key) the game makes no qualms about what shape you actually end up with. This was disappointing as I was hoping for something a little more involving, but when you have to draw the same four items dozens of times it becomes trivial to actually flesh them out when a simple straight line acts much the same way. Worsening this is the speed at which you must draw to stay alive, as you can withstand but two hits from the numerous enemies, and a death means restarting the level from the very beginning.  This in itself would be annoying and the terrible controls only escalate the problem. I frequently got stuck on the environment and has animations break, as well as often getting hit by my own creations. Despite the backgrounds being drawn with an illusion of depth the markers don't adhere to it, acting more like stickers placed on a glass pane than something being drawn into the picture. It makes drawing even more of a chore than it already was, forcing you to frame the screen at awkward angles, and adding an unfair challenge to the challenges which are never explained in the first place. A repeated task involves making yourself bait to lure enemies toward certain areas, which is neither fun nor often works correctly and usually ends up with you getting killed and repeating the process several dozen more times.   Whatever I expected out of Draw a Stickman it didn't deliver on any front. The controls and gameplay butchered any potential it could have had and left me with a sour taste in my mouth when I beat it in about two hours. Not because of the short length, but for how quickly I grew tired of it and wanted out. There are hidden levels and collectibles to find which may extend your playtime, but I can in no way recommend it in the first place.   As yet another example of what happens when a good idea doesn't get off the ground, Draw a Stickman in no way lives up to its exaggerated subtitle which given the quality of the game, almost writes the joke itself.",

            "review_text": "All things considered, Draw a Stickman: Epic is quite an original puzzle game in its own right. The game’s narrative follows its protagonist (which you draw) to find and rescue your best friend (also drawn by you) from the clutches of a selfish miser who wants your magic pencil for his own diversion.   The Good:  + Original puzzles  + Sensible achievements + Casual puzzler + Personalized Story – your friend is even listed in the end credits   The Bad  - Drawing items is tiring after a while – especially with a mouse  Most of the puzzles revolve around the elements (rain, lightning, fire) while others involve keys and tree chopping. To successfully complete levels you will need to utilize all the pencils provided you at the start of that level in combinations to progress through the levels. The manner in which drawn elements are utilized by you is (to me) a very refreshing and major attraction to the game. There is just so much which doesn’t meet the eye at first but after a few hour of playtime you get those ‘ah-ha’ moments which make puzzles rewarding and worth it.   Draw a Stickman: Epic is a somewhat short game but well worth the time investment, Even if you don’t cheat you can net all the achievements within a day providing you are willing to do a small amount of grinding.",

            "review_text": "Crayon physics meets...an...adventure game? I guess? Draw a stickman is really far less creative than it sells itself as. The objects you draw aren't actually related to their shapes, but rather the function you choose to draw them with. The game offers you a pathetic attempt at a story, tosses you some hand-drawn 5-year old levels and then asks you to 'puzzle solve' your way through them by combining the functions of different colors with the few objects that those functions are actually capable of interacting with in the level. So, realistically, this game isn't actually about solving puzzles or even progressing through anything so much as it is an interactive hide and seek between your functions and the objects those functions affect.   ...I'll pass.",

It's almost like Zelda, except without the overarching storyline, complex and innovative graphics, or levels that last longer than five minutes.  It's kinda Okamish, except minus the unique art style, deep cultural background and abundant cartoon breasts.  But it's five bucks, and that's just perfect. It's a silly, amusing little distraction where you make a guy and waggle him around doing stuff, setting everything on fire, accidentally blowing yourself up, and never actually killing anything. If you've got a little kid who unwisely chooses to hang around you, it's probably one of those rare games that you can both enjoy together. The devs are neat, and keep throwing stuff out there just because it's apparently fun to make.  I mean, yeah, it's not Skyrim, but if you're expecting a deep, creative and complex action-RPG with a concept like this, you should probably look into that gushing head wound.",

The puzzles usually aren't that difficult to figure out, although some of the achievements require some critical thinking and messing around. My favorite aspect of the game is that you get to draw whatever you want, and you don't even have to be good at it. Need and axe? Draw a chicken leg! Need a key? Draw a hand! Need fire? Draw a bunch of squiggles, it doesn't matter! All in all, if you like puzzles and drawing this game is definitely worth your time.  This game gets an A/5.",

Even if you can't draw pretty well on paper, it's still a fun and challenging game, and you can easily get around by drawing simple shapes using a mouse. After all, you don't need a lot of artistic talent to draw a stick man, clouds, keys, axes, and fire. Even the game recognizes simple red scribbles as fire.  Definitely recommend it!",
