            "review_text": "Good mix of farming games. I already owned and enjoyed both of the My Farm Life games previously, but they were worth replaying, with some more value in the rest of the bundle.  The Virtual Farm games are quite basic farm sims with a trading element. I felt the first one was a clickfest but not a particularly fun one, while the second one had the opposite problem of requiring me to wait until trades were completed before I could do anything else. I could probably get some more out of these if I tried but didn't find them particularly appealing.  Tropical Farm is, well, I guess it qualifies as a farming game. Planting is limited to about a dozen pre-determined spots, with a few animals thrown in to boot. Not necessarily a bad game, but more an entry level game to the genre.  Terrafarmers isn't exactly what I think of when I think of farming games, but it blends different game types into a fun package. For the most part, the animals produce products that you can then cook or blend to make more expensive products, all of which you can either sell for their standard price or to customers who pay based on how quickly you can service them. This is mixed with some pirate attacks to kind of throw you off, but I never found this as much of a turn off as I found the pests in Farm Frenzy to be.  My Farm Life and My Farm Life 2 follow a farm you build over the course of a 50 episode season as you must learn to satisfy an increasing volume of different products. This is more what I think of when it comes to a traditional farming game in which you plant produce, but along with Terrafarmers makes it well worth the rather cheap price.  I bought this during the summer sale for 59 cents, which works out to about a penny per hour. Even at full price, it's a better value than I get out of most games.",
