            "review_text": "(Edit to what was previously a silly accidentally made-public draft review... please excuse!)  An aesthetically pleasing C64-ish puzzle game. What is this game? Retro-mini-blocks maze. Two brother or sister blocks opposite sides of maze- 'eye'-icon blocks. Some little compu-baby circa 1981 would call 'cute.' You look to the LEFT... move towards the apoca-portal; BUT wait, you need to look to the right, nudge up to the wall, move the other blockhead towards the other portal.. look LEFT. Nudge up to the wall, move that lil sister in place. If you go cross-eyed you lose. Use both eyes, one side of the brain. Take a sip out of the glass of cyan-blue, then take a gulp out the cyan-purple.  Clever little puzzle game. I added the game to my library a few weeks ago. Popped it on a few times. I'm on level 6. Might take me the rest of the year to finish all? (Not sure how many levels). In any case, I will have gotten my moneys worth, and quite possibility in this same time frame the dev might pop on the Steam version at least another latter complex level or two? Periodic extra levels would be desired and this game is certainly set up for such potential and more interesting 'eye'-deas.  If you seek or want some retro C64/easy simple puzzler goodness, a cut above in wonderful simplicity, I recommend.  Good game!",
