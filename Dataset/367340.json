            "review_text": "Positives:  I like a lot of the ideas behind this title, and the graphical style is quite cool (in a slightly psychadelic way). The difference between weapon systems encourages tactical thinking and the various elements are introduced in a sensible way. It is stable on my system, with only minimal slow-down when things get particularly busy on-screen. I like the sound-track and, once customisation is implemented things will really start to get interesting.    Negatives:   The game at present amounts to a small series of tutorials. Accessing the different scenarios feels quite cumbersome (not least because you have to quit back to the start menu between games). At present, I do not believe this title is worth the cost (even with the 40% discount), although, once episode one becomes available (presuming this update is free), my opinion may change.",

            "review_text": "Game barely starts, which is odd given that it was such a small 306mb download. I thought the fan in my laptop was going to explode when I clicked on 'Start Mission' and then when the screen finally shows up, a message appears that says the actual game is delayed until next week.  The only 'playable' part is a few tutorial missions and you cant even fire lasers in them and it's laggier than a turtle dry-humping a snail.  I'm going to have to do a system restore to make sure this hot mess is completely off my harddrive. I think there's a virus included in this game's install file. It's a bit unnerving that Steam is allowing such an obvious fraud to be sold on their marketplace. I'll be flagging this game and requesting a refund.   Do NOT buy this game!",
