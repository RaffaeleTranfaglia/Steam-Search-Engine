Puzzles within puzzles, Hidden Object with Point &amp; Click elements and an interesting enough story to keep you uncovering more.  My one tiny complaint is I wish it were longer. It was getting addicting!",

            "review_text": "I did not find this game very enjoyable. Some of the hidden object scenes require you to find items that are just not visible enough to even identify what they are. For example, a dark black lens for a pair of sunglasses. It seemed needlessly tedious in some places. Right now there are many new HOGs being added to the store. You might find a beter game for just a little more than this one that will be much more fun to play.",

            "review_text": "Clunky gameplay. It'd be fun if it weren't for the difficulty of imprecise clicking, boring life stories of villagers, and, say, THE BUGS.  LIKE WHEN THE ANCHOR DISAPPEARS AND YOU CAN'T FINISH THE GAME.  I'm not stupid, I did my research. Multiple people have encountered a glitch where the anchor disappears, making it impossible to get the nest and complete the last section of the game. The hint option starts constantly repeating 'there is nothing to do here' because there is no solution. No way am I playing through the entire game just to get the anchor. Definitely not worth it.  Not worth the 99 cents. Just go play a browser hidden object game.",
