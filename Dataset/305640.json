            "review_text": "Despite roguelikes being just about my favorite genre around, I am admittedly not the best at them. They generally require a level of dedication and persistence I'm just not able to give, but that's what had me so addicted to  Shattered Planet .   The game has a very simple and seamless one-click control system for movement and attacks as well as an incredibly clean and easy to use UI. Armed with only your headgear, trusty weapon, and a plethora of helpful and sometimes unidentified and dangerous items gathered along the way you'll be tasked with exploring deeper in to the broken pieces of this strange and ancient planet collecting as much resource as you can for your next trip. You will die and lose your items. A lot. The only question is how far can you make it before you fail, passing this heinous task onto the next unsuspecting clone?  This is easily the most accessible, easy to get into and just plain fun roguelike of recent memory and yet still offers the same complexity and depth of other top games in the genre in terms of the huge scope of items, classes, events, and enviroments. At the center of the game is the Science Lab your cloned characters seem to be born from acting as the hub for your journey. You have tons of options here to prepare for the oncoming descent including the Clone Vat you're spawned from giving you multiple class and character appearance options, a shop to gamble crystals away for new equipment to save for later trips, a training console for using your hard-earned scrap to increase stats, and a pet cloner for storing DNA of found companions all unlocked through your progress on the unknown floors below.  There are a multitude of modes to tackle all featuring engrossing procedurally generated alien landscapes, starting with the Explorer mode which is a progressive journey that slowly edges you deeper into the fragmented shards of these broken planets as you earn more scraps to better prepare yourself for each consecutive run. Players also have three challenge modes of varying difficulty to test your wits after prolonged practice and equipment hoarding and last but certainly not least the Daily Challenge which gives everyone a new planet generated every day and predetermined gear to try their luck with.   Shattered Planet  is gorgeous and absolutely pleasing to the eyes to play, thanks to the stunning hand-drawn artwork and organic backgrounds that make you feel as though you've stepped into some otherworldly painting. The game has a very engaging sci-fi setting with a dystopic tale of impending human extinction, and while the overtone and story of your hundreds of re-cloned human explorers is mostly serious there are some very humorous moments in your adventures. For example, going into battle near the beginning of my career as an explorer with nothing but my Cabbage Helmet and a rolled-up newspaper as my weapon felt great everytime.   Shattered Planet  breathes a fresh breath of air into the roguelike genre and is easily recommendable for players of all skill levels, whether it be casual explorers looking for a relaxing bit of discovery and progression or more hardcore roguelike veterans who want to go for that perfect run on the daily challenge.",

            "review_text": "An invasive, shadowy substance known only as “the Blight” is creeping its way across the universe. One research vessel, outfitted with a mostly-naked Gekkian scientist, a random equipment generator, and an endless supply of clone explorers, has set out to understand and stop the Blight before it completely takes over. A nearby planet, shattered after a long-dead explosion, is putting off a Blight-resistant signal. Your assignment, as clones one-through-infinity, is to survey the planet, seek out the signal, and deal with any other bizarre challenges sent your way. There will be plenty.As a randomized survival RPG, Shattered Planet thrives on the unexpected. From the armor your clone wears down to the planet to the results of enemy encounters, nothing is directly under your control. A typical trip begins on your spaceship hub, where you can use R.O.S.A., the equipment generator, to create weapons and armor. But you can only tell it what value of equipment to produce—bronze, silver, or gold—not specifically what item. You can also buy consumable items from the “Crystalobot,” a friendly vending machine that sells a variety of randomized goods ranging from healing items to pet companions.Once satisfied with your clone’s loadout, you send her to the planet’s surface to tackle either a limited-scope mission or an endless survival run. Both play out in similar fashions, pitting your clone against a series of procedurally generated and progressively difficult levels connected via teleporters. Missions end after a certain number of levels and goals have been met, while survival lasts as long as your clone does. Depending on your gear and experience withplanet-exploration, that could be no time at all.There are a staggering number of ways to die in Shattered Planet, some more obvious than others. Most of the local wildlife is fierce and unfriendly, hunting your clone as soon as they lay eyes on them beyond the fog of war. The Blight itself, ever-oozing across the land, damages both health and fauna by turning creatures into deadlier versions of their former selves. Random encounters that might provide rewards just as often result in a surprise attack, curse, or other malady that degrades your clone for a short period. Luckily, since all actions are turn-based and time stops when your clone does, you have plenty of opportunity to plan ahead and either prepare for or avoid the dangers at hand.Encountering those dangers, taking the risk, and possibly earning a reward is half the fun, though. Slain enemies regularly drop golden scrap, which is used to perma-upgrade your clone as well as purchase consumables. Valuable items and crystals are often waiting just beyond those sharp-clawed crablets.Growing physically—by improving your Strength, Wits/Evasion, and Health—and mentally—by learning from your mistakes—allows you to travel further on the next run, earn more goodies, and keep the cycle going.The constant progression, rewards, and dangers keep Shattered Planet‘s gameplay engaging. But it’s the kooky inhabitants, unexpected encounters, and sheer charm of its world that will encourage teleporting down again and again.Shattered Planet has landed in the sweet spot between learnability and surprise that keeps each trip new, fresh, and entertaining. It’s packed with loot to discover, use, and inevitably lose as you fall victim to the many random and wild ways to die. Although each run plays similarly, you’ll never know exactly what you’re in for when you step on that teleporter—except a fun, ridiculous space exploration that can’t possibly be your last.",

Well worth a look for someone looking for a short-run roguelike that's akin to actual rogue games rather than just being a shooter with procgen or the like.

            "review_text": "Shattered Planet leaves a lot to be wanted, as the mechanics of the game are very enjoyable, but the execution is incredibly poor. Although you may have fun with this game for a few hours after you purchase it, you'll find that during your later gameplay, you'll be feeling a lack of depth that doesn't really deserve to be there. Like another user said, binary reviews like this are bad for games like this, but I'll have to give it a thumbs down until other things are implemented.  For those who don't know, Shattered Planet is a rogue-life, turn-based strategy game in which your character travels to distant planets. These planets are the equivalent to dungeons in any other rogue-like; you find items, gain currency, and inevitably die only to return and do a little better each time. To Shattered Planets strong points, this game has several things to collect and playthrough, but that's the extent of depth you'll end up getting.   Pros:   - Very visually pleasing.  - Comical lines of dialogue. - Level design is great. - Extensive amount of gamemodes.   Cons:   - Not enough items. - Small pool of abilities. - AI on companions lack-luster. - No crafting stations. - Expensive upgrades. - Sometimes dull grind.  The things that Shattered Planet does right is in its visuals. The game deserves to pride itself on how aesthetically engaging it is, considering the variety of biomes you can explore and the massive level design that continues to produce original and fun maps over the several hours I've played. I've not once felt annoyed to go into a certain point in the level because no specific artwork bores me, unlike other games like Tales of Maj'eyal and Dungeons of Dredmor.  However, there is a massive shadow looming over this game that makes it not enjoyable after a certain amount of hours. You can experience this with the substantial lack of items, small pool of abilities, horrible companion AI, and almost zero ability to craft your own items or at least upgrade them to a better weapon. This can sometimes make it a very difficult grind because, without much customization, the game falls flat quickly.  When you first play the game, finding all the weapons are pretty fun. All seem to have their own traits, like increased punctured damage or critical hit, but that's about all the depth you'll get with the weapons. It would be nice if the developers would add a crafting bench, another currency sink other than simply spending tons of money on static weapons from the store.  I imagine that adding this bench would allow you to spend currency in order to put different upgrades on your weapons or smelt them in order to get different resources in order to make your own weapon. Since enemies in the game have specific weaknesses and they appear on predictable levels of the game, having this type of crafting bench would be very important for people wanting to breeze past the first levels. Right now, you'll struggle through every run-through, which can be dull.  There's also a very small pool of abilities. What I mean by that is, you don't have any active abilities, the characters that you choose have passive abilities. Some are much more strong than the other characters, which almost defaults you to a couple of playstyles, which sucks for a rogue-like. It would be great to add some more abilities, even active ones, that players could use to enhance their gameplay. Right now, all you do is chop with subpar weapons and try to take as less damage as possible before going to the next floor.  AI's suck. They're supposed to be companions that attack for you, defend you, and stop you from taking damage. 9 times out of 10, they don't listen and they rarely attack unless you force them into a position to attack by moving several spaces. It can be tedious, especially when you're surrounded with tough enemies and your companion is doing nothing but snoozing in the corner. You'll die because of this - several times, and that just adds to your misery.   ...and this all adds up to a boring game, giving you very little for what you're putting in. With how expensive some of the upgrades are (health, dodge, and attack) and how insignificant they seem to be in-game, you're going to find that you'll get bored of grinding the first few floors until you just switch the game off and uninstall. The only reason I haven't done this is because I'm an achievement hunter and look to collect them all, haha.  All-in-all, I don't recommend this game just because of the systems I wish were added. The weapons are simple, the characters are simple too - it just leaves so much to be wanted and it's unfortunate for a game like this, a game that is very pleasing and has so much potential, but falls flat on its face because of developers that aren't attentive to quality designs. Find another rogue-like to play, mates, this isn't a good one to sink your time into.",

            "review_text": "Shattered Planet is a fun little roguelite (quite light) with a nice mechanic of ever-encroaching blight to keep a little tension. Levels are very quick to complete and have a nice 'one more level' flair. Itemization is fairly diverse in flavor, but limited in impact. There's a ton of random events, but unfortunately (again) they have little real impact (temporary stat boost). Progression is tied to boosting stats based on resources collected during runs, and the needed amounts increase exponentially. After about five to ten runs, you'll have more or less effectively maxed out your character. This is a fine mechanic while you're still progressing, but the wall comes too quickly and too hard.  Unfortunately, the game is its own worst enemy, as the mechanics break in really stupid ways. Blight adds tension, but a common item makes it completely trivial and avoidable. I enjoyed the game 100 times more when I didn't realize you could stop blight progression. Also, enemies are easily teleported off into space, instakilled no matter the strength...what's the point in fighting and developing stats if you can just safely kill everything without a fight? More importantly, anything past a certain level WILL one-shot you if you try to attack, no matter your stats. Again, why bother with combat at all? And finally, resource collects increase by level, so the best strategy is to simply teleport everything, get to the next level and collect random dropped items. It's far more rewarding than doing it the 'right' way.  For the list price, I wouldn't say it's worth it. I got it in a bundle (as the only thing I wanted in said bundle, but it was substantially cheaper) and am quite happy with that purchase. I would've been much happier with it had there been an expansion pack (it's a little repetitious, even for a roguelite) and if the game was better balanced. I did really enjoy it for a few hours. Good setting, fun graphics, some interesting things to unlock earn it a reluctant thumbs up. But ultimately, it's a bit too shallow and self-defeating for any lasting appeal.",

Also, if you get a shovel, you're pretty much golden (it's a one-hit kill, on a quick recharge, and you can use it to stop the 'blight' from following you).

Shattered Planet plays a lot like Rogue, but with a point-and-click interface, as opposed to using arrow keys. Honestly, this is the first modern game I've played that I would even BEGIN to compare to Rogue. If you haven't played Rogue, stop reading because the rest of this review won't mean anything to you.  Start with Rogue. Between games, add a sort of home base where you respawn after every death and buy equimpent for your next run. Here you have a storage locker to keep things you buy at the store (you can't keep things you find during a game, except for money and money (there are two kinds of money)), a place to cohose your class and pet for the next game and a place to buy permanent stat upgrades for your current class.  Now put in a few different quests. Of course there's the main 'quest:' run until you die. There are also a few other game modes that I haven't really gotten into yet because the novelty hasn't worn off the basic game yet. In addition, there's a daily quest that you can only run once that picks your starting equipment for you and challenges you to make it through ten levels before dying for a nice reward.  Add some fun graphics and average sound effects and you've basically got Shattered Planet.  Seriously. If you ever loved Rogue, you NEED Shattered Planet. And there's a mobile app as well. It's free, but significantly watered-down.  Shattered Planet gets an A+ from me.

Visually reminds me of some of the art you used to get on the Amiga but in high res.  Developers have really thought about things, and it shows the more you play.",

Pros +Visually enticing +Easy to pick up +Smooth, relaxing gameplay +Nice bits of dialogue and lore Cons -Repetitive in lazy ways, especially dialogue clips that aren't voices have weirdly limited variety -Limited itemization and randomization, poor weapon balance -Way lower replay value than you'd expect from a roguelike -Shallow  It's one of those titles where you hope the team goes in and makes a sequel just to broaden it out. Good at what it does but not as good as it had the potential to be.",
