Most importantly the game can be played multiplayer both locally or through the net. Thank you Artur Games.  Definitely a recommended game for the old school gamer.",

I have played the crap out of Probotector I &amp; II back in the day on the NES as a kid and surprised to see how well it resembles those games. I like the color palette and boss battles are much better designed than in the original. Worth a look if you are into retro games and a must have for contra fans. Great 8-bit nostalgia trip!",

The way of how the cyborgs move, how they jump, run, shoot and even die, all of the animation presents the same like in the old time, so does the feedback when you press a button to make any move.  Since it is a clone, the graphic is definitely old-school styled. With better hardware support nowadays, it displays more colors and details. The music is well composed in classic ways.  Also, a little surprise for players when finishing the game.  If you like classic Contra on NES and SNES, this game is a must-have for you. A gaming controller is really recommended.",

A bit too much, I think; it's the same one hit-per-life gameplay where the best strategy is just deleting enemies as soon as they run onto the screen, and getting hit leaves you with the default machine gun, and usually in a bad way as a result. If you really liked Contra it's probably quite fun but if you didn't it doesn't seem to have any modern changes.",

            "review_text": "It's a contra clone, but very cheaply done. I love the oringal NES contra, great design, great challenges and smooth and very well excuted.   This on the other hand has some bad issues that keeps throwing me out of the contra nastalgia. First is the framerate...at time it's really smooth, but mostly it's just not. It goes from what appears to be low fps, that's hard on the eyes, to sometimes a bit choppy, all sorts of really bad stuff done, in a game with low end graphics. Just feels like as powerful as my computer is, this shouldn't happen. I also tried changing all sorts of settings, they didn't do anything, except make the game look and feel even worse.  Shooting...well, my biggest gripe on this, is when you go up and down diagonal platforms...while trying to shoot up/down them. At times your bullets all go into the ground, other times, he shoots directly over everyone's head. Very frustrating. It's like the bullets have a set path, and the ground just doesn't match...which just makes me wish they never put diagonal type pathing.  Design...well, I liked the original's diversity. In here, they kind of did mostly right scrolling. The one that was kind of top down, well, it felt like they forgot about it so rushed it into one place. Even the platforming felt forgotten. IMO, it just felt like they didn't particularily care about the design.  Of course, all that said, it's not like they're asking a lot of money for this game...however, all this game made me really want to do was load up an emulator and play the classic again.",

So, I decided to buy it and give it a shotl. This game absolutely rocks. One nice feature in particular is the Automatic Save feature that saves your progress after each stage.   If you've played Contra, Super Contra, Contra 3, Hard Corps, etc... you should feel right at home with Super Cyborg. The gameplay mechanics are very close to the same with a few new features packed in such as the Alternate Fire Mode for each weapon.  Now, I wish I had an NES (or even a Super NES) controller with a USB adapter to play the game with. But, that's ok.",

In my day this game would have cost 30 dollars used, so 5 bucks brand new is a steal. For best results you should play with a controller (I did, and I feel great.) This game is instantly downloaded to even the most feeble and incompetent gaming rig and there really is no excuse not to do it now if you haven't already.",
