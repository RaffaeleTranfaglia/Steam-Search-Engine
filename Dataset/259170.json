            "review_text": "Metascore: 55/100??????? Seriously???? Like reading the reviews wasn't bad enough...  I don't get what's everyone on about... It may not the best game out there, but it’s still so damn brilliant!!!! I’m a big survival horror fan, I’ve played a lot of games and Alone In The Dark deserves to be applauded for its innovation. I’ve played it when it was released in 2008 and it was the first of its genre and I've been gaming since I could walk. This franchise started the survival horror genre. This is most probably the most underrated title in the history of video games. Because even though it has flaws like the broken mechanics, tiring controls and camera, and most probably Atari not testing it. There are also crashes when you try to edit the display settings, their fault aswell . But those who are able to deal with these flaws, that aren't easy to ignore, may end up living a very very rewarding action adventure.   Alone in the dark is a survival atmospheric horror game built in episodes. Each episode begins with a video summary of the previous episode, and ends with an epic scene to rattle our nerves.   You are an amnesiac Edward Carnby who is a paranormal detective who disappeared back in 1938, awakening from an exorcism in 2008. After over hearing a bizarre conversation between men in robes, you start to wander a collapsing building for a way out. You will witness several people being killed and possessed by demonic forces. You will meet a woman and an old man who has all the answers. But there isn’t time. Because Lucifer is trying to bring the end of the world using a stone that’s been held by Edward for decades, that contained his soul after he’s been cast out of heaven. And you must stop him before it’s too late. So you start your adventure in a beautiful, picture perfect New York city. Driving to out run a raging apocalyptic earthquake with giant fissures wiping out the entire city, trying to make it to central park. And that’s where you begin to unravel so many mysteries and experience even more epicness! Brilliant events and a gripping story that keeps building up to a whole new level every time as you progress and keeps you wanting even more. With an ending that leaves you with questions more than answers.  The graphics are great, the atmosphere, the lighting, the ambiance, gameplay, the characters and dialogues… All are featured wonderfully. The story is well scripted and provides many intense dramatic moments with beautifully composed soundtracks. Gives you a great feeling of novelty, as you try to heal your wounds, like literally look down to heal a bloody gapping wound through your jeans or jacket. The game also allows you to use your jacket as an inventory which I found pretty cool, like to fit in as many objects as the pockets and belts allow you. As well as combining them and creating fire weapons, explosives and light sources. Also how objects can interact with the environment. Like grabbing a chair or a wood plank and place it near other objects, then set the plank on fire. You will see the fire eating the plank slowly, turning it to ashes and moving to the other objects. Quite cool.  Alone In The Dark has many flaws that can kill the thrill sometimes. But it won’t kill the thrill of the story and puzzles. If you’re into survival horror and atmospheric games, then you should definitely give it a try. It might be too primitive for 2008 standars, but it’s still quite enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "This game is a little disaster. It shows what an uninspired port can do to what might have been a decent game. Slowly I begin to understand why Infogrames/Atari went downhill so fast.  I've been playing AitD back then in 1993 and loved the atmosphere, the puzzles and how the story did unfold. But this sequel discouraged me to play even before it started. Technical issues (resolution has to be set manually in a config file) gave me a bad feeling right from the start. But it got worse when I realized that the effort put into porting it from console to PC was minimal at best.  The greatest flaw is the hoplessly overcomplicated and unintuitive UI and control system. You are confronted with a myriad of keys needed to do things which you'll quickly forget afterwards, just to wonder what might have been 'blinking' (no kidding) once your eysight is blurring again.  But even worse is the way you have to move around. Pressing W to move forward while needing A and D to steer left and right might have been a decent input system for 1993. But it isn't really working for a game which forces you to walk on thin ledges while all kinds of debris is raining down on you. To make it even worse, the 3rd person cameras are so bad, that you feel like a drunkard stumlbing disorientedly around when you try to navigate even a small room.   The puzzles are illogic. In one situation you need to lift a fire extinguisher to a collapsed floor above you. Now every sane person with two working arms would simply lift the extinguisher to platform one, climb up and repeat it.  Oh no! The developers of this game thought it natural to put the extinguisher on a platform, which is connected to a rope, which in turn is dangling down from the ceiling... so all you need to do further is to climb up the collapsed floor to leap 2 meters above the ground to the dangling rope to grab it somehow in midair, just to pull the platform (remember, the one we put the extinguisher on?) up so the extinguisher is airbone to land on the second floor.  Phew.  Okay... seriously?  Annoyed as I am I don't even wish to mention the mediocre voice acting or the clicheéd horror snippets happening to anonymous people all around you. It's really not worth the effort, you know them all. Or the music which tries to create suspense, but is quickly starting to annoy you, because it's nowhere close to be dynamically linked to the action on the screen.  Anyways... don't buy it, unless you are a die hard AitD fan who just needs to know what happened to the series by first-hand-experience. Hope you got a gamepad then.",

Ok, fine, let's leave the video settings as they are.  When the game started, I thought it was cool that it lets you switch between first person and third person view. When in third person, it moves like the old Resident Evil games, which I loved back in the day... playing with keyboard? Frustrating as hell. The controls are very unresponsive, and non-intuitive.  The game looks nice, and it's interesting, it makes me mad that I can't enjoy it because the broken controls.  Also, seeing that is uses Securom for activating the game, so that is gonna be bothersome too when installing in another system.",

            "review_text": "Another exceptional console game with an awfull port.  Do i recommend the game? Yes, by all means Its so advanced for 2008 game, even today, almost 7 years later. It puts big focus on physics and creativity to survive. It lets you explore freely most of the time so you can look for supplies(even tho they are mostly easy to come by 'along the way'). It has very interesting enemies and melee combat system, amongst other interesting and unique features, like closing your eyes to see some things better(yup, its a thing, you will also have to blink manually at times) and combining everything with everything to get a tool best suited for you current situation. Games story is really good and even tho some people will say its 'just another post-apocalyptic zombie game', this is not the case, first of, its not post-apocalyptic, its apocalyse preventing one and there are absolutely no zombies here(although some enemies do look like them :P). Also what i would like to point out is that this game is made in a way to resemble a tv show. What i mean by this is that every time you resume your previous session, a 'previously on alone in the dark...' will play and highlight key moments that happened to that point , also, every time you complete main objective for that chapter, end credits will roll, but, in adition to this, game is playable in 1st as well as in 3rd person, and 3rd person is very cinematic, with great movie like camera angles while 1st is very immersive so, pick your favourite.  Do i recommend the PC version? Absolutely not! If you have XBox360 or PS2/3, play it on one of those instead, because, PC version is just bad, mouse and keyboard controlls are not that good, new PC's and systems cant run and/or configure it properly, visuals are glitchy at places and the game was never and never will be patched because the complany went bankrupt from what i heard.  All in all, amazing game, bad port, but since im reviewing a game here, imma hit 'Yes' for recommended, an as for the port itself, you have been warned",
