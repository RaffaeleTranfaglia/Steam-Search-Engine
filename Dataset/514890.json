            "review_text": "A fun game that feels and sounds just like a nes or sega master system game. No save feature, and 30 something levels, with a few secrets hidden about. Somewhat challenging, though if you can beat mario 3 you can probably finish this game too.  It controls mostly like mario 3, and the sound is mostly like a sega master system game.  Recommended for old school platformer fans.",
