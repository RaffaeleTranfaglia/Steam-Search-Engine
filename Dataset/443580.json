I hadn't really thought about sound puzzles until playing this and I think it's worth exploring further. Turns out I'm not very good at them, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I rarely stumble on something interesting in the free to play section, but I'm glad I gave this a chance. My first thought after seeing the logo, I expected it to be some wifi troubleshooting software like inSSIDer, but I'm glad it's a game instead. Anyway, it's good to experiment and I hope the positive feedback encourages you to work on something bigger in the vein of Limbo or Deadlight. If you have to go for a Microsoft timed-exclusive deal, then I understand, but know that we'll still be waiting for you here, when you finally come to your senses.",

If you can easily distinguish between two tunes/sounds and like to play around with it... this is your game. Personally, I've had no fun at all because I had to look everything up (because I didn't even understand what I was supposed to do) and then had to do it on my own anyway because everyone seems to have a unique solution. And I had no fun finding the solution because I just couldn't distinguish between all the sounds that I was hearing.  Apart from that... I also have my problems with the 'story'. I don't have a problem with games (or movies for that matter) not telling us every detail of the world and let us do some thinking of our own... but here we don't have anything at all. Not the slightes hint on what is going on. Are we the last robot on earth who miserably tries to fix antennas? Are we just fixing antennas? Why are there antennas?  On the plus side: - it's free - easy/quick perfect game - graphics are ok",

You are given no descriptions of what you are suppose to do, the environment is bland and boring, the sounds are genric and get very, very repetitive and irritating quickly.   The loading screens (Signal) last way too long, the opening does nothing to draw you in and it's unskippable (it probably isn't loading anything behind it because there's no substance, nothing to load).   You'll find that when you are prompted to press a key, it can be anywhere on your keyboard or your mouse. Your 'charcter' walks rediculously slowly for no reason at all, except to make this longer than it needs to be. Which makes no sense since it adds nothing to the experience (what little there is).   As you can see, I've spent just under 30min playing this 'game', and I have no desire to force myself to play any more of it. After sitting at a gong puzzle (match the sounds) and hearing the same sound come from all four squares for 10minutes, adjusting the sliders minutely over and over hoping to find the 'right sound', I said screw it.   It's not worth your time.",

Quite interesting for a game. I love the simple 'graphics'. 2D, monochromatic, and the sound design is simple, yet somewhat soothing to my ears.  Only (not even a complaint) issue is the length. I played for I think 17 minutes, Steam had told me. And that is including the time it took to boot up and get trhough the start menu (1-2 minutes).  BUT, if a short game is what you people are looking for, this is otherwise a fivestar game. I would certainly recommend it!  NOTE ON HIDDEN ACCIEVEMENT: I have no idea what it is. I only played through it once, but I feel that if I play through it enough times, I'll figure it out. I love surprises!",

There are four achievements just for doing small puzzles and such, but there is a fifth, hidden achievement...  The fact you could go faster by holding shift did unsettle me though...why would you need it? I honestly did expect something to chase me at anytime during the experience.   There is more to this than meets the eye, I can feel it... From what i've gathered from the broadcasts though, it does seem that this game takes place in Russia perhaps (some of the voices did seem to be talking in what sounded like Russian, but this is coming from a guy whose best Spanish translates to something close to 'The cat runs up a ladder'). Maybe after a war? I did hear some of the NATO alphabet at one point.  I liked it for it's simplicity and beauty. However, it's simple enough to beat in around seven minutes, so if that isn't enough for you, then don't play it. Duh. Now I sail my ship (S.S. Obvious) to other waters.",

One thing I need to point out is that the puzzles are sound based, hence the theme of  Antenna ! You need to listen carefully to get through the puzzles.   It is really short once you know how to puzzle it out, like with most fixed puzzle games, but with such games it is not for the impatient when first playing through it. I would recommend checking the game’s Community Hub for a hint or technical help if stuck. I needed to, since the interface had a slight glitch with the “?” button, and the implied hint of what to do kind of went over my head on the first puzzle. Heh, woops.  Anyway, if you are looking for a short break from other games, I would recommend checking this one out. You can likely beat it in one or two sittings, but the visual, and especially audio, details in it are what really make it interesting. Any armature radio operator would like find the details in the radio chatter almost a puzzle in of itself, since there are some encoded messages in it as well.",

Immediately prior to playing this game, I was playing a horror game that left me very apprehensive, so at first I was cautious with this game due to its dark colors and lonely sounds, but as I played, I noticed myself calming.  In addition to this, as I am quite fond of puzzles, and audio puzzles are not very common, this game was also rather stimulating with its few, albeit interesting, puzzles.  All in all, this game is great for relaxing, destressing, and simply taking a moment to breathe.",
