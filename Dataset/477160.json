Your avatar is controlled by you. And not well (but in a fun charming way). Each stick controls a hand. Triggers control the grips. Clumsily pick up items you need, manipulate objects, climb up walls, use controls, and more using your 'drunken baby' avatar. It sounds like an awful experience, but in reality it is fun and charming. It plays very similar (as I can tell) to gang beats. It isn't surgeon simulator level of ridiculous. It is clumsly, but manageable.  Also: - Future steam workshop for outfits and levels!  An easy recommend, as long as you can accept the wonky controls.",

I was having so much fun... Until he left but I still have a long fun time, the puzzles are puzzling, the parkour is SUPER HARD at first the gets easyer.. Even when playing at 3 phrames per secs.. Not really but it was kinda slow, 'cause I do not have a very good pc, and just in case u guys do not know how to play split screen, you just gotta press lmb and rmb, and lt and rt, and it workes, press lmb and rmb first if you want the keyboard to be p1 and press lt and rt if you want controler to be p1",

The first couple levels seem boring, and then the difficulty, creativity, and scale ramp up really fast. The game allows for so much ingenuity, and there's a billion different ways to tackle each task. The game gives you nearly no guidance, and that allows for a feeling of personal success. It's kind of like Gang Beasts if it was a puzzle platformer, or Octodad with 2 feet and climbing.",

It has funny ragdoll physics, split-screen as good as the single player and controller support to make it feel like youre playing on a console.  The 10 levels included are super-fun and provide HEAPS of of replay value.  This game deserves soo much more attention and i love the art style.  Everything and i mean EVERTHING has physics. No cutting corners in this joint.   After playing the game through once, you might grab a mate and go through the game again. On the second or third run, you experience finding shorcuts that let you WHIZZ through the game. And, after browsing the games news and Greenlight, you find cool other features like, Skip to any checkpoint, Cinematic View, Free Camera, First Person View.  In most of the levels there are many routes and little challenges that make the game soo much more fun. Personally, my favourite level has to be Ocean, as there are soo many routes and the puzzles are AMAZING!   This game was SOO worth the $20 (AU) bucks and i loved it.   I would definitely reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "It's fun sometimes. Unnecessarily frustrating and dumb other times. Infuriating when it's really bad. I know the controls are meant to be wonky and you're supposed to screw up and laugh at it, but doing something multiple times and failing wore me out. I cheated at a couple parts by plugging in a controller to have a second camera and player. Sometimes after doing that, I would realize an easier way to do the puzzle and berate myself for cheating.  I enjoyed the game when it was fun, but there were also a number of portions that made me angry. Maybe I wasn't doing the puzzles right, who knows?   But enough of that. The point is, the game isn't unfun for the most part. The concept works well in most situations and the situations themselves are completely ridiculous at times. I laughed quite a bit while tumbling off the edge of things. And I really enjoyed when a level allowed me to play it at my own pace and take my own path. And I'm grateful that there are few loading screens and you can get into the game very quickly.  If you're a fan of quirk, this game is full of it. If you can handle the frustration of a few confusing or difficult puzzles, you'll enjoy it. But if funky physics and metaphorical and literal brick walls get you down, you may want to move on. It's also fair to point out that the price is higher than what I'd pay. I spent a bit less on Itch. Still, I recommend it for being concise and simple and, despite my anger and cheating, not difficult to beat.",

            "review_text": "This game is amazing. I played couch co-op with a friend all the way through in one sitting and it was a total blast. Every level is unique and has a unique theme. People who say it got repetitive must be the kind of people who get bored of stuff very quickly and/or need some kind of action heavy game to fuel their twitchiness or something and just don't have the patience for puzzle games in the first place. The game constantly introduces new and varied puzzles and new mechanics and vehicles. It also has extremely good conveyance -- it teaches you what to do very well even in later levels without having to 'tutorial' you. It introduces new concepts/objects slowly building difficulty in layers.   While it is a bit short (~5 hours) and I wish it had more levels (because the game is so truly excellent), you have to remember that Portal was only ~3.5 hours of gameplay yet it was one of the best games of the year it was released. To me, this game is worth every penny of the full asking price.  I know that steam workshop support is on the way and I can't wait for more levels! I do also hope that the developer of the game decides to make an expansion/sequel that is at least the same length as the original game. I would buy it!  PS: kudos for making such an excellent game using Unity and for making it run 60fps buttery smooth with proper vsync and no hitches. So few Unity game devs out there know how to iron out those basic technical flaws.",

This is the first physics-based puzzler I've played, so I was surprised that the controls (using an Xbox 360 controller) felt really natural and intuitive. There's probably not enough content to justify the price for some, and the lack of a level editor kills the game's replay value, though I'm looking forward to trying out some multiplayer - several times during the game I thought to myself 'man, if only I had someone else here to do ...'. Hopefully we'll see more content and/or features added later (and hopefully it won't be in a paid DLC - I can't imagine putting any more money into this game unless there was a LOT of content added). Generally a pleasant and engaging experience. EDIT: Wanted to add - I didn't find everything, but I did take my time to look around and try to find all the hidden/side areas I could, and my total playtime was 7 hours.",

You can do whatever the game allows you to do within it's physics. Not that it's physics are something gold, it's pretty faulty but the goal of this game is to be funny, I guess. The only problem I've encountered is that you control your arms up and down at the same time you control the camera Y axis, so placing stuff around can be troublesome sometimes.   The level design is noteworthy, there's a lot of places to explore, paths to find, even tools and vehicles to commandeer. The graphics are simple, you can paint your dude as you wish but the music didn't appeal to me... it's kinda sad, and doesn't quite fit in the game.
