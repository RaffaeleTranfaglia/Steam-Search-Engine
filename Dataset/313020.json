            "review_text": "Soul Gambler is a really fun and short visual novel which is a modern retelling of Faust.  The novel follows on Faust. He works a boring job and has a mundane life, but all of that changes when he sells his soul to a witch for wishes. Each wish takes away apart of his soul and you have to find a way to get rid of the witch so you get to keep your soul.  The novel is a very interesting retelling of Faust, which I don't really remember much off, since the last time I read it was back in High School.  The novel is also quite interesting in general, since you can choose perk points at the start of the game and those help you out in other parts in the game, like seduction, brute force and intelligence to trick people.   The art style is also really well done, it's just fun to look around the environments, just because how awesome everything looks.   The multiple outcomes are also quite nice as it adds more replay value and I can see myself coming back to this game in the future to replay and get another endings I haven't got yet.  A single run of the game will last you 1 hour, but as stated before there are multiple endings and from what I understand there are 5 endings so that's 5+ hours of content and for the price that's quite a deal.  There are a few negatives like some sloppy writing and the horrible soundtrack.  I enjoyed my time with Soul Gambler and if you can get this game I highly suggest trying it out, cause it's quite awesome.  Final Rating: 7/10 - Good   If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

I played through the game a couple times and it was easy to see that the choices you were allowed to make had little impact in the direction of the story. Meanwhile, you are prevented from making decisions that could change the direction of the story in a meaningful way. Think of Soul Gambler as an interactive story similar to The Walking Dead except much, much shorter. My first playthrough was only an hour long.  The story itself is compelling, filled with alternate realities, moral choices, and a sexy seductress reminiscent of the movie Bedazzled. You start off dividing six points between four stats: Strength, Intelligence, Manipulation, and Charm. You can also choose to play the game in English or Portuguese. After that, the game begins.  Soul Gambler was interesting enough to keep me playing to the end. You can also get 'achievements' for completing the different directions the story takes you. One thing that put me off was you were often lied to in the story. In spite of being told (frequently) that you could never give up part of your soul unless you wanted to, I found the opposite was true in a number of cases.   I give it a hesitant recommendation for those who want an interactive story in a comic format. Is one hour worth of content enough to get you to buy this? The choice is yours.",

The stat system and selling parts of your soul adds an interesting element to it. I'm not going to rehash the description since the 'About' sums it up pretty well.  My 1.5 hour playtime got 16 of the 24 achievements. I still need to do a few more runs to get the others. So, you can see how short it is. You may or may not want to get it on sale. The full price tag is not too bad, though. This VN kept my attention the whole time.  ---   For more...    My Reviews   ||  My casual gaming...     Group   |   Curator Page  ",

No bit hurdles to jump and not much effort to 100% the achievements for this game, so no pressure for those who want high completion rates.  Pros:  1. Trading cards, trading cards, trading cards! 2. Easily 100%-able achievements! 3. An interesting story, akin to an interactive comic book.  Cons: 1. Your choices do change some of the story's incidentals, but the main part of it is unchanged... even the ending is for the most part unchanged! Incidentals are different, but each end involves a certain character getting a knife in the gut (no, not Faust, play the game for yourself to see) 2. Biggest con of the game: Once you beat the game in any way on that save file, it autosaves and restarts you to the very beginning: no saving before the end to see most of the endings for you! Full playthroughs all the way! (Those incidental changes, while being incidental to the plot, are still fun to watch, especially the one where you end with over 100% soul! =^_^=)  That being said, this game is simplistic but enjoyable, and feels like a computer-sized interactive comic book!  SIDENOTE: The story is good and an interesting spin on the whole Faust storyline, but has only the vaguest most tenuous connections to the real story of Faust! Don't use this game as any sort of Cliff's Notes on Faust-related homework.",

            "review_text": "Soul Gambler is a choose your own adventure type visual novel. You start the game by choosing to put points in four categories: Strength, Persuasion, Charisma and Intelligence. Basic gameplay involves choosing from a list of dialogue or actions. Stat checks during the story will often allow you to make special choices that will affect the game.  I've only completed 1 playthrough as of writing this review, which took about 30 minutes. There are a variety of achievements to earn which show that your choices will have some effect on the outcome. This game was entertaining enough that I want to play through differently just to see how it changes.  The graphics are well drawn and nice to look at. The sound is a little boring and doesn't add much to the gameplay. The writing kept me interested throughout, and made me want to give it another play.  The big downside is the length. The playthrough took about 30 minutes, and I imagine another playthrough would be shorter since I could skip through a lot of the repetitive dialogue. Looking at the list of achievements, there don't appear to be enough endings to require more than 2-3 playthroughs. So, about 90 minutes of gameplay is all you will get out of this. It's fun while it lasts, but definitely think about your budget when making the purchase. Whatever 90 minutes of entertainment is worth to you, that's how much I'd spend.  I recommend this game, but do keep it mind the short length. I got it in a bundle so did not spend much, and did enjoy my time with it.  Grade: C",

I dropped a few cents on it just because, and it turned out to be more than I expected. The story is very intriguing, not boring at all, and I found myself clamoring to know which ending I would get (there are multiple endings). Every choice you make in the game determines how things play out later on. It is also important how you distribute your character points at the very beginning - this makes some decisions suceed and others fail.  The art style is smooth and simple but nice. I never got tired of it. The music loops, but not flawlessly, and if you take your time reading you can tell when it starts over again. There are a couple of dialogues where the grammar isn't perfect, but it didn't take away from the experience at all. The achievements aren't too difficult to get, however there are a few where a very specific scenario is necessary to achieve them. It took me several playthroughs to get all of them. A general tip: if you're going for the achievements, save periodically; this way if you mess up you can quit without saving and start right before you made the wrong decision. Saves some time since you won't have to play through the entire thing again.  Like I said before, I got this game for a few cents, but I think it's worth it at full price ($2.99). The concept of gambling part of your soul to make things easier in your (Faust's) life is unique, you don't really see that in other games, especially visual novels. As of right now this is the best visual novel I've ever played.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in the story, or to someone who likes visual novels in general. I only wish it was longer. 9.5/10",

The game is also filled with poor spelling, bad grammar and some of the most ridiculous 'conversations' ever. Like the main guy asking a chick he just met and talked about work and nothing else for a kiss. I'm not sure if all this is standard fare for a VN, since as I said, these games aren't really my cup of tea.  Do I recommend it? Sure, if you like VN games. The story is unique and fun, and it has choices which might result in different reactions? I'm not sure, I haven't tried the different choices so I can't comment on it's replay value.  Another thing I like is the art style. If you enjoy gorgeous handcrafted art in your game, you will love this.",

And then one day he gets to change that by making the pact for the ability to sell his soul and in exchange get things to go his way.  The game is not long, it takes about two hours to finish, but there is a replayability value because of the numerous endings you can get by making different decisions throughout the game (4 endings in total). At the start of the game you get to distribute points in a 4 categories (Strength,Charisma,Persuasion and Intelligence) which will affect the outcome of the certain situations ingame. These points can also be altered if you do/don't do certain actions when needed.  The art of the game is very well done and frankly is what attracted me to the game at first. The ambiance in the background is a nice touch as well, too bad there is no voiceovers, because I feel that a good voice acting would make this a better game, but understandable because the game is made by a Brazilian dev team (I ended up narrating it for myself :)).  I enjoyed the game and played through to get all the endings and had fun. With the price of just 3€ (on sales even cheaper) there is nothing stopping you from buying it and enjoying it as well.   + art + background music + interesting story + multiple endings  - no voiceover - too short  Total: 7/10  P.S.

That's what I think the designers of Soul Gambler are thinking now. Free will? Are you kidding me? I tried in one save to get as far away from the witch as possible, but she ended up forcing me to make a pact with the bloody demon!   This game is incredibly linear. A lot of the same things- emphasis on A LOT- happen in each save. Sure, you may spend your soul on different things, or you may get out of situations differently, but the next scenes or consequences are always the same. And that really grinds my gears. I could ramble on about the free choice system and the strange 'RPG' elements in it, but what about the actual game? Okay, here's a good simulation. Just put your finger on your mouse and click it. Over and over again for about thirty minutes. There's the game.   Again, certain choices and moments in the story are enjoyable, but because it's a lot of the same stuff happening all the time, there's little incentive to go back. But go back I did about five times to find out every bloody secret this game had, and realized just how little the game actually had to offer. Besides the well-drawn scenery and poorly done sound (no voice actors, really? And why does the sound loop stop at the end for a moment before it begins?), it just isn't that immersive. I would've enjoyed it more if my actions had more consequences, or if the story had more variation. And this is a game with no voice actors and just drawings in its design! It'd be damn easy to make a whole new plot from decisions. But we have this. A crappily-put-together game. And, yes, I am bashing it a bit too hard. It does have good things in it. And I hope the developers learn from these errors in the game and make something so much better in the future. But as it stands, the best choose-your-own-adventure games that I've played so far are made by BioWare or TellTale.",
