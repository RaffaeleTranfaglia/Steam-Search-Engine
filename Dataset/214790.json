Basically you get this collection for the Meatboy prototype. That's worth the $3 it takes to buy it. A lot of these games seem like precursors to Meatboy. A lot of platformers, one unique asteroids type of game and not much else. Its worth $3 but not much more.",

Let's take a look at the games:  Aether - Loved it, exploration game with some small puzzles. Controls could use some work, but this is a great concept. Could work in a standalone game.  Time Fc*k - Another great concept. Puzzle game where you switch between layers to solve puzzles. Could work in a standalone game.  Meat Boy - A classic! No controller support though (hard !! :().  Grey Matter - Shoot 'em up without the shooting. Wasn't all that impressed, but it's ok.  Coil - Something about a pregnant lady. Weird and the controls plain suck.  Triachnid - Again, the controls suck. And no saves so you have to restart the game every time you exit. Nice concept, terrible execution.  And then there's 2 secret games (one of them is AVGM which is all about mouse clicking, the other one is unknown as of now) and a whole lot of extra content (audio Q&amp;A, artwork, etc.).  If you liked (S)MB and/or Isaac buy this !  [Rating: 80/100]",

And as for most of this guy's games the music is great. Meat Boy is pretty terrible. If you thought Super Meat Boy was a pain, try imagine it with unresponsive controls. Triachnid is interesting but barely anything you'll play for long. Coil - Play a sperm! Aether is just kinda adorable and has you flinging through space. Not much to it but it's time well wasted. Time ♥♥♥♥ is probably the mechanically most interesting one, very much worth a try. Spewer is a great platformer with a nice look to it and good mechanics, but it maniacly pumps up the difficulty very suddenly. This is probably the most interesting of the games alongside Grey Matter... Which I can't really describe well, but it's quite a neat game.  The Basement Collection ain't much with much in it. Sounds strange, and rightfully so..... Til' next time.",

I will sum it all up for you and basically say this is a game for people who like to take time to appreciate art or any form of game design ideas which have made massive steps forward in progression in terms of Flash games.  One minor issue is that you will need to look up an excessive amount of guides, but I will still love the crap outta this game bundle.",

The only game I don't particularly like is Tri-Achnid. Slow and clunky, not very fun to play. Altogether, more than worth four dollars.

            "review_text": "While this set isn't quite as bad as '♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls the game' aka The Binding of Issac, I will say that most of these games are barely Newgrounds circa 2002 quality. Sure, most were created quicky, but I'm surprised at how badly the controls don't work in most of them. The best game, Time ♥♥♥♥, is VVVVV with level shifting instead of orientation swapping.   Is there some sort of rule that physics based Indie games must have really really terrible controls? Aether is a tedious rope swinging game that attempts to use rope physics to swing from planet to planet.   Coil was the last straw. Basically, according to the dialogue, you play as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s sperm as you violate a woman, impregnate her, and then drive the newborn? into despair during the formation of the fetus (how does that even work?). Oh, and the controls are crap.",

If you're just a fan of the games themselves, this is *not* the game for you. It's a collection of scraps from earlier, ♥♥♥♥♥ier games that the devs made.   This is the sort of thing you'd expect to find as a 'bonus feature' on the Collector's Edition of Super Meat Boy or something. That's not the worst thing in the world! Just don't expect a new SMB or BoI. Just a lot of mediocre flash games and behind-the-scenes wackiness from the devs.",
