            "review_text": "I only played one hour of this at the time I'm making this review and despite the short playtime I foresee playing this more in the future. The premise is simple, why make a typing game be convoluted. I'm not saying Typing of the Dead is bad, or god forbid the games of our childhood that we were told to play in class. No those were all good on their own, but there's something so blissfully simple about this game that makes it exciting. It's like the typing version of 'You Don't Know Jack.' It has multiplayer implemented very well upon release. Not many small games get the 'Join Game' functionality right on steam, but this one has it down so it's easy to get your friend to hop on board with you and compete 1v1.  Speaking of competition, there are SOOO many different game modes, from connect 5, tug of war, to even just who can make the most words. There's always variety and you can always swap game modes in between matches. You can customize your matches to crank up the difficulty so it's fair.   You can even CREATE YOUR OWN LIST OF WORDS. I know, it's crazy, but say you wanted to just play a full game with nothing but curse words, you can do that. Albeit you have to type those words in by hand or find some website to rip the words from, but there's always some way to customize your experience. Just last night my friend and I jotted down a list of dank memes for our word bank to choose from for each game mode and had a blast!  For only 2 bucks...well $1.50 right now, I can't recommend this game more. Just sell a few steam trading cards or one of those stat trak fedoras you got from CS:GO and get typing!",

            "review_text": "Interesting and really simple game... makes typing fun honestly (i'm a writer though I already type for fun but you get my point)   The only thing though is it's not truly multiplayer... I mean... you're playing against a computer whose difficulty you can adjust accordingly but it does get boring... pretty fast.   It's not worth $1.99 in all honesty. Just isn't. There are different 'game' options but I feel this would me more for students to test their typing skills. That's the ultimate use I see for it.   But I mean, it's a good game. Try it out.",
