The gameplay is very much a cyber-hotline-miami with added rpg elements like items and skills. The weapon stats really make a difference as well so you have to pick your battles.  Besides that, the menu system isn't great and the controls are a bit flakey for a fast paced system but I like it all the same.  There is a high amount of replayability as well!",

Playlist is mostly great.  People in conversations emote appropreatly   writing is charming enough.   Cons_________________________________________  Guns with stats just makes all but the best guns feel cheap and sometimes useless spoilng the combat.   Camera, you gotta snap rotate it, hold to look further and even with the hybrid cam on its hard to aim.   conversation music drives me bonkers and unlike the into converations you can't auto skip the post mission ones.   picked up cash carrys on beyond death so money has no value. i got tired of cleaning the same level over and over, imagine fallout where when you die all the stuff in a level respawns but you still keep what you died with, a player will just farm or get tired of fiddling with the inventory all the time.",
