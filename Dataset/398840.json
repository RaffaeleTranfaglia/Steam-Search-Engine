If you want ot stick to playing on your phones and ipads and what not, be my guest, but this is a good game. I tend to like these kind of games because it is kind of open world but you still have to upgrade stuff. Some people may agree with me on this but if you dont, thats your problem and your opinion. I felt like i needed to make this reveiw so that some people could see a good reveiw so the creators could get more downloads. This is a GOOD GAME for people who like little simple games like this. But i still agree with a lot of people in saying that it is a basic copy of Boom Beach.",
