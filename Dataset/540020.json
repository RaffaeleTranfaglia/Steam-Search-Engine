            "review_text": "Avoid this game like the plague. The grammar is atrocious (periods do not exist), you can't get past the first 2 minutes of the game, absolutely horrendous '8 way' movement... But hey, if you like to battle, the guards will infinitely battle you! Oh and don't worry, they can't actually damage you... at all. So if you want to just grind and grind and grind then go at it!  Should it ever be playable again and I want to subject myself to pain, I will return and give it another shot. Judging by how the other games from this person went, however, I'm not expecting too much.  (Before anyone says anything about my time played... it's due to idling it for the cards.)  Oh, and before I forget to mention it... If you want to give some random person money to buy 'Cid's Theme' from Final Fantasy VII, then either this game or the first Final Quest are right up your alley! This iconic track from Final Fantasy VII is included in the BGM folder for both game. Also included? Some Wild Arms music!",
