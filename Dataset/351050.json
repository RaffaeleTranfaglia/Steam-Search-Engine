            "review_text": "I'm very pleased to say that this year's Cricket Captain is probably the biggest step forward the series has seen to date - they've eliminated a lot of stupid bugs that have been in the game for ages, and their 3d graphics actually look pretty okay now, with added shadows etc. The match engine has always been the key of the game, though, and it too has been updated to better reflect the aggressive cricket of the modern era, throwing up fantastic results that mirror real life in an unpredictable way, such that old Cricket Captain games would not have been able to manage.   8/10, biggest improvement I've ever seen in the series.

            "review_text": "Everything you want from a realistic cricket simulation... apart from one thing. You are only allowed to win once in a while by total random luck. No mattter how poor you opponent is or how great you are for the first 75% of the match, the simulation becomes a nonsense for the remainder of the game. The computer will score 200 runs for no wicket in the last session, or you will lose 8 wickets if you are batting. This game is not a simulation it is a script, and like most repetative stories it eventually becomes boring.",

            "review_text": "When I was in school, my math teachers always insisted we 'show our work' - we had to demonstrate what steps we took to get from the base equation we had been given to the answer we came up with. I once got a 0/100 on an assignment because I didn't show my work. The teacher wrote the score on the page in front of me and scolded me in front of the entire class for it.  Cricket Captain 2015 is very much in that same boat.  The trick with most sports managment sims is, they demonstrate an athlete's abilities to the player through an attributes system; for instance, in Football Manager, Gonzalo Higuaín is better as a striker than Carlos Puyol not just because that is his natural position, but also because he has a much higher 'Shooting' attribute, and probably several others that reflect his strengths. This is done to give the player a general guideline for whether he should expect success, failure, or something in between in a given matchup or scenario, even though it won't always work exactly the way the numbers dictate.  Cricket Captain 2015 does not do this. There is not clear and present attribute system, merely a series of standard cricket statistics and nebulous 'Form' and 'Fitness' ratings. Yet, the Form rating is hardly perfect, because I frequently have players with one-star Form wildly outperforming players with three- or four-star Form, and Fitness doesn't have any effect at all that I've noticed or had explained to me. The manual explains that batsmen also have a fatigue rating during matches, but fatigue is only visible for bowlers, so you as captain don't know when to dial back the aggression on your batsmen and try to let them recover for another big push. Unless you just recognize the names of bowlers, you really have no idea who will be good and who won't until they've taken a couple of wickets, which doesn't reflect the intense scouting and scrutiny of high-level sports. The player is given little control over what his team does, which can lead to a lot of frustrating big overs for opposing bats and wickets lost for your own side.  This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that there clearly is some sort of underlying attributes system that the player just isn't allowed to see. I get messages through my training sessions that players have improved certain attributes. What were those attributes before, and what are they now? Being able to see those things would allow me to adjust what I'm instructing my players in, so I know if I'm wasting my time trying to make a bowler more accurate or trying to make my young wicketkeeper a better fielder.  Despite a manual that does offer a few useful tips, the developers don't seem to have taken into account that this could be someone's first deep exposure to cricket, as evidenced by the lack of a tutorial of any kind. I've logged almost four hours in this game and still don't quite know what everything does. A scripted T20 or ODI match to help players get a feel for how the game works and how the sport works.  The game also lacks pretty much all forms of polish. I've had games where the field completely disappears and leaves the players standing on a black screen during highlights. There is no music of any kind. There's an option for menu sound, but there is no menu sound. These things are baseline in video games these days, so their absence is duly noted here.  For all the flak I give this game, I don't think it's that far away from being pretty good. It just needs to do a better job of giving its players information about why things are happening the way they are. Overall, if you're a die-hard fan of cricket with $25 burning a hole in your pocket, that probably won't stop you from finding some measure of enjoyment from this game. Everyone else should hold off and see what the 2016 edition looks like.",

I've been playing the 20/20 World Cup and after a steep learning curve i got to finally win a world cup with the West Indies.   A niche' game, yet easily the best niche' cricket game there is.",
