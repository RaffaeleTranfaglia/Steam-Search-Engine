            "review_text": "JUMP gives me the same feeling about VR platforming that Super Mario 64 did about 3D platforming almost 20 years ago: there are some kinks to work out, but overall, we're figuring it out.  Let's be honest, 99% of gamers who have put on a VR headset (Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive) agree that this technology is going to change the future of entertainment as a whole (not just gaming). It's the ones who haven't tried it out that remain skeptics.  Due to the potential motion sickness that it might induce, JUMP may not be the right game to introduce those skeptics to the power of virtual reality, but for those of us who have our VR-legs and don't get sick easily, this game is a great challenge and fun to play. You're tasked with reaching the tallest point in each of five major U.S. cities, and you have to achieve that goal in the fewest number of jumps possible. Replaying levels to minimize your jump count becomes addictive, and the awesome soundtrack keeps you moving.  Locomotion controls need to be a little bit more sensitive, and you'll notice it most when jumping to small platforms that require you to quickly slow down after sticking the landing. But that's my only real gripe.  This is the first game from Endeavor One, a studio comprised of ex-Halo and Destiny developers, and if it's any indication as to the direction they will be taking with their virtual reality games, count me excited for the future of this stuff.",

            "review_text": "Great VR experience! It is thrilling to jump from between buildings. Jump's visual style is very clean and effective for this type of gameplay. The control scheme is smooth and intuitive. The music is dope! I would listen to it outside of the game. The game mechanics are easy to pick up and challenging to master. I will be playing these levels over and over in order to get the best jump score possible.",

Very easy to get into the game, without having to setup any weird settings or move windows around. The screenshots/videos don't do it justice. You really have to experience it in VR to understand the scale/depth it brings. Very cool!",
