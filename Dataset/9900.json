            "review_text": "I've been playing this game on and off since it's launch and it has gotten better from those days. My perspective is from one who only plays PvE(Player vs Environment) content. I'd recommend you try this game if;  1) you are not bored with the tradional WoW type MMO (hotbar combat) 2) you are Star Trek fan 3) you like to play doll with your character(s) (the character customization in this game is awesome) 4) you can live with bugs popping up (The new VP promises that bugs will be fix fast but only time will tell) 5) you can resist(or don't mind gambling) since there are lock boxes in the game which gives out a top prize of ships(basically classes in the game), etc  BUT you can get all these things in game if you have enough in game assets to dabble in the exchange(auction house)  6) you don't mind the usual MMO grindfests which can get repetitive to farm better gear, etc 7) you are not a hardcore gamer 8) your internet connection to the servers is not crap  The gameplay itself is nothing to write home about and the main reason I'm still playing it is because it's the only Trek MMO out there. The game panders mostly to the casual crowd.  Contrary to some, the game in my opinion is not Pay to Win. You can have access to all the ships and gear if you grind enough currency to exchange for these items which other players put up in the auction house. Using real money is just a shortcut in the game.  Also this game features player created missions, some of which, are much better than the official ones. Don't forget to give some a try if you decide to try this game out.  In my opinion, Free to Play means demo and Star Trek Online's demo is surprisingly good in the sense that it's not restrictive like in some other MMOs. If your ISP does not suck and you can wait to download a 10GB or so game, give it a try and see if it's up your alley. Live long and prosper. \\V/.",

            "review_text": "Star Trek Online. I have almost 2000 hours on record. But I do actually have way more than that. For a while I had a really weak computer and I played the game standalone on a the DVD cover release. Back when that still existed.  Where do I start?  Star Trek Online has been through two phases, one is now gone but I'll take you through it anyway. To see how it has evolved.  When Star Trek Online was released it was driven by Cryptic and released by Atari. Both on their own site, Steam and through DVD boxes in stores. At that time the game was really weak and lacking. There was no audio dialog or fancy cutscenes and the graphics were already a tad outdate. New content was barely released because of how small the team was. But we still had a lot of fun exploration missions, you could visit every star system even if that ment just flying around the planet and looking around. You also had to pay to play back then. You could buy playing time online or buying 'month' cards.  Then the big boss 'Perfect World Entertainment' came a long. Now this was a good and a bad thing. The good news is that since Perfect World has a lot more resources than small Cryptic. And Atari was just a publisher, this now ment that Star Trek Online had a big team with a lot of resources. This mean the game quickly evolved in a highly positive way.   Such as missions getting better and more complex, the introduction of even more advanced audio dialoge and cutscenes. The general story telling of the game got improved a lot. There have also been way more updates and patches and they even just recently overhauled the graphics engine and it looks all quite nice. The ships have also been re-done since Beta days to make them look more realistic. Most even have brand new, made from scratch models and textures. So the graphics now compared to release are amazing.  That being said. The game is now free to play and everything ingame can be accessed without real life money. Though it'll take you ages to do that. But since the game is free, and there's something you really want I don't see a problem buying it for real money. You support the developers.  While the developers do not always pay attention to small bug reports that have been sitting on the forums or tickets for ages. They do fix serious issues. For example one time, I deleted my main character that I'd have for years and after 2 weeks I got a mail saying they managed to recovery the character. They are also good at cracking down mean players and annoying 'gold sellers'.  While the story driven content and graphics have been improved, togheter with general gameplay some things have been 'broken' as well.  For example, most systems in the Galaxy cannot be entered unless you have a specific mission. Almost all systems have a patrol mission, where you enter.. Explore, kill some bad guys or something. But when you've done that once. You are NOT allowed to repeat the mission on the same character.  The story arc is also 'shared' for all the factions in the game. Each faction has some unique missions but in the end they follow the same line of missions but it's done in a way so it's somewhat different and okay in my eyes.  They removed the exploration missions. In the old days the game itself generated a random star system, a random map and a totally random mission. So nothing was ever the same. Almost. Anyway it was a fun way to get some diversity in the game when you've done all your leveling and stuff. This was sadly removed because it did not 'feel up to the game standards' but we have not seen a replacement.  So when you're done playing all the story missions and done all the patrol missions. There are also some mini missions on Starbases and some planets, but again. These are non replayable. All you got is PVE and PVP. PVE is mostly dead but if you get in a fleet you can run private sessions. PVP is somewhat broken if you can call it that. It means the 'general' player can't really compet here because of how out of control DPS has gotten. But that's something you can google. Of course if you wanna' get into DPS it can be quite fun for those who love that.  But in short, Star Trek Online is an amazing game that brings the Trek universe to full scale in my eyes. You can visit and see all the locations from the show. All the starships are included in great detail along with a few new ones. The game also take place in 2409-2410. That's way ahead of Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation. That allows the game to have technology that wasn't in the series. For example personal shield generators and stuff like that. It works out great with the game setting and it does bring the feel of this is what Star Trek would evolve too.  There is a lot of Star Trek lore in the game to enjoy, everything from food items to a name mentioned. Or just a location or event in the series. You can also meet a lot of Star Trek Characters complete with audio dialog from their actors. Like the Doctor played by Roberto Picardo, Tuvok by Tim Russ and even Neelix by Ethan Phillips. There are also some people from Star Trek Enterprise etc.  The game also now focuses heavily on what happend in Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9, The Next Generation, Enterprise and even The Original Series. For example a lot of the deep episodes on the TV shows that was not really fully explained. Like Yeasterday's Enterprise.. The Temporal Cold War. The Iconians.. Stuff like that are explained in the game and it's just amazing.  But you don't need to be a Trekkie to play. You can still pick up on a lot of the jokes etc. There is also a lot of customization involved in the game. You have a lot of options when it comes to designing your character. It even puts the character creator in Saints Row to shame, and that's saying something. You can also customize your starship and mix parts. For example a Galaxy Class can have different nacelle's.. (Engines for you non Trek fans).  Anyway to this day, even though it's free the game gets new content quite often compared to other MMO's. The only other bad side is that the game community can be quite... Hostile. So it'll be hard to make friends and feel welcome. Try to ignore that, as some of the players including myself are awesome and nice.  In short, this is an amazing game. Especially if you are a Trekkie. And the fact that it's free, it doesn't hurt to try. Does it?  Also the game runs well on my system, though I have a very powerful system. Sometimes you do get a tad huge FPS drops if there are a lot of clicky powers etc. But that's just the game slowing down. Not you. Also on the Steam Page it's mentioned that it can run on 'Intel HD Graphics' this is only newer generation. The game was developed to work on Intel HD Graphics so everyone can play it. I tested it on my laptop with a Core i5-5500 2.20 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 5500. The game runs quite well with graphics set to low. You can have things like character detail, high detail objects and textures maxed out. But fancy things such as lighting and shadows must be off. Still runs quite well on a 'non gaming laptop'.",

            "review_text": "An amazing game all considered! To me it's just incredible to see how much it has grown and improved since three years ago when I started playing. It has it's defects, I won't lie to you. But it's definitely the most original mmo experience I've ever had, the most vision inspired and honest endevour! There's plenty to do, space combat is great, complex and exciting. As are the mechanics of gameplay, in general. Ground combat is ok, but improvents are constantly in development. Also, to be honest, pvp play falls a bit short at the moment, even though after just a first match you can realize that there's huge potential, and the community around pvp is remarkable (they even started an open school!). Gameplay is very story-driven, and most of the narrative inside it's absolute TOP NOTCH Star Trek fiction -they have brillian writers. It is, I think, the only place where new Trek episodes are being made at the moment. It's been showcased in many mmo rpg reviews and also won a 'best free to play' title a year ago.  If the game is not enough for you, and if you feel like it, there's an integrated editor called 'The Foundry' where every player can create their own episodes (=quests, pve campaigns), and upload them into the game for everybody to play, review and vote (there's a periodic competition with prizes for the winner)! The content is limitless!  What else can I say... I just loved it from day one and I will keep playing it, as I know Cryptic is committed and passionate about making it a little better every day!  Just try it out and decide for yourselves, it's free to play for crying out loud!! :D Live long and prosper!",

            "review_text": "As a Founder, with a lifetime account I will admit up front my opinion may contain a small amount of bias. Since I have not had to pay for the game, following Beta, I have had the fortune of enjoying it off and on at leisure. STO, has evolved since the beginning, with a whole new research and development system, additional episodes with a magnificent ton of canon content, STO allows players to experience up close, old favorite worlds, species we've grown up with for decades, and new, powerful enemies of ancient Trek lore, back to cause destruction. The graphics are mid-level, but the game makes up for those shortcomings by allowing players to fully customize their ships, officers, characters, and more.   One evil little caveat, this game is notorious, and I do literally mean Notorious for it's legion of micro-transactional content. I do not agree with the level the current owners of ESO take micro-transactions. I believe that paying out of pocket for the chance to wear Star Trek: The Motion Picture costumes, is a little overboard. This is just one example, there are hundreds more. Each has to be bought separately with coins from the in-game store. Coin's can be purchased with real money. As a huge fan of Trek, up until about 2 years ago I had purchased everything the in-game store allowed, and the sheer volume of new content available by micro-transaction was so high, I didn't have the hundreds or even thousands of dollars necessary to keep up with it. Sadly, there is a lot of content, including actual pay to win ships, consoles, etc. which may be out of the casual gamers reach. If one can overlook this glaring and elephant in the room sized flaw the game has, the game can be fun. The episodes are like playing an interactive star trek series. It has a lot of room for growth and potential. I would recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.",

The game offers a variety of playstyles, ships, equipment, and crew controls. The fact that you can get a huge capital ship by simply getting to the endgame and not needing to pay for one was a great surprise. The seasonal events were a blast. As a star trek fan is really made me feel at home. By the time i hit max level i found myself actually buying things with real money just so my character would look all the more cool hehe. Definitely give it a shot if you are an mmo or startrek fan.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely fantastic game. I've played for years and yes, sometimes the content in the new seasons leaves something to be desired, and the cost for zen-store content is a bit on the greedy side, but for a free-to-play title I'm happy to tithe forward a few bucks every month for a few extra nice-to-have cosmetic goodies. The foundry (permitting self-written content) is fantastic. The replayability is high and frankly - being able to pop online and fly a ship around the Star Trek universe for a bit provides a nice break from the daily grind. NOT a game for those who want PVP - but since I'm happily well in the PVE preferring body of gamers I've got zero issues with that. There are some variances from Star Trek canon, but the development team at PW seems to have continued to work on keeping to what's reasonable for the universe as Roddenberry framed it. The variety of story lines can sometimes come across as a mash-up that doesn't mesh terribly well, but the quantity and variety vastly outweigh any annoyance at those moments. Highly recommend giving it a go - as a f2p option you've literally got nothing but some time to lose and the chance to get to know a hell of a good game.",

Now that I have come back and tried to play it again, it seems that a lot has been changed for the better in my opinion.  The grind wasn't that bad at all. I never found myself having to grind because of being underleveled and whatnot. By playing the episodes and playing on the event weekends (2x weekends, etc), I easily made it to Lv 55 in about 100 hours. Keep in mind that I casually played this game for about 2 - 3 hours a day.  The only thing I bought was 2k Zen, so I could buy my favorite ship, the Excelsior Refit Class. I was Lv 50 when I bought it. I could have gone with a T6 ship, but I already had the free Kobali Cruiser and I prefer the Excelsior Refit due to it's dashing good looks.  If there is one big problem with the game, it would be the ground missions. The ground mechanics are extremely boring. They really should focus on just scrapping the current ground system and re-building it with a more dynamic/controllable.",

New contend new ships new missions new events is it good yah it is, is it the best hell no. But its for sure 200% better than at start. The Free to Play model is fine its not pay to win because you`re doing more pve than pvp at the end pvp is not worth looking for in this game so ignore that one. Still you can pvp but its cheesy bad that you think Elder Scrolls Online is better.   However there is a downside to everything like every mmorpg the end game is really the endgame you can farm special items or crew or whatever you want to do. So thats the downside of the game however there is also a more elite missions you can do or turn your story line to elite to get better loot.  You can change everything not only your ship or you but even your crew your deck of the ship and even costum your engine increasing it at your taste. There are cookie builds on the net to squeeze the maximum of your char and ship. But thats your taste of gaming.   Give it a chance play its free you know no money is needing to it. Perhaps if you like it badly you can buy a great ship you like. Fear deal right?",

However, despite this, it's still equitable for the F2P player. As the game description says, it's like being inside the show. Sector narration is done by Leonard Nimoy, Michael Dorn reprises his role as Worf and there are other familiar characters. If you're a Star Trek fanboy like me, then you'll see this game as a time suck. It's not the most visually stunning game out there but it's a lot of fun.  Edit 1: Recently, Tim Russ reprised his role as Tuvok during a Dyson Sphere event.   Edit 2: Now that I have more time on record, I can add a few things. My view about the game above is still the same. However, I will take the time to add a few things. As I said before, it helps if you're a Star Trek fan to begin with. You get to play with the ship types you saw in the different series and you get to visit the places you could only see on TV. I will caution you that the story takes place some 30 years after the events of the last Star Trek movie (no, not the new ones...I mean Nemesis). If you take that into consideration, you'll realize that it's a whole new take on the franchise.   Edit 3: I mentioned before that there are microtransactions. Really, the best ships are there and it wouldn't hurt to drop some money on Zen to get a few of them. That being said, you seriously don't have to. What you're really paying for are the consoles that come with them that give you some neat abilities. When you hit max level, you can get all kinds of equipment by running PvE/PvP queues that evens the playing field. So, you don't need to buy anything at all.   Edit 4: With the Legacy of Romulus update they did, the current mechanics seem to favor the Romulans since you can choose a side. Their ships seems to have the advantage in fights and function in multiple capacities. That being said, the disparity isn't actually there. Each race has their strong suit and each race is deficient somwhere.",

            "review_text": "Star Trek online is a game which follows in the footsteps of the franchise T.v shows in that the story and characters are always respectful of the lore but like the new movies alot of the plot revolves around time-travel and dimensional travel but so what, it seems the new season is focused on previously untold and unexplored concepts around Millenia-dormant threats from numerous ancient races which push the boundaries of the lore. I think many of the story mission sagas would actually make good comics or novels but most players lament not having conversation choices impact the story in a significant way, even though there are many opportunities to play as evil or good. The lengthy Rep system and new Research schools and specialization trees cretainly breathed life into the game for dedicated players, as well as new ships available to all players who complete events during winter and summer. 'No player need be left behind' in terms of ships and equipment, if you trade longer playtime for an outright buy. Important here to note is the store in this game has exorbitant prices, a ship can cost you $30 dollars only to be outclassed later and there are many 'packs' that range in the hundreds of dollars, 'WTH'? right? but believe me, I've played a long time and any player can earn and buy any ship the free way and it won't take THAT long maybe like a saving a month in-game at the most for a good ship. Lock box ships can also be purchased on the exchange I know many people who get them this way. All in all, what with events and discounts and giveaway's and dedication, I don't feel leftout as a non-subscriber and over the years I can say the game earned what I spent, at least I wasn't dumb enough to get into Lockbox keys but If you want to gamble 100's of dollars you deserve a good ship! crazy. Anyway, Graphics are good with many story options, some actually stunning enviroments like summer Risa, hours of fun for Trek fans or sci-fi ship combat fans, although ship combat is some of the best I've played, its done in a third person view with a more stategic take in that the skills and manouvering you use in combat are all important since all combat is auto-aimed. Same with ground combat strategy is all important and headshots non-existant but for a skill tree which gives a crit bonus for aimed shots. Anyhow, I would say check it out, I don't offer many criticisims because the game is quite open ended and everyone finds a different nche of activities they like, Over-all it's impressive work but I would say suffers like all MMO's because they also incorporate alot of 'mindless' grindiness into into it, if you know what I mean, something like being presented with a mountain of dull paperwork to do to get some rewards but again it's up to the player if they 'feel' like it or not.",

The story missions are pretty enjoyable compared to most MMO's, and make you feel involved in the plot rather than just as a witness to it. Also unlike other MMOs you aren't stuck doing gathering/kill quests to advance, but instead you are doing stuff to advance storylines. It was refreshing to play through an MMO that felt more like a proper story-based game.  At times it feels like a strange fanfic of what happens next in the original universe, but it's still Star Trek. Sure the DS9 and Voyager continuations can make little sense, but it's still a fun time to see those characters return.  If you're a Star Trek fan there is more than enough in here to delight you for a good long while.",

I installed it and created my account and I was truly amazed by just the amount of immersion they have built into the game. Ypou start by creating your character, You can choose between Federation, Klingon Empire or Romulan Empire... I picked Starfleet of course!  Upon creating your character I was expecting your normal 6 races that were peoples most favs but I soon learned that you could go as far as being Andorian and even a Trill(Joined or not) BUT it does not stop there, They have also included the tools to create your own Alien Race complete with special abilities custom looks and the lot. Imagine Spore Creature Creator in an MMO!   The Tutorial began and I was celebrating graduation from starfleet Academy which for me was a real shame because I would liked to have spent some more time and perhaps even my first 10 levels just learning about the game and the Star Trek Universe. I mean would you take up the chance to do a class on Warp Engineering?  This is where the excittment stopped for me, There is ground combat but I refuse to even Awknowledge that part of the game as its severly lacking in every possible way. (I remember one time I was being chased around a tree by a Klingon... all my friends just stood and laughed at me)   Space battles are extremely intense and provide a great bit of stress relief though I felt there could have been a little more.  SUGGESTION: Not something I can really complaoin about but I'm going to rant and suggest it here... this is Star Trek and there is no ability to command your ship from the captains chair... I want to be able to walk around my ship issuing commands to my crew, not steering and fighting in 3rd person from outside the ship!   Now that is all I can say but would like to also note it is a Theme Park MMO and I find these rather boring so this is not one I have played a lot of but it is one that has earnt itself a spot on my shelf and it will remain there defiantly.",

Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content. The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.  I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.",

From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.  The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles.   Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last.   More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch.   I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story.

            "review_text": "Star Trek Online: An MMO RPG where you begin as a captain of a 'Miranda-Class', 'ShiKahr-Class' or 'Centaur-Class' Light Cruiser of the Federation. Travel across the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta quadrants of the Milky Way Galxy, fighting numerous opponents such as Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians and many many more. Pilot your ship in ever-challenging combat scenarios and send yourself along with an away team to different planets to fight intense ground combat battles. You will ascend through the ranks of the Federation and gain new and more powerful ships along the way, choosing either a Science, Engineering or Tactical path as you become one of the most powerful captains the Federation has ever seen.   So I have around about 45 or so hours on this game on steam, around the same amount off of it also, and let me tell you it's my favourite game outright on PC. It's one of those games where it's so rich in lore and exciting combat, I can hardly get off of it. The story has clearly been designed by people passionate about all Star Trek lore, including the newer J.J. Abrams movies, as you'll see in the story. The episodes you play are exciting, clever and challenging, so much so that I find myself engulfed in a battle against a huge Romulan D'Deridex warbird in my reasonably large Intrepid Long-Range Science Vessel.  The combat GUI and controls are very nicely assigned allowing fluid and immersive combat on ground and exhilarating space combat, paired with gorgeous 3D visuals and beautiful particle effects it fully immerses you into the Star Trek galaxy. This game is beautifully designed by a great team; Cryptic have successfully made a game woprthy of being canon with the Star Trek Universe.  So I should do a traditional 'Pros V Cons' list so here goes.  Pros:  ~ Great Servers, never experienced any lag and loading times for large areas are decent.  ~ Nice Selection of Ships, huge lists of small shuttles all the way to the monstrous 'Obelisk Carrier'... it's big.  ~ Great Story Missions, facing a huge selection of enemies from all the Star Trek TV and Movies.  ~ Beautiful Visuals, maps and particle effects are great, along with the ships too.  ~ Lovely community, never seen any kind of hate war on the chat, only people willing to trade and help eachother out.  ~ Combat difficulty is dependent on your level, not the mission order.  ~ Custom Player, Bridge Officers, Ship, Ship Name AND Ship Designation Number (NCC-1701 style)  ~ EPIC MUSIC, nuff said.  Cons:  ~ Pay to play is evidently the case for higher level players wanting more ships or ships of better quality.  ~ Some ground tasks within missions can seem more like a fool's errand more than 'Investigating' however of course that sometimes is the life of a starfleet officer.  ~ Patch download the first time is quite substantial and is always increasing with every update.  ~ Really Nitpicking, the planet's aren't full scale.   All together I completely recommend this genious brilliant game, you'll enjoy it massively if you've evr appriciated any star trek series OR film. Seriously, start the download now.",

Most end game ships require coin to unlock, but thats only if you want to aquire more than the 1 you are given at top level.  I would say the most negative thing about the game is the Lock boxes ( form of gambling ) they use keys to open this costs real money and then your not guaranteed the item you seek, This type of gambling should not be allowed in games consdering the lack of filters they contain on these matters.  Other than that I cannot fault it..  ",

Yes, you can go inside of your ship. - Ongoing development and semi-frequent events - The team hands out free stuff from time to time - Some characters from the show are in the game and voice acted completely by the actors  Cons - Can be glitchy at times but easily fixed - Can feel like a grind at times but thats just every MMO - Requires internet connection just like every MMO - Some customization options cost money - Dumb loot box system that you have to pay real money for keys to open it and maybe get something cool (I never got anything and i've done it at least 5 times) - Endgame items (ships/upgrades/customization) costs either weeks of time or money",

            "review_text": "So right off the bat, I'm going to make the claim that if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll find something to love about this game.  Whether it's the episodic campaign that draws heavily upon the series and films. Or the vast overworld that allows you to beam down to many of the iconic locations you've come to know and love, such as Deep Space Nine, Starfleet Academy, Earth Stardock, Risa, and, taken directly from the most beloved film of the series, Paradise City from ST V. (Kidding.) Or just being able to run around your own ship or shuttle, most of which are inspired by, or are of the same class as, the ones from the show/films, and pilot it around the galaxy. There's something in this game for everyone.  Since most people here have already covered the big parts of the game, I'll point my own personal list of Pros and Cons:    PROS:   - Fantastic Campaign:  The devs for STO are big time Trek fans, and you'll definitely discover this once you start making your way through the campaign of your choice: Starfleet, Romulan, or Klingon. Each episode is formatted like an episode of the show, most of which are heavily inspired by plotlines from the show and films. Some of the episodes even continue the stories of some ST characters. Some devolve into shoot-'em-ups, but most --  especially  the recent ones -- are 100% Trek, on par with the show. There are also player-created missions available to play through by way of the Foundry, which is awesome and something I wish more MMOs would incorporate.  -  Frequent Updates:  Cryptic update the game with major episodic content a few times a year, most of which have featured actors reprising their roles from the series, such as Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok), and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar). Leonard Nimoy also narrates many key parts of the game in-character as Spock. Each new episode has added new story content, dailies, and general updates -- and all of them have been free. We've had one full-fledged expansion,  Legacy of Romulus , and another one on the way in October called  Delta Rising .  -  The Star Trek Experience:  A lot went into making the game feel like a genuine Trek experience. The general atmosphere, the scale of the overworld, the missions, the visuals, locations, and characters. You take command of your own ship, and you can pretty much roll up any character you can imagine: from the stock races, such as Human, Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazoid, Trill, Orion, etc., to a custom alien race that you can define. There are also a lot of RP opportunites: Dabo(!), asteroid mining, ship interiors, and seasonal events. Just a lot of great stuff.  -  F2P Model:  If I had to make a list of the most ethical F2P MMOs on the market... it would be a short list, but STO would be near the top. All of the story, PvE, and PvP content is free, as are all the updates. Most of the things Cryptic are making money off of are cosmetic items (uniforms, ship interiors/exteriors), ships (but the free ships are just as competitive), and services like inventory space, character slots, bank space, etc. The two things that I would count against it are the lockboxes, which can be easily ignored, and the two races locked behind a paywall, though with nearly infinite races available to you, it doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. With a model like this, I've been happy to support it since I started playing.    KHANS:   - Sector Space:  Initially, it's no big deal, but after some time you start to realize how unintuitive Sector Space can be, sectioned off the way it is. Can you land here, orbit, or do nothing? Why are there invisible walls in space? There's an event here, but is anyone participating? What does the event even entail? Cryptic have stated in the past that they want to give Sector Space an overhaul, which would be awesome, but we still have it for now.  -  Instance Stagnation:  There are a lot of PvE and PvP instances to queue up for. People play a select few, but most have stagnated -- not from lack of players, just lack of interest. I'd much rather them not be there if no one's going to play them, so that Cryptic would be able to put more focus on the ones people still enjoy.  -  Community:  Do yourself a favor and find a good fleet that you can get along with, because the community in STO, at least the vocal part, might just drive you insane. This is nothing new to online games, but it seems abnormal in a Trek game. Part of the reason might be how fragmented chat is in STO, which makes moderation rather difficult. Making chat universal across individual sectors would make things better, I think, but for now reading ESD chat might just make you go blind.  I think that about covers it! Like I said, if you're a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a try, especially now that we're on the verge of a new expansion.  Live long and prosper!",

            "review_text": "Star Trek Online (STO) is a solid MMORPG with tons of customization option for those who are willing to work for it. It is not, however, a good Star Trek game.   For me, the main draw of Star Trek isn't so much the science fiction, which let's face it, is on the silly side. It is the characters, the dynamics between the crew that makes it interesting. In-game, however, crew members are treated as little more than equipment, so that personal connection is gone. You gain the ability to customize your officers however you want, true, but you lose what makes them characters.  Another problem of the game is the randomly generated sidequests. Sure, it's fun to pretend that you are the star of your own Star Trek show, routinely investigating strange species, artifacts, and negative space wedgies, but the mad-lib style of quest generation means that after a while, all these quests seem to blur together. So aside from the story quests - which are well done, by the way - none of the other content is memorable.  The saving grace for these sidequests is the Foundry, which allows users to create their own quests and stories. Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here; 90% of the custom content is lackluster, but the other 10% makes it worthwhile.  While the game has problems that prevent it from being truly great, I would still recommend it for MMO gamers. The universe feels big, the ship-to-ship combat is frantic but tactical (although sometimes you fight with the UI more than the enemy), and the amount of reference to the Star Trek shows can make Star Trek enthusiasts giddy. If these sound exciting, that this is the game for you.",

From then on you are required to buy ships and equipemnet with real money if you want any chance to finish missons. So this means you'll get a good 50 hours gameplay until you have to reach into your pocket for mmo virtual products. So if your a star trek fan of any of the franchise give this a play for a few hours and decide after if you wan to spend money. The ship fights are great. The fan made missions are even better. The arrangement of your bridge crew adds fighting and mission abilites which is great. Complete customisation of your self crew and ship. The only downside I found was that every mission had you kill emeny ships. Its not very federation if your killing everything. The fan missions have a bit more of a true federation feel to them than the main ones. There is alot of fighting for a peaceful exploring space federation. Also its always updateing.

            "review_text": "Update: 7 February 2016;  It's a fun game to play for a while, especially for fans of the series. There are plenty of different ships, including the main ships from each series; James T. Kirk's Constitution-class Cruiser, Jean-Luc Picard's Galaxy-class Cruiser, Benjamin Sisko's Defiant-class Escort, Kathryn Janeway's Intrepid-class Long-range Science Vessel, Jonathan Archer's NX-class Escort. You can also find some movie-specific ships in the game, such as the Excelsior-class.  You could also go for a Klingon or Romulan Republic character, which opens up other ships and options, as well as unique story routes for these characters.  Endgame is a lot of PvE/PvP grinding, but what MMO does not have that? STO at least offers a variety of ways in which one can 'grind'. Such as research and development, special missions for duty officers or admiralty ships, and a reputation system with its own special rewards.  There is also room for daytrading on the exchange, although item prices seem regulated by a few dozen players who have large stocks of special items laying around on alt-characters and alt-accounts. Not too infrequently I have come across items which are no longer obtainable in the game, bought one or two to see if the price would rise, only to see five more of the same item put up on the marketplace within minutes, as if the sales triggered them to be posted.  PvE missions are all doable with items obtainable through in-game currency, but if you are looking to do PvP, it is more of a pay-to-win situation. The more competitive ships require ZEN to buy them or items for them, and while you can trade Dilithium for ZEN, at a cost of 316:1 it's simply not worth it.  The community is decent, and the new armada system allows fleets to work together more, so it's definitely worth looking at playing it with some friends.",

PROS: - You will get to choose your own new starship around every 10 levels, or basically with a new promotion. - There are LOTS of missions and some of the stories are pretty long and interesting. You will have to accomplish multiple tasks (even puzzles) to progress further in your story. - You get to choose your own uniforms, which includes the colors and looks. - You get to travel through many sectors of space with beautiful views of stars, nebulas, and planets if you choose to approach a particular solar system. - You do not have to buy anything in order to progress through any story or missions - this is an option for if you want to get a cool looking ship or other features. - You get to choose what alien race you will be, hence deciding your organization as well. Will you choose to side with the Federation, the Klingon Empire, or the Romulans? - Get ready to immerse yourself with popular characters from Star Trek, such as Worf and Sela in later stories! - Leonard Nimoy, aka Spock, sometimes narrates the prologues of what's happening.  CONS: - I used to crash a lot when I first started this game, but now I crash maybe once or twice every hour or so. - The graphics sometimes get glitchy and there are times where when the character is talking, their mouth movements do not match the speaker. - The background music tends to get too repetitive, and personally feel like there should be additional background music, especially when exploring space.  Overall this is a highly enjoyable game, even for those who do not know much about Star Trek.",

If I find it interesting, then any Trekkie can find this game to be a blast!  In this review, I will cover the most famous mechanics of the game, as well as the storyline and customization options for your character.  First off, I'll talk about space combat. Space combat in Star Trek Online is equipment-based. It means that, the higher the tier of your weapons, the better the damage and other side effects. Each officer has his/her own style of play. A Tactical officer can go in guns blazing and deal extreme amounts of damage (with the drawback being that a ship that fits a Tac Officer the most is a glass cannon), while an Engineer can go in and provide heals to his or her teammates on the frontline from a Cruiser-type ship. A Science officer can provide special buffs and debuffs that can periodically repair a damaged hull, or add additional armor plating, or cloud the sensors of enemy ships, confusing them. All in all, whatever profession you choose, you will feel a difference in gameplay.  Same goes for ground combat. On the ground, a tactical officer is the biggest damage dealer, the engineer is a trap-layer and a tank, while a science officer provides medical buffs. Combat is also equipment-based. The higher the tier of your weapon, the more damage and side effects.  For trading, there is an Auction House system (Exchange in the game) that provides an easy way of locating what you want to buy, or check the price of what you want to sell.  There is premium currency in the game, called ZEN, that can be either bought, or (Here comes the good part) earned in the game by exchanging Dilithium crystals. Dilithium crystals can be found literally anywhere, but to turn them into useful currency, you need to refine them first. Sadly, there is a limit on refining, as in, you can refine only 8000 Dilithium every day. However, a person with enough patience can gather enough Dilithium to buy literally everything in the game.  Customization. The character customization, as is traditional to Star Trek, is limited ONLY to Humanoids. Even an ''alien'' species is limited to looking nearly like a Human. This is the main drawback of a universe filled with aliens. The aliens all look too Human that one can simply say they're all Human, only with genetic differences that make their faces appear different.  The storyline in Star Trek is as Trek-ish as it can get. A lot of talky-techy stuff, techno talk and so on. The story (For the Federation) starts off with the tutorial, where you are promoted to the seat of the Acting First Officer of a small, recently-commissioned cruiser. The cruiser, while on a test run, is ambushed by Klingons, the Captain is killed, and you assume the Captain's chair and become the commanding officer. This mission starts the Federation's struggle against the Klingon Empire and reveals a lot of dark secrets that the KDF has in store. As the story progresses, you encounter different empires seeking to destroy the Federation, like, the Cardassians, the Romulan Tal Shiar, the Borg, the Undine, and the Voth. Your mission, as an officer of the Federation's Starfleet, is to try and make peaceful contact with all the races, explore the galaxy, and protect those who are in need of protection.  All in all, this is a great game that anyone who has watched at least one Star Trek movie should play.",

Frankly, if you're not a fan of Star Trek already, don't bother with this; but if you are, and what you want is more Star Trek that looks and feels like the real deal, then Star Trek Online is your go to. As far as MMOs go, STO is pretty clear cut, the same sort of thing, with some space battles thrown in - and I'm sure when it comes to gameplay there's a lot better out there. But when it comes to the feel and flow of the universe and the great stories, the Star Trek experience, well, that's what keeps drawing me back to this game when I inevitably give up on basically everything else.  The 'free-to-play' model is exactly what you think it is. You certainly don't need to pay to enjoy the game, but you have to shill out hundreds to get the really cool stuff. There is a market in the game that allows you to very slowly build up zen over time, but, you'd be there about a thousand years if you wanted to buy a ship with it. That said, the default ships are pretty cool... as long as you don't play a Romulan.  For the love of Odin don't ever play a Romulan. You will regret it once you've reached the max level and still can't get anything good looking or unique.",

            "review_text": "I don't consider myself a trekkie of any kind, but this mmo does a really nice job of capturing the Star Trek universe. I tend to enjoy games that really feel like an immersive enviorment. For example, Batman: Arkham City was a really great experience where I really felt in the batman universe. I believe that STO manages to accomplish this feeling of being in the Star Trek universe decently.  STO puts you in command of a starship, where you fly around the universe doing star trek lore inspired missions. Missions take place in both space and the ground. In space you control your ship in a third person view and on the ground you play as your custom designed captain (in third person).   Combat in general for this game is pretty simple. You can set your weapons to auto-fire in space and just fly around positioning yourself for the most ideal vantage point to shoot from. There are several different weapon types. Ground combat can either be done in a traditional action mmo format, or by using a targeting reticule. There are also 3 classes to choose from, each with differing abilities.  Customization in this game is pretty good. There are endless options to make a unique character. Ships can also be customized a bit.  The game does have its quirks however. There are tons of little things that could be polished more. Nothing that ruins the overall experience, but don't expect it to be a perfect game. Also the gameplay can get a bit stale after awhile. It feels like there is not really any super advanced tactics to anything. As a veteran mmo player this game didn't offer much challange.  The f2p elements are somewhat fair. The whole basis of the in game economy is that you can trade in game currency for real money currency to buy the real money items. However if you go that route expect to spend many days farming things to buy anything good.  Bottom line, this game is overall a good immersive experience if you enjoy sci-fi/star trek/mmo's. Don't expect a perfect game though.",

            "review_text": "Just for context, I played well over 300 hours of this game years back, when it was a relatively unknown, Pay-2-Play game, but got into shooters, and just a few weeks ago saw that it was on Steam. This review will be for the game in its state right now.   Graphics  Phenomenal. There is not an MMORPG that I've played with better visuals. Space combat is extremely visually pleasing. Different beam weapons have different looks (and sounds!), and each looks amazing. Torpedoes, cannons, and beam weapons all have their own amazing special effects. Not to mention, the ships are detailed, and reflections are realistic. Ships are varied, customization (covered below) has depth, and all lighting/shadow quality is top-notch. Ground characters are very detailed, with each character potentially looking completely different from the last (see customization for more detail). Textures, while not modern AAA quality, are high-quality, especially for such a large game. Easily the best looking MMO I've played    Gameplay  Gameplay is for the most part fun. Combat can be grindy at times, but it is an MMORPG, after all. Space combat is fun, controls are responsive and easy to learn (basically hold both mouse buttons to guide your ship and spam the spacebar to fire your weapons), and defeating enemies can pose a great challenge, but not too difficult to be impossible, lending a great sense of accomplishment at the end of a long, intense battle. Ground combat is lackluster, but manageable. The ground levels are sometimes quite large, but the game discourages exploration, in favor of more linear levels (which are sometimes not that linear), with set objectives you have to reach (go to X, defeat Y amount of enemies, etc.) but for the most part, it is doable. Generally, story missions are pretty funneled, so while the map may be large, much of it is inaccessable, and simply put there for the visuals, which is not a bad thing, as the ground visuals are, at times, gorgeous. It is an MMO, so something with programmable macros is recommended, though it's still very much playable with a standard 3-button mouse and QWERTY keyboard.    Story  Story is somewhat disinteresting, mostly due to the fact that any communication to the player is made through text (they've got voice actors for the newer episodes, so it becomes a little better in the later stages of the game). The gameplay style is at odds with much of the story, though, because most of the gameplay involves taking out enemies, when the game tries to push something a bit deeper, it just comes off as boring, though that might be my attention span at work. There's a fantastic little storyline in Drozana Station, which involves time-travel, that I found quite interesting, though, as well as a spook level, complete with maniacal laughs, and creepy poems, so that part was cool.  The new(-ish) story, surrounding Romulus and the Romulan faction (now playable!) is fantastic as well. I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you're looking for story, start out with a Romulan character. You won't be disappointed.   Customization  Extremely versatile. One of the most in-depth customizers I've seen in terms of characters, and the only customizer I've seen for vehicles in an MMO. For characters, you can choose a race (i.e. Human, Betazoid, Vulcan, etc.) or Alien, which pretty much means 'go wild.' You can spend half an hour perfectly tuning the decals on your Klingon-Vulcan cross's forhead, and then you hit 'Body' and it starts all over again. You can tune brow protrusion, eye width/depth/spacing/size/color, jaw width/height, and much more, and on the body, there are just as many options for leg or arm scaling, body shape and size, and yes, even breast size (hehehehe). After that, you choose the uniform for your character. You can stick with the classic uniforms (though TOS uniforms are pay-only), or go with the new uniforms created for the game, all of which offer tons of customizability and options. You can pretty much choose any color scheme for your character. There are uniform packs, such as classic uniforms (Enterprise Mirror Universe uniforms) or uniforms for specific characters (Seven of Nine or T'Pol, for instance). It's very easy to get lost in the customizer for lengthy amounts of time.   Canon  As you should be expecting, this, while still maintaining the storyline from the TV series and movies, does contain quite a bit of original story, but it isn't half-bad. A lot of it is focused around war, the main gameplay element being combat, after all, and in the later game focuses on the Borg and Undine, which makes for some cool missions. It's not nearly as off-canon as JJ Abrams' Star Trek, but it's unique enough to be interesting.   Pay  Do not listen to anybody who says that this game is 'Pay 2 Win' because it isn't. Here's what happens:  Get a free ship. Advance to level 10 Get another free ship. Advance to level 20 Get another free ship.  etc. through level 50. The end-game ships are not given to you, but the last ship you get (at 45 I believe) is still very competitive. Each ship is better than the last. Customization options are taken from three variants of the same ship, which you can pick and choose which parts to keep and which to change (i.e. Nacelle's from a Cheyanne class, but Saucer from the Dakota class). Paying, though, does not let you skip the grind to 50, which I think is absolutely amazing of them. When you do pay (which you will, if you like Star Trek enough) you will be rewarded with ships of previous levels with upgrades to make them competitive with newer ships, as well as some with fun gimmicks (like a Galaxy class that will separate into two sections) and they aren't very expensive at all. In the end, you're  supposed  to spend money, just because you want that one ship so badly, and it looks so cool.   Economy  In-game currencies are plentiful. There are different currencies which can be used to buy specific items, or there's an Exchange, which allows players to sell obtained items for Energy Credits, which are the main currency. Loot drops are VERY common, and you can get very good items from those loot drops, and the best part is, those loot drops didn't cost you anything, so if you don't need them, you can either discard them for some energy credits, or try to maximize your profit on the Exchange, and either way, you'll be making money.  Also, yes, there is a method of exchanging in-game currency, for paid currency, though the rate isn't favorable (which you shouldn't expect it to be), but it's there.    Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. Very appealing visuals, combined with a good F2P model and okay storyline make this a great game for trekkies and general sci-fi fans alike.",

I can recommend it to some but I personally don't want to play any more of it. I don't have the patience for it and I'm pretty sure I don't have the time either, not when there are so many other great games out there to play and so many other amazing game worlds to visit.  Essentially, Star Trek Online is a fun, highly detailed, hugely expansive adventure game with a very friendly community which is also severely hampered by awkward controls, an obtuse interface, repetitive game design and occasional bugs. This game requires a lot of patience and a lot of time.  +Good (at least adequate) graphics made to run on many different systems.  +Great character customization options (if the options can be deciphered).  +Lots of game options and settings.  +Truly expansive game with HUGE numbers of missions and locations (many of the space stations and such have the exact same layout unfortunately which gets highly repetitive).  +Large ship variety each of which have many subtle and non-subtle nuances about how they fight and what their load-outs can be.  +Free to play and not pay to win with an unusually friendly and helpful community which is always wanting to have new players to join in a game which mostly focuses on cooperative fights against computer controlled characters/events. There are lots of things you can buy with real money if you want to though. You can go up against other players too but most of them are extremely high-level and so have totally overpowered weapons and ships and shields who have been playing for years.  +There's a lot of stuff to see if you just want to fly around and look at stuff in your ship but that can get boring too. Afterall, you don't HAVE to do missions unless you want to see everything the game has to offer. But there is a lot you can see regardless, this being an at least partially open-world game. Lots of stuff for groups of friends to do also.  +/-You can play as the federation, Klingons or Romulans. I only played as the federation as I heard that the Klingons and Romulan factions don't feature campaigns or missions that are as well developed. Unfortunately the Borg and others are not a playable race. While there is a lot to see and do, the game will not let you do whatever you might be able to imagine. (I had hoped for a short while when I first heard about this game to be a good-guy rogue borg cube (we will assimilate some of you if you, you know, want to be assimilated) and I couldn't. Boo hoo!  +/-Classic, largely orchestral star trek music (which might not be for you if you don't like that very much or find it boring like I do) which can get repetitive over time and usually has a self-righteous feeling to it.  +/-Adequate though authentic sound effects.  +/-The game has levels to keep missions difficult and challenging and to reward you with leveled-up equipment as you progress. However, while thoughtful, as this increases replayability, this feature is implemented in a potentially buggy manner. If you enter a mission with a high-level friend and then that friend has to leave then you might be stuck in the mission and will need to find some way of escaping without being destroyed and thus automatically restarting the mission at that high level. You need to escape somehow and then re-enter it for the level to switch back to where your lower-leveled character is so you don't get almost instantly destroyed by high-level NPC enemies. The enemy difficulty leveling should ideally occur in real-time if possible. Still, this is not an issue which necessarily comes up a lot unless you have friends who are all very high level when you are not.  -Awkward controls even with the detailed keyboard and control re-mapping options. This game will make Just Cause 2's controls seem intuitive and streamlined. It might even make the controls in Mirror's Edge feel streamlined. System Shock 2's controls are easier. FreeSpace 2, a detailed space fighting sim, has easier controls than the space battles in this game.  -I mean, the game simultaneously seems to want you to use it like a menu and a 3d game which is usually obtuse. It is difficult to figure out how to do ANYTHING. Equipping a weapon or any other item is needlessly difficult. Indeed most menus, statistics and controls are needlessly obtuse and confusing giving this game a frustratingly long learning curve. I believe IGN's review said it best when it said something like how everything that is usually simple in a game is complex and everything that should be complex in a game (like traveling from one star system to another at warp speed) is oddly simple. This mostly just involves little, irritating things but all these little things combine to make a frustratingly difficult learning curve and this is the number one reason why I don't want to play this game anymore. Also, I have other games I'd rather play as a result despite this game's wonderful community. Even the interstellar map of the galaxy, for example, is hard to understand. Homeworld, this isn't.  -Occasional glitches and bugs throughout.  -The game's friendly AI is mediocre at best and the game's enemy AI is really bad. That's not the worst thing so far as fights are concerned though. The worst thing is that there simply isn't a lot of tactical depth to this game. Stay out of enemy weapon range (or line of sight if you are running around on the ground or a space station or inside a ship) and hit the enemy with your own weapons as quickly and as often as you can. Most tactical depth beyond basic maneuvering consists of figuring out which combination of abilities, special powers, shields and weapons to use at different times and against different groups of enemies (which is often not a very straightforward matter (which is fine in itself). However, this layer of tactical depth is often implemented in an extremely confusing manner which has a long and arduous learning curve to figure out (unless you have good friends (like I did) who will take an enormous amount of time to tell you what to do.) Unfortunately, once you have a combination of abilities, powers, shields and weapons selected, battles would have become a simple button-mashing frenzy if it were not for needing to wait for each item and weapon to recharge between each shot. You can opt to fire one weapon at a time though or fire them all at once in salvos (which is almost always best anyhow). Regardless, after you've decided on a loadout and inventory, the battles themselves get boring FAST.  -Maneuvering, either with your character or with your spacecraft feels cumbersome and restrictive, even with all the myriad ways of customizing your controls. The AI doesn't do much better though (and your own AI team mates and NPC characters have a nasty tendency to get stuck in corners or in tight hallways causing many of the game's areas to have uncharacteristically (uncharacteristic for the world of Star Trek even) large hallways and open spaces.  -You probably have to really love star trek to want to play this game. At least this is the way it was with me. The game world is a messy hodge-podge of every star trek episode and movie ever made and while this can be great for people looking for nostalgia and gives you a huge variety of enemies to fight the world can seem like a real chaotic mess unless you are fairly familiar with most star trek episodes and movies which have ever come out. The game tries to introduce you to things though but this game requires a LOT of reading text boxes to find out what's going on, almost from one minute to the next.  --The game world attempts to control overcrowding and lag issues by having different 'instances' or sort of sub-space like parallel universes running at the same time. To actually join your friends and see them you have to figure out how to join their particular 'instance.'",

Everything from the weapon loadout choices, to the movement of ships, to the sounds, everything is amazing. However, there are a few things I personally find fault with. The Federation Stoy quest line seems very un-Federation like. The story is not very engaging as none of the quests require that you actually pay attention to what is required. The ground combat tries to do a lot, but feels gimiky. However, the awesome ships and space combat more than make up for the faults.",

            "review_text": "Star Trek Online is a game that I not only find to be incredibly fun and engaging, but that I also respect it because of its Free to Play model. There's little here that I actually dislike about the game and, for me personally, I can only think of one minor glitch that I've encountered throughout my whole time playing.  So, where to start? Well, the ship combat system is so much fun and so well designed. If you've ever played the old Starfleet Command games you'll see that the combat system here is very familiar while also clearly standing on its own. Every ability you gain as you level has a specific use and, as you level, the combat becomes more and more challenging. You have to use your abilities at the right time and where you're strongest and where you're weakest. There's a good amount of tactics you can and have to use in the space combat, providing a fun challenge. Ground combat is okay yes, but doesn't compare to the space combat.  The UI is quick to understand and easy to modify to personal preferences. Character customization is magnificent and, for an RPer like me, I absolutely love how I can put in a background description for my character, and a formal name function, who would think to put that there? And you'd think it would stop for just your character, but no, you can customize your bridge officers with their looks, names, and fill out a background from them as well as their skills to use in combat, allowing for even more immersion into the game's world.  And then there's the Free to Play model the game uses, this makes me respect the game and their developers even more. Like all Free to Play games, there is a special freemium currency where one can use real money to get and buy special extras that non-subscribers can't get. For STO that can be ships or ship designs, extra character slots, certain races can't be played, and certain costumes/uniforms can't be gained without using this currency. However, there is a legitimate way to gain this freemium currency, called ZEN, without spending money for those who want some of those bonus goodies but won't, or can't (in my case) spend money for it. Basically there is a secondary currency in the game called Dilithium, which certain (repeatable every 20 or so hours) missions award as ore, you can refine the ore into crystals which, through the Dilithium exchance, you can sell a large amount of Dilithium for ZEN, roughly 150 per ZEN. Non-subscribed players can only refine a certain amount per day, 8'000 specifically. Per Character, before resetting the next day. Depending on what faction your characters join/side with, Starfleet or Klingons, you'll gain roughly some 3'000-4'000 dilithium ore by doing these repeatable missions, and your DOFF system can bring in some small bonus Dilithium while you're not playing (Don't worry, once you reach lvl 10 the system is usable to you and it's easy to learn and understand). So yes, with time, effort and patience, non-subscribed players can have most of the same bonuses as subscribed players can.  The fact that it is possible for non-subscribed players to get ZEN, while at a slower but not unreasonable rate, is where most of my respect for the game comes from, and the fact that, so far, it's not all in your face about how you don't have everything when you could with some cash (I'm looking at you, TOR).  In short, do I recommend this game, even to casual fans of Star Trek? Absolutely, heck I didn't even consider myself a fan of Star Trek before playing this game. Now, I'm watching DS9 and loving it, so yes, I do recommend it. At least try the game out is all I can suggest.",

Sure, there are some neat goodies you can buy (and I often do) but they aren't game breaking and you can get to max level and earn in game money just selling off parts of the ships you blow up or from mission rewards. For example, you are rewarded with a new ship each time to earn a rank (evern few levels) OR you can spend some money and buy the same ship with a different skin and an extra officer slot and a fun console (grappling hook, low damage auto turret, etc.) but the ship reward is just perfectly fine to go out and blow up bad guys with.  The community is top notch and (as would be expected) are a Star Trek lovin' bunch. Lots of great fleets to join as well as all level of RPers.  Character customization is top notch (as you would expect from Crypic) and the ability to customize the look of your crew is a big bonus. From Borg to Ferengi, hell, throw a few Pakleds on your bridge crew. Most of the major races are represented as well as a few of the lesser known ones. Or just make up your own with the character creator.  Ground combat and exploration is fun but the game really shines in space combat. You can level in PVE, PVP or let your crew do the work and send your duty officers and crew off to do assignments. It's up to you.  All in all, it's my go to MMO for when I'm 'between games' and since it's F2P I can always hop back in and pick up where I left off. It has a permanent spot on my hard drive.",

I continued playing and finished a few missions and realized the gameplay is better than any paid MMO I've tried to date. The missions and gameplay remind me of the first SWTOR and Mass Effect. Once you learn that you can press 'B' on the ground missions to actually get into the fighting, it's really immersive. The space fighting is also intense with the different team skills playing their individual roles. And its the first MMO where the missions aren't based on collecting 10 flowers, or killing 20 bears. It's actually story driven and similar to the star trek movies and shows.  Overall, the game is great. It's free, so why not give it a try.

I wouldn't know, because the beta had me hooked, and I signed up for a lifetime subscription before they went free to play. Even though they went free to play, I don't regret the lifetime subscription. This game is great.  There are two things that are awesome about this game: 1. Episodes. They have a bunch of quests in the game that are built together into an episode. Which mimics what you might see on the show. Usually they have some space battles, and some ground battles, and they always have great stories. The rest of the quests in the game are meh. Holidays can be fun, but I've never put tons of hours into those. Story missions bring me back. Not much else. 2. Space Combat. I love the style of space combat. Having to worry about shield strength, and positioning is a lot of fun. And because of the game's difficulty system, you can make it easy or difficult. Great thinking.  Things that are great, but not awesome: 1. Duty Rosters. It's basically giving everyone on your crew something to do. It's kinda like a minigame, and it can be tons of fun, but it doesn't have the epic feel of the Episodes or the Space combat, because it's just a quest.  Things that are not great: 1. Ground combat. It's not amazing, but it's fine. 2. Daily / repeatable quests. Boring. I thought I would really like the exploration system, but it wasn't really exploration the way I wanted it. It was grinding. Some of the storyline missions are repeatable, and that's not what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the quests that just keep coming back, like patrol missions and such. Meh. I just skip them. I can never even bring myself to clean more than one out of my mission log in any given month, so the few I've collected mostly just sit there.  Things I've got mixed feelings on: 1. 'Guild' system. I'm in a guild, but I don't really feel like I do much with it. There's fun things to do with a group, but I can do most of the stuff I want to do without a group. I'd like to do some of the content that's multiplayer exclusive, but I want an easier way to do it. 2. Reputation. The Reputation systems are kinda interesting but pretty grindy.

If you're like me and you like being able to solo from time to time, this is your game. While some missions are restricted to Fleets (the STO equivalent of guilds) or groups, the main storyline of each faction (Federation, Romulan, or Klingon) can be done entirely solo.  The characters you create are  completely  customizable, right down to the sizes of their hands and lengths of their fingers, if you're a sucker for extremely tiny details. If you're not that into the minutiae, there are a number of presets as well as a button to randomize your character's physical appearance. Uniform parts and pieces may be mixed and matched as well as recolored to your taste, and your character may have multiple uniforms that you can switch between as you choose. You can also fully customize the uniforms and appearances of your bridge officers.  Space combat was tricky for me to get used to at first, but once you learn how everything works, it's really quite fun. Each of your bridge officers has special abilities that can be applied in combat, and different ships have different abilities as well. You can fully upgrade your ships with new equipment, and at every 10 levels (e.g. each promotion), you receive a new ship for free. Ground combat is (as another reviewer mentioned) a little repetitive, but the drop rewards from defeated enemies are often fairly substantial as you move into higher levels of play.  While there are options to purchase unique ships, officers and various other items using real world currency, you are at no point required to spend money to access the main features of the game, and I haven't yet felt as if the game is overwhelmingly 'pay-to-win.' So far I've been successful with what I've received directly from story progression (as of this writing my main character is level 26 out of 50 -- yes, I'm a latecomer). Whether this still holds if you participate in PvP combat or not, I don't know, but since I don't intend to do any PvP, it's not really important to me. That said, I do have a monthly subscription and I've spent a bit of money on Zen (the cash currency) because I want to support the future of the game.  Finally: if you're a Star Trek fan (myself included in this category), you will probably enjoy the occasional cameos by various characters from the series and the films. Among others, Denise Crosby appears as the voice of Sela and the alternate-timeline version of Tasha Yar from 'Yesterday's Enterprise', and Michael Dorn makes a cameo as Worf.  In short: Star Trek Online is great fun and I plan to continue playing it for some time to come.",

But there are a few sets of problems. The rules and game play can be extremely confusing! Sending crew members to do work, getting new ships, finding more crew members, customizing, it's all very confusing. It's annoying as to how confusing it can be. The items are also confusing when you're thinking 'which is better and how?' or when you're trying to give it to a partner you've brought to the ground with you. Abilities are also hard to use/understand.   I guess this is a positive when you think 'Oh I'll always find something new' but it wasn't enough for me. What made it for me was the SPACE BATTLES! THOSE MADE THE GAME! Seriously, you'd be flying around and then six lasers come at you while you shoot out a few torpedos and more lasers. That is what made the game for me.  You will have hours of fun (especially because it's free) with this game, so there's no harm in downloading it and trying it out.",

If you enjoy getting into a game, roleplaying the character (even if it's just in your own head.) and don't mind the fact that the game is in general fairly easy it will be worth the low, low admission price of exactly zero dollars.   I would recommend perhaps picking up a friend to play with, and allowing yourselves just pretend you're the Captain's in your team chat. Get in character, have fun and don't worry about being silly.

            "review_text": "I have been playing this game since the private Beta when Atari still owned it. This game has seen so much positive change since then, it is almost astounding. I remember when there used to be 15 ships on that you could play as on the federation side, and the only diversity was the meager hull decals selects Captains could choose from. Now, OMG! it has gotten to the point where I am seeing ships I don't know the name of, or even where in the Star Trek universe it came from! It's amazing!  The development team behind this game is churning out new content and upgrades, some good some bad, pretty consistently. It may help that the weekly(?) dev blogs outline what’s new and what’s being worked on, so it keeps you in the loop. STFs (Raids) have grown from, like 3, missions into 3 STFs per faction. O yeah, there are factions now. So you can get your reputation up with a certain race of aliens in order to be able to craft rare item sets and unique weapon and console pieces. There never used to be anything like that.  On the downside, they have taken out some content, such as Memory Alpha and huge exploration areas that used to yield special crafting materials. While this deletion serves a purpose, it outraged many long time fans. But, as I said, it served a purpose, and you will either appreciate it or or loathe it, it's up to you. Graphics have never gone down, they have remastered almost every mission that has been in the game since the beta. The missions regains replay-ability for some of us veterans, as the levels and story are now more coherent and look beautiful. Character models stay true to Authentic Star Trek cannon, as does the political and physical map. The new Star trek movies play a part in this universe as far as time line so, but it is not significant. (Spoilers) Aside from the Romulan home world being sucked into a black hole the universe still contains TNG, DS9, and Voyager characters and past events laid forward in those series, including TOS are laced within this storyline and time arc. So consistency will remain from all the old TV shows you grew up with. Which, for me, was very important. Voice actors from all those series have or will participate in lending their voices into the game, so keep an ear out for your favorite TV show character.  The free to play system is one of the few games you can truly accomplish anything without paying a dime. That is, if you don't mind a ♥♥♥♥ ton of grinding. Still, grinding the only way to truly earn something in a video game and that will remain true in any video game you don't have to pay for. If you choose to pay, you can purchase points to use in an in-game store and get anything from ships, to crafting material, extra character slots, ect... You can also purchase a lifetime membership that gives you an allowance of those points to use each month. You can also purchase this membership on a monthly time table.  Overall, I would give this game a solid 8.5, and this is coming from a lifelong Star Trek fan and video game enthusiast. While some would argue a 10 would be more fitting for a game that allows space and ground combat AND also follows very closely to the source material. I have to agree but also point out that there are still things that need to be added and slightly polished. At times, its a bit chaotic to know what the best build are for a specific armor set and ship combination, due to the sheer size of the available content in the game (google STO faction sets). I feel they need to make some of the more rarer ships more easier/cheaper to obtain, as you could spend over $100 buying in game currency to open enough lockboxes to obtain enough Lobi Crystals to buy a special ship from a certain Ferengi vendor. It's insane when you think of how many steps, time and money that go into purchasing a ship, even when compared to EVE online's mining and refining process.  Hope this help any prospective player/Captain!",

Its open non-restrictive skills and trait system provides gamers with a wide varity of playstyles to adapt with the frequent changes within the game. This is a great improvement compared to the old system where players have to live with the choices they made.  Lock Boxes is an interesting venture on Cryptic part. On the surface, it benefits players willing to gamble some real cash into the game. Well, they need money to run the game right?  However, assets obtained from Lock Boxes, unlike premium items bought by Zen, can be sold on the exchange. Whether you're a paying customer or a freeloader like me, it boils down to how well you could earn your way through STO.

If you are a fan of star trek I would greatly suggest playing, more so now with the Agents of Yesterday update that puts you in the 23rd century to start with.  Things I greatly enjoy is this game does not punish you for how often you play, casual players can earn everything more regular players can just at a slower pace. People do say the game is pay to win but its really more to pay for convenience. You can use the ingame currency Dilithium to trade for the premium currency Zen. If you only trade your daily 8k dilithum per character for zen it will take a while to earn enough for a Zen store ship. But you can set buy/sell orders with the zen exchange and earn enough much faster.   The large updates they come out with now and again, breathe quite a bit of life into the game after the older content gets stale. There is certainly some grinding as with most mmo endgame content. But it feels more like a timegate that prevents you from rushing through the content and ships too quickly. But I will say the reputation system for the endgame does need a rework.   They are also working on what appears to be a graphical overhaul and are slowly rolling out features for it when they can. Thouse with better GPU's I would suggest going though the options and turning quite a bit up and set to use more ram. I would greatly like to see an autodetection feature ingame, that would set certain things for newer players.   On a score of 10, I would rate this game atleast a 7.5 maybe an 8 of ten. There is grinding that some does need to be reworked, but compared to other mmo's I have played in the past none of them have kept my attention for so long save for tabula rasa and Earth and Beyond.   I greatly look forward to where this game will head now that Abram's contract with star trek is over and new content is open to the company and not limited by the monopoly JJ abrams had.",

This game has some of the flaws that other MMOs do, but it makes up for those flaws with a great story and several easter eggs, which are perfect for any diehard Star Trek fan. However, if you're not a Star Trek fan you'll probably just come into this game and see a somewhat cool sci-fi MMO with slightly less flaws then any other MMO.  Now I'm going to list my personal pros and cons, and then I'll give you my verdict.  Pros: Excellent story  Great Easter eggs for Star Trek fans Space combat Not A PTW MMO  Cons: Ground combat is alright You have to pay for some ships    So, overall I think this is a great game and I highly recommend it to Star Trek fans.  8/10",

Every faction also has their unique set of spaceships). Every 10 levels (up until lvl 40) you get a new free ship to match your level, you can customize ships and rename them. You can have a crew and up to 4 more bots in your party. Also you are able to land on planets (not in all of them), which makes the balance between space and ground combat better.

There are quite a few bad aspects, but many good ones, and this game is just too good for any ST fan not to play.  Pros:  Amazing storyline, doesn't matter if you liked TOS, TNG, VOY, there is something for everyone. (They even got most of the Voyager cast, Worf, Tasha Yarr, etc. to voice.) Space combat is fun, although quite spacebar-spammy. Ground combat is being worked on constantly, and a few people like it better than space. The devs, although not very fast at fixing bugs, add a lot of new ships, story missions, and updates that after 5 years has not shown signs of slowing down. Music is absolutely amazing, although it doesn't sound like anything at all out of Star Trek. Stupidly detailed character creation. 3 factions, choose to play as Federation, Klingon, or Romulan.  Cons:  Quite P2W in many situations. The ships you get after leveling up are not that great, but you can always snag a ship or two from a giveaway, some of which are quite good. Learning curve. Do your research before joining a PVE queue, or building a good setup. Grindy, but getting better every day. The only truely awful grinds are Reputation and R&amp;D, which each have a daily that must be completed about a thousand times. Buggier than the Amazon jungle. You will need a fairly decent computer to run this game.  Overall, a must-get for any Star Trek fan.",

The thing is that, mostly, they are not enough to stop you from playing once you've tried it and if you've liked it for what it is. But after a while, dissapointment might start to catch up with you nonetheless.  STO is a bittersweet experience. I feel that most of the time, for every three good things this game has, there is also one bad thing to go along.  Pros:  -The episodes are really good. This game has an interesting story that kept me going from beginning to end to see what happens. -Space combat is not the most deep out there, but its satisfying and fun. Yes it's brainless and a spacebar smasher, but enjoyable. -It feels like a true Star Trek experience, despite some questionable things lore-wise. -Missions are repetitive, yeah, but more often than not many of them can be quite creative and entertaining. -There is a lot of room for roleplaying if you're into that sort of thing. -A good amount of content that will keep you busy for a few hundred hours. -The foundry allows for some welcome creativity and what I consider the most meaningful player run aspect of the game. It helps keep things fresh and going when you are out of episodes from the game's main storyline. -Getting in-game currency is not as painful as in other games, and the Exchange (a.k.a auction house) is great for fattening up your wallet. -There is a sizeable amount of voice acting (many of it from actors of the actual Trek shows) to help immersion. -You can customize your character appearance anytime you want, and as many times as you'd like. -The fleet (a.k.a guilds) system is good and has a lot of things going for it, from your own fleet starbase to many other cool things you can add and customize in it. -There is a decent amount of fan service and the tie ins between the tv shows and the game can be clever from time to time. -There are nice events that let you have neat things, as well as giveaways for the same purpose. -The game is regularly updated with content.  Cons:  -The game is designed to extract money from you. What I hate is that half of how it's done seems appropiate to me. The game seduces you to buy uniforms and packs from your favorite shows. If the milking would have stopped there, It would have been fine. But nope, the game asks you to pay up for the best ships of the game, or grind dilithium for around 2 months just to get one of the tier 6 ships (currently the best ones). And then theres the whole 'pay here for xp boosts, pay here to unlock more inventory slots, more character slots, and this and that, and etc.' which isn't as annoying as how it was on SWTOR, but still pretty out there. -Ground combat is terrible. At first, I accepted it for what it was, but after hundreds of hours invested here I have come to grips with reality and had to admit the truth: it is just horrible. Shallow, thin, counterintuitive, buggy, and just an overall mess. The AI of your companions gets the job done, but it is barebones basic. And enemy AI is just laughable. Patrols can be so bugged up, their walk will jitter and flicker around like a bad LSD trip. -The game feels like a singleplayer game that was slapped the MMO label because of some online components. There isn't really any need to group for questing and exploring, and end-game content is sort of shallow to even bother and fully experience it, so that pretty much erases any meaningful purpose to grouping. -Fleet actions (a.k.a. dungeons) are ok when they are space based but horrible when ground based. And even in space they can be boring, tedious and repetitive: fight waves of guys, protect some AI ships, and a small twist here and there depending on the particular one you're doing. There are different difficulties in which you can complete these, but considering you pretty much blow through everything with standard solo gear, the need to come together to get the best pieces seems like an aftertought. Don't expect endgame organized raiding here. -The community is just dreadful. The chat on Earth Space Dock really brings out the worst in humanity. I've actually created a special tab in the chat window that filters it out for whenever I visit. Players are not helpful, and every channel feels full of slander and insufferable banter. In groups, it's the norm to roll need on everything, even if you dont really need the gear at all. -This game is not noob friendly. The UI design is not entirely convoluted, but it can take a while to figure out. The map is a mess that will make your head spin the first time around. It is a labyrinthine disaster that will not be kind to a new player at all. Hell, I'm 60 and I still get confused looking at it. -The exploration factor is virtually unexistant, except for some random missions you can pickup when flying near some planets. -There is a lot of grinding, particularly with reputation, dilithium, stuff for the fleet, credits and many other currencies. -Bugs. Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Little bugs, medium bugs, large bugs, game breaking bugs. Bugs everywhere. Sometimes they get patched. Sometimes they don't. Developers are not as terrible as people often say, but they sure slack when it comes to patching for fixing errors. Not to add content, though; they can profit from that.  And despite having much more negative things to say about the game than positive and overall not recommending it, I feel obligated to answer the following question: is there any circumstance in which you would recommend the game? Surprisingly, yes.  If you are a hardcore fan of Star Trek and videogames, and you are willing to depart from some money then this is for you. Or perhaps if you are one of those fellows that do not mind to grind for months. If you like roleplaying, this game can be hours of fun as well if you find the right fleet.  If you're looking for a deep MMO with complex mechanics, don't bother downloading this. If you're not willing to open up the ol' wallet or grind your way through all the stuff you need, then keep browsing for something else as well.  What keeps this game alive and running with faithful players that follow it, is that despite all the bad, it is fun. A lot of fun actually. Many of us stick around waiting for a miracle that might never come: for Cryptic to revamp the areas that need it, and to patch the game so it can be rid of the problems it has. Perhaps a bigger developing team, and a more humane cash shop.",

            "review_text": "I've been a fan of Star Trek for a really long time. I've been to conventions, I've seen every show and movie multiple times, I've played damn near every Star Trek video game out there, and I was even at the Vegas Star Trek Convention when this game was originally announced (back when it was still being developed by Perpetual Entertainment). If Star Trek Online was going to appeal to anybody, I think it's fair to say that I would be at the front of the line.   And for a long while after Cryptic released the game, it did. Star Trek Online started off as a very decent piece of fan service to the core series. No, the stories were never the same level of quality that was seen in the TV series, but it didn't have to be. The game succesfully hit all the right buttons to be a succesful Star Trek MMO, and Cryptic legitimately seemed like they wanted to keep improving the product they had released.   Then came free to play. I have nothing against free to play as a general concept, but so many games handle it incorrectly in an attempt to increase revenue. That didn't happen immediately for STO, but after Cryptic Studios was purchased by Perfect World Entertainment, it sure didn't take long. Perfect World is very well known for churning out game after game with obnoxious freemium systems, so I suppose it shouldn't be to surprising that they did the same with STO. And that's exactly what happened.  All In all, there's still a part of STO that's good, but it's covered in so much money grabbing BS I just cant' recommend the game to anyone anymore. I would love to be able to revisit the game I played for 1000+ hours (I played on the standalone client before switching to the Steam client), but it's just not there anymore.   TLDR: Used to be a fantastic game, but it's been bogged down by to much freemium BS.",

            "review_text": "As Cryptic Studios released the game 2nd Februar 2010 they had an idea of how to make a good Star Trek Game. I played in Alpha and Beta and ordered several copies preorder to gain a lot of ingame stuff that was different on every copy of the game. They did not make it perfect at start, it had its flaws, but hey were working on it to make it better over time. I really enjoyed playing the game. You had exploring missions. Yes at some point they repeated themselves, but that is how close you can get in a game to a Star Trek feeling. The ingame store had updates from now and then and I bought some stuff, like the Defiant Retrofit (Now T5). You could speculate how a game that demands monthly money to play it can have an ingame store that requires money again, but it was another time and technically you could unlock almost anything by playing. The design was attracting a casual playing older/wealthy player base anyway. Prices were not too high and any unlocks were always account wide forever.  This all changed as Arc Games purchased Cryptic Studios and everything went downhill. The chinese company turned the game really quick into a typical chinese pay to win game. With the release of the T6 Ships around 80% of players left, for obvious reason not being willing to pay real money for them. Only other way to get these ships was brainless grinding and playing every day. Didnt take long for the famous chinese shop in shop system appeared in which you could buy stuff that only was unlocked on one character for the double price. Yes I actually calculated everything. Ofcouse you can grind everything out, but getting a T6 ship from the Zen Store without using money will take you around 150 days with one character, depending on the dilithium exchange prices and you having enough unrefined dilithium. Anyway we went enough on the pay to win part now, lets get to the gameplay. Well every patch breaks more stuff than they can fix. This is not Cryptics fault. They actually work hard I think, they just dont get any money to repair and improve stuff in the necessary amount. Arc Games is sucking everything out. The warp out animation is broken for months. An animation Cryptic originally changed 3 times at release till it satisfied them. But look here, shiny, shiny new ships. Give us your money is Arc Games answer to that. There are several issues in the game right now. Game breaking graphic bugs and never ending glitches can be expected while you play. Be sure the server disconnects you around 30s per map you are moving. Now lets get to the part if you really have to pay money. Yes and no. Technically you can play with your free ship, but the enemies are getting stronger and stronger and standing a chance with a T5 ship against the Vaadwaur proves challenging, against Na'kuhl it is suiciding through the missions. If this still didnt convince let me you tell you that, besides having bought multiple keys for ingame items at release, I am a Lifetime Subscriber. We get free Zen every month, only reason why I still play btw. As I went back into the game after a break I had the problem I couldnt claim the T5 I bought some time ago on any other character. Wait there is a player support that I asked immediatly to get a message some days later, I just need to dismiss it on the character I own it and reclaim it there. Ofcourse I trusted the support and dissmissed the ship. Jokes on me, I couldnt reclaim it. Wrote another ticket explaining it, showing proof of the purchase. Guess what. They didnt care and didnt want to give me the ship I already paid for. I was supposed to buy it again.  Conclusion: You can play the game, some of the original good content is still there. I recommend you to make a character and just play the story once. After that stop playing. Dont waste money on it. The game is close to being dead anyway. Not later than they release T7 even the hardcore fans will leave. Really sad what lifeless, souless husk this game has become. It had great potencial and it still has. I never expected it to be like the Series. Maybe one day a better company will buy Arc Games and make the game good again.",

            "review_text": "First things first, don't let my play time fool you. I've been a player of Star Trek Online for about 5 years now and I gotta say; it's not getting any better. That said, let's start out with the good...  (TLDR At Bottom)  You can't talk about a Star Trek game without talking about immersion. This game does draw you in and make you feel like you're a part of the 24th century universe that began with Christopher Pike and continued for decades after. You feel like you’re a part of an ever growing galaxy, doing missions to better the life of those around you. That said, it’s only good immersion for one pass through. Starting a second character on the same faction finds you instantly bored and upset with having to perform the same exact story over again. Thankfully there is more than one race, which means more than one story. If you want to stay the same race though, just take a different route (Assault/Science/Engineering) you’ll find yourself performing the same story over and over again. In addition, the additional content that is added after the 3 main storylines is pretty much identical no matter what race you are. Thus, you only get one playthrough of the additional content before you're repeating it with your other races. Anyway, back to the good stuff…  Sound and graphics are well done in this game. Arguably the best Star Trek experience yet. Game play adds to that experience as well. Large ships, while having more firepower and armor, actually feel bulky and slow while smaller ships are much faster and more maneuverable. You have to customize your equipment/ship to the style you play or you’ll quickly find yourself in a lot of trouble when an enemy race locks its weapons on you. There are also a HUGE array of ships you can use, of all classes and sizes, bringing a high level of variety, sort of...  Now let’s get to the bad. This game is distributed by Perfect World. That means the game is free, but not really. The game has been slowly converted from a very balanced system to what exists today, a heavy “pay to win” system. The best ships are only really available on the marketplace and every new ship has a higher price than the last newest ship. Now, I’m not going to say I haven’t purchased my share of ships, because I have. But it gets extremely frustrating when a ship you paid good money for is suddenly made inferior by the next ship released, with that ship then being made inferior by the next, and so on, and so on, and so on. This has quickly become the biggest money grab in the history of MMO’s.  Today, if you want the latest collection of “Tier 6” starships (9 in total) you’ll have to fork out 12000 Zen (the store currency) for the bundle, which equals around $130 of real cash. Believe it or not, that’s actually a deal! Buying just the tripple bundle for a specific race costs 6000 Zen ($70, roughly). Buying each ship individually for 3000 Zen would be an astronomical $315! For virtual ships in a game where said ship will probably be inferior in less than a couple months, that’s a lot.  In all honesty, the pay-to-win scheme has literally destroyed this game. On top of all the crap available in the market, which includes inventory expansions, expanded ship storage, upgrades, clothing, bridge layouts, shuttles, and so on, you start to hate looting ships/people because of all the drop boxes you’ll collect. Of course, the drop boxes are locked and require you to purchase keys (from the market) to unlock them. I remember, at one time, having my inventory filled with nothing but drop boxes. Like an idiot I paid for about 30 keys (can't remember the cost, but it wasn't cheap) and got what I expected. The boxes either had absolute junk or items that would become useless within a very short time. There was always a very rare chance of getting a starship in a drop box, but I never did. That said, I've heard of people spending hundreds of dollars on keys just to get those rare ships. (Maybe Perfect World isn't stupid, because people are) After my 30 keys were used I started dumping the drop boxes in the garbage, as selling them on the auction is totally useless. Trust me, if you go to the auction and type in the name of any drop box you’ll have no less than 50 pages of already existing auctions at stupid low prices.  Some players might argue that you can trade in-game dilithium for Zen, and it’s true. That said, all this has done is pushed the cost of the items in the marketplace higher. In addition, you can only convert so much dilithium every day, and the exchange doesn’t guarantee how much your dilithium is actually worth. Honestly, it’s worse than gold farming in other MMO’s. Not worth the time or effort you’ll have to put into it.  TLDR :   So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely not. The pay-to-win scheme has pretty much destroyed this game and the massive amount of drop boxes you’ll end up looting will annoy the hell out of you. It’s got a fairly good story, which continues to expand, but the game just feels like a Ferengi designed it. So no, I don’t recommend it. Why then is my play time is as high as it is? Not really because I enjoy the game. I was one of the saps who got suckered early into sinking money into this P2W pit of decay, before we saw it for what it was, and I wanna be sure I get my money’s worth before the final nail goes in the coffin... That's why.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of charm for people that are deeply into retrogaming. The engine is fifteen years old and it shows. The visuals are primitive and great fun for the Playstation 2 enthusiast crowd. However, because the game is built on Cryptic's ancient proprietary engine, the game suffers tremendously.  The early (first two weeks or so) of play, this game is very entertaining. It may be prehistoric, but the pew pew is mildly entertaining. The earlier storylines are pretty good, but many have been revamped recently, and the revamps are utterly awful. The dialogue reads like it was written by a middle school student that watched too much scoobie doo growing up.  After the leveling ends, however, you are presented with the reality of the game. Since being bought out by Perfect World Entertainment, Cryptic has lost most of the rights to direct the development of their games. As a result, Star Trek Online and other Cryptic IPs like Neverwinter have recently begun losing players at a dramatic rate. The honeymoon after going FTP has reached it's inevitable conclusion with this game as Perfect World Entertainment has turned this game into a thinly veiled scam and gambling interface that utterly diminishes the intellectual property and is pretty offensive. There is a common excuse used by Cryptic apologists that 'well, all FTP games are like that these days'. Hogwash. That's no excuse.  Because Perfect World has so drastically reduced Cryptic's resources to develop the game, there has been little to no real content introduced since early last year. Ever quarter or so, Cryptic is able to scrounge together a 'featured episode' that evidently has never been edited or run through any kind of quality assurance, and call that 'content'. At the same time, the bulk of their resources and development is spent on introducing more 'lockbox' ships. These 'lockbox ships' are quickly thrown together reskins of earlier ships and don't really introduce anything to the game. You have the privilege of paying for lockbox keys in order to open the boxes that contain them if you feel lucky, as you have less than a .005% chance of getting the ship in the lockbox. The entire game runs off of this mechanic. Where a valid and reputable game has a crafting system, Star Trek Online has a gambling system, where even if you spend the 8-12 months (yes, an entire year) maxing out a single crafting skill, you can't actually craft the gear you are trying to. Instead, you are permitted a minimal 'chance' to create the desired gear.   So in the end, Star Trek Online is a good game to play for a few weeks. As the lead developer has stated the game isn't really interested in retaining players. They rely completely on gamer churn. There is no endgame content, there is no meaningful progression, there is no reason to invest a single dime in or continue playing past the level cap. Everything after that point is a sad scam designed to get you to throw out those dollars. And we're not talking three or four dollars here. For the ships gated by Perfect World Entertainment's Zen (ingame currency) store, you are expected to shell out between 25 and 120 for what you're after. 120 dollars for a ship in this prehistoric engine on a game that is just a thin veneer for a gambling simulator.   I would have recommended this game to people about two years ago. But now, as the population is disappearing and the ingame community is dwindling to nothing, as well as the development team holding a very public scorn for the remaining players, I would have to say 'save yourself the heartache'. Watching what Perfect World Entertainment has done to the Star Trek intellectual property will break your heart if you're a Star Trek fan. According to rumor there is another Star Trek MMO in the works. Wait for that one. This one isn't worth your time.",

Buying anything in game is not worth it, as if you dedicated one day to grinding with end game gear, you could propably sort of save 40 euros if used in comparison to the money they would like you to give to them, that however would mean nobrainer zombie mode for 8 hours straight, buying from 'offsites' would save you maybe around 75% money and get you more bang for your buck, at the moment the money economy is horrible in that sence. Content: Latest few releases have been horrible, they released abilities that have no place in PvE content, but make the game impossiple for everyone else in pvp, for example, they released a PASSIVE trait, that gives you 100% critical hit chance on hull penetrating abilities, outcome: more ♥♥♥♥ for pvp content. They also added ability that stuns all enemies for 30 seconds, inside AoE. who uses stuns or disables in PvE in this game? NOBODY! more stuff that makes the game harder for everyone else has been added, that is just 2 examples. With addition to the endless grinding, they released update with new level increase, from level 50 to 60. as result, all your items are outdated, last 3 years of gridning and upgrading to your best gear was turned into waste, have fun, spend 300 euros to game to upgrade your items with the new crafting system or alternatively spending another full year into getting more dilithium so you could possiply upgrade your items to highest mark. In addition to all the bad releases to PvE, and PvP content, speaking of PvE content, instead of releasing something new to PvE, they made PvE content harder by increasing the amount of damage and health the enemies have, what changed? NOTHING! 5 man Glass cannon teams are still rolling in PvE, you still don't need ANY crowd control in PvE! Many of my veteran friends that have played multiple years, have had ton of dedication for the game, but have stopped playing...

Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game. Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.  Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.  Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add 'challenge' to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.  While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks. The create your own missions portion of the game called the foundry is also an interesting idea and fun to do some times. More often then not the community comes up with better missions then the devs do.  I do not recomment this game for anyone at this time, maybe in a few years it might be worth recommending to people but not at this time.",

Space combat was super tedious and slow, quests were all the same and everything was confined to small areas. How am I supposed to boldly go where no man has gone before when I'm confined to a small area like its an instance? If you've ever played the DnD MMO then you will know what I mean. It was the first MMO that I didn't play out the free month. They would have had to change pretty much the entire game for it to be good. By all means get the game and play it, but do so before you shell out a dime of your money.",

The main issue I have with the game is the 'power creep' added to late game content and how some items and ships are clearly more powerful than any other alternatives, especially the content that free players have access to. The base game is fun, and worth exploring if you are a Star Trek fan but as you progress to end game more and more of the content will be locked behind a paywal till eventually your reach a point where you will be simply inferior to someone who has dropped cash, from a little to a lot, to improve his or her ship or crew. Through the various systems in the cash shop you can directly buy power in-game. You still have to level to use this content, but the paid cash shop content is clearly superior than anything any free player has access to, some of the rarer, more expensive shops OP to the point of imbalance.",

            "review_text": "What I liked about STO (Star Trek Online) is impossible to say. After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than  perfectworld.com)  in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning: . My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc., runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than  perfectworld.com  and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security.  . What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  . Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base. . The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.",

All of the best captains sport Antiproton weaponry, and use ships either auctioned off of a ridiculously inflated exchange, or spend hundreds of 'Zen' (MONEY) throwing virtual keys at virtual boxes that seem to take up 1234567890 out of 100 percentage of item drops from enemies destroyed (so much for preserving the peace lmao). In this amazing Star Trek experience, feel what it's like to transport maps and have the game crash on you, or try beaming down onto the renown ESD and you guessed it: FALL RIGHT THROUGH THE FLOOR AS IF IT WERE A BUG THAT TOTALLY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AS FIXED BY CRYPTIC- I mean *ahem*- sorry, beam onto an amazing map, full of random and completely biased attacks and heated debates in zone chat about who's ♥♥♥♥ are bigger: Jeri Ryan's or Roxanne Dawson's. But wait- there's more!!!! Have fun customizing your ships, running around aimlessly, and the best part: having ♥♥♥♥ing walnut's activate party modules with annoying music and lights surround you, while your character is forced to dance (why are those things not confined to Risa). Enjoy your amazing journey through space as a character who looks like a 1995 rendition of Tomb Raider, while fighting the greatest enemies in the galaxy: rubberbanding, lag, and extremely harsh and sensitive ST fans! Buckle up, put on those IDGAF shades and roll your brand-new Miranda Trash boat through the galaxy!!!",

I love Star Trek, and I do enjoy this game, but there are a lot of aspects I really do not like.  Pros of the game: - To quote Markiplier: 'SPAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE!', 'I love space!' - Any build, as long as you know how to use it, can and will be decent, though you will always lose to the wallet warriors/grindfest lovers - Some of the ships doesn't look that good, but sure as hell make up for it in being fun to fly - Scenery is nice. Very nice - Social side of the game is nice, and most people are fun to talk to - Always fun to team up with Fleet/Fleet Alliance members and do stuff - Always, ALWAYS something to do - Space PvP? Always fun to see hardened veterans beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of wallet warriors. With a big ♥♥♥♥ing glee on their face   Cons of this game: - STO have pretty much turned into a Korean grinding MMORPG. Grinding towards the equipment you need. Even if you upgrade, you will only see a tiiiiiny fraction of an improvement over the old equipment - Too much emphasis on DPS. Way too much emphasis on DPS. Even crowd control have become almost useless - Did I mention crowd control is important, even if it doesn't have that much DPS? No? It is, but people don't have any apparently, so make sure to bring your own. Always - Federation ships, for the most part, are just sheer ugly, look bulky and doesn't look the part - Space PvP? Doesn't matter who or what you meet, you will lose regardless. Might as well be throwing rocks. At a battleship. From space - Either hit or COMPLETELY miss when experimenting with ship builds - Fully upgraded equipment? People bash you for it anyway - Not fully upgraded equipment? Lose out on the DPS race, AND have people bash you for it regardless - Did I mention the sheer amount of narrow-minded people in this game who are unable to accept ANY new builds? - Don't even get me started on the user interface, controls and camera control  Everything about this game have turned into a grindfest, to be honest. Need to fill your 8,000 Dilithium quota on one character? Grind the hell out of it! Even with the added +500 from your Fleet Dilithium Mine you're still only going to get 8,500 a day. From ONE character. Per day. And everything costs way too much. So prepare to grind that Dilithium like a fothermucker!  Have Zen? Good. It WILL be useful. Very useful. For a short while. Then you will need more. Lots more. Because everything's overpriced. Have a ship you want? Especially one of the newest ones? Save up Zen like a gold-hoarding dragon, as you will need every Zen you can get a hold of.",

With so little regard for the experiences of its customers I'm surprised that they get away with charging over $200.00 for what they call a 'lifetime' subscription, on top of charging real money for anything and everything worth getting in the game. Oh and they are sure to remind you of this fact as often as possible, from running big yellow text across your screen every time another player unlocks a new ship to regularly handing out the special chests that can only be unlocked with keys you have to purchase for $1.25 each. All ships of any worth range from $25 - $50 Each. They pretend like you can purchase everything with in game money, by trading game cash (dilithium) for it. but they limit you to a maximum of $0.20 a day, so 'IF' you play for hours each day farming dilithium and then trade in the maximum they allow of 8000 dil each day they, you can acquire a max of 20 ZEN/day/account ($1 per 100 ZEN). So just to purchase the weakest of ships is going to require repeating this for 50 days at 4-6hrs a day dilithium farming.

F2P sets such a low cap on your credits that you can't compete with subbed players on the AH, although credits are worthless anyway. The costumes are buggy and frequently ugly. You can't fly your ship upside down. Need I say more?  THE GOOD: The game does have one of the strongest senses of community of any MMO I've played. The players are there because they love the franchise, which also results in some of the most hilarious barrens chat. The set up of Fleets (guilds) actually encourages player participation in cooperative group projects that help you build up your space station and unlock personal gear. I spent most of my hours playing the Duty Officer Missions, which is like a card game that lets you have multiple quests running in the background for rewards and XP. I don't think it's for everyone, but it's great to do in the background while working on real life. Leonard Nimoy voices some small parts. Oh, and it's F2P.",

            "review_text": "I wish Steam would give me a 'meh' for reviews. I will continue to play this game, so I guess that's a recommendation. But I will continue to believe it's bad in many respects. What led me to finally understand how it is bad was attempting to work with the 'The Foundry' level designer. This is a cool feature that does let players create custom missions for others to play which creates a large variety of content for players to enjoy and experience. But it's also the main problem with this game. Whereas the devs/level designers apparently have access to a more advanced version of 'The Foundry' - whatever they design with isn't much better than the Foundry.  The limits this very poorly thought out level designer puts on a level designer are enormous. The primary problem being that there's no branching to story lines AT ALL. Not a single mission lets you make a choice that will result in a variation of what happens during the quest. Many RPGs are like this - linear quests with one resolution - but even tiny variations in the progress of the mission are nearly impossible with this level designer and, the thing is, this also plays out in the missions. No branching wouldn't matter that much IF it were possible to deeply customize gameplay - but it's not. The mobs are all pretty generic in behavior and they're fought generically. The variation between classes is basically a few abilities but fighting is all done on the ground by mashing a few buttons for 'shoot phaser rifle.' But remember - there's NO BRANCHING - I mean, there's not even branching in quests as simple as 'switch this lever and go down the left hall or switch the right lever and go down the right hall and then you'll be in the main room - you can't pick both.' The only branching is in dialogue which is good and necessary, but without branching at all during the story - it feels very boring in many cases.    Anyway... kudos on the graphics but their level designing engine is ♥♥♥♥ - and the one the devs have access too isn't much better. This is fundamentally a problem with the core game engine designers who decided they'd rather not give the level designers a versitile tool which results in poor gameplay and story.   I would recommend this game to someone who really likes Star Trek and will play it just because it's Trek - but from a game design perspective - no - go play DDO which got less attention than it deserved while still kind of being a niche MMO.  Story wise, it's ok. I haven't gotten into the Federation side yet... But I started a Romulan because - well - hey - Romulan. I'm sure everyone plays Federation already. And herein is where I was first really annoyed. I'm fighting AGAINST the Romulan Star Empire for some 'pro-Democracy' split off group from the Romulan Empire (which, granted, is in chaos because Roberto Orci decided to ♥♥♥♥ everything up by destroying Romulus and Remus for his massive ego).    Anyway, being forced into a 'pro-democracy' Romulan in STO is like if you rolled a Klingon and found out you were in the pacifist faction of the Klingons which only flies freighters and works coop farms and holds peace rallies in front of the Chancellor's residence. Also I don't buy the story they're spinning with the Tal Shiar. But, then again, I guess Nemesis really started the 'absolutely screw up the Romulan storyline' habit in Star Trek so I guess Orci can't take all the blame.  Pro-democracy Romulan? Like a Klingon who cares nothing for bloodwine.   I want my old-school Romulans back - the ones who were pretty much mirrors of Cardassians but far more Nationalistic. Not the freak show they made in Enterprise and Nemesis under the incompetent hand of Berga and Berman. And the massive disaster that what Roberto Orci destroying Romulans once and for all for his stupid action movies. Where is my honorable Romulan Commander squaring off against Kirk in a battle of wits and military honor?",
