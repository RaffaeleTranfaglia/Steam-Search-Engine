            "review_text": "Okay I'm going to say I enjoy the game and it deserves a positive rating, for the following:  - It is THE best Rugby game out today - It is an improvement over RC2 in various subtle ways that were needed - It is the ONLY online rugby game for PC you can buy, - The fanhub and the wonderful PC modding community mean that the licencing issues will not be a problem for too long.  There is one negative which is that the launch pricetag for what is essentially an update of RC2 (albeit with some very welcome features and modes and fixes) is unacceptable. Please TruBlu see some sense and discount the game so that the community can recommend new players and the game/online community can thrive.  Do I like the game? Yes definitely. Can I recommend it at Â£40 - a pricetag which no other premium Steam titles hold? If you are desperate for a good rugby game/online play, then yes. If you liked RC1 but didn't manage to get RC2 then probably. But players already owning RC2 will feel ripped off at full price if they don't have the money to throw around.  Update - I have yet to have an unplayable online game (I've played against 5 opponents - including UK, Aus and S.America - I am in the UK). All games have been quite smooth. This was not the case with RC1 and RC2 at launch - maybe it is to do with better internet connections in general, or perhaps they have improved the code a little in that area as well. Either way - this is a massive plus point for me. Come and join us online. :)  I haven't yet spent any real time with the offline gameplay modes, so the above is based on core gameplay and online play only at present.",

Sevens is great fun and the FanHub gives this game a chance to keep up to date with new squads and players.",

            "review_text": "This game is actually enjoyable once you learn to play it.  And hear me out on that because you do have to learn to play it, alot of negative reviews here mention misplays from unforgiving controls or inability to change controls but maybe those people should stick to the training/bench until they are ready to step up. ;)  But seriously, when a game is so intricate that I can set my back line depth, defence spacing, automatic ruck commitment and kicker placement depth (just to name a few) on the fly mid match in my pro games as I control my own character you have to understand there will be a learning curve.  I'm a big rugby fan and get a kick (slight pun intended) out of getting to play with my favourite teams and players (up the Waratahs and the mighty Hooper!).  The ability to play your own career aspect is a nice touch that allows you to focus on and develop one character's skillset (your own self-made one or an existing player) and progress through many different competitions, hunting contracts and perhaps even work your way up to representing your country. I started out getting dropped from my starting team in the NRC and eventually worked up to playing for the Wallabies which was fun, especially when I was picked up by the Crusaders and took the Captaincy from Ritchie McCaw.....ead Ritchie.  I'll be fair I have noticed a few issues with AI control and silly gameplay bugs (going blind with a .5m gap? GENIUS) which is understandable given rugby is a very dynamic game with alot of moving parts and these issues could be ironed out in the future. At the end of the day the game is still very playable and enjoyable, give it some time before you post a negative review with .50 hours of gameplay.  Anyone disagree? Take me on in game! ;)",
