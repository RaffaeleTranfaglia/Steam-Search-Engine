            "review_text": "It's not stellar. It's not truly memorable. It's strange and disjointed and has wonky dialogue.  And I'm recommending it.   It's short, which is a saving grace in my book. These types of games often suffer from difficult puzzles with unclear objectives, but Tales from the Dragon Mountain: The Strix does an excellent job of guiding you from place to place. If you are ever unable to find an item in the background, a generous hint system will help you locate it so you can move on. The storyline is interesting and bizarre, and the sheer weirdness will likely keep you moving forward to see the next oddity.   Easily beaten in 2-3 hours, it won't take up much of your time. Considering how few games of this type have made it to Steam, it's nice to have another diversion. Just don't expect the next GOTY.",
