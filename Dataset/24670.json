If you are train enthusiast you are going to love it, if you just like playing with simulators, its the best choice for sure and if you just like to play driving games compared to Train simulator 2014 it has lower quality graphics but way more routes, locomotives and the DCC mode (easy to operate mode, no hard times with the realistic things) and all of this without the DLCs, plus it is way more cheap than ts 2014 (DLCs). I strongly recommend this game!",

            "review_text": "Following the purchase of Microsoft train simulator back in 2002 I have always gone out looking for other simulators (especially train simulators) so I can confidently say that I KNOW Trainz, from Trainz, Trainz 2004, Trainz 2006 and Trainz Classic UK.   What is this game? = answer its bad, it’s a simple money sock soaking up the cash from every innocent customer. I mean really guys this is just bad... don’t even debate.   Where do I even start?  Firstly and this is my biggest point that drives me up the wall. This is NOT a new/newer game. By the use of clever branding and publishing your led to believe that this. OH WOW, IT’S A NEW TRAINZ!!! ... Well don’t get too excite sat at ye-oldie computer because it’s not.  If you simply go into your “Rail yard” (which lists each loco/rolling stock for you to observe) you can see that 90% of the content, YET AGAIN has just been copied and pasted from the previous versions. I mean Big Boy ??. for crying out loud that was made for Trainz 2004 it looks a pile of A*** for one of the latest’s lines of train simulators. Its laziness, pure and simple.. However that being said, they have made some, and I mean some, new locos and stock that actually looks ok.  The sounds are awful, again like the locos, sounds have been taken from the Trainz backlog of games. This game screams nothing but laziness, essentially what you looking at is trainz 2004 with mix and matches on certain locos and routes in truth.   In terms of simulation there isn’t any, well no more than some buttons that make you go forward and backwards, ok there is the complicated control system but its miles from simulated, it feels like someone who has a basic grasp of what things do and has just botched it together how he thinks is best. So it’s not a great start is it? The menu and in game overlay/system is far far far complex than it needs to be, like seriously what was wrong with a button that just opened up individual trains to place, here you have got to go create a consist somewhere and then once that’s saved you can load it up in game, it is just stupid.   Want to know something that amazed me? I find it amazing how a Post PS2 era game with the same level of graphical detail can run THIS badly!!, ¬ seriously. I can run Train Simulator 2015 on full graphics reaching about 20fps in lag spikes and running normally at about 35-40fps this game however runs like a slug, RUBBISH, I get 9fps at best, I turn down the graphics so it looks EVEN worse for very little improvement.   The only thing worth crediting on this game is the first appearance of Train Simulation in Multiplayer...ok it’s a short lived compliment because you can only drive from one map unless you come off the game and fiddle around with the content manager thing to get more, the trains are already placed even if you’re a server host and this far complicated menu system just makes the whole experience even more un-enjoyable. However when you finally do get set up it can be some full playing with friends. But again short lived, because every time a player joins the game will send you miles and mile away from your own train for no apparent reason and it’s a fiddle to find “where you once where”  I got this cheap but even cheap feels expensive, I would pay at best £5 for this .... Out of curiosity I bought a bundle of 16 Trainz DLC the other day for £2.99 to try out.... and there amazingly rubbish. Just avoid at all cost is my advice. In fact go play train simulator its better ;)  ",

Game looks quite similiar to Trainz Simulator 2004 (funny thing, my NVidia drivers detects TS2012 as TS2004) and works like S**T. The only thing you can do is to make a cfg that will tell the game to use more RAM memory, but that led my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad Y580) to hellish temperatures. Less maps than TS2004, less trains too. I see no point in buying it. Gladly got my copy from Bundle.",

In hopes that the new version would come out and be better than the previous versions, I have been wrong EVERY time.  I have a very powerful machine that can handle any game on the market. This game is not smooth on my machine at all. In fact it is nearly unplayable. I know for a fact I am not the only one experiencing this issue for the forums are littered with this issue.  Now I do know that many of the routes are very intense graphic wise. But like I said, I KNOW my machine can handle it. But it still skips and stutters and even freezes.  I am leaning towards Steam being the issue. I have experienced this issue mostly on steam. The steam versions of games are crap and are not worth the money. I am going to purchase this game (hopefully at a discount) off the traiz site directly and see if it is just the game itself. I will write a review on that version as well.  My final thoughts are this. If you want to waste money with steam games, I obviously cannot stop you, but I can at least WARN you. You will get what you pay for and steam games are NOT worth your money. If it costs a little more directly from the game makers, I would recommend spending the extra cash. DO NOT get it from steam!!",

The forums online are almost exclusivly about content creation and the grinding achievements... to get all achievements you MUST play the game for at least 20.000 hours according to the description. i assume its ingame time, but still its nuts..

        {
            "review_text": "This 'Simulator' isn't that bad at all considering there was a massive performance boost between Pre-release and the current version. I've had TRS 2004, and TRS 2006, and this by far is the best one. One thing I enjoy about is it actually alerts me about up coming signals, and stations so I have time to slow down when I'm hauling a lot of freight.  Now, there's a few things that do make me angry about this. Here's a list of them:   Parts that anger me:   Adding additional settings to the game is no longer possible in the config file as it is binary written to file now, rather then plain text. So changing features that the options window doesn't list, but the game uses, can no longer be applied.  The `Content Manager' has a download quota of 100.15 MB A DAY. I realized this when I was downloading some locos, I got 100 megs and tried downloading the dependencies.. nope. If you download anymore then that they want you to buy some `First class ticket' which costs REAL MONEY. That's an outrage!   You charge people $30 for the main simulator itself, then another $50 for DLC then shove this ticket stuff down their throats when they try and get good content that the comunity made? That is rediculous. The download rate from the servers is only a max of 12 KBPS without a ticket! It took me all night to get that 100 megabytes of addons downloaded thanks to that. There was NOTHING that told me about this before I bought the game.  However, their website of `Download station' does not limit the downloaded files if you use FTP. But trying to find a specific addon that's listed within the content manager search window may not be easy.  Some of the headlights of the trains don't work, or barely work at all. Some of the night missions are almost too dark to see because the train's themselves don't have working headlights(Could be improved in the future however).  The simulator still lags on my high end rig, and I find it sort of strange how the options window doesn't have the same settings that 2006 did with all the tuning settings. However lowing settings did fix a lot of performance issues, but the simulator's engine has a lot of room for improvement.   Things I like about it   The simulator is great for train enthusiasts looking for something to enjoy. It has a powerful world editor, and realistic controls. It can teach you basics of driving trains and designing railways.  Multiplayer is available for those who want to play multiplayer with their friends, or relatives --  though I have not been able to test multiplayer.   You can create your own custom content to use in your game if you ever felt the need, or want to do so. Share it with users around the globe to show your interest world wide.  The simulator itself has pretty straight forward missions, good instructions, and a ton of driving hours available on routes. Once you get into it, and you enjoy it, there's a point of no return.    My Conclusion:   The game is great if you want to make your own railway, drive routes, or play with your friends. It's probably the most stable one there is on steam, however the game does have restrictions.   So help me, if you turn into Electronic Arts, or Microsoft, I am done with your games and content for good. ",
