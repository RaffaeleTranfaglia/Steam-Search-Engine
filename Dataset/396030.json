            "review_text": "I liked the start... although it didn't have as much wow factor as inMind VR where you go into the eye but was still cool. As soon as I got to the racing though... 'urrgh', I'm rotating but not rotating... recipe for disaster in VR. Probably there are a list of movement mistakes that should be avoided in the literature but I'm fairly certain this should be one of them. OK I got used to it but I still had to be careful at how quickly I moved around the cylinder. Another reason I don't like head movements to control position movement is that it restricts how much you are free to look around. You can look around in a 'certain way' but that really isn't natural and reduces enjoyment in my view. Imagine a bunch of stuff going on in your peripheral vision that you can only see if you are very careful about *how* you move your head... not nice.  I'm being asked if I would recommend this game... well since it is free and very pretty I cannot help but say 'yes' however, had I paid for it, I think I'd have been a little or maybe a lot disapointed as I was expecting essentially a similar thing to the mechanics of inMind VR but with a ton more content.  For reference I should include I tried the game on a core2quad 2.7GHz cpu with 680GTX gfx card and 6GB system ram. The headset was a Rift DK2 on 1.3 beta drivers. Frame rate and overall VR experience was fine but the game was let down by the movement mechanic.  Sad to have to be so negative as this is free and really very pretty with a lot of work clearly having gone into it... but hey ho, such is life.",

            "review_text": "I really like this game. It's simple so everyone can play it, and it gets parts of the brain activated in ways which are expensive via simulators that are expensive to run and operate. This is the future and games like this along other titles I believe will provide great content.  I want get into more expansive levels and I will gladly give my money.   It's free and it's VR.
