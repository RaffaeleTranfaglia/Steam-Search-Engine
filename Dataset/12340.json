            "review_text": "Disappointing.  That pretty much sums up my reaction to Jack Keane. Jack Keane has decent graphics, controls reasonably well, and even made me chuckle once or twice. Why do I not recommend it then?  The puzzles are badly designed and I can not count the amount of times I found myself saying, 'What am I supposed to do?' No, not wondering how to solve a puzzle. I found myself wondering what I should even be trying to solve. The problem is that the game does not clearly establish what the puzzles are. Jack rarely offers even the remotest clue about what he thinks of a puzzle and it is extremely easy to miss a key item just because you ran past it.   I adore adventure games and love great puzzles, but this game was a misfire. I might even try the sequel just to see if they fixed the problems, but this one misses more than it hits and can not get recommendation from me.   I'd give it a 4/10.",
