            "review_text": "Oh god. This game made my eyes hurt.  You can tell that this game was made for a mobile device. It was ported to steam with absolutely zero care. The controls alone made this game unplayable on pc. The gameplay itself is bad on its own right. The screen is heavily cluttered and is from what i can tell not customizable. The attack command is left click, which by it self isnt all that bad. Untill you realize the only way to move your character is to hold down the right mouse button and pretend your trying to use a touchscreen.  This was a terrible pc experience.",

            "review_text": "AHAHAHAHA oh my god this is honestly the worst game I've ever played.  The interface is absolutely abysmal and navigating to the options menu almost gave me a heart attack cos I was laughing that much.  The sound effects for each and every goon are similar to what I imagine a muffled underwater fart and/or burp to sound like. And regardless of your rig this game runs at a solid 3.5 frames per second, and I'm pretty sure my old gameboy could play this. But the controls really take the cake, hands down the worst ive encountered, it's like playing Unreal Tournament with a joystick or World of Warcraft with a steering wheel. I can't get over how you can make a game this bad; I just wish it was published by EA and had day one DLC to really say '♥♥♥♥ you consumers'.  I'd recommend checking it out for 10 minutes just so you can laugh at the sound effects (dat dragon monk makes some weird ♥♥♥♥in noises man) '-10/10 won't install again'- IGN",

            "review_text": "Not completly sure about recomend or not this game, so lets check its pros and cons: + Free and not pay-to-win. + Cross platform (Windows, Android, iOS). Actually I first played it on my android tablet (iPEGA-9700), so you can play it anywhere and anytime with a single account. + Matches can be quick. If you don't want to or don't have time for long matches you can play for 5min or 15 min matches. + Nice variety of heroes (not a lot). This can be good so you can find the ones that suits you faster. + Very accessible. If you're new to MOBAs or just want a lighter experience. + Best played with a Xbox360 controller.  - Terrible Mouse/Keyboard controls. Also I couldn't make x360ce work so just use an Xinput controller. - Don't look for nice graphics or animations in here. - Music and FX are not the best, but are not horrible. - Unbalanced matches (sometimes). Sometime you're team will be full of low level players against really high level players making it totally unfair. - Lag, sometimes. This is bad because the game doesn't seem to be complex so no idea why there's lag sometimes.  So for the big letdowns I'd say the terrbile MKB controls (considering this is a PC port), but probably having a proper configuration would be and advantage over the mobile gamers, so maybe that's the reason (or devs were just lazy). But afterall is a nice ligth MOBA for guys like me that don't have too much time for big MOBAs like Dota2 or LOL and just want to kill some time and have a lightweight MOBA experience.  Just remember to USE an Xbox360 controller.",

When we go to bed, we don't know whether we will ever even wake up. That's why when I'm up in the morning, Heores of SoulCraft is the first thing that I want to do with my time. Because in life, nothing really ever lasts. A game like this? It's probably going to be removed within the next few days for having 'poor gameplay' or 'overpriced, pay to win characters'. And to that I say neigh. For I am a horse, and as a half horse, half gamer, full moba god, I deem this game to be the greatest of our generation.",

The game as an Overtime, where your and the oponents tier 1 tower is automaticaly destroyed, and sudendeath where you can no longer buy an Insta-respawn in the in-game shop.  :. 4v4 Queue .:  Almost se same ♥♥♥♥ I guess.. who cares!   :. Movement aka RMB .:  This is not your tipical right click spam MOBA.. You can press it once and the character will follow it FOR EVER.. nevermind.. It really is ♥♥♥♥!!!
