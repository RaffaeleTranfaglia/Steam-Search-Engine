            "review_text": "Action Henk is a fun casual game that should appeal to gamers of all ages. The premise is simple. The game is a series of 'race' tracks where you're racing against the clock or against other people in the multiplayer modes. If you've ever played a game from the Joe Danger series or to a lesser extent in terms of comparison, the Trials series, you'll have an idea of what Action Henk is all about. Another game I found it easy to compare is the Bit Trip Runner series. Basically every course is based on simple physics, speed and momentum. Your goal is to finish the track in the fastest time. There is a good deal of variety throughout the courses, with your buttslide and grappling hook coming into play at various times. You'll have to learn to time your jumps and nuances of particular courses to get the fastest time.  Pros: + Very fun graphically. This game doesnt take itself seriously. + Variety of tracks. + Friends leaderboard. + Steam Workshop support. Create your own tracks! + Wide range of courses that unlock after a certain amount of medals in the section prior. + 'Ghosts' and replays to see where you messed up or how to tackle a tough obstacle.  Cons: - The music is abysmal.   All in all, Action Henk is a good entry into this genre of game. It encourages competition, but at the same time keeps it light and fun. The track creator is fairly robust and hopefully Workshop support will encourage people to make new and even better tracks.  I recommend Action Henk if you are looking for a fun game with a competitive spirit.",

            "review_text": "This game is great. This game is where Sonic should have gone after the Genisis games.   The controls are tight and handle very well.  Levels are well designed and offer many little ways to get faster. As you play you learn new things and little tricks to get faster making it have a high replay value especially for those people who love to climb a leaderboard. I enjoyed the music as well as the look and feel of the game even the setting of being in a childs room as his out of shape action figure. It gives it almost a Toy Story feel. (almost feel like Action Henk should show up in a Toy Story sequal lol)  Definatly would recomend this game to Sonic fans, people who enjoy running games, and anyone who loves climbing the score board.",

            "review_text": "Action Henk is a video game where you jump, slide, combine the two then slide and jump to get more speed on your next run. I very much like the concept of this game and it has phenomenal graphics. If you are in a position where 17 dollars is not very much to you (or however much it is in your country), then by all means this is a great buy.  However... this review is very borderline positive as I was rethinking my opinions on this game. I love all of its content, but the combination of it in a game like this makes it seem less than it is after you've played it enough. Let me explain.  Jumping, Sliding, Hooking, Landing Properly. That's all this game consists of. Because of this, getting a world record time in this game is next to impossible, because all you do is literally practice this combination. In a game like trials, mechanics are its #1 priority before graphics and sound design. In this game, however, its architectural design and all of the major appealing features seem to be the key. In terms of feature diversity, it takes but 10 minutes for you to gain and lose a world record. I would like to emphasize, however that this paragraph is not intended to be directed towards cheating players, as that is an entirely different topic. This game is deceptively difficult.  Oh yeah. Multiplayer works, but nobody ever really goes on it... so there's that.  But where I stand about its flaws, I think anybody can agree that not only is the sound design near flawless... So is the graphics, mechanics design and momentum rules. That alone merits a +1 from me. It's very easy to tell that years of work went into a game like this and the level editor makes it a lot more enjoyable to a first time player. If you are the type of person who is just looking through steam to see which games are worth buying, please don't let my negative views on some of the content discourage you from buying it. If you aren't competing for world records or looking for some interesting game content to impress you, it's worth every penny.  Would I recommend it to my friends? Not at its current state. The ending of the game is not beginner friendly and it gets needlessly complicated near the last levels. If the authors of this game could pad the game a lot more between these levels, I would consider recommending it. The game makes an absurd difficulty spike at the end. If you don't have the patience for it, the spike is worse than trials'.  Just thought I would voice my opinion about it. Thanks for reading!",

            "review_text": "Whether you loved the Sonic games on the Genesis/Mega Drive, or Uniracer/Unirally on the SNES, or if you're a fan of Speedrunners on Steam, you will absolutely love this game too.  Speed, momentum and flow are the words of the day in this 2.5D platform game, as you race through awesome levels that twist and turn, full of obstacles and difficult maneuvers. Levels start off easy enough to complete, and steadily become more challenging as you unlock more of them, with extra features and game mechanics introduced.  This is not a game for those who get frustrated easily: You will fail, and fail, and fail again as you try to speed up and optimise your path, leaping over 'lava', sliding down hills, using the hookshot to try and build momentum, and figuring out where to best jump, to run, and slide to improve your run.  The amount of love that went into this game is obvious: The game has an awesome art style, with great details put into the backgrounds of the levels, and into the individual characters: Each of which has multiple outfits you can unlock - and these aren't just reskins - each outfit has been individually modelled, with a completely different theme and voice pack, and I'm fairly certain that many of them have their own character animations, with Swan Henk (a ballerina outfit for Henk, and one of the first you unlock) doing split jumps as you leap around the levels - I've not noticed others yet, but I've not had a chance to play with all of them.  Anyone worried about the longevity of a speedrunning platform racer will be happy to know that there's a level editor available, which should allow for players to share their creations, and provide plenty of challenges even once you complete the main level pack. Multiplayer is also available, though I haven't had a chance to check it out yet.  Basically a fantastic game, and you should definitely own this.",

Controls are very good and tight, speed feels wonderful, and there's nothing quite like seeing yourself improve in real time. The moment when I began accidentally overshooting a springboard that I couldn't even reach minutes before was immaculate.  Also the hookshot levels are the best part of the game because, buddy let me tell you, if you like figuring out speed tricks this game is ESPECIALLY for you, and the hookshot opens the game up to so many more possibilities for speed tricks.  e: Just don't be offput by Betsy being terrifying.",

Having nice mini challenges for different skins is cool too!  I love the editor, I always wonder why devs don't put an editor in games like this. But these guys did it and it's great (didn't try it yet but I already saw some workshop levels so that's nice at least).  One tip for the devs though, I noticed you are a dutch company so I looked up your website. It's bad. It almost made me NOT play the game. It's almost like you're mocking yourself. Some parts of the site don't work, other parts are extremely unprofessional and the start page made me think you're all a bunch of slobs. Just update the website, make it the same style as this game if you want to be crazy, but don't make it unprofessional. But of course that has nothing to do with the game, which is a lot of fun.",

This is one of the few games that gave me that old school feeling when I played Super Mario Bros. in the sense that when I'm trying to make a jump, I move the controller like it's going to help,  The final levels (after the credits) are VERY difficult. I for sure recommend this game. You'll keep saying to yourself 'just one more try!'",

If not that this game can be completed in less than hour or so. Also, time doesn't go back to moment when you activated your checkpoint, so this feature is useless considering you need to get certain score to earn those medals. There's no other mechnic different than go right, jump and slide beside hookshot which appears only in 10 levels or so. Graphics are nice and colorfull, even too colorfull for my taste. It just makes you loose concentration sometimes. Thankfully I'm not a fan of Toy Story, so I'm not falling for all the nostalgia that Action Henk tries to put throughout the game. Only hard part of the game are challanges which leave hardly any room to make mistake. For that price (14,99 euro) I'm not recommending it at all, you spend less and better money for Bit.Trip Runner which does everything better - especially with difficulty and different mechanics. I suppose Action Henk is only worth buying on sale if you really want it.",
