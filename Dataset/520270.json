            "review_text": "This is just really overpriced for 3 very short coaster rides all set in the exact same environment, with nothing particularly unique about any of them, and nothing of any interest happening around you in the environment. The graphical quality isn't even particularly high. It's certainly quite an intense ride, but it would be a nice touch if the Vive controllers were supported just to use the haptic feedback to give a sensation of holding onto the safety bar for dear life ;) Will probably keep it around just to freak people out, but there just isn't the detail or quality here of other recent releases at a similar price.",

            "review_text": "Deffinatly a fun game. As of writting this there were only 3 tracks and its deffinatly one of the better roler coaster experiences on VR that I have experienced. Yes its short and maybe a little too expensive (i dislike the trend to make vr games more expensive than normal games) but i'd still give it a possitive feedback.   Itdeffinatly gives you a bit of motion sickness but if you have someone who is able to take your chair and attempt to move it in a fashion that is in keeping with the movements it most deffinatly aleviates alot of the issues (allowing your inner ear to match up with your other senses). If you want to show off your VR to people then this is deffinatly a good choice.  Just remember this is a short experience so DON'T expect to be playing it regularly. but it is a fun experience.",

I did the 3 rides in a row then I had to take a break because I started feeling a tad sick.  This will definitely be on the top list of experiences to show off the Vive!",
