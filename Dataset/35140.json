For some reason I was under the impression it would be cartoonish, simplistic, and probably not a game I would enjoy; However, Once I sat down and started actually playing Arkham Asylum, I realized my fears of a childish rendition of Batman in game-form, was completely wrong. Batman: Arkham Asylum, reminds me of games like, Knights of the Republic meets Metal Gear 4, meets a Kick ♥♥♥ Batman. It had all the qualities I like in games, an array of weaponry and gadgets, puzzles, a compelling story and interesting characters, all brought to us from the Batman Universe. Complete with the villains we've come to love and/or despise, as well as an in-depth back story of the Historic Arkham Asylum, it is easy to see why this was the game of the year when it was released. If you don't have this in your inventory, you are missing out on something pretty amazing.",

            "review_text": "Retrospectively,  Batman: Arkham Asylum  is the high point of Rocksteady Studios'  Batman  trilogy. It's a tight, focused experience with a deft tonal awareness, shaping a dark, grotesque setting for a plot that hits all the 'edgy  Batman  story' notes, relying on spectacle - supplemented by some pretty top-tier action and stealth gameplay - to see it through.  Similarly to the way  Asylum  itself is the pinnacle of the  Arkham  series,  Arkham Asylum 's third-person melee combat is quite easily the best to be found within this genre. It's fluid and functional, with solid ability variation supplemented by superb animation and sound design shaping an experience that is - at its core - quintessential to the cheesy, ridiculously one-sided combat of superhero comic books. Despite the borderline omnipotence of Batman's combat ability, the fights never became overly unchallenging, as the game introduces new enemy abilities frequently enough to keep you juggling knives, stun batons and giant experimental abominations. Regarding stealth gameplay,  Arkham Asylum  utilises mechanics that necessitate a predatory approach - if you're spotted by armed enemies, you'll be dead in seconds. Creeping around in the shadows and picking off burly, shirtless men until they start to panic is great fun, but it tends to be even more one-sided than the combat. It's almost as though there's too much freedom to just hang out on a rooftop with the x-ray vision constantly turned on until a specific enemy moves far enough away from the group for you to drop down and take him out, and then rinse and repeat. The endless functions of the x-ray vision makes it almost irresponsible not to keep the thing turned on, despite the fact that it replaces pretty much all textures with various shades of dark blue. The somewhat 'Mary Sue' nature of most superheroes is probably the cause of troubles like this - people would complain if Batman didn't have tons of ultra-powerful gadgets like this. Regardless, it doesn't totally ruin the game's balance, it just tends to make a lot of encounters a touch too easy.   Arkham Asylum  is pretty aesthetically brilliant. Voice performances by long-time Batman and Joker voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill adds an air of authenticity to the dialogue, as does top-tier animation and some genuinely creepy underground sequences. While the plot is more of the same stuff you'll find in a lot of  Batman  comics ( Arkham Asylum  is primarily based on Grant Morrison's 1989 comic  Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth ), it's still good stuff. Not because of the storyline itself, which is samey and tedious, but because of the amount of work put into the various villainous characters, particularly the Scarecrow, whose subplot features some pretty interesting surprises along the way. It's in the depictions of established characters that the story shines, coming close to the 'definitive versions' that the endless superhero film reboots seem to be going for.  Arkham Asylum  really ramps it up towards the ending with some fancy setpieces that are actually very enjoyable. In general, the game shines as a rare example of a popular IP being adapted into a video game that actually manages to gel the elements of the  Batman​  franchise with what makes video games inherently fun.",

I have had no graphics or technical issues with it at all even on my older systems.  For the game of the year version you get all the added content with the exclusion of the PS3 Joker missions. I wish those had been included but not a huge loss.  I recommend this for just about any action gamer out there...even if you have played newer entries its still worth playing through. The only down side I can find to the game is it is not high on the replay value.",

This game has no real weaknesses and is highly recommended to all action-adventure fans, especially to the fans of Batman!  Batman: Arkham Asylum is a serious action-adventure game based on DC comics, it’s very atmospheric and story rich. Top-notch quality. Graphics are amazing. Nice design, superb models, great animation, it’s simply awesome and looks fantastic. Music is very good. It certainly helps to remain motivated while under pressure in certain combat and predator challenges. Voice acting is phenomenal – world class. As far as the 3 difficulty levels are concerned, this game is rather easily beatable even on Hard. The only significant difference is that you don’t see a counter warning. Needless to say, enemies deal more damage and your health replenishes less than in easier difficulties. Only few achievements are really hard, probably getting the 24 medals in combat challenges will be the most challenging for most people. Everything else is just a matter of time and proper preparation. Completing everything is rewarding, because you discover more details about characters and get to see highly detailed models of them in the main menu.",

I'm not a huge Batman fan, but this game was so polished that I could see myself getting into the Batman world.As the titles says you take control of batman in arkham asylum fighting againts the evil…of course I mean Joker.The story reels out with an impressive way fighting different bosses which are villains from comic books.Also our character may solve various puzzles which are Riddle’s puzzle and we can learn various things about arkham location,friends and foes.Despite that, in-game we don’t fight with all famous villains that batman has instead of that, we can learn many things for them, by solving riddles puzzles.I hope some of them appeared on arkham city. Combat system is just awesome.Attacks,heavy attacks,counter attacks and combo attacks are the base ingredients of the combat system.Trying to hit all the enemies flawlessly is a bit of challenging which is the best part of the combat.As you continue, our character unlocks new finishing moves which can instant kill an enemy we choose and after that we continue our combo in order to not get hit.The last kill is in slow motion! When you are not in combat, basically you are what really batman is….a detective searching for clues for murders and other things.In order to follow the clues, you must use some of the gadgets you have from the start or either unlocked later like the spray which explodes etc.One amazing thing is that you can press a button and instantly the camera changes and go to ‘detective mode’ in order to see clues,vents and other things which keep in secret.Batman is stealth so many times in game, we can kill secretly one by one all the villains on a location where many enemies patrolling with the right sequence. Sounds are awesome, from grapple up to the opening of cape and voice acting.Graphics the same.UE3 did a VERY good job here. After you finish the main game, either you can walk around on arkham asylum either you can solve Riddle’s puzzles. Summarizing either you are a batman fan or not you will love this game. ",

So I was pleasantly surprised when an AAA game on a comic/movie franchise actually comes out really well polished.  The level design is well thought out, which is again surpising for most games these days. Obviously the game looks great graphically, but you'd expect that from such a title. I'm more interested in gameplay dynamics and having fun, and this game delivers.  The best thing about the game is probably the combat system and the gadgets, which are well designed and thought out for game progression. There's also a lot to unlock and lots of hidden things to search for. They implemented it into the game the proper way also, at a dose that is comparable to going through the plot, rather than just dumping a load of crap all over the place, like most games do with hidden collectables.  I'm really enjoying this game, and I'd imagine most people would enjoy it, as it seems to cover a lot of enjoyable aspects: sneaking, hand to hand combat, detective sections, decent characters and plot and cohesive level design.",

            "review_text": "As much as I love playing creative indie games, it is really refreshing to play a game with a huge budget where they worked closely with Nvidia to optimize the graphics and make a 3D Vision ready game. What I mean by all of this is: Batman: Arkham Asylum looks gorgeous! There were even a few scenes that had a lot of PhysX effects going on that my GTX 670 struggled with. I wouldn't have guessed that it came out in 2009. One of my biggest pet peeves is when games that look great have cutscenes that have been rendered in 720p (I'm looking at you, Mass Effect series) but the only difference I could see in Asylum was that the cutscenes were not in 3D.  I'm not a huge Batman fan, so I don't know who most of the villains are; I only learned about Two Face when I watched The Dark Knight. Arkham Asylum does a very good job of introducing the characters and giving their backgrounds. They even have a little bio section for each major character with both in-universe and real life facts about them. I could tell that most of the character designs were new takes on those characters, and I definitely think that they were done well. I found it a little odd that almost every single person in the game was ripped, but this is Batman after all.  Mark Hamill did a phenomenal job voicing the Joker. He was easily the most interesting character tho listen to, and I intentionally died a couple of times so I could listen to him taunt me.  Each main villain had a couple of levels devoted to them. My personal favorite were the Scarecrow levels because I got to relive some of the defining moments in Batman's life. By that I mean I got to see his parents die.  The gameplay is pretty basic: left-click to hit people, and right-click to counter when they try to hit you. Some enemy types switch this up a little by making you stun them first or dodging behind them before you can hit them, but ultimately it only adds one extra button that you have to hit before taking them down.  My favorite parts of the game were the rooms where there were a bunch of armed thugs in a large area, and I had to figure out how to take them down without being seen. It reminded me of the scenes in Batman Begins down by the docks where Batman did just that. Unfortunately I wasn't quite as good at it as the real Batman.  The detective 'puzzles' were fairly interesting, but usually very straightforward. I felt like I was doing less detective work and more just following a trail that the developers would only let me see if I turned on the special goggles.  My least favorite parts by far were the boss battles. They were clearly constructed exactly the same way that boss battles were made back in the 90's. I was usually stuck on a platform below the much larger boss, performing the same actions multiple times while looking for patterns in their attacks so I knew when they were vulnerable.  It took me a little over 10 hours to complete the story. It seemed like I wasn't missing much by not exploring heavily; the main missions took me all over the island. It would have been nice to have gotten more of the audio logs, which were pretty amusing, and I only found a fraction of the Riddler trophies. I'm definitely not a completionist.  Overall I enjoyed the game a lot, and I would recommend that anyone who thinks Batman is the coolest play it. It's currently $20, which is a pretty reasonable price.",

It's a game where you play as Batman as he tries to stop the criminals within Arkham Asylum of succeeding in their plans of killing countless people.   Why is this game so great? Well, there are a lot of reasons really. The gameplay. It's so good. Whenever I play fire this game up on my laptop and play on a challenge map, I enjoy just fighting enemies.   The combat freeflow system is amazing, you fight seamlessly from goon to goon punching them, kicking them, breaking their arm, throwing them, the combat flows so smoothly. It feels so satisfying to fight enemies with the freeflow system that Rocksteady implented. Everything connects together so well. Other than the freeflow system, the stealth is pretty satisfying when you pull it off well. The gadgets Batman uses are pretty awesome, you can set traps for enemies while you lure them in. The gameplay in Arkham Asylum is awesome, Arkham City improves on it though.  The story revolves around Batman and his usual foes as he tries to stop them from killing guards and tons of innocents. You get to fight iconic batman villains such as Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Joker, Poison Ivy and Bane.  Joker is awesome in the game, laughing maniacally as he cracks his jokes. Mark Hamill does Joker justice, his voice is perfect. Kevin Conroy also did a great job as Batman.  Get it even if you're not a Batman fan, it's amazing.

Then in 2009 Batman: Arkham Asylum came out, developed by Rocksteady Studios in London as their second game. This game had a moderate amount of hype at the time (everyone was scarred this would be a failure) however upon release it gained mass appeal. Graphically the game looks great, has some awesome environments and character models. The storyline is great too (written by Paul Dini, who also the Batman: Animated Series) and features a good roster of Batman Villians, and manages to balance the story and characters pretty well. The gameplay is amazing, it features an easy to learn but difficult to master hand to hand combat system mixed with Batman gadgets, and to complement the gameplay the control scheme is great (recommend a gamepad). The game also has stealth sections which are enjoyable however they are often repetitive and players often use the same tactics over and over (the AI in the late game does try to mix things up later), there is also a detective mode where you need to scan various crime scenes which is sadly the weakest part of the gameplay as all you do is scan an item and follow a breadcrumb trail to the next area (also the detective mode feature can be used in combat or in the stealth sections however this makes those sections a cake walk). Finally if you like collectables this game has a crap ton of them, they litter the entire map and tie into the unlock system Batman has to unlock gadgets/abilities, in the post-game you can hover them up.  Pros: - Great Batman game! - Great graphics, and good looking environments and characters. - Great controls (recommend a gamepad). - Gameplay is awesome and doesn't bore the player (some sections however are a bit tedious). - Great story and dialogue. - Scarecrow sections are fantastic.  Cons: - Some bugs. - DLC is missable just some challenge maps that can tax your abilities in combat/ Stealth arenas. - Stealth sections are a bit on the easy side/ not challenging once you have beaten the first couple until later in the game. - Some tedious bits in the game, also a fair amount of backtracking is involved. - So many collectables to find (they do tie into the Batman lore though).  9/10  TL:DR: It's a great Batman game, really good single player campaign. Perfect balance of gameplay/graphics. And it has some great scriptwriting.",

The land and buildings are brooding and never seem repetitive. Each building is unique and I enjoyed exploring each and every one of them.   Batman’s “Detective Mode” was fun to play with but sadly, I found myself in Detective Mode more than 80% of the game in order to detect crates and destructible walls trying to collect all 240 Riddler items. While in Detective Mode you lose out on the beauty and detail of the land and interiors. Which is a shame because there is so much packed into this game. Each area has something a little unique. It could be an odd plaque on a table, Calendar Man’s cell covered in dates, Harley Quinn’s room with Joker pictures everywhere, and other random things all tied to Batman’s lore and rouges gallery.  The fighting in Batman is amazing to watch. When I first started I was button mashing. As I progressed I learned that everything must be timed. Once I realized this and started learning all of the combos and counters, fighting became a joy. Each boss fight is different and I died many times each time until I figured out how to actually beat each one.  Last, but not least, the story is engaging and showcases Joker as the “Mega-Super-Planner”. The opening scene is great comedy. By the time the game starts, you really like the Joker. I laughed often listening to Joker as he berates you as you progress through the game. The interview tapes you find scattered across Arkham Island really add to the game and story. You learn a lot about all of the different villain’s backgrounds and motivations. When all is done and the night is won, you'll be left wondering why anyone would ever live in Gotham.  This game is great fun to play and I enjoyed every minute of it. Even the frustrating ones.",

Although the combat forces you to be more tactical due to it demanding more precise button presses, and thus, making the gameplay a little slower, it still holds up to this day. Surprising, as it's still more responsive and precise than Origins. No Batman fan should go without playing this game.",

For parents: This game is violent. In a punch punch kinda way. there's little or no blood [EDIT: Actually, the Joker in his final Titan form is incredibly disturbing, with blood seeping out of his side and ribs showing, and a very disfigured face. my siblings, who have been watching me play had to leave he's so horrifying], but sometimes deaths can be horrific. Batman has a no killing rule, so rest assured that your child will not be bragging about how he killed an old granny (I'm looking at you, GTAV). In terms of language, there is mild use of a*s, b*tch, and d*mn, and some other words. if your child has watched any 12 or pg-13 rated movie they will be fine. this game is dark. both literally and the other thing. this game has some VERY dark themes, such as torture and merciless killing. is term of sexual content, there are a couple times when Harley Quinn or Poison Ivy will speak suggestively to Batman or other people. The Joker once makes a joke about him in a thong, and the female characters wear skimpy clothing. for most childeren, this will go over their head, or they have seen worse (Lookin' at you, GTAV). this game is rated teen for a good reason. work out your self whether this is right for your child.  Conclusion: this game is great. 10/10 would punch goons again.",

            "review_text": "Here is my review for Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition  Intro: The story places after Batman has finally captured Joker and is transporting him to Arkham Asylum. He senses something bigger is happening, but isn't sure what it is. After entering Arkham Asylum, Batman becomes just another inmate and must battle his enemies and restore order the Asylum.  Gameplay / Sound: Batman AA plays like a super advanced version of crackdown. Don't know crackdown? Well its a action adventure game where you use buttons to chain together attacks and combine with Batman's arsenal. It involves kicks, batarangs, batman's cape, explosive gel and many other items. While in combat you can chain these weapons along with dodge and counter button to quickly wipe out the enemy. The second part is part stealth action game, where you can take down enemies without alerting anyone, in classic Batman fashion. There is great satisifaction from taking on 6-10 enemies and just picking them all off, one by one. The only issue I have with this is that you have to watch 'slow mo' kills on the last enemy. Granted you can skip it, it almost doesnt feel really necessary to also cut to that. All the inmates are like mini hulks and just look like the can bash your skull in, luckily Batman is a master of combat. After about the first couple of hours the combat begins to grow stale and repetitive. If you complete 100 % everything like I do, than it almost becomes a grind. Other than that a normal playthrough will be enough for most players. The sound effects whether you are solving riddler challenges or destroying Joker's toy teeth, each sound is unique that you'll always remember what each sound indicates. The voices of fan favorites shows up in Batman AA and makes the game very nostalgic.  Story : The story of Arkham Asylum revolves around Batman trying to escape from AA and stop the Joker from unleashing a weapon upon Gotham. The story is fleshed out between common knowledge, background audio tapes dubbed 'patient reports' and through dialogue. In terms of complete story Batman AA has it all. A clear Beginning, Middle and End. You never are lost and are always free to continue the main story whenever. This means going on 'side quests' to collect all the goodies hidden in the asylum. The story mainly focuses on Joker and Batman, but many other villains show up to help move the plot along. The story is almost purely confinded to the island, whether it is above or below, you grow to love the asylum, no matter how many enemies reside within its walls.  Replayability: Batman AA has tons of replayability for players who are looking to collect all the achievements, records, and solve the riddlers questions. Outside of all those things, there isn't any main story to complete after you run through it. Extra modes like the fighting, stealth and reward challenges will keep you busy, but after that the replay value decreases. Batman AA is meant for a story playthrough and includes all these extras to keep you interested. Most people will just complete the story and will be satisfied with their time on Arkham Asylum.   Controls: The controls are fluid and really smooth. Rocksteady worked hard on this and makes it very easy for anyone to pick and a play. There is no big learning curve which makes this a very attractive game to new users and veteran players.  Conclusion: If you are looking into buying Arkham Asylum or a Batman fan, this is the game for you. It has tons of juicy story content, great characters and voice acting, and a great open world system. The combat can get reptitive and some tasks might repeat themselves, but overall Batman Arkham Asylum is a great addition to everyone's collection.  Final Score: 9 out of 10",

However, I must have been stupid! I strongly advise you buy this game, and in my opinion, it is pure gold. While the boss fights could use some work, the game is ultimately still a great experience. This is not exactly something I would call open world, but because it is such a small map it is absolutely CRANKED with detail! There are really nice riddles about the environment in several locations on the map, and figuring those out is one of the best parts of Arkham Asylum. The combat is stellar as you may have heard before, with countless games trying to imitate it but not always reaching their full potential. Well, to say the least, this is one of the most fun combat systems I have ever messed around with. There are gadgets at your disposal which severely impact the flow of combat, in both good ways and bad - depending on how you use them. The story is insanely awesome, and the graphics have CERTAINLY aged well. The story goes that you have captured Joker, and obviously ♥♥♥♥ never goes as it should be. Joker is absolutely insane here and is about to... well, I will let you find that out for yourselves. This is a great experience and in some ways better than City, in most ways better than Origins, and story-wise better than Knight. 9/10 from me. Boss fights could be better, but it is a load of fun, and the story is great for any Batman fan to enjoy!   Absolutely recommended!",

Batman: Arkham Asylum was a game that everyone expected would be crappy but it turned out to be good... blah blah blah, everyone knows the stories. And if you've seen anyone's review of Arkham Asylum, my opinions are pretty similar, so for once I'll actually condense my thoughts:  PROS: 1- Great voice acting from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, as expected 2- Excellent, intuitive level design and puzzles  3- Well-created world within Arkham Island, that feels very dark and twisted 4- Continues telling a story without beating you over the head, like when Ivy takes over, you see all the plants swarm the island 5- Fantastic stealth and combat gameplay  CONS: 1- Uncreative boss fights 2- Lots of plot holes 3- Sometimes stiff animations (Conversations mainly look very stiff and robot-like)  I played this game years ago, and loved it then, so I'm glad to see that my opinion hasn't changed. I planned on taking a break from Steam to try out some Bayonetta and Lollipop Chainsaw on the console, but the temptation was too strong and I gave in. And I actually went out of my way to find out all 240 Riddler Trophies, which (while a little repetitive) was ultimately fun to find. It makes the replay value just a little bit higher.  Batman: Arkham Asylum gets an 8/10. With all the things it does so flawlessly well, it's very hard to judge it for its shortcomings. I'm definitely coming back in a few more years to play through a third time. I might even go for 100% completion.",

Dodging five assailants attacking at once and still being able to beat them senseless never gets dull.  Controls: A little unwieldy with mouse and keyboard. It is obvious from the outset this game was designed for consol controllers. If you don't have one hooked up to your PC I would recommend it to get the most from this game.

Sound: Atmospheric, no catchy recurring theme music sadly.   Secrets: My personal oppinion is that this game is all about the secrets. I believe there are over 15 for each map area and over 200 overall. It is easy to spend hours (literally) hunting in detective mode for hidden messages and riddle solutions. If you have intense OCD that you wish to placate and cure once and for all with the king of OCD games, then try to get 100% completion on this. No mean feat by any means.    In conclusion...

I finished it in around 11 hours by just doing the story, but there's enough challenges and secrets to last another 10-20 hours easily.  So any negatives? The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unreal engine as well as console base means you can't change sensitivity unless you change it in the config file manually. Also 2 of the bossfights were made with a console controller in mind which is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause when you play it on a PC it ruins the experience. Imagine playing the game for 10 hours in one way, then you're forced to do a 5 minute fight with the opposite controls. It's doable, but frustrating.  Other than those two flaws, I'd class this game a straight 10 and very enjoyable. ",

While the later games in the series offer a more open ended approach with arguably more things to see and do, in practice they seem to offer little more than filler between heavily scripted events. While collectibles, secrets and side missions often feel like chores in the later games, they feel like meaningful reasons to fully explore the asylum with appropriate rewards on offer. Each area is filled with unique assets and small, rememberable details. The riddlers side missions task you with photographing scenes that are unique to various characters from the Dark Knight universe which helps to direct the player toward these specially crafted, and unique in-game assets.  The combat system, while arguably too simplistic, is a delight to control as you see Batman stringing insane combo's together effortlessly disarming, and countering incoming attacks. Every kick, punch, grapple and counter is animated well making fights seem appropriately realistic and violent. The combat is assisted by some excellent audio leading to some satisfying crunches, cracks, and smacks as bones break and fists collide with faces.  The metroid-vania aspects of the game are implemented well, with each upgrade offering the oppertunity to revisit locations throughout the game.  The story is well told and the voice acting is excellent throughout, although I felt the final parts of the story were anticlimactic with the final boss fight in particular being tedius and frankly, rather silly. Seeing the Joker turn into a roid-raged meathead seemed rather out of character, and a little far-fetched - even for a comic book super villain.  On a technical level, the game still looks great to this day and runs exceptionally well. A mid-range pc should be able to run this game on maximum settings with a solid 60fps.  All-in-all it's a ground breaking game and in my opinion one of the best games of it's generation. A true masterpiece.",

Once you're done with the story, you still have a bunch of special challenges to beat (both combat and stealth related) and it doesn't even end there. Then, if you can, you still have a ton of hidden riddles around the asylum that are a lot of fun to find.  As I could not beat the challenges (I warn you, they ARE hard)I uninstalled the game after beating it to the end for the first time, and just a few days ago I decided to install it again (for which I blame Marvel’s Daredevil TV series, which made me want to punch thugs and feel like a superhero once again) and well, I 100%’ed the game this time and can only recommend playing it. I easily just put another 25 hours in the game, and had a lot of fun along the way. This game *gets it*. You really feel like Batman, the combat flows, the animations are well done, there are no loading screens to speak of, the game looks beautiful and the story and the appearances of the enemies are kind of justified. And, if you want to want to learn more about the characters, you have a bunch of entries about most of them. The gadgets are fun to play with, but I admit that it’s kind of annoying how convenient everything is for Batman. “Oh, I’m stuck in this island… never mind, I have several batcaves in every corner of Gotham, mwahaha!” The game is perfectly adapted to the PC, almost no FPS drops, and if you are Spanish or if you are learning Spanish, I recommend playing it in that language, as the quality of the dubbing and of the translation is extremely well done. I think this is one of the very, very rare occasions in which I prefer a dubbed product rather than the original. But yeah, that’s just my opinion. Anyway, congrats to everyone who participated in the Spanish localization of the game.  And among the best moments of the game, I loved the parts with Scarecrow in them. Extremely interesting and engaging, and trying not to spoil too much, there’s this particular part that resembles the now classic fight against Psycho Mantis in MGS1. That was genius and I loved it. We need more mind-blowing, scary stuff like that in video games.  I still haven't played Arkham City or Origins, so I really cannot compare them yet with Asylum. However, I must say that I bought them both as soon as I could after finishing this one, so I guess that means asylum is probably worth it…. In fact, it is! If you enjoyed the movies/series/comics, you'll definitely like this game.   So yeah, if you still haven't played any arkham games, you should definitely give this one a go. It's your chance to be Batman, should I really say anything else? *vanishes*",

Besides this, some enemies wield guns, and that forces one to take enemies out with stealth too.

            "review_text": "This is where it all began - most likely the coolest superhero game series ever, even with the problems it suffered later (the not exactly innovative Origins, and the buggy launch of AK). And what a start it was!  Even today, the game looks really dang good, and the atmosphere rocks still! Don't be misled by my low number of hours... I did buy this game when it came out (back then, still with the horrible Windows Live system), and played it like crazy, and just was given AA and AC for free because I bought AK a while ago, and just started replaying this one AGAIN. And it still is one of the best entries in the series.  AC might be bigger, AK more technically advanced, the other games have more gadgets and stuff, but this still has such a great vibe to it, and a cool story.  The intro (even though it gets a bit long on your 2nd, 3rd, ... playthrough) is a great start, and off you go, exploring the huge Asylum, which is split up into different segments. You can focus on the story and go for that mostly, or you can try to find all the Riddler secrets and interrogation tapes, which will tell you more about the villains.  If you have played any of the more recent ACs, Shadow Of Mordor or any of the newer Batman games, the gameplay will be fun, and you will be familiar with the controls. Hitting, combos, blocking, etc.   The game runs perfectly well on my system, and I think that you really SHOULD get it if you haven't tried it yet, especially when it is on sale. One of the coolest games of the recent years, a totally great entry to the Batman-franchise (the game really does justice to the Batman we all love... the cool, enigmatic, torn, threatening one), it still looks great and is fun, and there are some very cool moments in there, especially those that are related to the fear toxin.  The boss fights might be more varied and interesting in later games, but still, they are fun in this one (and less 'waaayy too long' than they were in Origins), and I think it's decently challenging...and a ton of fun. If you love Batman, or the games I mentioned above, if you wanna see how the Arkham-franchise began with a killer game, get this game! Right now, during the xmas sale, its five Euros, so GET IT!  Pros: - Runs perfect, even on highest settings, and has aged very well - Still looks great - Awesome atmosphere and voice-acting - Challenging yet not unfair - Some great sequences and writing - Fun combat - Some VERY creative scenes. Killer Croc's Lair was one of my favorites, as it was very suspenseful.   Cons: - Boss fights are not as varied as in later games, ymmv  YMMV: The game is pretty short...I finished the whole story in 8 hours on this playthrough. Didnt do any challenges, and didn't find all ridler-icons, but focused mainly on the story. However, better 8 hours of a great game than 60 hours with tons of repetition and filler, right? It was VERY VERY enjoyable, but some may find it too short, or too linear... the storyline dictates where you go, and the Asylum is segmented, not as open as AC. Still, an AWESOME game even today, and if you can get it for a low prize, don't hesitate!",

This is one instance where a license appears to have been handled correctly with a competent product. Hearing the old cast, wielding Batman's arsenal and using stealth to take down enemies were all immensely satisfying.  However, I had two problems with the game:  1) Arkham Asylum traps the player inside boss battles. Want to explore and upgrade? Tough. The game decided to autosave. You're stuck playing a frustrating minigame with questionable resemblance to normal combat.  2) Enemies don't respawn. When solving riddles, this is good for decreasing travel time. However, I didn't learn the bulk of the combat basics until the final battle. I focused on stealth, rarely counterattacked and made it through with a low combo count. By the time more advanced techniques were necessary, I had removed every opportunity to experiment from the story. Practice in the challenges.",

Almost 7 years old and this game feels as great as it did the first time I played it back in the Peasant Station 3's golden days. It's a game that never bores you from beginning to end and it encourages you to find every unlockable.  What to say about Arkham Asylum? This game revolutionized the way we play games. It brought so many innovations to a time when games were starting to feel so repetitive, uninspired, buggy and generic. The surprising thing was that this game was based on a DC superhero world; something that was considered a stigma in the gaming world. Almost no superhero game has ever been good, or interesting enough to engage people who are not into comics. Yet Batman Arkham series threw this misconception away and brought a magnificent piece of gaming software at the same time.  So many games have tried to copy the Free-Flow system, but non have succeeded. This combat system is the 'pièce de résistance' of the Arkham series and will have you craving for fights. And I love how the game does so well at not overdoing it. It gives you just enough fights throughout the game so it is always exciting, without falling into repetitiveness. And still, at the end, it rewards you with a mode were you can beat as many henchmen as you like.  Appart fromt he wonderful combat system that it's such a treat to watch and perform, the game also engages you in stealth as well as playing the detective. It manages to wrap all this into an immersive story with a very dark style never seen before in a Batman game. It even manages to sneak some horror elements, which does fantasticaly well! Definitely a surprise for the first-timer.  I really can't find any negatives on this game. It plays brilliant, looks wonderful for being a 7 year-old game, amazing soundtrack and sound effects. great voice acting (we've got the official Joker's voice: Mark Hamill), gorgeous and badass character designs, engaging story even for the non comic fan, and the list goes on.  This game is a classic on its own right and it will go into history as one of the greatest and most influential games of the past gen.  Graphics: 8/10 It's a 7 year old game but it still looks fenomenal. The PC version benefits from sharper textures, light effects and 60fps. It almost does not look as old as it really is.  Sound: 7/10 The soundtrack alone is epic! But it suffers from volume spikes. Cutscenes are too loud. Something that many games suffer from.  Controls: 9/10 You got to play this with a controller. Once you do, you find yourself with one of the most responsive, smooth and intuitive controllers there is. Developers really put an effort in them.  Gameplay: 9/10 This game is in a league of its own. Back when it came out, there was nothing like it. Brilliant fighting mechanics! Great ballance between stealth, beat'em up, exploration and even horror, making this game feel interesting from beginning to end.  Story: 8/10 Simple, but engaging. That darker, more mature Batman game no one really asked for, but oh boy, thank the gods we got!",

            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is a 2009 action-adventure video game based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. It was developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on August 25, 2009, with a Microsoft Windows version following on September 15.  Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum is based on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman's archenemy, the Joker, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum's inmates and put an end to the Joker's plans. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration.  The game received critical acclaim—particularly for its narrative—and won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from different media outlets. It held the Guinness World Record for 'Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever'. A Game of the Year edition was released on March 26, 2010, and an OS X version was released in November 2011. Arkham Asylum '​s success launched a series of Batman: Arkham sequels, beginning in October 2011 with Batman: Arkham City.",

Batman: Arkham Asylum just so happens to be proof that the action-adventure genre can still survive and do extraordinarily well in terms of profit amidst a plethora of other games that do the same old thing all over again. A lot of the gameplay reminds myself of older adventure games, and mixes it up with brawler action stuff which is good, but those with less than an average competence with button-press timing may find that the flow of combat is often interrupted and can at times be infuriating. The narrative is pretty much standard Batman with the twist that you face multiple of his most notorious villains, with Joker being a sort of pseudo-kingpin with a master plan. Add on the voice talent of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and Joker respectively, and you definitely feel like this is an authentic Batman experience. All in all, if you haven't played Arkham Asylum by now, you really REALLY should, as it is (and was) a refreshing change of pace to the usual product.   P.S. Kudos to whomever was in charge of putting those collectibles in the right places.

Arkham Asylum is one damn good action game, surprising for a western-developed title, and one damn good stealth game, surprising for a modern video game (ded genre etc). The combat is simple but also somewhat complex, with quite a few gadgets and moves, and a LOT of ways to take down enemies. The stealth and combat in Asylum can be mixed together at will, (except when fighting armed enemies, in which case it is too dangerous to fight them openly) providing a lot of different gameplay possibilities for the player. While learning the advanced uses of moves and gadgets is not necessary for the player to truly succeed in the normal game, the challenge mode is where the game's combat shines. On top of the base game and the challenges, which are all reasonably difficult, the game also comes with a harder difficulty mode that will really wreck your ♥♥♥♥. It's a little bit broken because the game's combat is very reliant on the appearence of shining attack indicators over enemies before they strike, which are gone when playing the hardest difficulty, but overall it remains one of the hardest action games I've played in the last few years. The stealth is also wonderful. It's very fast, and requires proper use of your gadgets and tools. There's never a moment in Arkahm Asylum's stealth where you're doing nothing or waiting for something to happen. It also has a very interesting system of fear tactics, where you can get various effects out of enemies with fear. Arkham Asylum features my favourite depiction of Batman and Gotham City, it being in my opinion a perfect blend of the style of the animated series and the more realistic versions of the live-action films. The art style (and graphics) is fantastic, and that's without even mentioning the amazing Scarecrow segments scattered throughout the game. The biggest problem with this game is probably the integration with Games For Windows Live, even on Steam. But if that doesn't bother you too much, you should definately give this game a try. You won't regret it.",

Overall it's just boring with plenty of style but little substance. The metroidvania level design and pacing is nice and the presentation plays with all of that quite well but the main issues are still abrasive enough for me to lose interest pretty fast. I'm not a fan of batman or comic books, so the writing is honestly fairly uninteresting and predictable overall for me. To top this all off, very clunky controls and irritating design choices and boss fights make it tedious to play at times. I don't care if it was 'designed for a gamepad'. I'm playing on PC, and these games have had bad ports since the very beginning.   The 'predator' style encounters are where this game really shines, though. It's not a very good stealth game due to how static and repetitive the core gameplay moments are, but it is a fantastic Batman experience. The 'free flow' fighting mechanics are also the start of a very annoying trend I've seen in numerous action games since this title that I'll honestly be quite happy to see disappear.  This game certainly paved the way for Arkham City which was a far superior title (and an all-around good game,) but I can't really recommend this game because there's honestly not much of a point in playing it with Arkham City released. The ONLY exception is in its level design. Arkham City was open world, while this is metroidvania. If that interests you then maybe you'll enjoy it.  It's not an awful game but, in my opinion, the Arkham games are pretty oversold through and through. If you haven't played this, then you probably haven't played City. If you haven't played City, simply play that instead. Stay away from Origins and Arkham Knight, though... unless you're a rabid fanboy apologist.",

The controls are fairly simple to get a grip on. The main challenges are can you take on so many enemies and are you really paying attention? The last part can be somewhat frustration as the Arkham Institute is so detailed you might find yourself, as I did, overlooking that one simple air vent because there is so much stuff!  The Riddler's, collect as you go, side quests are actually quite enjoyable. Some of them are clever enough to actually make you smile once you figure it out.   I really only have two criticisms of the game:  1) At times some of the Boss Battles don't give you even an inkling of what you're suppose to do to break them down until after they've beaten you.  2) Some of the Riddler's quests require equipment that you don't get until much later in the game to access. This at time led me to waste time futily trying to get to something just because I thought I wasn't being artful in my employment of the abilities I did have. Also once you do get that equipment you have to do a lot of back tracking.  All in all, a very fun game where you actually get to be a top hero in the DC Universe.",

For some reason this mix of a Sanic '06 and Final Fight: Streetwise is being paraded as a masterpiece of videogaming. I never read any of the comics but was there really an issue where Batman wore black panties over his tights? How is he looking so cool when he looks like a rétard?!  The combat is the most boring ever. All Batman does is punching goons, no guns, no grenades, not fun at all. Combat gets a 20/10. The stealth-sections are also really bad. Rocksteady thinks they made the stealth-sections cool by renaming the sections 'Predator stuff'. So lame. You have like 50 gadgets only 70 of them are useful, but still, the best thing to do is to just drop down in front of the goons and punch the shít out of them and take the hits.  The story starts out really boring. Batman brings The Joker to the Assylum, then something happens with Poison Ivy and Rocksteady got my attention by shoving Poison Ivy's succulent butt right in front of our faces. Then my attention dropped when they made Killer Croc a freaking cannibal.  I think what sucked me out most of the story is when I realized that Batman is the lamest super hero ever. Just look at him, his design is redonkulous and his motive for not killing is stupoid too. 'GEHHH, diz guai keeled muh purrents wehn I wuz a chaild, me no kil pipul.' So unoriginal, you know Lucian did that before, right? Man, Bob Kane can't come up with a single original idea.  The game is also rather short, I completed the game 100% in just about 13 hours, to me that is not acceptable. Rocksteady, make your games lengthier.  Alright, this game gets a zero out of 15 million.  I'd rather play a David Cage game. I'd rather ♥♥♥♥♥ing play that bullcráp game Skyrim, or as it should be called 'Shítrim'.",

Its gameplay, story and design all make you feel like the Caped Crusader and is one of, if not the best licensed title we've ever gotten.  Arkham Asylum's story pits the Dark Knight against a plethora of classic villains from the Batman's rogues gallery who are all pawns in the Joker's master plan. Honestly, the story on its own and Rocksteady's take on the Batman mythos are worth so much just on its own. The way they cleverly write the whole rogues gallery essentially into this game, either through story or easter eggs, is genious at least. It also happens to be one of the best Joker stories in recent memory.  Just story alone really makes this game, but the fact is that the gameplay is also insanely good. And I'm not just saying that because Batman, but because all the game mechanics and level design are excellent in their own right! The combat system this game crafted has been copied by so many games already. The simple freeflow combat mechanic where you can counter enemies' attacks and keep your chain going is just simplicity at its best. The stealth portions of the game are also very good with level design giving a hand in those sections.   All the gadgets available to Batman are useful and do very different things, not only in combat and stealth, but also in puzzle-solving, collectible hunting and platforming. The Metroidvania style of gameplay and Bioshock type ambience also really make the game's atmosphere really shine and make for a dark and gritty Batman story. They also explore and enliven the Asylum which is usually not shown too much. The whole concept of spending the entire game on the Asylum with all your superpowered nemeses, during one night is genious and they have managed to pull it off perfectly.  Even if you're not a Batman fan, you'll become one after playing this game. Gameplay and story are all excellently crafted and add to this essential Batman experience. This game is most definitely worth your time.  A must-buy!",

The game is also tagged as being 'open world' but it certainly is not, so you shouldn't bother to buy it if that's a big selling point for you. Yes, there's a fair amount of freedom to roam around, but there are also plenty of spots where a real open world game would allow you to get past barriers, like stairway ballisters, that you can't jump over in this game. For true open world gameplay, get Just Cause 2 and compare, you will see what I mean.  Overall the game is fun and challenging, but very often far too annoying.",

Fun for both the action-seekers and the more patient stealthfanatics, it mixes subtlety with action... ranging from silently taking down armed inmates from the shadow and swooping them up from gargoyles to seamless free-flow combat against a number of thugs wielding knives, lead pipes and stunbatons. There's also trophies and taped patient interviews to find and riddles to solve, left by the Riddler. And if you don't know any of the characters, or would just like to learn more about them, you can read their character biographies, and in some cases, listen to their taped patient interviews.",

            "review_text": " Quick Breakdown:  A strong superhero game that combines elements of action and stealth, taking place in a dark and gritty Arkham Asylum. Strong voice acting and dialogue, along with a fun story help propel the game even further along. It properly delivers a thrilling experience playing as the dark knight.  Length:  12 hours (Main game)  Score:  8/10   Full Review:  The Dark Knight has long been a beloved character for many, and I don’t think I’m alone in wanting to play as the caped crusader. Thankfully, Arkham Asylum delivers this experience in spades.  The setting for this experience is Gotham city’s Arkham Asylum, home for the criminally insane. In proper Batman fashion it’s dark and gritty, taking place in the night and filled with shadows. Those kept locked away in the asylum have broken free, and under the Joker’s leadership, are now in control of their prison. Retaking the asylum and defeating the Joker and the other inmates is, as you’ve likely guessed, your mission in the game.  The game’s story is fun, and is your typical sort of Batman plotline. It’s not an all-time great Batman story, but it will keep you entertained throughout the course of the game (though the ending is rather weak and stupid). The greater highlight is the voice acting and dialogue featured in the game. Many voice actors from the 1990’s animated series lend their talents to the game, including Kevin Conroy as Batman, and Mark Hamill as the Joker. Hamill steals the show, showing once again why he is so superb at voicing the Joker. He snarls, mocks, and cackles as if he were the madman himself, and the Joker’s comments and mockery as you fight to retake the asylum are highly entertaining.   Though Hamill’s efforts as the Joker overshadow the rest of the cast, it should be noted that many other characters are well voiced, and their dialogue as well is entertaining as you play through the game. This from both the big names in Bats’ rogue gallery, such as the Riddler’s mocking condescension as you solve his challenges (more on those in a bit), and the Scarecrow taunting you as you overcome the fear induced from his toxin; as well as the over-confident boasting of the Joker’s grunts, and especially as their chatter turns to nervousness and then fear as you pick of their comrades.  Of course, when discussing a game one must talk about the most important part of the medium: the gameplay itself. Thankfully the game does not slouch here either, successfully giving you the experience of being Batman (as much as a game can anyway). The gameplay includes both elements of stealth and action, each being an entertaining experience.  During the stealth portions, you must tactically pick off your enemies one by one, avoiding detection, lest they fill you with lead. To do so you must creep in the shadows, and crawl through air ducts, hide beneath floor tiles, and swing from gargoyles from high above. You have various ways to silently dispense of your enemies, such as dropping down on them from above, stringing them up from a gargoyle, or a discrete melee attack from behind. To aid you in your quiet takedown of enemies you can use detective mode, which gives you a greater view of the land, allowing you to look through walls, floors, and ceilings to see where enemies are located. Additionally, detective mode will tell you how many enemies are in the area, how many are armed, and how many are unarmed, as well as which are which.  The action sequences feature more direct combat, as you utilize feet and fists in a direct assault against your enemies. This is one of the strongest points of the game; it’s simple but elegant combat system. You use one button to attack, and another to counterattack when a few blue lines flash about an enemy combatants head. Strikes must be properly timed, so as to earn combos, which not only grant you more experience towards earning upgrades, but also do more damage, ending a fight more quickly and efficiently. During fights you are not left to use only your limbs as weapons, as you are equipped with your trusty batarangs to stun enemies, as well as being able to stun foes with a strike from your cape.  As you level up you can purchase upgrades that increase your fighting abilities, the gear you use, and your health.  Sometimes throughout the game you will be transported to a bizarre place, where you must defeat the Scarecrow. During these segments you must hide from Scarecrows gaze, and make your way to the top of the area, which have some light platforming elements. Later Scarecrow stages will also involve skeleton enemies that you must fight off, while still evading Scarecrow’s gaze. These segments are a lot of fun, and are a highly memorable part of the game.  Occasionally throughout the game you will face off against one of the many villains from Gotham. Sadly, these battles are rather lackluster, and are one of the glaring weaknesses of the game. While I wouldn’t go as far as to call them bad, I must say that they are rather mediocre, and don’t shine as brightly as the rest of the game.  In addition to the main content of the game, there are also Riddler challenges, which task you to find hidden trophies and symbols hidden throughout the world map. While I didn’t find them particularly compelling, they do provide a distraction from the main game in case you need. As for myself, I merely collected the ones I managed to find as I went through the game, and didn’t bother to seek out any additional ones.  The bonus content for the game features additional challenge missions for you to partake in. There are two types of challenge levels, the first is a combat oriented mission, where you must fight through successive waves of enemies, aiming for the highest score you can. The other is a stealth mission, where you are tasked to take out your enemies as quickly as you can, and are rewarded for taking them out in certain ways. All said, the bonus content included isn’t very interesting, and I didn’t spend any more time on it than it took to get a feel for what it is.  As for the bonus content is included as part of the GOTY edition (originally released as DLC), there are 4 bonus challenges to play through. They are in much the same vein as the regular bonus content, being a mix of combat and stealth levels. Likewise with the other bonus content, they too are lackluster and not particularly entertaining.  In addition to my criticisms already mentioned, I feel must mention that the load times for the game are a bit long, especially when dying and waiting for the game to reload. Additionally, it’s a tad ambiguous at times when they game is at a checkpoint that will save your progress at a point you can resume from when you reload the next time you boot up the game. There were a few occasions where I thought I had reached a checkpoint, only to have to redo a small portion of the game the next time I resumed play. Given that there is no option to manually save the game this is a bit more troubling than it should be. Thankfully this isn’t too major of an issue, but it is still annoying and unnecessary.  At the end of the day though, this is still a strong game, and certainly one of the best superhero games out there, delivering the sort of experience one deserves from a Batman game; you get to sneak around and beat up criminals as you play as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman.

Sure, you'll encounter The Joker and Harley Quinn, but you're also going to run into the likes of Bane, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow and Zsasz. A multitude of other villains are referenced in various ways, even though they don't actually appear in person. Either way, for those who are hardcore fans of the franchise, it's a nice touch.  Is it good? ================= Making your way through the story, three types of game play quickly become apparent: combat, stealth and exploration. In short, pretty much all the fighting is handled with two buttons and timing. Get the timing down, and you'll be whipping out amazing combos with a simple tap-tap-tap. The stealth game play is referred to as 'predator mode' by the developers since it is most directly inspired by the classic Batman of the comics. Here, the focus is on creating fear and eliminating enemies when they are vulnerable. Exploration is more or less standard plat forming, but combined with Batman's cool gadgets.  Audio is a strong point for Batman: Arkham Asylum, be it music, sound effects or voice acting. Mark Hamill reprises his role as The Joker, while Kevin Conroy stars as Batman and Arleen Sorkin voices Harley Quinn. It all makes for good visuals, even if things do look a bit plastic at times. PhysX support appears to be PC-only, which means you’ll only find volumetric fog, detailed cloth animation or random destructible items such as paper and tiles here on the PC version.  Does it have any problems? ======================== Where Batman: Arkham Asylum stumbles is in the boss fights. Some, such as the battle against Poison Ivy, are challenging in an old-school, learn the pattern way. Others, such as the (multiple) fights against the Scarecrow, are brilliantly executed. But most are repetitive fights against low level enemies and are more an exercise in button-mashing than any sort of challenge.  Final Thoughts! ==================== In addition to the main game, Batman: Arkham Asylum also features a wealth of unlockable information in the form of characters bios, audio interviews with key inmates, beautifully rendered character trophies and the aforementioned challenge maps. Challenge maps are split into combat and predator style, with the goal of the combat maps being a high score and the goal of the predator maps being elimination of the enemies as quickly as possible. There have been many different Batman games over the years, but none quite so polished as this one. Batman: Arkham Asylum combines the best elements of the classic Batman mythos with the modern-day interpretation of the hero. The end result is a game that outshines its flaws and is quite simply a blast to play.  --------------------------------",

Back in 2009 the Batman had had his ups and downs in regard to videogames, and then suddenly there was this one which came somewhat out of nowhere. It had its very own fighting system, tried a different approach to the game making it feel closer to the comics and additionally it didn't stop there. As Batman's greatest weapon is fear and striking from the shadows as he is almost always outmatched, the game added predator encounters, in which you should avoid fighting the henchmen head on and insteadt jump or swing from vantage point to vantage point and pick them off one by one. Basically, Rocksteady took a risk and gave us something new. Completely new gameplay mechanics, a new story... Additionally, they topped it off with tried and true voice actors and I have to say, Kevon Conroy and Mark Hamill are just perfect for this. This package worked perfectly. Arkham Asylum is still the masterpiece it has always been and has aged well. This is a great game for everyone. For Batman fans, however, it is a must-have!",

The characters are fantastic, even though this is the  first game  in the series. Everyone seems previously developed (to be fair, they were in comics) and all have a unique personality. The voice and sadistic character of the Joker has never been better   (exept the final boss)   and the game is all around great. I just wish the game had a regular edition, as the DLC is worthless survival modes.

            "review_text": "The best Batman Game, and in my opinion the best use of a licensed character closely followed by this titles sequel 'Arkham City'. Arkham Asylum puts you in the shoes of the World’s Greatest Detective in transit to Arkham Asylum directly following catching the Joker in Gotham. In true Joker fashion though, this simple booking procedure goes wrong, and Joker takes over the Asylum. Now you as Batman has to figure out what the Clown Prince of Crime is up too. Along the way you see and battle the A-Team of batman Villains who happen to be locked up in the Asylum.   Visually Arkahm Aslyum still holds its weight and looks great. The art direction in this game does an incredible job in complementing the emotions and feelings the writers are trying to convey. From the cramped insides of the Asylum to incredible vistas from Arkham Island looking out at Gotham. I also enjoyed that despite the massive success of 'Nolan’s Batman' this game is throwing you into the Batman from the Comics or Cartoon that I grew up with.   In keeping with Nostalgia, Rocksteady got the two greatest voice actors to reprise their roles as Batman and Joker. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill respectively. These voices are the ones that most of here when we read the comics and both Actors do a phenomenal job, coupled with great writing from Rocksteady.   For anyone is worried that because the story and visual presentation are so superb that the gameplay must be shallow, which happens often. I can ease your mind, Arkham Aslyum's gameplay is tight responsive and truly makes you feel like the Caped Crusader. Combat when out in the open completed with 'free-flow' combat, which when first introduced seems like single button directional combat. But they do a great job of building on it as the game goes on adding in gadgets, parries, stuns, and diverse unit types.   Along with great combat, Arkham Island is full of Exploration and puzzles to solve. Throughout the game you will be taunted by The Riddler to solve his puzzles, which range from grabbing statues to finding hidden Easter Eggs spread out around the world with hints given in Riddle-Form, and using your Detective Mode vision to find hidden 'Question Marks'. Detective mode is a vision where you can see enemies through walls in skeletal form and other important objects will be highlighted (Be warned you will spend a good amount of time in this vision a lot more than you would think)   I could go on and on but do not want to give any Spoilers because that where Arkham shines is in delivering an incredibly well-paced and well written Batman story worthy of the Title. If you want to not only feel like Batman but be put into a great Batman Story this game is a must play  5/5 - please read more of my reviews and add me ",

Harley and Joker are my favorite Batman villans and their homicidal madness shined, here.  Are there quibbles? Yes. The boss battles are all too similar bar Poison Ivy, the game is VERY linear, how Joker got a hold of the mystery party guest at the end is baffling considering they'd already escaped the island, there are a lot of repetitive game elements, there are unresolved issues with the spirit of Arkham, and my three pronged bathook (or whatever it's called) would repeatedly get stuck on the unevolved single pronged version and I'd have to switch to another tool and back to get it to work properly.

But man, this is a great game, no matter if you like the comic or not.  Some people say, and I tend to agree partially, that this is still the best game in the batman series. The latter two games in the series are more open world, which some might prefer. But I found the story and the game play a little more contained (in a good sense) and with better pacing. It feels slightly like the open-world was added to the latter games just because that is popular, while in fact the games don't really need it. They are still great games, but it is not the open-world aspect that makes the games great.  The game is beautiful (even though it does not demand the best PC), there is so much to do, and all aspects of the game are interesting and well made. The combat is incredibly smooth and satiesfying, even though on paper it looks rather simple. You really feel strong and powerful being batman. I find it a perfect combination of stealth and fighting. But batman is also a great detective, and the gadgets are really inovative and fun to use. There are quite a few ways to 'travel' around, and the games has tons of extras to find, which might make you want to come back again. There are also boss-fights, and even though I don't like boss fights normally, these are fun, and sometimes quite interesting and innovative. The voice acting is very very good (the joker is Mark Hamill for example) The whole lore and universe is interesting and deep. I learned a lot about the batman universe playing this game, and I really felt every antagonist had an interesting story and depth. The game is dark in the right way. It does not feel silly at all. It really feels like the game was made by people who love and respect this comic. It is a game about batman, not just a way to cash in on a great icon. This game delivers well even if you are a fan or not.  I think it runs great with mouse and keyboard, and this time I did not try it with a controller, but I can't imagine that being a better option anyway.",

Seeing as how I got it from the recent Humble Bundle I decided to check the game out. I'll start with saying that this game has a wonderful atmosphere and feels very satisfying to walk around in as Batman and stalk the various enemies in some very vertical levels. Pretty much everyone knows how the fighting in this game works by now and I am probably one of the last people to have played it so I'll just leave it at 'it's pretty darn fun'. When I wasn't in full blown Batman wrecking ball action, I found the other most compelling part of the game to be the stealth. At times it did seem a bit ridiculous with what Batman could get away with, but in the end it was incredibly enjoyable to stalk the unfortunate few who were trapped in a room with the one and only Dark Knight. A nice complement to the game were the various gadgets Batman acquires throughout the game. I'm not sure why he didn't have these items on his person already, but it added I nice dash of Metroidvania into the game as well as fun mix-ups to the combat. The last big item that I would like to mention are the Riddler challenges. They can be extremely addicting and frustrating all at the same time. They were a fun activity to be distracted by whenever I wanted make myself to not plow full speed through the story. Even if you don't think you will enjoy the combat or stealth in the game I would still recommend to play it on easy just to enjoy the story. There are plenty of characters that make an appearance along with a ton of audiologs and others inclusions, all of which are enjoyable to take in.  I give the game a 'Yes' out of 'Go Play It Now'",

The world is extremely interactive, you still have to follow a general line, but you can just spend forever exploring each well detailed area. Needless to say, some of the scenes will put you on the edge of your seat. Now, if you are one to follow the Batman story line in depth, it is an even more impressive game. Many- if not most- of Batman's official Rogue's gallery, is included in cameos. From Firefly to the Madhatter to Humpty Dumpty to more than you can imagine, they're all here in some aspect, and that itself is exhilerating. Despite being a decently old game, first coming out in 09, its graphics are up to par with games released today. Having incredible fighting movements, various different types of enemies and a utility belt full of gadgets with you to choose from, the combat in this game is good enough for anyone who just wants to go around beating up every thug in their path.

What I found out much to my surprise is this game is dark, very dark! and with that VERY gripping. The presentation of the asylum harkens back to days of old when patients were more like gunea pigs that those in need of help. The protagonist and his arch nemesis are presented in all their gloryfying horror. The area to explore in this game are expansive and when you realise that there are more sub layers to your objectives such as the riddlers trophies etc, this game takes on many characters and levels.  I particularly liked the intorduction of the main characters from throughout the batman archive and the explanation of their backround story.

I was able to catch on quickly on what was going on and the history and personality of each character.  The visuals of the game are astounding, everything just seems so perfect with the graphics. It has the perfect atmosphere for the story that is being portrayed.  The ambience in this game were fantastic, especially when Scarecrow decided to show up, the game would take a completely different turn and give you quite the chills. Could just be I had my headphones turned all the way up? Who knows?  This is where the game shines in my opinion, the voice acting was absolutely amazing.   And the combat and overall gameplay of Batman AA is very fluid. Everything just seems to roll into eachother perfectly. One second you are taking on 6 thugs, next second you are grappling to safety and now taking them out, one by one.   Overall experience: 8.5/10",

The story was simple fare: enter Arkham Asylum, and stop the Joker and his enlisted bosses, through technology/subterfuge/force, from holding the institution. The ending was a bit of a cop-out. The story wasn't anything amazing and didn't have any lasting implications in the Batman universe.   Despite it all, the game *feels* good. It moves/travels/fights as Batman should. Possessed of some legitimately tense moments, the game also exhibits a Batman that we remember from the comics. Unlike successors that have suffered from feature creep and a series of issues, Arkham Asylum is very linear, thankfully enough. The game moves briskly and with purpose as you work your way towards the conclusion.   Definitely worth the time if you can get it on an 8 dollar Steam sale.  Recommended.  8/10.",

One of my favorite things that I liked seeing in this game is that (on normal difficulty) it was easy enough to move the story along without frustration. The bosses were enjoyably challenging but there was no stupid wall that made me throw my hands up and forget about the story because I couldn't advance it past a particular boss. It was the right balance of difficulty.  The only frustrating part is not being able to save manually. Whenever I had to get off and do real-life stuff I was always afraid that after killing a whole bunch of thugs, I hadn't reached a check point and would have to kill them all over again when I got back on.

            "review_text": "I honestly have to say this is one of the best licensed games out there. Scratch that, one of the best action adventure games out there.  The reason why this game is so great is that it has strong gameplay, great visuals and an awesome soundtrack and it doesn't rely on being a Batman game to fool people into buying it. Don't get me wrong though, this is a Batman game, from beginning to end. Rocksteady have crafted one of the most unique and well designed gameplay experiences of the action adventure genre that suits the Dark Knight perfectly. This is particularly impressive considering most licensed games do it the other way around: trying to fit the characters into an already existing gameplay style. This game does exactly the opposite and that's what makes it so incredible.  Speaking of the gamplay style, it is a healthy mix of action combat bits, stealth sections, environmental exploration and even some minimal platforming and detective bits. All of these feel distinctly Batman-y in every way though so don't be fooled into thinking this is just another generic action adventure title.  The combat sections in Arkham Asylum do a great job of making you feel like the Dark Knight. They are very unique as they focus on timing your strikes and flowing smoothly into each next move without ever braking your combo rather than the standard button mashing and long button sequence memorization in most games. In fact the actual button sequences you need to remember are very minimal. Most of the game you will spend only using two buttons really: attacking and countering. The attack button does what you can imagine but the counter is a bit more interesting. It allows you to automatically counter incoming attacks indicated by the little Spiderman-esque lightning bolts that appear on top of enemies' heads when they are about to attack. This may seem like a very simple system, and for the most part it is, but even though the system is easy to get into, it is hard to master as it requires a lot of timing to execute properly. It is truly brilliant and it's no wonder it's becoming the system most game devs have started using. It just makes you feel like a badass.  The stealth is equally as interesting and fun although it is more standard stuff. The focus here is using your environment to your advantage to take out threats without being seen. To do this you get a wide variety of options for silent take downs each as satisfying as the next. The only thing I need to say here is that these sections don't feel slapped on like they do in most other action games. They really fit and are great fun.  The environmental exploration is in the form of Riddler trophies and riddles. Dotted around the island there are many question mark trophies placed by the Riddler. Sometimes to get them you just need to find them but sometimes they require a certain gadget or upgrade to be obtained. The riddles themselves are about scanning a certain landmark or object that answers the riddle for the said area. Don't worry though, it's never anything too obscure like in the old point and click days. No leaves in the corner of the Arkham mansion need to be scanned. These trophies are very rewarding to collect both in a literal sense and a personal accomplishment sense.  The story and visuals are great and fit into the Batman mythos amazingly. I won't spoil much but it's great fun for fans of the Dark Knight and even those who don't care about Batman might enjoy it. It's very well written and voice acted.  The only con I see is that the game is sometimes easy to get lost in due to the dark bleak environments. You do have a map though for that but it is still a minor annoyance. The bosses are also pretty weak as you only get one type of them for most of the game. I feel like they could of been so much more.  That said, the cons are very small and this game is an absolute diamond for any Batman fans and fans of good games in general. Highly recommended to everyone. 9/10.",

The wide array of gadgets you need to use are great and movement of batman is easy weather he's flying or running.  The story is pretty good although it helps if you listen to the interview tapes of the many criminals and read bios to help add depth. The ending is abrupt and maybe could have been more statisfying.  The extra content such as the combat challenges and predator challenges can get quite tough but they are fun, especially some of the combat challenges in which you need to beat a hundred baddies.  The graphics are holding up really well, the game still looks so good considering it came out a long time ago. It's very well optimized on the PC and was only ever using 400MB of ram most times and it never crashed during the entire 36 hours I played it.  Although it says 'Partial Controller Support' I've never had any issues with my Logitech F710 gamepad while I played this.  The voice acting in this game is superb. You can really feel the effort being put into these characters.  The riddler trophies while some might find tedious to run around and collect, I found great, Particularly the ones that required you to THINK on how to actually get them by using multiple gadgets. Many other games fail at collectables by just spoon feeding you a location you need to run to collect it without making it a challenge to get the things. Many of the riddler trophies aren't even visible initially, you need to find riddler maps which expose them on the game map or simply have a sharp eye and look out for them.  P.S Arkham City is even better than this game, but play this first - it's worth it",

            "review_text": "Excellent game and one of the best single player titles in recent times.  You can probably split the appeal of this game into two categories-  Gameplay Story/atmosphere  Gameplay- Combat: Addictive and great fun, easy to use but difficult to master.  Predator (Stealth): Incredible fun, you really feel like batman stealthily wiping out hapless henchmen one by one. Possibly a bit too easy when you get good at it. However they made it harder but ruined it (imo) in the later titles.  Both elements make you feel like Batman when you pull them off, which is just so damn awesome. There's not too much more to say about them, but the hours of fun they provide cannot be understated.  Story/Atmosphere- Amazing. This is not an open world game like the later titles and from my perpective actually benefits massively from it. The story is dark and mature and the 'feel' of the game is oppressive and even scary at points, this feels much more impactful than swinging around Arkham City and randomly dropping in to beat some thugs to pulp (which is entertaining, but ultimately feels much more like GTA and the masses of other titles which emulate it). This recreation of batman is better than all the film versions, and damn, that Kevin Conroy Batman voice is perfect.  If I had to criticise, then my first target would be the bosses, especially the poor final boss which mostly seem to be copy pasted across the game in a predictable mould. Don't get me wrong, the titan fights are great. I just wish that there was more variety and more good stuff.  Overall this is a very good game, I would argue that if you are a remotely a batman fan (I wasn't) you should definitely get it. If not it applies to anyone who wants to sink some hours into an absorbing story and experience the thrill of being batman.",

            "review_text": "Originally posted Sept 15 2009  gameaday-ish.blogspot.com   ...  Arkham is not tied to any specific property other than the characters than have populated the Batman universe for over 50 years. Seeking inspiration in all of the media that has come before, the game references the Christian Bale movies, the Tim Burton movies, all of the animated series and the comics themselves, weaving these details into a claustrophobic, atmospheric story.  Penned by animated series and comic creator Paul Dini, the pitfall found in Wolverine is avoided by casting voices from the animated series, namely Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker. As fully committed to the performances as Jackman, they create familiarity to fans of character without jeopardizing the verisimilitude of the presentation. Had Arkham been tied to Dark Knight, it may well suffer from some of the issues facing Wolverine.  The seemingly ubiquitous Unreal 3 engine makes a spectacular appearance, rendering large colorful worlds that appear open but are quite limited in scope. Once again, the decision to set AA on an island and solely within the facility grounds serves the game well, motivating the linear aspect of play.   I found it amusing that expositional scenes revealed through off camera radio transmissions are in full force in the game, as apparently that is a feature built into the engine. The animations for these sequences are identical to the ones uses in Gears.  What I found most striking in the difference between these very similar games was the presentation of the main character and their interaction with the environment through gameplay. Batman uses his familiar bag of tricks from his utility belt, resulting in a cavalcade of gadgets and upgrades. Platforming is restricted to using a grapple gun and a glide ability, referencing both the movies and the animated shows. Puzzles are integrated into a detective mode as Challenges left by the Riddler.   Combat is an integral part of the game and Batman’s combat is a far more nuanced and cerebral experience, playing much like a real-time Bruce Lee movie. Counters are used to intercept attacks, allowing the player to chain together attacks and build up multipliers, which unleash finishing moves. Strategy must be employed and it is a far more satisfying experience.  Against the odds, junior developer Rocksteady created a tour-du-force experience in AA, while Raven managed what appeared to be impossible prior to AA’s release: create a good comic book game. Wolverine is a very entertaining game but it pales in comparison to the masterwork that is Arkham Asylum.",

I say this because, slightly discounting Bryan Singer's excellent X-men film from 2000, Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins in 2005 was the first comic book adaption to deal with it's subject matter in an entirely adult way. And here we are again with Batman: Arkham Asylum, a slightly more comic book feel, but still a very dark tone and a very adult game.  This game is excellent. It's much more linear than later attempts and has a more platformer feel to it but that works fine. It's daring, it's cinematic and it's well written and designed. It's an excellent, silky-smooth game through and through and I believe it has earned it's place in video-game history, Batman or no.",

Fun boss-fights (although you won't believe how much I hate Poison Ivy, the hardest boss probably), Level design that still amazes me after all this time, (but I must say 'Arkham Mansion' has his confusing and problematic directions), Voice-over that brings back memories of the old tv series, and a very interesting story.  and if your going to skip right now and play the other ones (Arkham city or whatever) you are doing a bad decision, you won't regret playing this one, and it is a good way to learn the mechanics of the game for the next games.  10/10 'I salute my fallen enemy!﻿'",

The challenges keep me entertained even after I have finished the story, and the infinite challenges could be their own game in and of themselves. I have almost all those dang Riddler Trophies, some of which are really hard to find, and take some real patience to seek out. I have only completed the game in Easy mode, so I hope to play through it a couple more times in Normal and Hard mode.  PROS: -GREAT story and plot! -Voice acting is superb! I really love Mark Hamil's Joker, and it really makes this feel like a Batman game! -Music is AMAZING! It really adds tension and helps the situations feel more real. This is most apparent, to me, during the killer croc fight. -The SOUNDS in ths game are great! I can feel it in my gut every time I dislocate someone's elbow or snap their leg, and all the gadgets have great sound effects as well! -Great combat OVERALL. There are a few minor issues, but I can work around them. Combat really does take skill in this game. You have to have good timing and tactics. -Stealth mechanics are fun. I love being able to clear out a room of baddies without a single one seeing me, and there's always more than one way to complete a stealth mission. -Gadgets are fun to play around with. Batman has everything from remote control batarangs to explosive gel. The gadgets are all fun in their own way, and are really essential to completing stealth missions. -Movement is pretty good. I love the feel of gliding, and for some reason it's fun just running around and jumping over stuff. -I can easily plug in a controller and start playing without havingto adjust any settings (but I prefer keyboard controls). With a keyboard combat is much faster, and I can look around alot faster.  CONS: -BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME: Once you complete the story, there are no more goons to fight in the asylum. It makes sense in context with the story, but I would really like to be able to explore the Asylum AND fight some baddies. After the story is over, it becomes really boring to wander around looking for trophies. -While I may enjoy the combat overall, there are a few frustrations. Sometimes my counters seem to lag, or if the game goes into slow motion, sometimes I can never counter at all. Other than that combat is great! -Movement is fine, however there is very little precision. This is really obvious when you are trying to line up riddler trophy spray paint, which you have to look at from a specific place and at a specific angle. It is also apparent when you are trying to sneak around. Often it's hard for me to be sneaky when I keep bumbling around. I can work around this, however, so it's a minor complaint. -I have an XBox controller I plug in to let people who are not accostumed to keyboard control play. However, whenever I try playing with a controller, I find the controls clunky and very slow. It is much easier to play with a keyboard and mouse. This is another very minor complaint because I never use the controller if I can help it.  Overall I give this a 9/10. There are a few minor issues, but the good things far outweigh the bad!",

            "review_text": "I really love everything about this game. The story is fun and interesting, and it actually requires skill, timing, and strategy to complete the stealth missions. The challenges keep me entertained even after I have finished the story, and the infinite challenges could be their own game in and of themselves. I have almost all those dang Riddler Trophies, some of which are really hard to find, and take some real patience to seek out. I have only completed the game in Easy mode, so I hope to play through it a couple more times in Normal and Hard mode.  PROS: -GREAT story and plot! -Voice acting is superb! I really love Mark Hamil's Joker, and it really makes this feel like a Batman game! -Music is AMAZING! It really adds tension and helps the situations feel more real. This is most apparent, to me, during the killer croc fight. -The SOUNDS in ths game are great! I can feel it in my gut every time I dislocate someone's elbow or snap their leg, and all the gadgets have great sound effects as well! -Great combat OVERALL. There are a few minor issues, but I can work around them. Combat really does take skill in this game. You have to have good timing and tactics. -Stealth mechanics are fun. I love being able to clear out a room of baddies without a single one seeing me, and there's always more than one way to complete a stealth mission. -Gadgets are fun to play around with. Batman has everything from remote control batarangs to explosive gel. The gadgets are all fun in their own way, and are really essential to completing stealth missions. -Movement is pretty good. I love the feel of gliding, and for some reason it's fun just running around and jumping over stuff. -I can easily plug in a controller and start playing without havingto adjust any settings (but I prefer keyboard controls). With a keyboard combat is much faster, and I can look around alot faster.  CONS: -BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME: Once you complete the story, there are no more goons to fight in the asylum. It makes sense in context with the story, but I would really like to be able to explore the Asylum AND fight some baddies. After the story is over, it becomes really boring to wander around looking for trophies. -While I may enjoy the combat overall, there are a few frustrations. Sometimes my counters seem to lag, or if the game goes into slow motion, sometimes I can never counter at all. Other than that combat is great! -Movement is fine, however there is very little precision. This is really obvious when you are trying to line up riddler trophy spray paint, which you have to look at from a specific place and at a specific angle. It is also apparent when you are trying to sneak around. Often it's hard for me to be sneaky when I keep bumbling around. I can work around this, however, so it's a minor complaint. -I have an XBox controller I plug in to let people who are not accostumed to keyboard control play. However, whenever I try playing with a controller, I find the controls clunky and very slow. It is much easier to play with a keyboard and mouse. This is another very minor complaint because I never use the controller if I can help it.  Overall I give this a 9/10. There are a few minor issues, but the good things far outweigh the bad!",

I was a little lost due to being completely unknown to universe. I did some google about the story of Batman and things started to make a little sense. Game might become a bit tedious for some people as its is not completely linear, which I think would have been better if it was. Also it has these wierd bug on my 980Ti where it suffers from occassional frame dips like hiccups for split second. Don't see any fix as of now. Overall till now seems a decent game to start the series. Not that I am enjoying my time too much. Also a ted bit of repititiveness. Only recommending this game for its story for someone who wants to play other following sequels so that they don't get completely lost.  I am still playing through and will update my review later when I am done.",

This is an awesome experience to get to play this game, with the best graphics possible. It's basically like a virtual comic book, as he tries to investigate what is going on. Well worth every penny, whether it's on sale, or regular price. If you're a Batman fan, or of the mythology, you won't be disappointed, with the collection of villains you get to face.",

            "review_text": "Compared to the other games in this series, this is probably the shortest game but nonetheless awesome and exciting to play. I had some issue during installation though (Direct X 9 not installed and stuff but I got around that by installing some third party program). The game really puts you into the Dark Knight's shoes, going around investigating some stuff and beating up some baddies. Reasons to buy this game: 1.) If you love Batman, get it. -You finally get to be the Bat and do the stuff he does best, solving crime and serving justice (YAY!) 2.) The combat mechanics of the game are simple but challenging. -The combat mechanincs of the are really simple but challenging enough to have you thinking your next attack. Plus the combat is so fluid, you'll enjoy playing as much as watching the fight play out. 3.) The riddles are challenging and really satisfying to do. -I finished all the riddles and yeah, I feel pretty proud of myself for finishing all the riddles and yes, you do feel like the Bat when solving the riddles. Think like your enemy and you would know how to react ;) 4.) PC compatibility. -I played this game on a notebook with Intel Celeron (N2840 2.16 GHz) and 2GB ram. The game had some lag to it but I was still able to play it. So my notebook specs are pretty bad and I'm still able to run this game so yeah, as far being able to play this on low spec computers, the game wouuld still run okay. 5.) Challenge modes pack quite a challenge. -Even after you've finished the story mode, there are still some challange modes you could complete (like extra missions). So the game does not stop in the campaign and you could still relive those butt-kicking scenes over and over again.  So in the end is it worth it? Yes, and it is amazing. This game just set the standards of superhero games. In the Arkham series, this may be my favorite one (I have yet to play Arkha Knight but meh, I don't really expect much). I just hoped the campaign did not end so fast. So yes, I love this game as much as I love Batman. So yeah, buy it! *Now, to the Batcave!*",

Although, there are some sort of repetitive parts it is one of the best I've ever played. The intense story line evolves quite nicely towards the grant finale, there are lots of details in the game and the graphics are very nice. The combat system works fluently and the controls are mostly intuitive. However, if you play on a pc I'd recommend using a gamepad (such as a 360 controller for example) which makes things easier. [To beat the challenge mode as well as the entire game to 100% completion you really need to focus on combining your moves.]  It is easy to play but can be quite challenging at the same time - a really fun game to play!!!

If somebody can not run this on their pc, they are probably using stone computer from prehistoric age. Really, do not put negative review because you are grinch to buy a better computer. My game did not work first time after running it. I had to reinstall the new driver and everything works great. Batman is story focused action 3rd person and RPG game which will lead throughout whole game with dialogues. Story is what makes this game good. There is enough enemies to stay awake. 3rd person is something I needed to get used to. You are earning exp which you exchange for stronger kicks, gears and some useful skills. Game has lots of cutscenes, graphics is great, plenty to discover as you will be presented mysteries and discover more story around your opponents which are professional criminals, mutants and psychopaths, murderers. You will be travelling around the island of Arkham Asylum which is a big area where the doctors try to cure their patients which are incredibly dangerous. Game gets harder as you progress, it is not so hard on normal but sometimes I get beaten. There are boss fights awaiting you as well as stealth fights and you will uncover new skills after you progress some part of the story. It is Game of the Year for reason. Seriously.",
