Made by small team of developers, yet it still has humour, wishes, expectations and all emotions, which are present in our lives. Lets see in detail this short lovely game.  GAMEPLAY  + Cute animations + Good story design - Short time - Fullscreen is clunky  Animations and story was perfect. There were choices, I think my most favourite part was playing the Sunflower War (that joke was hilarious, I like, when authors are able to make fun of themselves).   Only negatives were a little short time and fullscreen resolution is not optimized well. But this negatives are just a small scratch on a perfect facade of the game.  CHARACTERS  + Vinty + Good actions are rewarded  I think everyone of us is a bit similar to Vinty. We desire for success, fame and respect, but we have to fight our everyday struggles. I like, that when I gave a chance to good action, I got rewarded. Thanks!  VISUALS  + Decent  By the visual side, game has no faults. Enjoyable, childish shoujo style. Suits this title well.  SOUNDTRACK  + Limited, yet fine  There are only few tracks, but they complete and enhance the atmosphere. Good work, even better, than some big studios.  SUMMARY  Without Within is a humble title, that deserves its score. Made by a small team, perfect idea from Invetmouse, other members did well too! Do you want to live one day as an artist or calligrapher? Well, here is your chance.  Strongly recommended.",

            "review_text": "Just finished this short, simple, but lovely VN.  The choices I made along my first playthrough turned to be the correct ones, but it's not something hard to achieve if you're not easily angered, or if you're not an  'I complain about things, then do nothing, becasue it's others fault, not mine of course'  person. I'm making too much out of it in fact. Just try every option.  So I tried the other options after successfully finishing the game.  The 'bad endings' felt a little rushed to me, and the real ending unfinished. But not less enjoyable because of it.  In fact the game has some good points of 'working-class/everyday/easy-to-understand' philosophy.  'Simple thoughts, nothing really new or that profound'  you could say about it, but are the simplest, most quotidian things the ones we pay less attention to, the ones we forget with ease. Quoting some lines from the game,  'I had forgotten the last time I found joy in [whatever you love doing]. (...) All I obsessed over was how much, or rather how little, people paid attention to my efforts.'  I ask to you, fellow reader, Have you ever forgot about the purpose on doing what you love to do?  No need to answer me in a comment, just answer yourself.  As a response to the negative reviews I've read, I quote something from the game again, 'I had every intention of tossing this game aside. I kept demanding excitement without offering an ounce of passion in return.  If I played my part, I might be able to discover so much more. '  It's short? Yes. It feels incomplete? It does. But it delivers a simple yet charming story, and the dev announces  here  that more of Vinty's adventures are planned for the future, along with some kind apologies about the game's length.  I almost forgot commenting, the soundtrack is cute, and it goes very well with the rest of the game.  I also found myself related to Vinty when she   buys the game just because how the shop's employee was gazing at her   lol.  I hope this review has been useful.  For the dev team, thanks for making this nice and lovely VN.",

Pros: -Funny/amusing -Short  Cons: -Short(whether this is a pro or a con really depends on how much time you want to spend) -Ending is a bit abrupt, though I think it fits the visual novel  I think the art is sort of cute, but I was a bit disappointed because I felt this visual novel had a lot of missed potential. It could have been better if it was longer imo. This VN is nothing amazing. Still, it's free and short. Considering this, can't really complain too much.

The game itself can be completed in, at most, a single hour (probably quicker, but I was live-streaming it when I played it). The art-style and music are all very nice (I really enjoy the title menu's music). Overall, the writting feels very natural and casual (there were a couple of areas that I thought sounded a little odd, but it wasn't anything large and is likely just me).  The only real negative I can say is that the ending is extremely abrupt and that there really is only one 'good' ending. You get a few situations where you have to make a choice between two options, and only one of them will actually progress the plot, as where the other will lead to a 'bad' ending immediately. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints for this game.  It's short and sweet, which is likely what it set out to be, and it's free. Definetly worth a playthrough on a rainy afternoon or a stay-at-home night.",

She seems like a loner from the way this game only shows her interacting with less than a handful of people. Princess Aria doesn't even sound that fun anyway!

What is there, is relatively good, however, the nature of this game was so forceful in demanding you make it's 'right' choices, that you are represented with a fail state, if you do not follow the games linear story.  The fail state is badly made, and deserves a retry segment button, so I don't have to go all the way to the start again, because the Load/Save system is usesless here.  I'd say it's a good start, especially due to it's stunning visuals, and good music, but all up it felt EXTREMELY lacking.  If, you make another game, I'd reccommend adding the following: Multiple choice that MATTERS Different endings A retry last checkpoint/choice button for the fail state More stills, and movement within them More than a singular character Extra songs And most importantly? Something that isn't a sequel.    If you do the above or even a measely quarter of it, you'll be more likely to gain more followers in the future, and I'd be more than happy, to try whatever new game you make.

I took 7 more minutes to read through the results of other choices, but they all end the game in about 10 lines if you choose them. Heck, one of the bad ends is almost exactly like the true end.   I'm fine with games made by small teams, but seriously, reuse some art assets and give me more to go on than 15 minutes or so of game that ends in some sort of bad end every single time. Also, it's fine to give the girl a fantasy, but could we have at least a tiny indication that she realizes her fantasy of being an INSANELY famous calligrapher is a little bit overblown?

Maybe you'll enjoy it. Since you don't have to pay, I suppose you won't lose much by trying it. It doesn't make me want to purchase the sequel.",
