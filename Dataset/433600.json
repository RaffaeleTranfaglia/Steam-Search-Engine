It is one of the first medival fighting games for the VIVE and it is actually pretty fun, if you can ignore some of its quirks. However not like many indie games on steam this developer really seems to care about his game. From what if have seen from the update history on the game updates are beeing release fairly often, so even if you aren't satisfied with the game at the beginning, it can still be, that these errors are removed. ATTENTION: in the former version of this game review, i accidently made a huge mitake: i downloaded a workshop objekt and thought, that it was part of the game- which lead me to believe, that the game isn't that good. I apologize to the DEV for this stupid mistake  Continuing with the review: Obviously the game isn't finished, however after i gave it another try i realised it isn't that bad.   Conclusion:Whoever is craving for another awsome VR RPG much like Vanishing realms then this game is for you",

I've been scooping up VR games like crazy and I expected this to be similar to Vanishing Realms, but it seems to be a rogue-like Isaac-like just as it claims, and it's a good one at that. I ripped off my headset and posted this review, and I'm going right back to it.  It's not VR for the sake of VR, it's a solid game augmented with what only VR can add to a game. I've never met the devs, and I paid for it with my cold hard cash and mark my words you'll be seeing my 'time played' go up every time you come back to this review.",

            "review_text": "I would highly recommend going room scale with it gives the game an entirely different feel and just might give you a bit of a workout hopping around like mad to avoid the boss hits.   Almost like your very own dungeon set your lording over as you go through, you can adjust the floor height to about mid waist and has that old school zelda dungeon feel.   When I first tried the full scale something felt off to me, and when I tried it again today at room scale all the mechanics made a lot more sense, the difficulty was greater and I was moving around more.   Once you get to floor 4 things start to get interestingly hectic, developer seems genuinely interested in feedback and bringing out a good product.  ",

            "review_text": "This is a new review after playing A Legend of Luca more and in light of the negative reviews that this game does not deserve.   1. The game lives up to the permadeath genre. If you die you have to start over.  2. Procedural dungeons (if that is what it is called) but not in the sense that the rooms will change their shape. They have different mobs in them each time or no mobs at all. They will have loot in them or no loot at all. They will have more or less obstacles in them or none at all. 3. You have to play the game to actually get to the harder levels/Mobs. I didn't find it 'easy' to kill all of the mobs that I encountered. Easy means yo unever get hurt. There were some cases where I have only on heart life left.  4. There is no vender right now but at tis point you don't need one. Getting all the weapons is work enough. Maybe after the developer adds more levels or whatever he will add a vender. A vender would only make sense if there were MP or if it was an MMO of sorts.  5. I encountered no bugs except teleporting outside of a wall before and that was really my fault getting too worked up fighting a boss. That is a minor thing to me.  6. The bosses are not easy to fight at higher levels. I dare anyone to just stand there and see how many hits you take before death. I am sure the developer will add more models perhaps with different abilities.  7. It is a dungeon crawler if that is what you call these games. Why are we not complaining about other games? A lot of people buy the pixel junk. Why is a dungeon crawler boring now....in VR? This is by far a better expereince than that junk and gives you a VR world to play in. That in itself is worth the modest price.  Any VR Game imo is worth 10x its price. Can you make a game? Do you have an unlimited supply of cash on hand. Most of tehse VR devs are loners.   8. Originality: Any VR game out now is original unless it bit off another VR game. I see nothing here doing that. To fill you in on the models and I don't know the story here: Developers can buy premade models to use and put them in their games. That is cost effective and sensible since there are obviously a lot of refund junkies out here and especcially on Steam. So you may see similar or the same models in games of teh same genre. Wow !! I can't beleieve developers want to save money to get us out a game to play. So expect more of that especially games using Unreal 4 engine.  VR in the context we have now is new so give the developers a break. These are not meant to be AAA titles. This game is by far not junk or unworthy of playing. The music is not good for it ( the dev said he is trying to change that) so shut it off and play your own. I actually prefer not to play with any music.   9. Roguelike game: This fits it pretty much. different dungeons every run, permadeath, etc. What more do you want form a new VR game with a very small team?   Again I don't like permadeath games but I am actually enjoying this the more I play. Even if I get only 10 hours of gameplay it is worth the price to me. That at least is better than 1 hour trash play from a cheap game that offers no fun at all or repeats what another game is doing. Can anyone say arcade shooters?  That is my humble but serious review. I personally don't think the negatives are warrented here. Especially if you like dungeon crawlers. I really don't know what people what these days. Especially in a new type of gaming (with today's tech). AAA titles will come but if we keep shafting these guys the VIVE will take a backseat. More people can't do room-scale than those who can. I am sure of that in my mind. You decide the future of us.  Update: As of today The Legend of Luca is still recommended. The develeper has been actively updating the game and it is even better today than when first released. More loot, various monsters added, harder challenge as you move up levels, dangerous rooms, shop keeper is present to grab whatever is for sale, more chests and cool weapons. This game deserves some love from us VR users. More fun to me than the wave shooters and games we have out now. The room scale is used quite well. Buy it and Enjoy it for what it is. A randomly generated rogue like game.",

            "review_text": "Prelude: Back in July 2016 I had purchased this game, played it, reviewed it, gave it a thumbs down, and refunded the game.  I first played this game and was on the fence about giving it a thumbs up or thumbs down. Then the developer got in contact with me, asked for my input about some of the negatives about the game, and made some changes that directly responded to my complaints. I had actually refunded the game after writing my review. I have since re-purchased the game, replayed it, and am now changing my review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up.   If you are unsure about buying this game this is my recommendation: This is a rouge-like action RPG VR version of the Legend of Zelda with a developer who cares about his project and the community more than anyone I have ever seen. If that sounds like something you would like, then get this game. If you're debating wether or not you want this game, take a chance on this guy and let's show the developers out there that it pays off to listen to your community and to keep providing updates on a regular basis. Chances are if there are things about this game that you don't like, you'll be able to get in the forums, and if the community agrees with you, it will change. I think the dev deserves support for that!  --------------Below is my original review----------------    I really like the premise of this game but 3 things that may sound trivial really kill this game for me.   1) The size of your 'hand' is so small you can't help but laugh. It should probably be about 150% to 175% of the size it is now. Either change hand size, or just remove it and give me the weapon like Vanishing Realms does.   2) The music is not done well. It really breaks immersion when you run around a fantasy setting with metal playing. I turned the music off but it's just too quite when you do that. I guess some people like the metal (Tenacious D, for example) but maybe provide an option to have some fantasitcal type of music as well with the option to choose which music to use.   3) The outdoor skybox seems really weird. Am I just in a maze outside? Why not just climb up and traverse the walls then? Why is there an elevator at the end of the level? Where does it go? I would feel like I was in a dungeon if the dungeon had a ceiling. Would also make it feel more intense (which is what the metal music is trying to accomplish, i think).  This game is fun and has a lot of replayability (probably), and the combat is fun. I just can't give this a thumbs up with the music as it makes me not want to play. If you think a straight up combat hack and slash version of Vanishing Realms set to metal music would be fun, then buy this game. In it's current state I will not be recommending it though.",

            "review_text": "If you are looking to play a VR equivalent to Binding of Isaac...look somewhere else. That game may or may not exist yet, but it certainly is not this game.   The basic concept is similar, you are a non-descript hero who has been tasked by a goddess to travel through a dungeon to collect weapons of power in order to save the world. Throughout this dungeon you meet a range of villainous creatures who wish for you to die while exploring randomly generated rooms and collecting loot to grow stronger in the hope that you can defeat the final boss in the end.  It has a lot of promise to it, but sadly fails in its execution. Let me start on the enemy design, while there are quite a few different creatures, many of them do not have any artistic link to each other and just feel out of place, awkwardly throwing you out of any immersion. These enemies will then be able to either throw fast moving projectiles at you, or slam their faces into your chest. Within the enemy range exists a couple charging enemies which can frustrate as they are capable of crossing an entire room within a second, give no warning of their attack, and deal damage by standing ontop of you.   This brings me onto the combat which is very much lacking. I understand that vr is new, and what you should do with it is not always clear, but by having a melee system where you are unable to block and enemies can damage you simply by walking into you, you make melee weapons almost useless and uncomfortable to use. Ranged weapons are better but also have a few awkward kinks such as the bow forcing you to hold your controller in a different position to the wand. That sounds logical until you realise that you will be dual wielding weapons and as such will now have one hand trying to aim pointed forwards and one arm trying to aim while pointing upwards...this can lead to the system feeling clunky.   The level generation has its own issues as enemies can spawn in regions you cannot enter and so have to have their location guessed as you awkwardly stand over an obstacle. Or you could have the ever so fun event where an enemy is randomly placed ontop of the entrance to a region so the instant you try to take in your surroundings you find your health draining away to an enemy that you cannot see as it is currently situated inside of your chest.   It's difficulty scale has issues as well, you will rarely find yourself struggling for health or anything really until the 4th floor where enemies get a sudden boost in power and will annihilate you via seemingly undodgeable attacks.   Just a personal pet peeve here, I mentioned earlier that some of the enemies do not match each other's art styles...well that is an issue throughout the game, If you go through the screenshots you may notice this but many of the assets have wildly varying quality. Some have detailed textures (doors, enemies, weapons etc) while others have very blurry and vague textures. Some have very dark creepy looks while other things just look derpy and lighthearted as if they had been taken from a children's game. Then there is the skybox...I would advise removing the skybox and replacing it with a ceiling. When you have a very cartoony style game, it is not a good idea to set what seems to be a low resolution picture of some clouds as the skybox.  Now I have ranted a bit on its negatives, but it does have some upsides. You always get one new weapon per floor which helps to add in some variety to the combat. The automatic minimap is very helpful for navigating the similar looking rooms. Outside of some janky parts the controls do work fairly well, teleporting rarely breaks, door movement is easy (you just cannot get too close to them or else that breaks), firing weapons outside of active abilities (Which I will not mention because outside of one throwable axe I could barely even tell what they did) feels mostly natural. Some people have mentioned that they dislike the soundtrack...but I have a soft spot for the sound of a guitar and as such the music was quite enjoyable for me, at least as background noise.  In summary, this game does do what it says it will do. It offers a VR rogue light. Does it offer a good one? No, not really, I couldn't get over its flaws enough to actually enjoy myself. I am not one to forgive all of the flaws within a game just because it is VR. Maybe after an AI overhaul and a lot of changes to the melee combat system this could be a good game. But in its current state is is by no means worth how much it costs and I would not advise buying it unless it was on on 50% sale.",
