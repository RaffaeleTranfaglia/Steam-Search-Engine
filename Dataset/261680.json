    "description": "Enter the pages of the hand painted world of Journal. A journey through the life of a young and troubled girl as she tries to face up to the choices and responsibilities that come with childhood. An experience that questions the reliability of how we choose to remember events and explores the truths hidden within our dreams.",

            "review_text": "I will admit it: at first, I didn't like Journal. The main character comes across as an unlikable narrator. As other negative reviews have mentioned, she steals, lies, and hurts her friends. It's hard to find anything to like about her as you begin her story.   But then the experience broadens, and you begin to see some of the reasons why she is making poor choices. One of the girl's regrettable experiences hit home so much that I was emotionally jarred. Perhaps because I was also once a teenage girl, I found myself relating heavily to her story. You watch as she struggles through the realities of divorce, relationships, death, and the daily nonsense of life. It is an extremely personal tale, and I was floored by what the game achieved. I could have easily been that girl, through some of the ways she related to others and the choices she made. I didn't like myself then, and the girl in the game doesn't like herself now. Journal is in some ways a tragic work. How much you like the game will possibly depend on how much you relate to her and her journey.   There are some minor flaws in the experience. It can be difficult at times to determine where the next conversation trigger is, so that you may talk to some individuals multiple times fruitlessly, trying to figure out what you're supposed to do. You will wander over the same settings again and again, although this is accomplished at a pretty brisk pace that never feels too cumbersome. Some of the dialoge choices could be clearer; at times, I was unsure what my character was getting ready to communicate by the options.   Still, for the flaws, I absolutely recommend Journal. It blends painful realism with touches of imagination that create a story that can stun you in the accomplishment of its narrative arc. I applaud Locked Door Puzzle for what they've made: Journal is a piece of art.",

            "review_text": "The game provides us with some interesting situations, ranging from the social interactions with peers, to conversations with a priest, the deceased and a homeless person. We get a more or less subtle view into each of their lives, which adds up to a bigger picture. A bigger picture of life as a hardship. The human condition, if you will. Especially in the time as a teenager. Insecurity, stress, insufferable amounts of complexes and general frailty - when it comes to the need of being accepted by the people around you - are things which are prominent in the years of being a teenager; in the years of being at all, to be honest. Where the desperate attention seeking can spring into action actions which in retrospect can be seen as abhorrent. But with a little bit of care, consideration, empathy, with a little bit of knowledge and insight into a persons motivations, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THESE THINGS, understanding these idiosyncrasies can be much easier. The person being a '♥♥♥♥♥' can at the same time at home deal with angry parents, destructive parents, alcoholic parents, whatever concoction of behaviorism you can imagine and thereby themselves become a person like their parent, for the simple reason of learning behavior from your surrounding. A depressed, absent-minded mother who blames you for her stress and angst, and a father who left you stranded with her will surely make you desperate for attention, in whatever way possible, especially when you're falling out with your friends, or the people you assumed were your friends. This is the case of our protagonist. Making her actions understandable, as I've seen people think otherwise.   We follow our maincharacter through a hodgepodge of a timeline, where we often get to see the consequences of something she'd done wrong. As in cheating on a test, stealing a snow globe and breaking a window and blaming it on her friend. This is where we need to get the notion of what a game 'SHOULD' be out of our head. We don't have a say in these things, we are merely a witness. Sure, we control everything but we're not really in control. We are watching everything unfold in front of us without any say. For once I find this positive. It's a personal story, why should the player interject their own personality, morality or will? Why plaster your face onto a character when it's clearly not meant to be that way? Why forcefully demand the relatability of everything any character does, that's why the personality of most gamecharacters are nonexistent. Why are we afraid of people not being like us? Let this game be an expansion of your view of people. Why not let a character be itself, and then the analysing could be of interest.  And this is where my point is to some critique I've seen for the game. This game is not about trying to let you choose how to handle a situation, it's showing you the situation of this particular teenage girl. It's showing you the aftermath of some regrettable actions. It's showing you how it affects a person, how guilty a person can feel because of a mistake they barely had any real reason behind. And how your peers and upper echelons shame you because of these mistakes. It show's you the protagonist being shunned by friends and family because of silly mistakes, and the fact that you feel the need to steer her actions lets you know that the game is doing what it intends to do.   The stereotypical feel of the characters in this game is because they are real characteristics of real people. They are very common issues, personality types, and very typical scenarios for people to be in. The thing about putting this in a game is to illustrate it somehow, and get an outlet for these things you think about, as you do. To get past things. To put things into perspective. It's all there, you just need to look close enough. The game doesn't hit you in the face with its messages, or it's insights. But it's all there. From the carnival stories, the distorted mirrors of better times, memories being forgotten of the people that passed, the lying lion who did anything just to get another bite of food - in reality a metaphor for attention? I need to play it again, you should play it, think about it. Discuss it. I wish I wasn't as tired as I am right now, I don't think I can do the game justice. It's not the most beautiful game, not the most intricate, not the most interesting, but it has its moments. It's a game that tries to give us something, more than just a couple hours of time spent. I will always pay for a game with a good concept, a game that tries to do something interesting. This game certainly did, even though it may have been too much to actually get across in the best way possible. But I think most of it is already there, the teenage hardships, the tragedy of selfishness, the selfish social interaction, the shallowness of sociality, the subtle character motivations which can be parallelled with our lives. It did what it set out to do, a shame it didn't get more leeway to express this in a much grander and more beautiful way, but what we see is what we get, and what we got was good enough for a purchase, also for probably more than one playthrough.   I think I got across what I wanted to say, albeit clumsily and badly, but I did it.",

Interesting concept, nice visuals, good voice acting that was not used enough (only important parts, which are written in the Journal, are spoken by one actress), short story with a very funny alternate ending (that reminded me of Portal 1 and 2's ending songs).  The bad part? The story is not very well written, so the ending feels like it was thrown in for dramatic purposes.  If you are looking for something different and short and don't mind a flawed diamond, make sure you buy this (on a sale).",

The adventure begins on her journey to reclaim her lost pages or so she believes.  On this journey, I met her friends, parents, a love interest &amp; other colorful folks, all in her wistful hope to locate what exactly happened to her journal pages. And surely, the pages, the words themselves start to come together. As the days pass, the journal starts to re-assemble itself.  The more I learn of the life surrounding the nameless protagonist, the sadder I feel. Maybe she isn’t trying to remember at all. Maybe she wants to forget &amp; create something anew…  End of entry",

            "review_text": "First, comparing this game, Journal, to Richard Perrin's previously popular game, Kairo, is to compare fire to ice. Not as opposites so much, as simply defying comparison. Beyond an obvious regard for thinking-gamers, please consider them seperately when deciding on the selection of either.  If at first we think to compare this (apparently unnamed) protaganist to our own experiences, we soon find out how wrong we are. While there are, no doubt, some young lives closely matching that in this game (perhaps every life has some immediate comparisons) what makes this game MOST remarkable is that it starts out to seem anything BUT. Just a young girl, misunderstood as are most people. By gradual steps (or more frequently, sudden starts and stops), we find out she is NOT us, and therefore, if we expected validation, we may begin to lose faith in this game. But if we continue, we find out in surprising reveals (conversations, experiences &amp; titular journal entries) that inwardly she may be almost exactly like us, no matter our age, background or gender. NO life is truly ordinary. Or easy.  But this game's real theme is regret. Choices have, not so much results, but consequences. Our 'heroine' frequently laments her choices, while other characters, in word and act, confirm the irreversable, often heartbreaking, permanence of 'The Wrong Choice' made. There is no SAVE.  The artwork was strategiclly minimalistic, changing to become more haunted to match our protaganist's life. I don't recall much sunshine (if any, but this IS supposed to be the UK.) Rain was part of the story, as were the gritty streets and coffee-cup rings on some 'pages'. Temporary barriers between locations were made 'young girl's life' obvious, including a band-aid. The 'busy' dialog was effective and amusing. Aesthetically, a very pleasing game.  The stories built into the game were a wonderful, welcome touch, though never explained specifically. Did they even exist 'in story'? Perhaps leaving them, and their source (mostly) ambiguous, except quite probably from our heroine's subconscious, was more interesting in retrospect. Particularly if they were driven additionally by interest in her friend Trevor and his oft-mentioned comic. If indeed retrospect is to be considered in our analysis and/or appreciation, we may find this game to be absolutely filled with subtle (and not) hints and clues. Dare I say, almost in a David Lynchian sense? (Please understand, 'Journal' is NO 'Mulholland Drive'.) This game, like many great ones, may truly be better appreciated AFTER completion.  It had some moments that, at the time, felt like minor flaws in the game. Now I'm not so sure. Is something that only SEEMS like a flaw less a flaw, despite having taken us momentarily out of the game? I can't go into detail about either of the two (spoilers) I noticed, but they were moments where cause and effect were reversed. Something happened that, at the time, made no sense. But when the reason was learned minutes later it seemed that, if characters had been encountered in a different sequence, actions would have felt to have occured normally. Having finished the game, I just don't know anymore, except that it seemed unfortunate at the time. Perhaps it was nothing more than a plot device. Foreshadowing maybe, or a jaring of our comfort zone. Or I got the game sequence reversed by selecting the wrong topics from the wrong people in the wrong order.  There was one instance that seemed otherwise flawed. The protaganist went to talk to a teacher about a family member, but when that person is selected as the 'topic', there was no discussion available. But as far as I could tell it had no major impact, except to (regretably) draw notice. Perhaps the intent WAS to say nothing, but that might have been better indicated.  Also, I wish there had been a way (other than rapid spacebars) to avoid repetative dialog, if desired. (Perhaps a color change if nothing was different since prior selecting.) And I'm not sure why we were allowed to continue going into places that no longer had importance (particularly the Post Office, which had its brief moment of signifigance.) Perhaps simply to intensify the game-critical feeling of 'choice'. The promised opening of the package never happened, and as such felt forgotten in the story. A contrivance, essentially, but relatively minor (not even important enough to be considered 'spoiler'.) Perhaps other player choices would have had more satisfying, or complete, results. Another was far less minor (i.e.: 'spoiler' level), but just as abandoned. Also, there may be players unhappy about the lack of a SAVE feature. Well, life is like that.   I'm glad I played it.   As with MANY Steam games, offline play and/or play-time is ignored. PLEASE offer corrections as appropriate. (4NQfam)",

            "review_text": "This game was actually somewhat frustrating for me to play. Maybe this experience is my own, and nobody else has had any of these problems, but I felt that I should share nonetheless. The story is definitely the most appealing part of the game, but the design behind it is really lacking. Most of it is played through text, and sometimes you'll have to respond to what people have to say. You'll normally be given a couple of choices. Sometimes it's hard to know what choice you pick is going to result in what actually happens. The options are sometimes just vague one word descriptors, and aren't the easiest to follow as to what your character is going to do or say next. This isn't like Mass Effect where it'll give you a diagrahm showcasing which ones are your good and bad choices, which makes it a lot easier to know which route your going in the game. Instead, the options in this game are placed right next to each other with no kind of color indication or anything to specify which one's your 'good' choice, and which one's your 'bad' choice. Maybe I'm just spoiled by how other games have designed their games, but it felt like there could have bee some kind of implementation of that in this.  This game also has its fair share of backtracking. You have to talk to everyone (or at least it feels like you have to talk to everyone) if you want to advance the game, and sometimes if you do things out of order (like I guess I must have done...?) then this results in you going around and talking to EVERYBODY AGAIN and going through all the dialogue options AGAIN until you finally find the right person you needed to talk to. Even then sometimes it feels as if you have to talk to some of the characters twice, because for some reason it seems as if there was a dialogue option that wasn't there the first time, unless I'm just mistaken.  Also, there was a point in the game where I made a mistake in my choices, but I couldn't go back because the game doesn't have a save system. You can't save and load from wherever you want, instead the game saves and loads based on checkpoints. It would have taken me a few minutes to get back and make the change I wanted by replaying that certain section, but if the game utilized a normal save system, that mistake easily could have been avoided.  There was also this strange graphical glitch where the entirety of the text was replaced with these rotating and shifting characters that looked like the text was glitching out to the n'th degree. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it happened in a few areas of the game, and with dialogue that I don't think I was supposed to miss, so it must have been some kind of glitch. Game breaking, no, but definitely something that was very confusing, and ultimately just led to more frustration.  All in all, this game feels very sloppy and poorly designed which broke my immersion into it about halfway through. This made me frustrated and not really care much about the story, which is what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine if a game is all story (I loved Gone Home), but this art style and engine were not the best route to accomplish the story they wanted to tell. There could have been a much better way to tell this story. Overall, if you think the game looks like it has an interesting story, pick it up when it's cheap. Otherwise, give this one a pass.",

I think it's worthy of recommendation. This recommendation does, however, come with a caveat.  The game, to me, was very disjointed. It was as if every day's journal entry was completely unrelated to any others. It also seemed that despite the choices made and what was said during some of the many conversations throughout, the outcomes seemed a bit unexpected and almost illogical. I found I was often confused when, as the protagonist I would be having a seemingly pleasant conversation with someone only to find I was suddenly forced to defend myself over something that was not apparent. But I guess, after thinking about it more, maybe that's one of the themes of this game... not everything happens as expected.  In the end, you do sort of find out, in an abrupt sort of way, the premise for the game itself and why some things happened the way they did. It still doesn't explain everything of course. I was still very moved (to tears) by the ending as it comes almost out of the blue and it hits you like a ton of bricks, but I was also still a bit confused with some of the prior events since they did seem very mashed together.  Aside from the story, I like the graphic style used. The voice acting was top notch and helped me connect a bit more with the main character. The music was also very well done.  So once again... I do recommend this game, but you really do have to play it without expectations. It is still a touching story.",
