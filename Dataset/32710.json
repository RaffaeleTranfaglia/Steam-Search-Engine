            "review_text": "Yes, its dated. Yes, some report glitches... but its pretty fun. Kind of reminds of a sim/rts/fps cross the way it plays a little. I think the game captures the team strategy thing (leading your group of tanks to victory etc - kinda like playing madden football but tossing a bomb is a bit more dramtic :) )  Get it because your a tank buff and old graphics don't automatically equate to 'no good' - sometimes old games with old graphics completely hold their ground when newer competing products comeout... some stay on top for decades - so you never know.   I played this long enough to know its pretty cool - and due to lower graphics - you're out in the open more often - and you must use the terrain - period - I like that bit... :) Remember - you're getting an old game here - so unless you really dig tank sims, you might want something more eye-candyish... this is - get in - there are bad guys there, here are your guys - here is the terrain - good luck soldier! LOL - Some days - thats just what the doctor ordered...or general - whatever",
