            "review_text": "I don't normally write game reviews, as most of the games I've purchased have either been somewhat satisfactory or worth the price, but let me just say that the praise this game is receiving is totally off. I tried playing this with my girlfriend, and we really tried giving it a chance, but between the clunky controls, chuggy framerate (my machine runs DOOM, MGS 5, Vive games, etc, on highest settings), bad performances, and generally boring gameplay, I can't say I would ever recommend it. If you want a scary 3rd person game, there are plenty of options better than this. In a nutshell, this is overpriced amateur hour.  The easy-to-read version of my review for Zeux:  bad controls, bad framerate, bad acting, boring, overpriced.",

Pros: - Interesting story - Great atmosphere of the woods - MUSIC  Cons: - Animations - HW optimalization  It reminds me of Alan Wake without the shooting parts",

If you like walking Horror(ish) sim and like norse. Buy it. little short, not that hard to collect stuff, thought it was pretty much straight forward.  but a game from my home country after all and it does it good. I loved it!  Keep it up.",

You will come across some interesting monsters/creatures, but you can't fight back. You can only use a flashlight (with thankfully no battery life to deal with) even thought the character comes across many swords and other weapons.   I'm a bit burned out in this type of game after playing Gone Home, Dear Ester, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Kholot, etc and was expecting a bit more. I was sold on the original trailer and avoided reviews as to not spoil the game for myself.  With that said, you may like It and should give it a try at least.",
