            "review_text": "I spotted the derelict ship, known by the local STALKER's as Skadovsk, in the distance. A wave of hope passed over me. The Zone was cruel, unforgiving, and merciless. With the sky growing darker every second, the tension and anxiety building up, I made the final sprint to the Skadovsk. It was difficult to see at this point, with only the silhouettes of dead trees and abandoned machinery to guide my way. My flashlight had ran out of battery, along with my PDA. Navigation was close to impossible. I could feel the Zone closing in, with the sounds of the unnatural creatures this unholy place has birthed echoing in the darkness. I may have a weapon - however, it was badly damaged, and my single magazine of ammunition wouldn't do me much good, as my gun was unreliable and often jammed or malfunctioned. No prayer could change the fact that I was a walking meal for these creatures. Creatures, whose shimmering eyes you could see in the distance with no visible body, speeding across your vision. Whatever unnatural cloaking the Zone has given them, they could attack from any direction. I wasn't going to let them get that chance. The Skadvosk was near, now. I'm getting exhausted. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. I had used my last bandage after getting shot by a bandit, if I wanted to survive, I had to get inside. Just as I approached the gaping hole in the hull of the ship, those piercing yellow eyes appeared in a cluster of dead grass. The eyes that followed me, watching me, waiting for me to slip up before it attacks. It was all I could see, the rest of the world was encompassed in a miserable darkness that could strike fear into a fearless man. Just as I had stepped inside the broken hull, sprinting with my last burst of stamina to the sealed door, ear-piercing shots were heard above me, along with the heart warming Russian insults being directed at the creature that was just hunting me. Stepping in the ship, closing the door behind me, I quickly unloaded my haul to Beard, the bartender and trader. The weight lifted from my shoulders, I purchased some Bread and Vodka with my newly acquired Rubles, and sat around the table, listening to my fellow STALKER's tell the tales of their own Misery.",

            "review_text": "An absolutely amazing game with an incredibly oppressive and bleak atmosphere. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, there was another explosion in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, an explosion that left the surrounding environment altered in ways that defy scienfitic explanation. The area is now filled to the brim with deadly physics defying anomalies, countless pockets of radiation and incredibly lethal mutants. The area is simply referred to as 'The Zone'.   Those that explore the zone, in search of valuable artifacts spawned from the mysterious anomalies, are called Stalkers. You are one of them. Or rather, you pose as one.   You are in fact a Ukranian army major, covertly entering the zone to investigate a lost helicopter squadron sent in to conduct reconnaissance in the zone. To accomplish your mission, you need to make allies with other stalkers and with their aid make your way towards the city of Pripyat and find out what exactly happened to the helicopters and their crews.   Of course, there's also hostile humans to contend with, ranging from bandits, brain fried zombies (Still capable of using their guns) and foreign mercenaries. You also have some degree of choice in which faction to align yourself with and every side mission you complete (Or don't) have an impact on the epilogue endings of the game. It is very much worth it to complete every side mission, for that reason but also because a lot of the best moments in the game happen during them.   The game is very survival focused, with a large emphasis on resource and inventory management. It also has a hunger mechanic, which adds flavor without in any way becoming overbearing. There's a real time passage of time (At a factor of 1 minute per 3 seconds or so), various weather conditions and there's also recurring 'Emissions', which are essentially storms that turn the entire world red and fry your brain unless you take cover inside a solid structure.   There's quite a lot of weapons and armors to acquire and many ways to upgrade them to improve your survivability. You can also equip artifacts to boost various attributes, like improved healing rate, increased endurance or resistance against radiation.   I personally find that the equipment progression curve is a bit uneven, with the player finding equipment early on that's good to stick with nearly all the way to the end game. The feeling of being outmatched and outgunned, which was prevalent for a large part of the first two games, is much rarer in this installment. That's not to say that the game is easy, because it certainly isn't. Later in the game, you very much want to stick to the biggest guns you've got and bring as much armor piercing ammunition as you can.   But it lacks the initial desperation, trying to scrounge for decent gear, which made the beginning of the first two games so frustrating, but also exciting. This also has the effect of making pistols somewhat useless, which is a shame, because there is quite a few of them. But, as far as the story is concerned, it makes sense to not have terrible equipment from the outset.   This is still the best installment in the series, due to it's gameplay refinements and focus on a handful of large open areas rather than multiple smaller maps. I do however think the environment design of the first game is superior, but it's entirely possible that that is simply nostalgia speaking. I just felt that each area in the first game introduced something new, while the 3 large areas of Call of Prypyat feel a bit more sparse and predictable. I do miss the beginners area of the Cordon (Rookie Village, Railway Bridge), the claustrophobic streets. alleys and railways of the Wild Territory (Exploring this in a thunderstorm is amazing), the absolutely terrifying Bloodsucker village and the city of Pripyat itself (And the locations you find there).  Really, what I'm saying is play all of them.",

That is, a living world that can, and will, probably kill you. Alot. But more importantly, especially with the MISERY mod, the Zone feels like the type of place that will go on with or without you. You aren't some superpowered hero, you're an underfunded schmuck with scavenged gear and a job to do. Given the setting of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, it shouldn't be any other way. Verdict: Definitely give it a shot. And then install MISERY, and give it another 4 or 5.",
