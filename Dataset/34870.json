            "review_text": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a first person shooter that focuses on stealth and sniping and presents itself with quite a couple of improvements over the 2011-released prequel.  The story is stereotypical modern first person shooter bla bla. Terrorists try to obtain a weapon of mass destruction and you have to stop them before they get the chance to use it... so, really exciting stuff there. While the story is as generic as it can be, the storytelling and the dialogues, combined with the actual gameplay, work out surprisingly well and keep things going without every really boring you to death.  S:GW2 is based on the CryEngine 3 (the same engine used for Crysis 3) and while the original game already looked fairly decent, S:GW2 made an even bigger step forward towards visual quality. The texture detail, lighting and level design of the different locations made me stand still and just look around for a bit more than once.  Along with the enhanced visuals, the gameplay mechanics also greatly improved. The AI in the prequel was a horrible pain as enemies would spot you through walls or over a distance of hundreds of meters. Thankfully, the AI was completely re-done for S:GW2, so enemies behave like they should and also show some actual intelligence as, depending on the area, they will try to flank you from all sides or hide behind cover. Additionally, if you break the line of sight or hide in foliage, they will start searching for you.  Each of the 'hotspot' areas in the levels provide you with one or more overwatch spots from which you can safely identify your targets and take them out either one by one, 2 with one bullet if they stand in line or even an entire group if you shoot a grenade on one of the enemy's belts. Alternatively, you can also get closer and take them out either with your knife or your silenced sidearm and if you want to be a real Ghost, you just sneak past them so they will never know you were there.  As the enviroments change, you will have to utilize your thermal or night vision to progress safely and spot your enemies. While this is a nice gimmick and the night vision is often required in really dark areas, I barely used the thermal vision, though it can help spot enemies that blend into the enviroment or are covered by obstacles. The visions are also pretty much the only gadgets you have and while you get C4 charges during certain key points in the game, it feels somewhat lame to not be able to place Claymore mines and lure enemies into them. Or just blow them up with frag grenades.  While the prequel had some action-heavy levels where you actually went head-on towards your enemies and mowed them down with your combat rifles, S:GW2 doesn't feature something like that at all. You have to stick with your sniper rifle as your primary weapon at all times and while the game actually is called 'Sniper', I feel like this strict sniper rifle-only thing killed a bit of the gameplay dynamic and possible replayability of the game as it eliminates the option for the player to replay a level and, instead of silently sniping the enemies, just going nuts with an assault rifle and pumping bullets into everything that moves.  I tried to be as stealthy as possible, so the base campaign took me around 6.5 hours to beat. The Siberian Strike DLC, which consists of 3 fairly lengthy levels, added another 2.5 hours on top of it. While a couple people seem to be still playing the multiplayer mode, I can't comment on that as I was never able to join a server and gave up after dozens of tries and a couple attempts to fix it.  All in all, S:GW2 is a huge improvement over the sequel and seeing what turds City Interactive has produced in the past (prior to S:GW), it's good to see that they can do something decent for a change. If they keep up this level of quality, I might eventually start looking forward to their upcoming games again.  If you're looking for a decent and good-looking sniper experience, make sure to give S:GW 2 a shot (A shot - get it? Because it's a sniper game... hahahaha. Ah, nevermind).",

            "review_text": "Heyyo, it's a pretty decent game tbh. It's not a AAA Game like Sniper Elite series (The WWII sniper game by Rebellion) but it definitely holds its own. :)  The sniping? Well, since this is a sniper game? I guess that should be discussed first heh. The game takes into account bullet drop, wind direction, stance, elevation and stamina (how many beats per minute your heart is doing) so the mechanics are all there ok. The bullet cam is very much like Sniper Elite, but no model damage on the enemies. They just flop over. There's also the hold shift to slow down time and make it feel more movie-like and make it easier to hit moving targets. If you sit in sniper/scope mode long enough? The game gives you a little red circle to show where the bullet will hit and highlight when ontop of an enemy... so as a sniper game? It's good... but Sniper Elite feels more rewarding when you land a shot since you see what kind of damage you're doing.  It has a decent enough storyline... Quite generic tbh but it was good enough for me to want to finish the game.  The voice acting is also nothing flattering but works good enough to make me want to finish the game.  The Gameplay? Eh, after playing Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2? Gameplay isn't as good as those games. There's no disguises and trying to sneak around... the campaign is extremely scripted where you spend most of it doing exactly what your spotter tells you to do or you die.. speaking of which? Once enemies start hunting for you? The AI will definitely 360 no-scope you at close range. Super annoying when I try to ambush them and as soon as they rush through a doorway? Bullets hit me before their character turns around and I'm dead... so that's seriously annoying lol.  The graphics? They're pretty darn good, definitely not the best on Cryengine but I'd say a step above State of Decay (another good game built on Cryengine).  The music? Eh, I think there's only three or four songs for the complete game as most maps feature the same songs... They're ok I guess.  Sound effects? Well? Since most of the game you're only using about three different guns (silenced pistol, silenced sniper rifle and a long range silenced sniper rifle) for the whole game? There isn't that much variety in sound effects. The sounds that are there are pretty good though.  My Steam account says I beat the campaign in 5.2 hours and the asking price is $21.99 CAD... so that equates to $4.22 per hour. I don't plan on playing multiplayer since I'm not much of a multiplayer FPS guy these days I guess. So do I feel like it was worth $4.22 an hour? Kinda I guess. It was fun enough... but there's some older games with a longer campaign for the same asking price that'll give you more entertainment. I'd say get the first Sniper Elite game and see what you think of that game before buying this one tbh. Maybe the same with the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior game.. but of course I don't own that so I can't directly give my opinon on that game, but this one is ok so I'm guessing the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior is also ok.",

            "review_text": "Even if I found the game disappointing, I must recognize that the environments are beautifully rendered, the look and feel of the sniper rifle satisfying and having a supporting character quite enjoyable sometimes.  Unfortunately, S:GW2 is an 'execution' game : most of the time you follow a predefined path in the maps, and you're told which targets to kill, in what ordre. So you don't really have to worry about recon, strategy or tactic that much. It's very different from Sniper Elite where you have a lot of agency in that matter. On top of that, the game is pretty short and the storyline not that exciting.  So, in solo play, it's more a 'filler' in between more consistent games.",

It's my 3rd attempt to finish the game but it seems like I'll give up again.It's just too dull and boring.   Also there is no MP, just 2 apartments 100mt away from each other, random snipers shooting each other on random floors.Probably the worst MP FPS experience I've ever had.

            "review_text": "City Interactive Has botched yet another game. Graphicaly this game looks pretty good, and the positives stop there. This game suffers from MAJOR graphical issues especialy on computers running Directx 9 that really void the aforementioned graphics. The Gameplay effectively boils down to you only being able to follow the instructions of your poorly acted spotter, only kill who he says, only move where he says, when he says. Choose to deviate from his instructions and you will imediately be engaged in a firefight with enemies who will go from not being able to hit a aircraft carrier at point blank to being able to shoot the head off a moving spider. Your spotter is only one of a small number of poorly developed and cringe worthy characters that only make the sub-standard story even less bearable. The overall campaign is EXTREMELY short (Took me around 4 Hours on normal) and has no replay value. I initialy thought that this game could be the turning point for city interactive but had those hopes squashed about 30 mins in. If you are looking for a similar game Sniper Elite V2 is the same price. 1.5/10",

It's very linear story campaign ang gameplay also which either can be good or bad to some. Not much freedom to rome around. But the DLC campaign is much better than main campaign so if you get this game be sure to get the Siberian Strike DLC.  The multiplayer can be either fun or frustrating at all. There is a dedicated server, or host your own and server browser too which I seems to always see around averagely 5 or more active games always. So playing with public is guaranteed at this time of writing. Sniping on single player seems pretty straight and simple that you will sure say it's fun snipping but on multiplayer it's all very different 'coz it's frustrating sometimes because everyone hides so well and comes to the point so hard to find your opponents especially the pros. Multiplayer surely needs a lot of patience and passion to play or else frustration will kill you in always getting killed by your opponents. Some get mad and annoyed then go crazy cross over to other other side and just kill them all with handgun.  Overall, It's Average, okay and 65/100 in general view. But might be 85/100 for snipper enthusiast. Buy it on sale to make it worth having.",

The main drawbacks with this game is that it is only 10 hrs long (each level can be completed in about an hour) and if you are spotted at any time in a level it is kind of difficult to get out of as it only takes a couple hits, depending on difficulty, to die. The sniping mechanics are solid as it tries to be as realistic as possible, with the bullet curving to match the wind conditions and angles. It is really fun to line up enemies for a one-shot, double-kill action. The locales in this game are pretty unique for any game, as it features the Phillipines (Russian mercs), Bosnia (Serbian army), and Tibet (Islamic insurgents). The graphics are very detailed using the CryEngine to fully demonstrate its power. Buy this game when it goes on sale, I got it for $5 on a Steam Sale but I would not pay more than $10 for this game as it is very short and the replay value is limited to your inclination of sniping bad guys, but the whole ride is fun while it lasts.",

There have been some improvements since the 1st Sniper Ghost Warrior game, but not sure what exactly, because I've played the original game only 1 hour most, it really sucked. The second Ghost Warrior has amazing graphics, the gameplay is nice, but the story is short as hell.  Multiplayer is not as much fun as I thought. 2 of 3 maps have places where you can't even see your enemy, on kill cam you know approximately the spot where he's hiding, but can't rlly find him. (hiding in the rocks on the resort map and in some dark places in sarajevo) The Chinese/Tibet Temple is fun. They should have made a capture the point mod, because tdm and dm get boring quickly, especially when there are these strange places and ppl camping only in there... Have not found out if there is a voice chat in multiplayer, but maybe it depends on the 'lobby leader' if he enables it I guess.

Gameplay is entertaining, maps are basically corridors, true, but built in such a way that it never bothered me. Sniping is well-done and very satisfactory.   It is a fact that enemies are insanely all-seeing and all-knowing once you trigger the alarm, but I never felt it to be too much of a flaw - it just forces you to play carefully and make your shots count.  Storyline is good enough, I guess. There's always something happening, always something to do or at least look at. The environment changes with each act, preventing you from getting bored with the same old ruins/jungle/etc. I will refrain from judging the graphic side, since my PC is rather low-end and I'm playing in lower resolution anyway (and the game still looks good).  Overall, I'd recommend this if you are a fan of stealthy sniping and especially if you see a good discount. I hear that Siberian Strike DLC is even better than the basic campaign, but I haven't tried that yet, can't really say...",

If you are spotted you are in trouble and things become a lot more difficult, but you do not automatically fail. You can also choose to sneak around enemies and leave them alive, or take them out from close quarters.   This game is absorbing and highly entertaining. Don't expect a story like Call of Duty, or an insane graphical masterpiece.  Want a true challenge? Harder difficulties remove the aim dot. You need to check the wind strength and range, and then align your shot accordingly. This game mode immerses you even more.

I feel that there should have been more player based control, especially during the missions where you just simply pick off the targets that have been selected.  Multiplayer isn't very active - I did manage to get onto one game and it was alright, but i feel the concept was not advanced enough. Your team AI not always that briliant when you are in combat (Fully detected)  Came across a few problems, including what appeared to be an invisable barrier at the top of a ladder, aswell as some of the dialoge being cut off.   Pros:  Good graphics Runs fine, although probably wont do great on low spec systems Immersive campaign - Such a shame it was so short. There is a multiplayer option, so could be fun if you play with friends.  The AI you play with really does make it feel so much more Co-op rather than being lonely 10/10 Would reccomend when on sale. 7/10 Would reccomend at current price.",

No stealthy 'oh where'd that shot come from lets coordinate and look around, while alerting our teammates to a potential threat', it's 'you blew your cover, we, the AI in this zone (and only this zone, never mind the guys just around the corner), know EXACTLY where you are instantly'.    Zero challenge. Be it in stealth, shooting, or decision making, there's no challenge to be had.    Bullet mode, randomly the game will think you've made a good shot, and will swap your view to follow the bullet and give you a close up of the crappy sprite blood splatters (the first sniper game had better effects)    Plays more like a movie (or a shooter-arcade game) than a stealth game (lots of cinematic, or scripted sequences, like melee stealth kills: 'oh let's pause your control while you watch your character do some fancy melee stealth kill for 15 seconds).     Movement is EXTREMELY clunky. Countless times when I am trying to sneak around the jungle and have gotten my toe stuck poorly formed terrain. Or press &lt;action&gt; to climb things, but rarely displays when you need it. ... Was this even play tested?   Graphics are appalling on ultra settings, everything within the narrow path is  fine  but if you step an inch out of that path (and I do mean litterally on the other side of that bush, near your foot), it's N64 perfect dark- style graphics.   Motion blur that can only be disabled through config file edits   If there are any redeeming factors in this game, I'd did not see enough (if any) to keep playing past the two hours I put in (3-4 missions in, POST tutorial).",

I can't comment on whether the inital reviews were justified or the extent of any bugs which were subsequently fixed. What I can say is that this is not a bad game. I've played through the single-player campaign (about 7 hours) and the Siberian Strike DLC (about 2.5 hours) and had a fair amount of fun doing it.   Overall, I thought it offered a nice, if over the top, narrative and reasonable stealth / sniper mechanics. Much of the criticism of the game centers on its linear nature. On that count, it's guilty as charged. You will never confuse this game with Far Cry 3 in terms of open world mechanics. That said, there are plenty of games that offer a fun experience in a linear fashion. While the encounters are essentially all set-piece they are nicely designed. I'm still not sure what the campaign was doing in Tibet, but it was terrifically rendered.  I'd define the highs and lows as follows:  Highs: Solid graphics (better than average PC options for a port) Good sniper gameplay Reasonable level of player decisioning (no penalties if you decide to alert the enemy rather than being stealthy) Logical controls Good range of difficulty levels Essentially bug-free as far as I could tell  Lows: A little short A wonky checkpoint or two (nothing game breaking) Occasional unaware enemies (walking past bodies with no reaction)  Overall, I had a good time playing through the campaign and DLC and will probably do so again. If you are looking for a sniper game specifically, I would probably recommended Sniper Elite: V2 over this one but only by a small margin. If you catch this one on a periodic Steam sale for less than $10, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up along with the Siberian Strike DLC.  ",

Instead, this game puts you on a rail where it's like 'Kill all these guys' then 'Sneak pass these guys' and I really get bored of it that quick.  The graphics look amazing on the highest settings, but this fact does not make the game better, the gameplay does. If you had a game that could only run on advanced computers, but it the game is terrible, then no one will play it because it's just all effort was put into graphics.  The multiplayer is horrible. Just dreadful. You can't kick/ban people in-game, you have to wait until the lobby to do it, and even if you do that, the people can come back as a different name and keep doing stuff. There are also instances where you are not visible to anyone and still be shot from no where. This game needs VAC on every server, or something even better than VAC and kick/ban abilities during game.  The DLCs are redeem this game a little, but not much too pull it out of the toliet where it belongs.  Over all, if they focused more on story/gameplay, it would be more decent.

No chance to see the map area to plan a stratagy. You die as soon as you move after the cut seen pushes you into view of the enemy. All that is playable is the target range. The actions respoce times are very slow. I don't know why they did this but I have all the audio maxed out on every setting and it's still so quiet I can not hear the instructions the team mate is giving.

Stealth system was pretty good, but I was sometimes detected while under cover (rarely though). The biggest annoyance I had (again, just an annoyance, not a major problem) was the crouch/prone mechanics. Crouch and prone were set to two separate buttons. Hold one of them toggle stand/prone. The other toggles between crouch/stand or crouch/prone depending on where you went to crouch from. The major annoyance with that was if you were crouching from being prone, the only way to stand up was to either go prone and stand from there or to start sprinting (which enemies can detect more easily). I found myself going from crouch --&gt; prone --&gt; standing a lot because of this.  That being said, imagine the sniper mission from Modern Warfare (COD4), then make that mission into an entire game. Tweak the combat system a bit to specialize on sniping, and you essentially have this game.",

On the other hand, I like the way how this game has some realistic features to it. Such as showing the amount of air you have inside your lungs while you are swimming, you get medikits to heal yourself, and it shows your heartbeat rate! And when you are aiming at enemies with your sniper rifle, there is a red dot to reaveal where the bullet will ACTUALLY go, which is smart due to the wind blowing the bullet off where you want it to actually go. And the other thing is when you press the trigger, the bullet has a travel time, unlike other games where you press the trigger and in a 900th of a second it hits them already. So basically, you shoot and it hits before you know it. Unlike Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. Overall, to me it's a 67/100 rating.",

Sniper : Ghost warrior 1 is a crap. And i concured on that. But This one is something you should try. The singleplayer campaign can deliver you more fun than Battlefield 3 (singleplayer) 's.There 're some of the 'Call of Duty moments too , lots of Hollywood - driven scenes'   Some people might think 'Hey if this game is as fun as those others good FPS (+ Sniping / Stealth) , then what's new in it?' My answer is Beside the fact that you have more chance to snipe and sneaking / crawling than other FPS games , No. Nothing new here. But Why not ? Why not get it if you saw the price drop to 7$ , 4.99$ ? Like i did. And I have to say that it's FUN.  Pros :  -Beautiful graphic (Thanks to CryEngine3) in ACT 1 - forest , it's kinda dark and too greenish there but after that in Bosnia and Tibet (ACT 2 - 3) The graphic will start to shine. As good as - better than Battlefield 3 / Medal of Honor 2012. I really like Bosnia and Tibet. The level designing , the buildings and those decorations are an art , espacially Tibet , VERY stunning.  -Bulletcam made a comeback.  -Storyline is ok , nothing special but not bad either.  -You always carry either Thermal cam or Night Vision one , Which are very useful to use in nearly every chapters. Good + fun tool.  -Improved AI , they 're way smarter than the previous one , when you start shooting , they will duck and get to the nearest cover. and try to swarm you from multiple directions if they have a chance.  -Realistic bulletdrop  -Good voice acting.  -A lot of Cut scene.  -Realistic HP , even in medium difficulty you can still die easily within 2 sec. if you got spray'd by enemy rifles.  -Sniping + play like a Hitman is fun and satisfying.   Cons :  -Length , it's short. Singleplaye clocked around 5 hours and 1.5 hours for the DLC (Based on my Medium difficulty gameplay)  -Multiplayer is kinda empty.  -Unrealistic enemies at some chapters e.g. You are about to engage large group of enemies from Hilltop with Unsuppressed Barette XM500 Sniper rifle. You followed what AI told you to do. When you shot an Ememy he told u to. Another enemies who stood around 20 m. next to there still acted the same (stay on their course like nothing happen). even your gun is unsuppressed O_O  -You will never have a chance to use some cool sniper rifles (VSS Vintorez , DSR-50 , Accuracy International Arctic warfare 50) because they saved it for the multiplayer and yet multiplayer is deserted and empty , so. you lost that chance eventually.  *PS. The Singleplayer DLC 'Siberian Strike' have more things to offer. Huge map , Good post - soviet vibe of Siberia , because of the size of the map you can create your own strategy of killing.   7.4 / 10   'Don't hate it , It's actually FUN' and remember , one shot one kill , people :) ",

Add in thermal vision and some levels become basically a Predator role play. The 'story' behind this game plays out like a Tom Clancy-wannabe made for DVD movie.

I can perhaps see why it's been slated - no awkward fiddly grappling hook that you struggle to remember the rather unintuitive controls for (yes plural - you first have to select it, then you have to activate it, then you have to press yet more keys to use it). But hello, you really enjoy being a sniper, you see a game called 'Sniper 2 : Ghost Warrior', you just want to go sniping! Or am I missing the point somewhere.  The game does feel a little on rails, but that's still fine with me - it still lets you explore a bit but if you wander too far you get a 5 second countdown to get back to the mission area. The level of detail within the game is really quite something. The locations are very varied and I felt like James Bond going all over the world on my missions - if not always to the most glamorous of locales. Also the developer has made a far better use of the Far Cry 3 engine than the developers of Far Cry 3 itself have. One rather nice difference between this game and Far Cry 3 are the lack of bullet proof leaves. If you want an all action title with a sandbox feature, go to Just Cause 2. If you really, really enjoy picking people off from afar, get this game. It is not that long, but in this case it's definitely quality not quantity. The game feels polished and finished.

There is some action here and there to keep things interesting, including a few forced alerts you have to deal with which helps break the monotony of sneaking and sniping. Story and graphics were good, though the story itself was nothing special, but did keep things interesting overall.   As for complaints, not really much.

My only complaint would be maybe the adding an assault level or two to keep things more interesting (assuming the assault rifles can be fired without jumping around like a kid with a mother of a sugar rush). However, that's a small thing, and doesn't really detract from the game itself.   Overall, I would definetely recommend this game. Though perhaps not on par with sniper elite, it is still a good sniping game, and one worth definetely trying (unlike its predecessor which you should avoid with a 10-foot pole).",

Multiplayer is boring, just a bunch of people camping 24/7.

I got it three years ago, when it was on sale and I figured I would play it just to complete it. The visuals are amazing, and gameplay can be fun, but it is really linear, and there will be points where you will think that this is probably the corniest game you have ever played. I did have fun while playing this, but I mainly used it as a timekiller while waiting for a new game that will be coming out soon. So overall, if you want a game that doesn't present much of a challenge, even on the hardest difficulty, and you want bullet drop, then this the game for you. Other than that, this game deserves the rating that metacritic gave it, but I still found some enjoyment out of it.",

Also the fact that you never see the bullets impact in slowmotion, wich is my favourite thing about sniper games.

I do not reccomend this game at all, unless you are like me and just wanna stock up your library with games you buy for really low prices lol.",

We used to shrug them off as just being 'a little different upstairs,' and exclude them from society. We eventually figured that it wouldn't hurt to include these people in society. We were wrong. This game is a prime example of why exclusion is the vastly superior method of handling the mentally handicapped.   It was well worth the 2 dollars I payed for it however.",
