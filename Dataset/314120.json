            "review_text": "Genuinely funny dialogue and an interesting combat system let down by: - occasional (apparently) random encounters - Drama star system designed to prevent save scumming also misses the point of saving for reasons *other* than save scumming. In fixing one problem, they created another. - Seems to be deliberately designed to push you back to town on a regular basis - The town is... basically pretty boring. Takes too long to wander around it compared to the amount of stuff to do. - NPCs that are nowhere near as interesting as the protagonist PCs - The effects of many of the perks &amp; upgrades are not well explained. - The graphics are about on par with Might &amp; Magic 6-8, which is to say mediocre by late 90s standards. I don't actually mind this much, but if you want eye candy look elsewhere.",
