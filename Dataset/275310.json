An amazing idea for naval battles in 1880's, before world fleets evolved into all metel goliathans, turned super boring with only four playable scenarios; no campaign, no skirmishes. After you play the four scenarios, then what? Also, the shooting disturbs me; you can't control the ship's shooting and they can run away from the main fleet, so you can't even control each ship's movement. Da♥♥♥♥?",
