I attempted to play online, I literally couldn't as it wouldn't let me; I hosted a server, apparently my connection node won't work yet it's fine.  the worst thing is that you can't turn the sound down.. you have defeaning music in your ears the entire game  10/10 if you like defeaning music and staring at a screen for hours",

I love it, people are complaining about the low charcater count, have none of you ever played a fighting game that wasnt made in the past ten years??? 8 characters is plenty. And yes there is only one map but this game is still in very early development. Dont complain about controls, use a controller. dont use a keyboard with a pc fighting game. This game is amazing and has so much more potential. I am going to continue playing it and I cannot wait to see what is next in what I am imagining being a great and amazing game.",
