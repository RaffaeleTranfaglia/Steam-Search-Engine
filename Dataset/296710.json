            "review_text": "From the reviews I was looking forward to a creepy tense survival horror experience. Good survival horror toys with you by using misdirection and engaging your imagination. Monstrum however is a jump scare slot machine with little cat and mouse and misdirection. Everything is telegraphed to you and is 1:1. You here thumping? Then you know the lava guy is around. You see the lights flicker? You know a ghost is near. See sacks on the wall? Be ready to be chased by a derivative monster. The game rules are very clear, which is good for a rogue like, but makes for a very dull horror experience. At no point did they achieve actual terror with me. The game never made me question my surroundings or my own senses, except for using the same texture on nearly every wall.   I never once found myself coming across a narrative moment that made think 'what's going on here?' Everything felt sterile. They even missed the opportunity to have the ship creak and the doors sway as the ship rocks against the waves. Or even have the ambient ship sounds change over time. Instead you're on what must be the absolutely most silent ship, ever. They never pulled the rug out from under me. They don't toy with you, which is the very meaning of 'cat and mouse.' Simply having something patroling after you is not cat and mouse, it's hide and go seek. Cat and mouse means toying with me, letting me escape only to appear around the very next corner, creating that 'phew... OH MY GOD!' kind of moments. Instead it's just hide and go seek. If that's what you're into, this is for you. If you're looking for something that's going to try to get into your head you might want to pass.  ",

You are stranded on ocean ship alone and needing to escape, all the while you are hunted by 3 Monsters. Each one has a unique perspective to them.   While on the ship you can find:   Escape Parts ~ Used to aid you in escaping   Distraction Tools ~ Used to make a noise to stir attention away from you   Maliciousness ~ Usually fuses or lighting sources    Also I recommend using a very good surround sound headset to add to the effect.  Also VR support is amazing at Direct X 12",

            "review_text": "So I've only played this game for a whopping 20 minutes. However, in those 20 minutes I have nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself 20 times. I have only played the game in VR (It has a VR option during launch) and I can barely play it because I'm too scared. To be fair, though, any horror game (in my opinion) is significantly more terrifying when playing it in VR.  Here's what I have to say about the VR aspects of the game: As I said, VR makes this game so much scarier; I can hardly play it. I keep trying to, but I can't get through it at all.  When I do play it though, I play it for about 5 minutes at a time before I wimp out and turn it off. The way the game is with camera controls and movement relative to the VR perspective, it's one of the very few VR games that starts to make my stomach hurt; I can't play it for too long before I start feeling sick.  That being said, neither I not you HAVE to play this game in VR, so many of those issues above can be avoided.  The game is really well made and very scary and it's procedurally generated so each time you play is different! Which is always a bonus! So every time that I've restarted the game after getting too scared, it's always different (for better or worse).  Great horror game. Great VR horror game.",

My main complaint about this game is that the game uses this really annoing rubberbanding method with the monsters so that they are always close by no matter what it feels like the monsters are cheating. Think Mario Kart 64 cpu players. Other than that and some glitches the game is super sppoky and will make you super nervous. I also love its hard core one life system.",

Sadly there's not many that have recently, thanks to most horror games relying on jump scares, which do nothing for me. (Amnesia: TDD has been the most recent game to give me a good scare.) So I bought this game based off the reviews, and even though so many people were talking about how terrifying it could be, I still expected that it wouldn't provide much scare...  So then I turned it on, waited for the level to load. Walked through the brief tutorial room. Started thinking 'Hmmm, it's Outlast... No big deal.' Walked up the stairs into the next room, got caught off-guard by the security cameras. Turned and seen one facing me, started thinking 'hah, you're just a camera, you can't do anything.' Found the security room, closed the door behind me, started scrounging around for supplies.  Went to turn the light on, heard the door creak open, turned to the door just quick enough to see the Fiend nonchalantly walk in before taking my frail life with the greatest of ease.  There's just something so amazingly creepy about a monster slowly advancing toward you, as you try to figure out how, and if, you can possibly survive such an encounter... 10/10, I may never be able to leave a door closed again.",

The randomly generated ship is claustrophobic and disorienting, which helps with the sense of isolation that the game goes for. The only real problem I have with the game is the price--it's a rather shallow game, with no story and anywhere between 5 and 40 minutes per playthrough. Though the replay value IS high, I really wouldn't consider this a game worth the almost twenty dollar price it asks for; I'd say it's worth around the Summer sale value of ten dollars. Still, though, a great indie game worth checking out if you plan on replaying it.",

EDIT: The reason for the lack of hours is because I've played this on a friends PC previously; just bought it on my account.  But in all seriousness, people that say they'd rather play 'Alien: Isolation' don't get it. While I love Alien, this game is different; Alien is a game you can play once, and the scare mostly stops, you've experienced the game. Monstrum on the other hand has a lot of replayability because of the random generation, no item is in the same location, you never know what enemy you face, the rooms change, and it's just overall more challenging in my opinion. In conclusion; I love both games, but Monstrum is a better purchase if you want to get into the horror faster.",

However... the ship seems quite large, I have no idea where to walk to and what to pick up, I try to be as quiet as possible (crouch all the time) but the monster keeps on coming and killing me, sometimes it is just there without any sign (or sound) of warning, running away and often hiding, too, won't work (fast enough, well enough)... I feel that I totally don't have any control of the game's outcome. That would be acceptable or even nice for an experience, but for a game it is quite a downer for me.

            "review_text": "Over the years I have acquired a lot of Steam games, but rarely do I feel sufficiently motivated to write a review for a particular game. For Monstrum, I am more than willing to make an exception. Be warned, this is long, pretentious and tries to be more cerebral than my brain can handle, but ♥♥♥♥ it, I love this game too much.  The premise:   You are alone on a ship. You need to get off the ship. Something else is on the ship. You don't know what it is. You don't know where it is. It. Is. Hunting. You.  Anyone who has played Slender, Outlast, Amnesia or any other screaming youtuber-bait knows the drill - darkness + beastie + orchestral stings = Not Another Generic Indie Horror Title amirite? Certainly I will not pretend that Monstrum is a title that pushes the genre's boundaries in any meaningful way; it is in essence a corridor crawler where you must find certain items to achieve a goal whilst avoiding a hostile entity that would like nothing more than to make you not be alive no more.  What Monstrum is, is an exemplary and noteworthy addition to the indie horror family, one that I feel stands alongside Amnesia in terms of achievement. It earns this accolade through its incredible mastery of two distinct elements that are absolutely intrinsic to the basic concept of horror, be it within video games or entertainment media in general.  The first element is Sound. Any horror film/game/show worth its salt has at least a basic understanding that, while Sight is the sense that is the easiest to use to convey the imagination of the creator of the film/game/show, Sound is the ultimate doorway into the imagination of the viewer/player themselves. Sound can paint pictures, it can control emotions, and it can create POSSIBILITIES. In horror, Sight is the opening of Schroedinger's Box. In horror, Sound IS Schroedinger's Box. With Sound, there are no constants, only variables. And amongst those variables, horror crawls and chitters.  In Monstrum, as you travel around the claustrophobic corridors and gantries of the ship, ignorant of the location of your nemesis, things can seem quiet in a very stark, relative way. But Monstrum is not quiet. Wherever you go, you are beset by Sound, in the form of groaning doors, hissing pipes, humming electronics, crashing waves and hostile camera alarms. The ambient Sound is Monstrum is spectacular, creating a sense of sickening dread that I have only felt in a number of games that I can count on two fingers. Unusually, the most notable of these is the Sound that you as the player will create. Every step you take clangs and echoes through like ship like a demented church bell, every door you open screeches and wails like a titanium newborn. In terms of Sound, the actions that you as a player take create such a hideous, crunching contrast with the perceived silence that you will curse every door, every drawer, every step as you fight the urge to run before the Creature comes to investigate all the noise you're making.  I'm not even going to mention the noises the Creature makes as it closes in on you. You can buy the game if you want a taste of that.  The second horror element that Monstrum, in my opinion, blows out of the park, is The Unknown. Historically, one of the best examples of the use of The Unknown is of course Lovecraftian horror, and the cosmicism principle that we are an infinitely insignificant species, at the non-existent mercy of beings, entities or powers infinitely greater than ourselves. This premise is tapped into by a significant number of video games, notably Call of Cthulu, Alone in The Dark (THE ORIGINAL ALONE IN THE DARK, LET ME BE CLEAR), Slender and even Mass Effect to an extent. Fear of The Unknown is an ancient, biological instinct, pervading millions of years of evolution, death, predation and cowering in the dark. It teaches us that inside Schroedinger's Box, there may not be a cat at all - there may simply be teeth, teeth that allow us to scream for half a second before clamping over our throat.  The ship in Monstrum is randomly generated each time you play. Every time you start a new game, once-familiar corridors, corners and entrances will evaporate, replaced with a new, alien configuration. Key items required to escape from the ship will move around like mischievous imps with every playthrough, taunting you with their absence. This flawless use of The Unknown means that in Monstrum, there is no real strategy guide, no Youtube walkthrough, and certainly no map. The only guide you will have is the one in your mind - the one you hastily scribble inside your head as you traverse new doors, new passages, new threats. This is where Monstrum achieves - no matter how many times you play, you cannot know all. No matter how many times you play......The Unknown will be there with you.  Finally, we come to it. Your Nemesis. The Creatures themselves. Horror itself demands an antagonist, and Monstrum delivers not one, but three. Each time you play, the game will randomly select one of three completely different Creatures to come play with you. No spoilers, buy the game. All you need to know is that when you start a new game YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH CREATURE IS ON THE SHIP WITH YOU. It is difficult to describe the feeling this elicits within me every time I open that first door, and I suspect that is because it is a feeling that I have rarely felt, perhaps have NEVER felt. It is The Unknown, boiled to purity and soaked into my soul. I don't know where I am. I don't know where it is. God help me, I don't know what it is.  Monstrum unlocks the power of random/procedural generation in video games in a way that is blisteringly brilliant, a way that I cannot adequately intone. There are some minor issues with this game, but I cannot even begin to summon the wherewithal to mention them. Monstrum's use of Sound is devastating to the nerves, its cloying, rusty graphics a steroid to my wide, glistening eyes. This is indie horror.  Buy it.",

The randomization just adds so much to the game, keeping both the game play and the fear fresh. even though 50% of the ship is not randomized, it does its job well of getting you lost.  the fear for me turns up to 12/10 when you use the oculus rift. I've never shook so hard in my life. you can imagine why.   the game play is solid. and I've never felt this much freedom in a horror game of this style, even more so than Outlast or Alien Isolation. Because you can go ANYWHERE you want on the ship, which ramps up the horror even more cause you feel like it REALLY IS up to you to go and figure out how to save yourself from the situation. no hand holding, other than with helping understand how to repair something (via shopping list to fix a submarine for e.g.). your own plans, your own decision, your own fault for getting what you need to get and failing to do so from monsters with there own plans as well.  Seriously, the monsters are really smart and I can tell by the way they behave. If there are multiple places that I could be hiding, they'll just skim through all the rooms without checking under beds and stuff to save time and to try and keep me from running from room to room. And if they have a really good idea of where you are, they'll stick around in your room for a long, long time until they find you or give up. they're not there to be spooky, they are legit trying to eat your face to the best of their abilities. It gives you a true sense of being hunted, one which few horror games have achieved.  there tends to be a bug or two, but they are very rare and will never break game-play. In fact none of the bugs revolve around the player, so you'll never die a cheap buggy death. any bugs I've found revolve around the monsters, which is good cause you'll need all the help you can get :P  Each monster has its own strengths and weaknesses, but no matter how well you know the monster, it can still catch you completely off guard. Remember, they are SMART. I remember a monster chased me down the side of the ship on the top deck, and I went into a red locker on the port side. I saw it rush past my locker. It stopped at the corner up ahead, sensing that it wasn't chasing a running target any more. so it began retracing its steps, trying to figure out where I went. it went back and forth in front of my locker. and each pass it went slower and slower and slower. I knew that one of those passes will result in it figuring out that I was right beside it the whole time. and I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself with the realization. I ran the moment it did another pass on my locker, but even though I lost it, I was still shaking.  get the ♥♥♥♥ing game. it's a real gem amongst the 2015 ocean of 'scary' game wannabe's.  ",

If i had to give constructive criticism, It would have to be towards the endings. Finally escaping the ship and the monster feels like an acomplishment. The simple ending pictures shown of you escaping is just a bit bland. I recommend making it so escaping has more feeling to it. After entering the raft/submarine/helicopter, show a cutscene of the player activating the escape and leaving the ship before cutting to a picture of the said escape route.  For example:    Raft-",
