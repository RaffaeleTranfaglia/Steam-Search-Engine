            "review_text": "A simple casual hidden object game with puzzles mixed in. Good graphics, good music and more interesting storyline than the original. I think Time Mysteries 2 was the best in the series due to its length. While they are all easy, since they are casual games, I found this one a little too easy compared to what the rest of the series offered. Still though, if you enjoy the genre, well worth a playthrough if you catch it in a bundle or on sale.",

            "review_text": "I like these games for the puzzles (mini games), I would be happy with just them and no Hidden Objects and no story. Most of the time, the rest is fun too though.   I'm a bit undecided here.  I like this one a lot more than the previous ones.  The hidden object games are just right for my taste (medium difficulty).  The alternate to the HO games is great. Same as in Time Mysteries 2, where I don't have the option to just play it from the Extras, but it's possible here! A different kind of matched-blocks-disappear game. That adds a lot of replay value for me.   I could follow the story better in this game (than in the previous ones), and it's interesteing, but it still feels disconnected. Maybe I'm just not for time travel. The immersion I am used to from other games, including other Artifex Mundi titles, was missing.   The jump-to-room-and-time function is great to save manually walking around, but here it increased the above mentioned feeling. As before, I ended up just ticking off of exclamation marks from the device.   The puzzles (mini games) could use an explanation on what to do.   So, with all that, in the end it makes a thumbs up.  There are few games where I don't turn the music off first thing, so I can't say anthing about that.",

            "review_text": "Time Mysteries 3: The Final Enigma is the final chapter in the Time Mysteries series and does a good job at wrapping up all three stories and connecting them while also tying up loose ends.  The game itself is nothing special and is a little dated, as are the previous two games, but if you like the Hidden Object genre, then all three games will probably satisfy you. No bugs, reasonable voice acting, plenty of puzzles, and lots of HO scenes.  Time Mysteries 3 also has a bonus chapter, as had Time Mysteries 2, but while the bonus material in TM2 was mostly original, the bonus chapter in TM3 is mainly re-used HO scenes (with the same objects) from TM2 and TM3 which was a little disappointing.  Overall, the trilogy is a decent, if not spectacular, journey through time with the Ambrose family that is perhaps on the easy side for experienced HO players, but still worth making.",

            "review_text": "Continuing the story from the second game (and marginally attempting to include bits of the first game), this concludes the Time Mysteries series of hidden object games. Like the first two, the puzzles are straightforward and it shouldn't take you long to finish the game and get all the achievements. The voice acting is still bad, but the writing has improved a bit for this one and sends you in better time-looped circles than the first two. Improvement in the graphics is sadly offset by typos in the main menu and game text, and some explanatory text which doesn't make sense (have a look at the chess game puzzle). To top off the 'we rushed this' attitude, the trading cards still have the Time Mysteries 2 logo on them.   After being a bit more impressed with the Nightmares hidden object games, playing through all three of these games I keep coming back to the same thought - there's a really neat concept here with the time travelling family with its roots in the Merlin mythology that's been butchered and given poor, rushed execution. While this continuation of the story is an improvement, the series still leaves a bitter aftertaste in knowing it could have been done so much better.",

            "review_text": "This is the closest I've come to giving an Artifex Mundi title a thumbs down. It's presumably one of their more dated projects, and it shows. Not only is the game short (I beat it in 2 hours, including the bonus story, though I'll confess to skipping two or three puzzles in addition to about two-thirds of the cinematics), but it's just a little clumsier than what I'm used to seeing from them. The hidden object segments are hit and miss, but mostly miss thanks to lower-res images and a tendency to hide the most identifiable part(s) of some objects so that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be when you're looking straight at them. (An inevitable few confusing labels - 'handle' for a knob, e.g. - are old hat, but still annoying when they happen.) The usual nonsensical 'keys' and progression items are at play, which is forgivable but not ideal, and it definitely has one of the weakest and least well-integrated plotlines in the library. My biggest gripe, though, is that this game only offers two difficulty options, basically divided into a kiddie mode that holds your hand constantly (this is what I settled on, contributing to the brevity of the playthrough) and an exasperating mode that forces you to find and remember every detail of the often unintuitive environments if you wish to progress.  That said, the successful AM formula - a good balance of puzzles and hidden object scenes, nice visuals accompanied by good voice acting, etc. - manages to keep the overall experience positive.",

            "review_text": "I have only recently started playing these kind of games and this one was okay. I've seen better. I played on the expert mode (which usually works for me fine) and noticed that the hint-button didn't really work outside the hidden object scenes where I specificly would have needed it on a few occations. It pointed to the time travel machine and when I opened it it said to press the compass (?) and then it always gave the same note saying that exclamation points mark the active areas but THEY NEVER DID. So no help there.  I haven't played the first two games which might be one reason why I didn't always see the game's logic clearly. I skipped the previous ones because of bad reviews. I hear this was hard. I guess it was. I was lost.  Still I'd recommend this, just maybe played on the easier mode.",

Gameplay generally good. Some going backwards and forwards to find hidden object puzzles to progress, but generally easy to find and mini games are generally logical.  It's not anywhere near as good as other Artiflex Mundi games, and the voice acting is awful in places, but it's not a bad game.",
