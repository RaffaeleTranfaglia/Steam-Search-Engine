            "review_text": "Distraint is a short psychological horror title in which you play the role of Price, a young man whose job is to seize the property of others. He quickly discovers that he's entering a decent paying career at the cost of his own humanity.  The game is full of hidden meanings (even Price's name), and the story is something that almost everyone who has had a job can relate to. Myself personally being a slave to call center careers for the past decade, I certainly know how the protagonist feels and the story really hits home for me.  The graphics and gameplay style will easily remind players of titles such as Lone Survivor, Claire and Home. However, Distraint has a personality and concept that is unique to itself. The atmosphere in the game is heavy, brought on by dimly lit corridors and a pressurized ambiance that gives an overflowing sense of dread for the entirety of the game.  Distraint is an outstanding indie horror title that does its job of instilling fear and dread into the player. The puzzles are very easy and the game is very short, your initial playthrough may take anywhere from 1-2 hours to complete. Subsequent playthroughs will see 30-45 minute timeframes. There are a few grammatical errors within the dialogue at times, but the game is bug and crash free.  Though you may find yourself hard up to pay the asking price for such a short game, the price is worth every penny as every second is enjoyable here. It's also impressive that one person created this title in a little less than 3 months; the same creator behind Silence of the Sleep. If you're looking for a good horror title to spend some time with this Halloween, look no further.   Rating:   4.5/5.0  - Excellent, highly worth playing.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, even if the game is labelled 'horror', i think that 'horror' isn't quite the right word.  The atmosphere is creepy, there are some nerve wrecking scenes but it really isnt a scary game so to speak.  The real horror of this game is probably the way the story pans out. That scares people.  In all seriousness though, a very good short story with simple and non-repetitive puzzles (At least the ones that make you agitated about having to do it again). Definitely reccomended, should probably take somewhere between 2 hours (Slightly more if you're lost but it generally isnt too hard).",

            "review_text": "- - - - Nominated for the 'The 'I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award' Award' recognising the amazing effort of the one man dev team (aka Jesse) to make this wonderful little game in just 3 months! - - - -  Basically Distraint is an indie 2D horror game where the 'horror' aspect is mostly provided by the twisted human condition- surely the most terrifying of all demons! It often follows a metaphysical thread, blurring dreams and hallucinations with reality- and really commits to it too, which in essence is vital to its' success.  Suspense is king here and at appropriate times it provided a jump, or a dropped a twisted revelation you didn't quite see coming. The moments in between are sprinkled with subtle humour in dialogue and interactions that reminded me of getting the giggles playing games like Final Fanasy IX. The art style is fantastic in my opinion, and the dev clearly has a talent for giving flavour to the environment and characters.  The game also provides one particularly excellent and memorable mind bending spacial/ temporal trippy puzzle sequence that rivals Braid at its very best (drugs, all the drugs).  There isn't much to criticise, but being nitpicky, I found most of the puzzles and inventory items to be a bit too 'neat' and convenient- not an uncommon problem in adventure style games. All of that is forgiven when it throws out some funny dialogue when you try to put some item where it clearly doesn't belong. I love it when a game has a dig at you, the player, for beng dumb or whimsical.   I would highly recommend this one. I got it on sale but I think it's well worth the full price.",

            "review_text": "A strange and suspenseful short-game. It's really very short, only an hour or two, depending how many circles you walk in while trying to solve the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are simple, but you can get lost or skip something over pretty easily. It's got a decent story, almost something like the films 'Naked Lunch' or 'Eraserhead'. A surreal experience, but not all that scary. The music and art add to the atmosphere well, but sometimes the two dimensional levels can be disorienting.  I'd recommend it if you are looking for an eerie suspenseful game to play late at night. But get it on sale... Its very short and once you've finished the game, there's nothing else to do (easy achievements).",

            "review_text": "Distraint is a side-scrolling 'point 'n' click'. I'm not sure if point 'n' click is the correct genre exactly but it's the closest thing I can attribute it to.  In Distraint you scroll side to side looking for items to activate the next section. There's very little in the way of actual puzzles. It's horror in theme only. Outside of a couple of minor jump scares there's nothing really scary about it. My biggest critiscm is that it attempts to be surreal but falls flat. Instead of surrealism it's just nonsensical. Weird for the sake of being weird.  If you are looking for a surrealist game of this type, I'd point you to The Cat Lady. Where that game delivers, Distraint seems like a bad imitation. While the journey of Distraint is filled with pitfalls and non-sequiters, the ending is satisfying.  I wish Steam had a neutral rating because that's what I'd ideally give this game instead of a negative. I wouldn't   recommend   somebody play this game however I wouldn't discourage anybody from playing it either.  If you aren't a fan of horror, indie,   and   point 'n' click I wouldn't reccomend this to you.   However, if you   ARE   a fan of   ALL   those things, you'll likely enjoy Distraint.",

            "review_text": "If you want a better cheap experiance play the Cat Lady as it's scaryer and sticks with you longer. This game I was able to beat in 119 mins without looking at tutorials and getting all but 1 achevement, while the Cat Lady took a longer time (9 hours) to beat and only gained 11/25 achevements (plus the story was alot better). I diddnt come here to just say that the Cat Ladys better, infact i do believe this is a good game. I just diddnt really find myself engaged in the story, if anything bad happened I diddn't feel sad, I just saw what happened and thaught,'ok then'. Im ok with the game being 2 hours as I'd rather the game to be short and nice rather than long and dragged out. The games message is clear and I also liked how the game was foreshadowing the end (I decided not to spoil). The game is easy, the only time you will get stuck is if you carnt find somthing, its clear what and how you need to do it. Nothing felt out of place and even if at first they don't it is explained later and just made it feel normal, but even then the story isn't memrable, just the message and unless your 2 you can see the message all over the game. Not the best 2D point and click horror but not bad either as i've seen worse and atleast the game dosn't have cheap jumpscares like some horror games that whorgamer69 will play. No matter what the excuse though if you havent got the Cat Lady I recomend play that first, if you wana play a small game thats littered with checkpoints you go right ahead and if you played the Cat Lady before this I definitely recommend as its another nice game to sink your teeth into. I love the creator for his dedication to this project and hope he makes more games in the future that even might end up better than this, I can hardly wait.",
