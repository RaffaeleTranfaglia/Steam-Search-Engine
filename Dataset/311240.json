It gets crazy intense at parts (left unmentioned as spoilers) and I would recommend this to anyone who likes this type of game.  The story is significantly better if you have played the previous in the series (9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors for DS, and Virtue's Last Reward for 3DS/Vita) however you can jump in to this game without issues, but the impact is greater if you have played the previous games.  So far it seems that the PC version is running as smooth as it can do. The Vita version has a pretty bad framerate, but this seems to be running perfectly at at least 60fps. This alone makes the PC version the obvious choice, although the portability of the Vita is also nice.  Some of the puzzles have been quite difficult, almost to the point of frustration, with you searching hard for that last piece that connects everything together, for some people that may a be a good thing or a bad thing.  TL;DR, More Zero Escape. Yes good.",

            "review_text": "Lets just say this. Before you even buy the game and play it, I HUGELY recommend that you play (or read up) the orginal 999 and VLR. As this game has crucial plot points from thoses games. (like 4 of the characters are from thoses games).  If you have, then buy it now and play it for youself. Its best to go in completely blind as the game is an experience on its own.        Want more huh? Well I'll try to explain the elements of the game while keeping spoilers to a minimum.  Gameplay: The gameplay kicks in either at 'SEEK A WAY OUT' or during 'MAKE YOUR DECISION MOMENTS'. So techniquely this isn't exactly an 'Gameplay' focused game. Which is fine if you okay with listening and taking your time with hours of cutsences. The puzzles in the 'SEEK A WAY OUT' are okay, some are challenging and could take some time to get your head over it. However while there are quite a few 'SEEK A WAY OUT' situations, I ended up being slightly disappointed that there wasn't a final room to escape from in the TRUE ending.  Story: One of the strongest points of this game. If you have played the previous Zero Escape games, then you'll know that the story is pretty Mindblowing at times. In this game, yes, it does close the game up for good. But I can't really say that the plot twists are Mindblowing. I'm not going to spoiler for your sake, but eventually I was able to guess things before it could even explain what the thing was. But either way, I enjoyed the story as its the main focus for this game. If you're not into strong story driven games like this one, then you'd probably want to find something else.  Narrative: Now, let me explain. The voice acting and the directing for this game is GREAT. Even the camera angles look professional at times. You can tell that SPIKE CHUNSOFT worked really hard for this game to come out. However, as well as that. You can tell that this game may have had a low budget. The animations are rather choppy at times and the graphics look worse that VLR somehow. They changed the first person narrative though by having you view sections of 3 different characters. As the characters forget every 90 mins, the first time you play the game you won't have any idea which timeline it maybe. You no longer have to constantly click to progress through text anymore. I suppose this is a good thing, however there are many times in the game where it gives you a code that you need to write down.  Overall: ZTD may not be strong with its gameplay, however the story will make you want to get the gameplay sections outta the way.  It makes a fine conclusion to the Zero Escape games as a 8/10, while my previous 9/10 for VLR and 7/10 for 999  So if you want a good story driven franchise. I'd recommend checking out the ZERO ESCAPE games.",

            "review_text": "As a preface, I'd HIGHLY recommend you play the first two games in the series before giving this a try. While ZTD can be played as a standalone title, you'll be missing out on a lot of crucial information and you won't enjoy it to its maximum potential.  Another hit in the Zero Escape series which has yet to have a bad (or even mediocre) title. The overall premise is similar to the two previous games: 9 people are stuck in an underground bunker, where they are forced by the antagonist (a peculiar geezer named Zero) to play a game ('the nonary game' in the previous titles, 'the decision game' in ZTD). For each person that dies, a password will be obtained for the X Door, which when provided with 6 passwords, will open and result in freedom for whoever opened it (and whoever passes through in the ten seconds after). This is the basic premise, but the story goes MUCH deeper than this and anyone who has played a Zero Escape title beforehand will understand what I'm saying.  I've personally already completed the 3DS version of ZTD, so I can say with absolute certainty that the story is great. My only criticism comes in the form of the games ending. Without spoiling anything, I believe that if this was meant to be the conclusion to the series, they have left the ending a little open ended (I'm hesitant to call sequel-bait, but it's a distinct possibility). This may result in another game in the series being released (which I'd love), but based on the wait many fans have had to endure for ZTD, it's a distinct possibility that another may not be made. Don't let this put you off, however - the journey through the entire game itself is incredible and it's on par with the previous titles (which are also held in a very high regard by most people who have played them). Some of the plot twists will blow your mind!  In terms of gameplay, there's not really a lot I can say. The game consists of a mixture of visual novel elements along with 'escape the room' style puzzles, with a large flowchart full of branching decisions. The game handles this in a very unique and interesting way, however, allowing you to jump between fragments of the timeline, not actually knowing where they place until they're completed. This allows you to jump right into whichever fragment you desire, and play the game in whatever order you choose.  The PC port is absolutely fantastic, and I have been getting consistent 60FPS at 1080p with full antialiasing with an antique GTX 650 and AMD-4170fx rig. The animations may be a little jarring occasionally, but the voice acting more than makes up for this.  Overall, Zero Time Dilemma is a fantastic entry into the series and I'd highly recommend buying it ASAP. Do yourself a favour, and play the first two though. You'll never regret it.",

            "review_text": "My feelings about this game are very complex. On one hand, I enjoyed it very much and found that its flaws didn't really dampen the experience as a whole for me. On the other, I can't really give it an unconditional recommendation.  Let me start off by saying that if you are already a fan of the Zero Escape series, you've already played and finished this game - so really, what are you looking in the reviews for now? If you are considering whether to get into the series, the answer is that of course you should - go play 999 and VLR right now!  As for ZTD itself, it is not without its issues. The good, however, is very good - (mostly) good characters with complex motivations, an interesting plot full of timey wimey and quantum theory bull ♥♥♥♥. The story is not perfect by any means; some plot elements are wavering near asspull territory, and some characters lack sufficient characterization, development or a reason to be in the story. The way the story is framed and presented is on the whole very innovative, as the story is told in independent fragments that can (and often must) be played out of order, taking advantage of the medium to tell a story that wouldn't have necessarily worked as a film or book. At some points, you need to do some unintuitive stuff in order to progress the plot, which you wouldn't necessarily know unless someone else told you, and there's a few moments of tedium through the course of the game, but on the whole, the writing and presentation are pretty good - I wish there was bit more banter and fleshing out, and that the story was a bit more meaty on the whole, but on the whole I would say that it's a good and fitting conclusion to the trilogy that I enjoyed greatly.  Now, I have two big qualms with the game. The first is mostly technical - I've had to deal with constant bugs and crashes throughout the whole thing. The interface is clearly designed with a controller in mind and few concessions towards M/KB input - it does work and I played through the whole game in this fashion, but you still can't rebind keys, input text through your keyboard (you instead use your mouse to press keys on your screen), or even get M/KB button prompts - it's all Xbox controller stuff, and you don't even have a helpful guide as to which key does what besides trial and error. While not really a technical issue, it must be said that the animations are just plain awful. It's not really a deal breaker, but everything looks cheap at best and comical at worst (or is it the other way around?) The models themselves are rather pretty and well made, a few low-res textures aside, and the environments are completely acceptable (with the same caveat). Unlike others, I haven't had any framerate issues, but given the bugs and crashes, I don't know if that's enough to recommend this version of the game over the 3DS or Vita versions (which I have not played.)  My second big issue is that Carlos will never be real.  Altogether, I give this game a solid 8.5/10.",

After playing 999 (the first one) and Virtue's Last Reward (the second one) I was very hyped to see the final of this serie. VLR was the one who completely blew my mind and I was expecting the same for ZTD. So did it blew my mind? No. So you must ask yourself why this review is positive. Well the game isn't bad at all, it is actually great. I loved the characters, the puzzles were great, the story stays awesome, etc The only thing that I am disapointed of is the final and the revelations. Unlike VLR, you pretty much expect them except for some.  So should you buy this game? I would say, not if you didn't played 999 and VLR first. Hopefully they may get to Steam in a near future. You could still play it without the first games but it would spoil you those ones, and it would be a shame since they are so great. And if you played them, well go ahead and play this one, just don't expect to get surprised as much as in 999 and VLR.",

Instead of the visual novel portions of the other two games, this game uses 3D cinematics. If you think it's too slow don't worry, you can switch on subtitles and skip through text. Puzzles are very high quality as well, you get the 'ah ha!' factor when finishing them. The story, in my opinion, ties up most loose ends from the previous two games, as well as leaving some room for you to speculate about certain elements.  Cons: One or two puzzles are convoluted and the cutscenes might be a bit lacking in quality sometimes, but they are minor cons, as the rest of the puzzles and the great voice acting and writing makes up for it.",

            "review_text": "Holy freaking crap. This game is just amazing in all points. But Should I write a really long, extensive review or leave it at that?  Let me flip a coun. If I win that toss, I'll leave it at that. If I lose - more review.  Damn. Okay, here we go. Let us embark into a 20 hour  review  Decision Game!  First of all: I have no prior knowledge or Experience with the Zero Escape Series. Say: 999 and VLR.  This gamme is a Puzzle Game / Visual Novel, but unlike your average visual Novel all dialoge is voiced and acted by character models in the respective rooms. So, in Game Cutscenes pretty much. The Story is pretty simple (and might be known from a certain other Spike Chunsoft game involving a killing game) 9 people are trapped in an underground shelter. They are split in groups of 3 and awake for 90 minutes at a time. After that their memories of those 90 minutes are erased. To get out of the shelter they need six Passwords. A Password is revealed once a person dies. If you did the math, then six of the nine people (at least) have to die so the rest could escape.  And here is where the game starts to shine: You dont play the stories of the 3 teams in a linear fashion. Rather than this, you have a global flowchart, based on a decision made by the 3 teams which splits the timeline into 4 different ones. You pick those 90 minute, amnesia ending snippets (called Fragments in game) and play through it. Some require you to make a Decision which might end up causing deaths or other bad (or good) things to happen. You are able to jump in and out of completed Fragments to see different outcomes or to just check what the devs came up with for text entering possibilities.  For example - I keep this part as vague as possible but still, Spoiler tags     One character from a team ends up dead at the beginning of a fragment. Another character aquires a weapon and believes you (the player controlled character) did it and threatens you to spit out the name. I have tried a lot of names that come up in the game, including end game very spoilery ones and I got different responses such as 'You say it was ME? Stop prouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!' upon entering the gun wielders name, 'I can see that, but you are probably acting for him' upon entering Zero, the name the game master calls himself and 'Interesting, But I dont know where that is' with the super duper spoilery name    This also happened with another whudunnit text entry, but in textbox form.   The VN Action is Broken by Escape the Room-Style Puzzle games. Those arent too hard or require you to have extensive knowledge about a lot of things (since usually upon checking a puzzle long enough, they will give you hints that become less subtile). I stopped the time on one I thought was going rather fast, and it took me about 20 minutes.  If there is one thing I have to complain, its that the voices, especially the voice of Zero, was very quiet and with a fan running next to me, I could barely understand what he said. This might have been due to my Laptops crappy sound output, but still, even with headphones it was hard to make out what he was saying.  Music is wonderful and fitting to the situation, the Puzzles are very well crafted and the Story is just   Woah    Overall, a good solid recomendation",

Pros  - Excellent story - Pretty character models - Excellent characters who make you really care for/despise them (I'm looking at YOU, Eric) - Fun puzzles - Answers so many cliffhangers from the previous two games - The cinematic shift, when it works, works pretty well to sell the story. - Some really tense decisions that have had me actually panicked. - Some pretty solid voice acting  Cons - Awful Animations can get a little distracting during serious scenes. There are a few scenes that could have been more impactful had it not been for some wonky character animations. - Akane's voice actress is kind of a dud. She can't really pull the emotional train she's trying to. - The environments tend to not match the chracter models - Has some pacing issues  I've been waiting for this game for so long, and thus far it's shaping up to be worth the wait.

The animations are clunky, almost to the point that they shouldn't have included them and just went back to the VN style of 999. Most of the 'action' happens off-screen, not for the Tarantino-effect, but becuase the animators were doing such a terrible job that they just removed all complex animations from the game by moving the camera away.   All of the story 'mechanics' of 999/VLR (read:   Morphogenetic fields, multiple timelines, etc.  ) are used here to the point of losing their 'wow' factor and as a 'basic' game mechanic rather than a narrative strength.   The puzzle mechanics range from 'yeah that makes sense' to 'panty-twistingly obnoxious developer-mind-reading nonsense.' Some puzzles you will see how to solve them and go 'ugh, I don't have time for that,' and just look up the solution.   The new characters are basically pointless except for one, and even that one is kind of a letdown in the end.   The only good thing about this game are the 'moments' in some of the scenarios, and if you look at this game as its 'vignette'-style single story nuggets, they're not 'bad' per say, but put them all together and you may find yourself annoyed by the time you're done.   ::WARNING: SPOILERS FOR 999/VLR/ZTD AHEAD::  If you have played 999/VLR and was hoping this game would give you answers on/dive deeper into:    Free the Soul The Moon K/?

And yet, how could I expect them to be fulfilled so thoroughly?  Suffice it to say, Morphogenetic Sorrow filled my days. It might've been slightly harder than what I was used to, in both the puzzles and interface, but... On some level, 999 did something scarcely any other medium has ever managed to accomplish with me.  It actually brought an emotion to my eye. With every second of a story unraveling in front of my eyes, I was reminded of those days I thought long forgotten, of that sacred moment when I launched that very first game of Broken Sword for the first time and had my perception of the medium forever changed.  But I digress.  When Virtue's Last Reward came about, t'was the purest of sufferings, for another console was needed. It took me a year.  Worth every day and penny.  And now, game three is afoot.  You know, I happen to have a friend on Steam. He never heard anything about 999 or Virtue's Last Reward and haven't even pressed on this game's name on Steam.

The story will make you disoriented and confused (in a good way), but perhaps not quite as immersed as the previous two chapters. The story navigation heavily builds on Virtue Last Reward's manually selecting which timelines to resolve to a gigantic extent, but it often leads to doing events out of order which can be confusing at first.   Puzzle difficulty is pretty uneven. Some rooms, even later rooms, are easy to fly through with much thought, while others may require note-taking and/or memorization.

            "review_text": "Spoilers Ahead. Only read this review if you have already beaten the game, or if you don't care about spoiling it for yourself.  Zero Time Dilemma is easily, for me, the weakest game in the Zero Escape series. It's still a good game, with a variety of interesting twists and mind boggling time line bending, but at the end of the day it fails to pull it's own weight.   First thing's first: The Cast. ZTD is played through three groups of characters, Q team, D team and C team. Sadly, C team, containing Sigma, Phi and Luna, character's we know and love, play a surprisingly small part in the game. Phi is a grave casualty in this situation, receiving far too little screen time for such an important character, and while Sigma and Diana have reasonable time, their existence is more about establishing their relationship than strengthening their characters. Carlos, leader of team C is a new character introduced, who is a perfect flawless John Doe fireman, but still manages to come out as one of the better characters if you can ignore his backstory being ripped out of a Disney film. Junpei and Akane are back and better than ever as the co-members of C team and they hate each other... For roughly five minutes. After that Junpei is hunting for that poon once more and Akane is talking about how she could never live without him, even though he's become a wildly cynical ♥♥♥♥. Then, there's Eric, a ceaselessly whiny, trigger happy fellow who spends almost all of his time on camera screeching about this or that. Mira, a girl who loves from the heart for the heart, and manages to scratch that 'angsty, just not quite realistic murderess' that everybody knows and loves. Last but not least, your friendly robotic child and a dog that everyone has an absurd affinity for.  The Animation! If you're looking for some constant uncomfortable uncanny valley in your life, look no further. Joking aside, the animation is a nice detour from the previous game's Visual Novel style, as it allows for a little bit more freedom in camera angles, but I do think it ruined the immersion a great deal at some times with the jerky, jaunty movements and sometimes unsynced voice/lip movements.  Plot: The plot of ZTD was good. Kind of. It was good as a stand alone game. However, if you're expecting Akane to talk about her brother who loves her dearly, that's not going to happen. If you're expecting to ever hear about K, tough. The previous games are mentioned in such small amounts that, while it would be nice for new players, it is incredibly disconcerting for someone who wants to know more about the mysteries left over from previous games. Still, there were good twists sprinkled about, and while it did dip into the melodramatic from time to time (see; Maniacal laughing, unnecessary murder, WHO KILLED MIRA?!), over all it managed to handle the situations portrayed well.  Ending: (This is where the spoilers really really start, so turn back now.) This is where the game fell off the most. The ending for ZTD was a huge disappointment. Once again, everybody was trapped in this facility because Zero had the good of mankind in mind. Well, more exactly he had 'Complex Motives', and needed to bring himself into existence even though that creates a paradox of it's own. Then, there's the fact that, assuming as the implication has been that this is the last game in the series, we don't even know who our villain is. It's just some terrorist who we know nothing about. Free the Soul, Brother, Left, Crash Keys, Cradle, throw them all in the same pot cause they're all good guys at the end of the day and you're never going to know who the real bad guy is.   VLR's ending left a huge promise for what ZTD was going to be about; Sigma and Phi trying to stop the outbreak of Radical 6, with the help of some other company from that timeline who never appear in this game. Instead we got a soft boiled, poorly connected rehash of past Zero Escape games where Sigma and Phi played a surprisingly small part.  Overall: Overall this game is a good game, contrary to what everything in my review says. If you liked the other Zero Escape games, you kind of have to play it to experience the ending, but know that it won't live up to it's predessesors in anything other than psychobabble. If you just want a different, story based game with puzzle elements, go for it. You'll definitely find yourself missing something, but it's something unique, and that much is nice. Preferably play the other games first though. More or less just buy the trilogy and be disappointed but not entirely crushed by this one.  Enjoy! ",

            "review_text": "Once upon a time there was a little game called 999: Nine Persons, Nine Hours, Nine Doors (or possibly some other configuration of those three things). It paired room escape puzzles with deeply anime visual novel sequences and plenty of weird random pseudoscientific nonsense, and that's probably about as much as many people got out of it because it was structured in such a way that you didn't get the really amazing, mind-bending twists and revelations until you'd finished it a couple times, which meant repeating at least some of the room escapes and sitting through repeated visual novel bits over and over. And ultimately to really experience the whole thing and get the True Ending (tm) you had to hit all the major permutations. If you did that, it was a heck of a ride. But you really had to work at it to get there.  Then it got a sequel called Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. Similar formula, but this time it exposed the decision flowchart from the get go and let you jump around it at will. And the ways it played with this ability in the actual fiction, as well as the ways it called back to 999 and generally messed with all your expectations were frankly incredible. I could forgive people for being unenthusiastic about 999 because of how many obstacles it put between you and the good stuff, but Virtue's Last Reward was pretty much impeccable. Oh, and the True End? A giant, horrifying, agonizing cliffhanger reveal you almost certainly wouldn't have guessed. But then sales were not great, and every indication was the planned third game in the trilogy wouldn't be made.  Well, here it is. Zero Time Dilemma. If you've played the first two games, you need to play this. That's all there is to it. And if you haven't, you absolutely should not play this until you do, because it is the culmination of two games worth of story. You don't -have- to know this stuff going in - mostly the characters don't - but it will make a world of difference in the impact of what happens in the course of the game, and your familiarity with the returning characters will help parse their motivations and actions in this. But also, frankly...not gonna lie...Zero Time Dilemma is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and it has some incredible twists. But it isn't the best game in the series. That's still VLR. You can unfortunately tell that Zero Time Dilemma was made on a shoestring budget and so the cutscenes are pretty awkwardly rendered, there's a lot of telling and not showing, and the pacing and format are a bit strange for the game overall. This by no means spoiled the game for me and I certainly wouldn't have been willing to leave it at VLR's cliffhanger ending. But it means I wouldn't recommend it as your one and only Zero Escape.",

I never played the previous two games in this series and so it was harder to get into the story then I assume it would have been otherwise.  MORPHOGENETIC FIELD!!!  I did not understand why the designers would have the story jump around like it does; eg from one 'history' where people may be dead that your choices should not have caused to jumping forwards and backwards in the timeline. All I can say is; trust that this is NOT the game 'not saving your decisions' and there is purpose to it all. I do believe they could have improved the experience; maybe by showing exactly where each fragment lay on the timeline BEFORE playing through it, but irregardless I greatly enjoyed this title and fully recommend it to anyone who liked the Saw movies. I do have three additional warnings however. 1) The price tag is a bit steep for what you get at $40, I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale first 2) The first section of the game is a bit slow and repetitive - stick with it, and do not be afraid to make bad choices - you'll be able to change them later 3) DO NOT cheat and look at the passwords guide until the very end or you saw the password in your playthrough but forgot it - those road blocks are there to make you experience the other sections before coming back with the correct answers",

It's out and all I can say is, Spike Chunsoft, Aksys Games, and Kotaro Uchikoshi have made one of the best endings to a trilogy of games, movies, books, or anything in the history of media.   The story is complex, characters are filled with development, the puzzle rooms are gloriously challenging, and writing is superb throughout. It's a game that will interest you from the moment and starts and may even make you a little misty eyed by the time the game shows you it's true ending.  The layout of the game is wholey unique and done expertly. Jumping between different storylines back and forth can be jarring at first but, it all fits together in a way towards the end that no other game ever has done before. All questions that you wanted answered from the past 2 games will be answered. Only major problem is the presentation of the game. The animations look pretty cheap which could be blamed on a small budget and the facial animations almost never match up with what emotion is supposedly being portrayed.   Overall: An incredible and flawed masterpiece that needs to be experienced. Pick it up NOW! 10/10 ",

The writers fail to understand that it might be possible for someone to shut down - or at least go quiet - in a crisis, rather than Emote. As if! The Actors. Were Being. Paid By the time! They Take. To Say! Their Lines. The puzzles are fine, but given the first hour or so involved exactly four player choices, the pointless and frankly stupid deaths were almost a relief. At one point, two characters wake up in a room, missing a third, who is later found dead for plot reasons and the two original characters later fight to the death over who killed the third. Except... it doesn't occur to either of them that perhaps the sinister mastermind WHO MOVED THEM TO THE ROOM WHILE THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT may have been the killer. I mean, the plot is stupid enough for it to be one of the two, but if it was, and they did it because they wanted to be one of the survivors, why didn't they off the other (still knocked out) person at the same time as they killed the first? And then stage a hidden death tableau?  This game is not tense. It is not smart. It is not an exploration of human emotions. It is a series of things that happen for an audience. Don't be that audience. Play something with a more meaningful plot, and better acting, like Space Invaders.",

            "review_text": "  Just in The Nick of Time [h2] Zero Time Dilemma is the finale up to Spike Chunsofts 'Zero Escape' series which started with 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors and was followed up by Virtues Last Reward (both to be soon avaleable on steam). These games are some of the few that I would with no exageration in my say are genious. Evreything about them is purposeful and they somehow answer all of the questions that they raise in such a uniqe, clever and shocking way it is hard not to be at awe at times. I remember that personaly in 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors there was a scene that I was so shocked I litteraly froze for a minute and dropped my DS, this has never happened in a game before and it has only occured again with 'Vitrues Last Reward' and thankfuly 'Zero Time Dilemma' continues evreything that made the original two games so great and they did something that I never in my wildiest dreams thought that Spike Chunsoft could do, they met my ridiculously high exectations and did not let me down at all.    Story   The story of essentialy all of the zero escape games start with the base concept of this: 9 people are trapped in a enclosed space by a mysterious person calling themselves 'Zero', their objective is to escape the area without dying. It seems simple enough but there is always a catch to it that changes with each game. I would explain the catch for Zero Time Dilemma but the problem is that its hard to explain without spoiling anything so the best I can say is that you are split up into 3 different groups consisting of 3 different people in each. Your overal objective is to open up the X door and escape, to do this you need at least of what are called X passes, the problem here is that a X pass is only revealed if somebody dies meaning at least 6 people have to die to make your escape. The game is also broken up into different sections in a 'Beyond Two Souls' kind of way where the time line is intentionaly out of order, the big thing here though is that for the most part characters do not know what happens in other secions due to a amnesia enducing drug that they are given to make them forget each secion. Make sence? No of course it dosent its not supposed to make any sence thats the whole idea around it but just trust me when I say that all of the questions that can be raised by this are all resolved in the ending.     Gameplay   This is a game that is hard to describe on a gameplay standpoint because alot of it is just kind of watching cutscenes, however that is not all that you do. There is alot of escape room puzzles that you must complete a series of puzzles to get the key that will lead you to an escape. These puzzles are usualy followed up with a difficult choice at the end of it that the player has to chose between one of two outcomes. Some times it goes into knowing a certain event, sometimes its just on assumptions of what happens or sometimes it is just plain luck that the player has to take a guess and hope for the best. Again this may not seem like it makes sence but it really does make a huge impact to alot of events near the end of the game    Music   If you have played any of the zero escape games before this dont be expecting anything really new. While the old tracks are incredibly effective and always set a uneasy and atmospheric vibe to the area. But this still unfourtunatley means that there was only a handful of new tracks that were put into the mix, while again effective they lack in variety.    Graphics   While the character designes are surley a step up from the characters in Virtues Last Reward the animations are just unforgivabley bad. They look like if the animatior was told what people looked like while they moved but they had never actually experienced it for themselves before. And for some reason the way that the characters move their mouth are very off, the best way I could describe it is saying that they look like they are trying to get out peanut butter that was stuck to the roof and sides of their mouth, it just kinda moves to much and to jarringly. But other than that the enviroments look nice and the cell shading really does suit the game well    Optimization   Just thought I would throw in this quick note here I was very supprised by the optimization due to alot of options being realized and put into the game, even a option for widescreen displays which almost nothing has    Verdict   Overall Zero Time Dilemma was my biggest shock of the year so far, not because I expected it to be bad but because I thought it could never live up to what I was hoping it would be. What I was hoping for a satisfying ending to my faverioute obscure franchise. If you are reading this and are still unsure please do yourself a favour and buy 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors , to start, it will be out on steam soon, the developers really do deserve more money and more credit for making what is at least for me, the best game of the year so far.

This is an amazing escape-room game, bundled with an incredible story, tense choices and incredible depth in it's choices and consequences.  If you are a fan of 'organic' stories and mysteries, Zero Time Dilemma is an incredible, amazing jewel.   (I haven't played far enough to know if knowledge of the two previous games are required. I will update my review later. So far the games is handling the needed exposition very well, uncovering the (pretty heavy) story of the earlier games slowly enough for you to assimilate while keeping a bit of mystery on the most interesting parts of it. (there's still a few spoilers, and I would really recommend you to try 999 and Zero Escape first. Both are amazing games, the second especially.) I will keep this review up to date.)",

I looked some of the ones up where it was just a factor of luck or going through the probablities a lot. As luck would have it I got probably my hardest puzzle in the game as my first puzzle (the teleporter numbers). Your mileage may vary. Two that really screwed me up were the manufacturing stungun sequence and the study shifting down 7 that would make a negative number. If you contemplated that then you know my pain for a pointless hint I already knew! Doesn't everyone combine everything in their inventory already? My favorite puzzles were moving the shapes around to let one pass. Not sure why.  I didn't really like the art direction here. Phi looks the worst, though Diane the best. Akane's English voice is horrible. I wish they would have used the lady from VLR (at the end of the game when she was young).  Overall I liked VLR better, but you kind of have to play if you played 999 and VLR.",

Since the game’s story is mainly catering to those fans, it’s imperative to play the two predecessors first.   Thankfully the story does not disappoint…even after all those years of waiting, hype, and speculation. As fans are aware Uchikoshi’s genius comes from insanely complex narratives and a barrage of unpredictable but fitting twists. ZTD is the melting pot which combines characters and principles of 999 and VLR. It isn’t trying to be edgy or gory…and everything fits into place.   The gameplay works fine, and blends with the narrative wonderfully. The puzzles are just the right level of difficulty. I liked the presentation and animation too, (even on 3DS). It was a refreshing change from the VN set-up of the previous games. As usual, Shinji Hosoe's soundtrack is on point.   It’s the intense and emotional climax that fans have been waiting for, and I’m just so glad to exist in this timeline.   999/10 would suffer again",

            "review_text": "Ahhhh, the Zero Escape saga. What can I say about it that people haven't already? Between intriguing mystery, exploring the hidden depths and quirks to the colorful characters, and genuinely challenging puzzles I legitimately fell in love with this series from my first play through 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors.  All that being said, while this game is a very nice capstone to the series, it feels just a bit lacking.  Perhaps it has something to do with the shift from visual-novel style to a more Tell Tale Games-esque interactive movie. Only problem is, unlike TTG there's no quick-time events and (whether you love or hate QTE's) that removes a level of immersion from the game. When you're reading the events visual novel style in the first two you can't help but be drawn in, and with TTG knowing that a dialogue choice or QTE waits around every corner means you're constantly on the edge of your seat.  ZTD, however, lacks both of those. You still make choices and explore the consequences that unfold, but it's always after watching a scripted sequence that, admittedly, can run a bit long. The puzzles also feel just a bit less challenging than I'm used to from this series, and the fact that the gameplay is broken up into multiple 'Fragments' means that the story has a disjointed feel to it while trying to play since after each big decision you're getting booted back to the menu to pick a new memory to play out.  Of course, those complaints are middling compared to the fact that this is a worthy conclusion for the Zero Escape Trilogy. Any complaints I may have are pointless since if you're already a fan you've probably already got it and if you aren't you're doing yourself a disservice trying to skip the first two and jump into this.  My overall opinion? A good game, nice way to end the series, but it unfortunately feels like this all really peaked back in Virtue's Last Reward.",

My only suggestion is to avoid D team early on until you get into the problemsolving/puzzle mood by warming up with the other teams.   This game made me interested in the other works of this series.

This is because I feel as though you don't get the full experience and/or some things won't make since if you haven't played the other two. Luckily for those that can't play the other two due to a lack of DS/3DS, 999 and VLR are rumored to get a steam release soon   Now onto the game, I really did enjoy Zero Time Dilemma a lot, but sadly not as much as the other two. Overall, Zero Time Dilemma is a great and fitting ending to the trilogy, and while I have a few of my own gripes with it, it was a really enjoyable experience overall  Pros:   Great story   Soundtrack is amazing as always   Really interesting puzzles, most of which presenting a good amount of challenge   Plenty of moments that make you go 'OOOOHHHHH' when you realize something   Fully-animated cutscenes were actually really cool. I know the animation may not click with some, but I enjoyed it   Really good PC edition, everything ran smoothly and I never had any frame drops   Cons:   A few issues with the story, but I won't list them because spoilers   It may have been just me, but there were times where the story felt way more linear that what I'm used to with Zero Escape games, which I guess worked out well for this particalar game, but it just felt kind of weird to me   As with most Zero Escape games, it takes a little while for the story to pick up, but this may not be that big of an issue for some   If you played and enjoyed 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, then you'll definitely enjoy Zero Time Dilemma. If you haven't played the previous games, then I highly recommend playing them first before playing this one",

            "review_text": "First, as others have said, Zero Time Dilemma is the third game in its series. While there is some in-game context given to familiarize new players with the storyline, it is still highly recommended that you be familiar with the plot of the first two games in order to understand this one.  With that out of the way, this installment was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, though I wouldn't say it was perfect by any means. For example, if they wanted to transition from still images to animated cutscenes, they should have gone all out and fully animated every detail. Instead, the camera often cuts away from the characters when a significant action is performed (such as one character attacking another) and we only hear a sound effect to signal that said action took place. To me this signifies either a limited budget or a lack of effort. However, the music was good, the dialogue/voice acting was entertaining, and the events of the game were presented in a coherent manner. The room escape puzzles were the perfect level of difficulty; they were challenging enough to require some thought, but not so difficult that I was stuck for hours on a single puzzle.  But let's talk about the one aspect that the Zero Escape series is known for: the story. You can expect the same sort of mind-blowing, alternate timeline laden story in this game as you experienced in the previous two. While I wouldn't say that this game introduces any ingenious new concepts to the overarching mythos of the series, it takes what made the other two games so awesome and cranks it all up several notches. More death, more violence, more paranoia and backstabbing, more alternate timelines, more time-loop miracles that completely screw with your brain. Killing off other characters is not just something that happens to take place in certain timelines, but is now a requirement for the remaining characters to escape the facility they are trapped in. A group of characters can seem completely peaceful and cooperative at one moment and then suddenly proceed to turn on each other in a matter of minutes. Needless to say, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole game.  The one part that did leave me scratching my head a little was the ending. While many old questions are answered, new ones are raised - and therefore left open to interpretation because the developers have apparently stated that this is the last game in the series. While it wouldn't necessarily be unfitting to end it right here, I certainly hope they reconsider, since this game's ending leaves open the possibility for a fourth installment. Nonetheless, you should definitely get this game if you enjoyed the first two.",
