            "review_text": "The most boring game ever.   Everything is slow and there is no excitement to anything. Make sure to turn 'NPC Threats' off, because the only enemies are wolves that spawn when you pick up key items, and walking away from these wolves is pretty much the game forcing you to backtrack in order to despawn them which makes them just a waste of time. The setting is really dull too and moving around in it is clunky due to the bad controls. The worst part about the game is the gameplay itself, which is nothing but walking around in a large but empty world at a very slow pace. This makes finding items for puzzles and then bringing them to where you think they would work a major pain.  About the puzzles: They are garbage. The game's progression is tied to you picking up one specific item after another, you pick an item up just to use it on the next item which will then let you do something to get another item. Missed an item? Better search everywhere while moving like a snail. Most of your time will be spent walking around an empty area clicking on everything to find that one item you need. Also, good luck finding the matches. Putting them inside a 80% opacity glass case on top of a grave was not the best idea.   By the way, the game is not scary.  EDIT: I read the Steam Store page for this game and got angry, so I'm gonna pick apart each point.  --High detailed realistic graphics. Not really. The village itself is very boring and weird-looking (many of the houses are one room for some reason), and the forest area is plagued by bad pop-in problems with shadows. The same 3 moveable rocks are repeated throughout the whole game. The lighting is alright.  --Explore open environment with realistic physics in the Greek countryside. 'Realistic physics'? You mean like how you can put a chair through a solid wall if you move quick enough? How about whenever something moves along the floor or touches the floor, it makes the same sound at the same volume like 20 times in a row really fast and sounds like ♥♥♥♥? The rocks are easier to throw than a glass jar in this game. Also, can you really call it an 'open environment' when 90% of all the houses and buildings are locked?  --Use stealth tactics and agility to survive.  'Stealth tactics' is wrong, it is a blatant lie. There is no stealth in this game, enemies show up out of nowhere and you'll never see them before they see you and start chasing you. And there is no running in this game, you walk and enemies walk at about the same speed. They chase you at a walking pace until the game decides to give up and despawn the enemy.   --Use physics-based objects to defend yourself. This statement is solely meant to cover for the lies of the previous statement since running away and stealth are not an option to anyone who doesn't want to backtrack even more than they have to.   --Challenging item–based Puzzles with simple interface. I already discussed the puzzles and why they suck, but the interface is also bad. You get like 12 item slots but you'll never come close to filling that since you use items after getting them. It looks and feels ugly and rushed.   --Dark atmosphere with eerie sounds. What 'eerie sounds'? That doesn't even make sense because there are no eerie sounds at all, or anything close to that description. Also the dark atmosphere is not something to be proud of since it makes no sense either. The moonlight is so strong that it creates lightrays around every object, but everything on the ground is still pitch-black???  --Original storyline Sonic fanfictions are also 'original storylines', this is yet another meaningless statement.  Don't buy it, not even on sale.",

            "review_text": "This is worst game I have encountered during the last two years. Both the grahpics and atomsphere are to some extent attractive, but there is literally no Gameplay at all... The plot is cliche, empty and rather approching to stuipidty. 80%+ of the whole game is jogging around the landscape, with a dog and a robed figure randomly jumping out and surprising you. I love AVG and played more than 30+ AVG. I can say with confidence that this game is one of the lousiest I have ever played. I don't recommend it at all. It is totally a waste of your precious time.",

            "review_text": "First off, you are better off trying a good mod for Amnesia.  If you do play the game, turn NPC Threat off; wolves are OP and annoying.  Eleusis does a few things right, but a lot of things wrong. The story is decent and original, and the game is pretty being built with the Unreal Development Kit. Everything else is horrible though. The controls are tank controls. The movement speed of the main character needs to be fixed; running actually feels like walking, and walking actually feels like crawling. NPCs in this game are just there to annoy you and really don't feel like a threat. If you don't have a rock on you at all times, expect to die alot, so just turn NPC combat off. Puzzles are either clear and easy or unclear and just difficult. It would have been nice if they would have put more thought into them.  Overall, avoid buying this game. Save your money, go download a decent Amenesia mod and have fun with that.",

            "review_text": "First off, I will say that Eleusis has some nice graphic design and a nicely spooky atmosphere. It was a project with potential, but I sadly cannot recommend it. I completed the game in six hours, and a good portion of that was spent wandering around trying to figure out what to do next. A lack of hand holding is one thing, but providing little to no direction is quite another. But the big thing is that for me at least, Eleusis just isn't scary. And that's a pretty big failing for a horror game. Nearly all hostile encounters are scripted and you can clearly tell when you're in danger and when you're not. The plot is pretty thin and I saw the big twist at the end coming from a mile away. Maybe if the devs had had more time, money and/or staff, this could have been better, but as is I can't give it my seal of approval.",
