            "review_text": "07/12/2015/ For those who won a key on orly: I'm also there. Meaning that I will have no regret to report any copy/paste of my review. Some of you may have experienced that with Galaxy Admirals. Do you really want to have your 10 credits revoked because you're too lazy to try the game and to write some lines?  I wanted to believe in Moonbase 332. I didn't care about the graphics but I wanted to believe in a little FPS that I could enjoy.  Moonbase 332 having been in many bundles, I got a key for myself thanks to that. I decided to give it a try yesterday because I was wondering if it would be any better than Galatic Hitman. And it is better than the latter. At least, levels are differents, you have a lot of weapons and the enemies are moving.  You're arriving in a secret base used by Austria to develop a virus that would have infected Germany. And guess who will clean it? You!  While the story isn't the plot of the year, I was immediately thrown into my biggest mistake: changing binding keys. Yep, it was still in beta. But I would have never imagined that I would loose my reload button. I couldn't reload ANY weapon. Any! I had to wait until I wasted my bullet to reload.  And the reload action.... My god, why is it so slow for the dual weapons? Even other games take less time for that.  I never understood why Zombie Nazis, walkyries with crossbows and slashers appeared in the game... or flying skulls for the matter. For a game about infected people, the developer added some paranormal stuff.  But the best? I don't know how the zombies with bazookas managed to hit me even when hidden. And I was dodging the rockets, I really was. Apparently it's vain because they're hitting you each time. That's how I managed to loose many of my lives.  Because you have 10 lives before a gameover... and you have to keep counting. Because the HUD only shows the weapons and your ammo. No health bar. You don't know if you need to reload a save or not.  About the weapons, they're nice: the shotgun is powerful through three bullets isn't enough. I couldn't enjoy two weapons because despite showing having still ammo, they refused to reload when it was at 0. I cursed that because they were among the most powerful! Yay!  I don't care about the graphics but when you see the last bonus level, you're asking yourself why it's more 'alive' than the main story. And in general, bonus levels are refreshing.  And why did the dev ignore completely puzzles? I mean, the last bonus level showed that you could have mixed shooting and brain. But no, you're just running around to find buttons to open doors.  The big problem is also that I've crashed constantly at the end of a loading level. The only answer you'll get is 'reload the autosave - problem solved'. Yeah, apart that my computer is in the recommended specs and that having the message 'FPSC stopped working' without any cause is hard.  I would have been more positive about the game if it wasn't for the crash, some problems with enemies with bazookas and my ♥♥♥♥ed up rebinding, though I think that the dev will probably patch that one.  Between Galatic Hitman and Moonbase 332, choose Moonbase 332 because the dev did work on the game and didn't take you as fools. But in the end, I can't recommend it if the game is always crashing. I really can't. Would the problem disappear, then, you can go ahead and try it.  Sorry to put a 'No' for this game. I really wanted to believe in the game. I was happy to see the keys in the bundle. I put it in my wishlist. In the end, I still want to believe that there will some improvements though....",

            "review_text": "  ★★☆☆☆ This was a alright game I guess, I had a bit of fun with it, has some cool weapons but they aren’t balanced properly, throughout the game I just used the second weapon you get because everything after that felt weaker and took longer to kill enemies with. I encounter like 6 bugs in the game like the floor missing textures, glitching through areas by accident and having to start the level over, holding a certain gun which is also missing its textures causes the game to crash if you have it equipped when loading into a new level. This game is just riddled with bugs and annoyances.  I do however slightly like the game, it was a mediocre type of fun, the best part of the whole game is the last bonus level, where you need to figure out how to get out of a house through reading riddles and solving puzzles , that was really cool, I would definitely recommend a game that played like that. However I won’t recommend this game, it was too bad… 2/5 ",
