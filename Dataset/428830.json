            "review_text": "Seems I'm one of the first to review.  Save the Dodos is a puzzle game which revolves around sliding the map around to guide dodo birds into a doorway. It's that simple. Except it's not, because the difficultly will increase. And if your like me, you will have a tough time. The game will throw in other modes and enemies into play, along with powerup birds that can help beat a frustrating level. I'm sure the devs will come out with some new content in the future, and that is my investment. You will get some good time off of this game.",
