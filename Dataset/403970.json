            "review_text": "I think the team behind this game is very talented and has executed their vision exceptionally. My main beefs are witih their vision.  Pros: * I run 21:9 3440 x 1440 and the game immediately picked up the setting and ran with it. A+ * The story telling is grand. * The lore is wonderful. * The visuals are so pretty. * The responsiveness is there. Why the downvote?  Cons: * The combat is clunky and unrewarding. For me, combat is primary. I feel like the devs started with a premise and this premise was a bad starting position that led to bad conclusions. This premise was probably something along the lines of 'let's have a party-based combat system centered around collision physics'. It sounds awesome, but the reality is dull and disconnected.   * The introductory fight is a really bad intro. You dominate that fight, which is misleading. Subsequent fights are much harder. I felt like it didn't matter what I did during the intro fight. * White damage is abysmally low compared to special attacks. The disparity is far too great. This requires pausing the game relentlessly to run a tactical special for each party member every 1.5 seconds. Unlike the intro fight, this is so far the opposite, that it felt oppressive. I had to nuance every single move. There wasn't a moment where I felt like I could kick ♥♥♥, not even in a small way. * The physical collisions felt like they got in the way more than they added to the experience. Friendlies trying to path around one another failed all the time, even when there was room! Managing physical collisions and movement is great when you just have one character to manipulate (think Counter-strike). This was just a chore in this game. * Loot, gearing, and character growth were very shallow. Don't expect the game to shine in these areas. * The camera always center-focused on the selected party member. This was aggravating when trying to view the battle field. There is no camera pan during combat. * Combat felt like homework to get throguh so I could get back to the story. * Targeting misfires regularly. Sometimes I would pause the game, but a specific enemy would not be target-able. I would then unpause and pause immediately, and then I can target said enemy. * The world map is just a digitized mini figure that you move around like a chess piece. If an encounter 'pops', you go to battle. This model can work, but the world map is actually very small when you realize you can only move to and from specific points of interest on the map. There is no free roam of any kind. That said, the integrated story-telling on the world map was just awesome...so good. I would be so forgiving of the encounter-based combat if combat was actually fun.  ",

            "review_text": "The Dwarves, the newest game from THQ Nordic is... quite the peculiar thing. The game revolves around an amazing story, full of twists and mysteries (instead of the opposite), tactical combat which is a mixture of Pillars of Eternity, DOTA and Starcraft 2. Crazy explanation, isn't it? It has the real-time + pause option of Pillars of Eternity (and thus, sadly, the 'I don't have anyone around me, so I'm gonna do nothing while my friends are dying' AI), the Click + QWE skill combat sytem from DOTA and the 1-2-3-4 hero selection + micromanagement from Starcraft, which makes it easy to get into The Dwarves for fans of these games.  The GOOD:  1. It is a game that revolves around the story, instead of the opposite. As such, the story is way more compelling and interesting. It is by far the strongest thing about this game, and by many accounts, worth the admission price alone. I, myself, was captivated by it. 2. The art style does the fantasy theme justice and never lets off. 3. The soundtrack is amazing. Blind Guardian made a great theme for the game. 4. The game provides some choices that do affect the gameplay to a certain extent, which is always nice to see. 5. Skill threes (albeit minimalistic) add to the replayability of the game. 6. The 11 playable characters add a lot to the game, allowing you tomix and match parties that would best suit your tactics. 7. The tactical combat is really good, and is making good use of the terrain. For each battle, you get to select up to 4 characters and equip them with a single item - be it a trinket that boosts something, or a potion. You can also send enemies flying into pits or other places where there will meet their inevitable death at the bottom in many satisfying ways. I felt a good amount of challenge on normal. Next playthough goes on a higher difficulty, absolutely. 8. You can easily do a few play-throughs, spanning about 25-30 hours, unless you are a crazy completionist and want to do everything on the first go.  And now, the BAD... and it is a lot.  1. The game is overpriced for its length. It took me just above 9 hours to finish it, and as I usually judge my gameplay time by Euros per Hour, 10 Hours for 40 euros is quite the rip-off. 2. You will fight orcs of various statures and sizes (yes, including ogres, which makes it all the more Lord of the Ring-y) and the occasional Älfar boss. So much for enemy variety... well isn't that a huge turn-off for many people. 3. The fact that the AI is relatively stupid, doesn't really help the game. You really need to channel your inner Starcraft 2 spirit and micromanage as best you can. Thank God you can pause in this game... 4. Sometimes it feels like you can go to a specific point on the tactical map, but you can't because the grid of the game doesn't allow you. This causes tons of frustrations in combat and while exploring towns. 5. WHY THE HELL do I lose the battle when one of my guys falls down from a 1-2 meter high ledge (and breaks his/her neck I guess), when an orc just shrugs it off and takes barely any damage?! Enough said. 6. Pretty much every battle has its tactical quirks, and while it can be a good thing, it may also lend to a good amount of frustration before you win it and/or find the best team to complete it. 7. There are characters that are obviously better than others... Which really destroys immersion and makes you pick them till the end of the game, in order to make battles easier. 8. While it looks like you have a huge map, little happens on it apart from random encounters (with orcs, duh) and the occasional lore segment. As such, it feels like a streamlined choose your own adventure game book... 9. I wish there were more ways to complete a tactical combat than 'Kill all enemies', 'Get all characters to the end of the level', or 'Kill a certain NPC'. While these three are sort of kind of enough, there could have been more outcomes. Why not get someone captured if he/she doesn't manage to get away on time and rescue them later? 10. Choices matter or only a few occasions (to gain a companion for example), which always makes me question why give us, gamers, choices when the outcome will be similar. 11. Even though you have many Points of Interest to traverse, ultimately you are forced through bottlenecks in order to progress the game. 12. There could have been way more side missions, lore segments and battles. The potential for those is there, the developers just didn't put more effort into the game...  Conclusion:  I am recommending this game to crazy Lord of the Rings fans or to everyone when it hits 50% or more off, in order to merit its purchase price. The captivating story and the tactical combat are very strong selling points of this game, but they are largely overshadowed by the lack of enemy variety and the small amount of side activities to do. I enjoyed myself thoroughly, and while the BAD outweighs the GOOD by quite a few points, I can't discard the fact that I was very much into the game, and I was so captivated by it. As such, it gets my thumbs up - but if you are on the fence about The Dwarves, wait until it goes on sale.",

            "review_text": "The game is good, has decent characters, has a decent story progression, but it's not great all the times, the game has some AI pathfinding issues just like many other Unity games, these issues may lead your characters to die frequently, or just hit each other more than they hit the enemy (the friendly fire in this game is also unforgiving so too bad for you g.g), I liked the main character for the most of the time, except for the borderline emotional roller coaster , that makes the character arc looks weak sometimes, one thing that also bothers me is boindil frenzy that happens too often (he strikes everything near, EVERYTHING including you and he does not heal) has a lore reason too but even so, he just does not have HP enough to go crazy and live after if he's just too far from the others and you always have to babysit one of the coolest guys in game, there's also the issue with the arrows hitting you through solid objects and the freezing in one place bug that happens sometimes. Besides all of that, I had fun, the animations sometimes are just great, the attention to small details is something that I also liked and I will be waiting for a proper sequel, maybe one with less bugs and better AI, epicness awaits the children of Vraccas . 7/10",

Pro's Dwarves! Easy to follow along lore. Excellent voice acting. Amazing cinematic. Decision making. Alternative paths for your quest. Likeable and no flat charcters. Music is spot on. The area's you go to and fight in are well crafted. (Besides the camera clipping in a few.)  Bugs/con's  Camera clipping Audio sometimes does not sync with cinematic's Not much variety in music. Large healing potions do not heal. Game can be very short if you do not do what side quests there are. Hero has a rommantic relationship with someone else and it felt force. Ai pathing can be clunky.  Final notes: I would buy the game because i feel all the con's and bugs are very small and can easily be fixed. I have had been having a itch to play a game sort of like this with dwarven charcters in it. But alas no games intill now. Its a def buy if on sale and it made my love of dwarves ignite again. If its full price. It would be up to you. I finshed the game in 12 hours.",

The game feels like it should have been better polished before being released. The bigger problem is that it is just too short. When i got this on the release date, I expected it to be similar to other western RPGs. This means I expected a 20-40 hour experience with a lot of gameplay. This game is closer to 8 or 9 hours with little content past the main plot. That said, what is there is the great foundation for a game. The story is what makes the game work, but when I consider that, it makes more sense to recomend that potential players read the books instead. My best recomendation is to wait for a sale with a heavy discount. If I had not payed so much for the game, I would perhaps of been more inclined to recomend it.",

If you are versed in German, I can actually recommend the voiceover. It's the best thing about this game hands down.  - This game would look pretty if it came out in 2002 - Only covers one of the five books = 40€ for 7 hours of gameplay - Baldurs Gate 2, a 16 year old game had better AI than this - Customization is pitiful for an RPG. You basically choose one activatable charm. Levelups sometimes, like once or twice per hero, let you choose between two underwhelming abilities. - The fight system is stupid. You basically only deal damage with special attacks and you constantly need to pilot all the heroes personally: First to stand directly where they are supposed to be, then to execute the attack. Multiply that by 4 heroes and then lament a movement system with units that constantly bump each other around. I've lost so many attack points to randomly changing positioning, you wouldn't believe it.",

I stumbled upon a couple of bugs and very performance-heavy scenes which forced me to reload and turn the quality settings down. The game looks appealing but I don't know where the performance goes judging by the minimal visual difference of the lower quality settings. The menu and character navigation still feel like they could use a bit more polish, too. Everything feels a bit clunky and slow. Overall it feels like a good start but like a game that was published too early (I'd probably say it's beta) with a price that doesn't fit the content. I recommend taking another look at the game when there's a sale since I feel it's a bit too expensive for 7 hours of full gameplay (with all sidequests) and the issues I described earlier.",

The story, although cliché, I enjoyed. You’ve seen it before, but it was clearly handled, for the most part, with much care and attention. However, the gameplay will be unpardonably messy for some, while others will be able to get through it with some effort. It’s a situation where the 8-10 hour campaign is too short for the story to cover everything it should, yet long enough for what’s on offer in the gameplay department. What isn’t justified, however, is the 40 euros price tag, given how there’s not that many reasons to replay the campaign once it’s done. Fans of the books may feel differently about The Dwarves, however, to those approaching the universe for the first time through this title, some caution is recommended.
