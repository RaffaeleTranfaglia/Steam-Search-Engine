            "review_text": " Pros  - The game has an incredible number of customization options and offers a wealth of variety in viable strategies, particularly if you're using the balance mod practically everybody seems to be using. You can manage fine details of your empire's war machine that most games would abstract, and the game is clearly aimed at people who get giddy at the prospect of developing and testing warships to maintain an edge over current and prospective enemies. - Despite the dated graphics and sound design, fleet battles manage to be enjoyable, and I've killed hours just messing with designs and testing them in the simulator. The weapons have a good amount of variety in their look and feel, and the encouragement toward mixing specialist designs in a fleet means that the enemy's fleet composition can significantly affect your tactics in the field. - The AI will happily sign my Treaty of Imminent Backstabbing and praise me as a peacemaker, because the AI cannot comprehend the English language (I guess that's kind of a con, but I've never seen a game with AI that could deduce when it was being threatened or insulted through a text prompt, so I'm just happy for the source of amusement).   Cons  - You're not really given a choice in terms of how much detail you want. You're going to engage with all the detail, or you're going to lose. The learning curve can be very steep, and the UI is not friendly to new players. Forget not holding your hand; SE5 is pushing you down in the street over and over and laughing at you while you try to cross. Enjoy giving orders tediously one at a time across your huge empire until you figure out queues, because the game isn't going to nudge you in that direction one bit. - The balance mod is almost necessary, because the base game doesn't feel like it was balance-tested sufficiently, and the built-in AI is pretty much useless. Even with the balance mod, the AI doesn't have a good chance against a player with at least a decent understanding of the system, which only makes the transition from single-player to multi-player less comfortable, because if you're used to fighting the AI, human players will kill you before you even figure out how they built so fast (it's spaceyard rushing and their management of that emergency build thing the game never hints at the importance of). - There is only war. That depth I mentioned earlier doesn't extend to politics, economics, or anything else like that. Your empire is a machine to kill other empires, and everything else just kind of feels bolted-on. If you don't enjoy designing ships to patrol spacelanes, or you get bored of it, there's not much to fall back on. You can win through diplomacy, but it's far too easy to be any fun.   Bottom Line  If you're looking for a combat-focused space 4x that's so deep it hurts, SE5 is one of the best I've played. You definitely want the balance mod, though.",

            "review_text": "I was pretty excited to see Space Empires 5 here after I got SE4 from sale on  gog.com  - But I was utterly and completely disappointed with this game. The new resolution messed up the UI badly and the icons that were previously very visible are now very hard to make out. Even if you get used to it, you'll find out that the game is in that regard fundamentally the same as the previous part and loads of the new stuff I've seen is largely superficial or outright stupid.  -Parts placement: In SE4, you just added components to the ships, here you have a 2D-View of your ship with lots of slots to put your parts on. It's utterly redundant though, as the placement doesn't seem to do anything (surround your crew quaters with engines? why not!) Additionally, there are three decks for these slots and the new view makes it hard to see what you got on your ship already.  -Race Creation: They put in new options for race creation. Mostly, it's cosmetic and allows you to e.g. describe the physical make-up of your species and can choose the ship designs independently from each other (unlike SE4). The new social structure your empire has ultimately added just a little bonus to various aspect. Instead of making each government unique and stuff, you just have a sliding scale of peaceful/research bonuses vs. war/combat bonuses (for some reason Anarchy is on the far end of peaceful gameplay and Hivemind is for aggressive play, everything in the middle is when you are indifferent). Oh and you can of course give your leader the title 'Grand Emperor Führer Overlord' if you are in a peaceful democracy, because that totally makes sense and all.  -Research: Oh god. In SE4, you just picked all areas in which you research and then the game allocated all your research points automagically. Either split evenly or one after another. The new system requires you to allocate the points with sliders which is incredibly cumbersome and you can't just enter the amount you want with a keyboard either. The option to automatically (re)allocate points is missing entirely. This is furthermore worsened by the fact that the Research tree was broadened to include stuff that no player would ever research unless he knew the techtree. I mean if you research Energy Beam Weapons, you know you can laz0r your enemies harder afterwards. But please tell me why you would research Ethics in a game like that? Would you have known that it protects you from espionage actions? Also, gaining new ship hulls is now a crawl, while you could get the base ships (Death Star-Sized warships) within 7 research steps in SE4, you now need five times as much, because each shiphull size is now it's own research field.  I could elaborate on every aspect this game has to offer now, but given the amount of content it predessor already had, this could probably fill a book.  What I noticed about this game is that loading between turns and other stuff (e.g. generating the maps) is much longer and low-end machines might perform rather slow, a problem SEIV doesn't have.  Ultimately, if you like 4x Strategy games and this game seems really interesting to you, get SE4. There is no reason to choose this game over the prequel.",

            "review_text": "Oh well, Space Empires V.  With Balance mod, the AI and the overall fun of this game is really nice.  However, i cannot recommend this game even though I love the hex/scanner design and 3D graphics. I really do, with all the 4x game complexivity in space.  The Interface is so clunky, and does not work/glitters/lags on newer end systems, making the game barely playable. There are couple of fixes, but they have limited effect.  if you are prepared to spend most of your times fighting the interface, you're good to go.",

            "review_text": "Played much more than what the tooltip says, as i got this game in the very early years of Steam. Must have played for several hundred hours at least.  SEV does have several things going for it;  - Micromanagement galore. You have control over a LOT of things in this game, and they all really matter. Ground combat, space combat, population management, ship design.. and that's just the first layer. - Combat is fun. YOu can also experiment with your ship designs in a simulator against your own designs or what enemy ships you know. - Many race creations options, and they are all valid. - Loads of research options, both wide and deep. Afaik, all of it is usefull, and its goes far as far as options it offers. - Boarding, stealing techs, blowing up suns, building ringworlds ect ect. - Ships and troopers trying to flee combat when crippled, allowing scattered survivors to escape (.. or not). -Supply and ammo management make ship design require a bit more care, plus making having support/supply ships to back up your warships important.  To note, Vanilla balance is a bit all over the place, but using Captain Kwok's Balance mod make this game so, SO much better. Go get it!  Buuut, SEV does have severals problems.  - The UI is clunky, cluttered and heavy. Too many (useless) options presented at once. At the time i was fine with it, today i can barely tolerate it. - THe engine is weak and really struggle with displaying your stuff on the strategic layer once you get 100+ ships in a system. Nearly unplayable (at the time i played, years ago) when i was busy moving around several fleets of 100+ ships as the lag was that high. No idea how it would fare on my current machine. It did make for epic wars however, when they did get there. - Multiplayer is utterly primitive by today's standarts.   But despite that, i keep thinking of this game in a positive fashion as its one of the very few that gave me all that freedom in the sheer depth and width of options, choices and designs i could DO. The options. ALL the choices. ALL of them, it made them work. I find myself wishing for more of that SEV's toolbox in 4X games i play right now, like Stellaris.  If that game could get a new update/iteration with today's standarts but keeping its good points? Its weaknesses are really about UI and engine frankly. I'd buy it. I'd buy it HARD.",

It's a GREAT game, just not for a Steam re-release. If you're eager to try this game, go to the 4th one in the series (also on Steam); it works like a charm for my PC and installs all the necessary files. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I first had this game I was 15 and lived with my mother; I got the boxed version of this game.
