Dialogues are not booring anymore compared with previous Gothic parts. Combat system is much easier compared with previous parts. The thing I really dislike about this game is Open World. Like, you can't go anywhere without a premission, or if you don't have a right key or something else, you just can't walk around like you could back in 1/2/3, I would say that it's like auto balanced game - you complete the quest, you move to next area, where you will need to fight against your lvl creatures, then you complete this main quest again and you have a premission to next area, where you fight against your lvl creatures and so on. I don't really like that type of gameplay. Back in Gothic 1/2/3.. You just start the game and you can already die in first minutes, if you go somewhere random, because there was no such thing as this ''auto balance''. When I play this game, i feel like i'm playing a different RPG game, it's fun, but it's not Gothic anymore. I bought Arcania + Gothic pack (6games together) for just 5$, If you ask me - Is this game worth 5$? then my answer is yes, you should give it a try. If you ask me - Is this game worth 20$? Then my answer is no, there are other nice games for 20$ out there.   ",

Initially, the game starts a bit slow, but it becomes fun after the first part is complete.  The gameplay is much easier than the usual Gothic experience, if you get past the initial stages. It has some nice additions too, e.g. the ability to roll in order to dodge attacks.  The game is very short, it ends before it becomes boring. The plot is very linear, like a children tale.  Adviced for very young players. ",

            "review_text": "I´ve played the old Gothics and loved them. This title is a little bit tricky. You can´t compare it to the roleplayness of the older ones. Especially because you can´t interact with obvious things with obvious effects. I know, I know, there´s a setting, where you can enable or dissable roleplay element, like cooking or 'sleeping' but it doesn´t give you effects. For example you can´t skip the night in a bed. Or regenerate health in a bed. i don´t actually know why this is not possible, because it´s even possible in the older ones. Most people be like: Ok i jump ingame, set difficulty to normal and maybe enjoy something. But that´s wrong. In my opinion you can only play on hard or gothic (very hard). Easy: Is just you are running through the world and killing Undeads with a kitchen knife. On normal it´s a little bit harder but still not a good experience. On hard it´s almost perfect. It´s not unfair, but not too easy. It´s a challenge. For example you can easily be killed by 6 or more Bloodflies. I´m almost at 100 health and have the best equipment you can get for this chapter of the world and it´s the perfect difficulty. 'Gothic' is for the experienced player. But with 'experienced' I don´t mean someone who played the older Gothics. This is far away from being a 'real' gothic. You could compare this to Risen 2/3. This difficulty would be ok, but in my opinion it´s ridiculos how they don´t stop the attacking-chain (infinite combined attacks) Now something about the world. Now to the world. If you played the older Gothics, you most likely think it´s an open-worldgame, too. Wrong. It hasn´t an open world. You have one great island, where you fight from chapter to chapter. For example you can´t get from the beginning to the place where the game should end. But it´s not so bad, because you have a really good teleporting-system. No, sorry I was joking. The teleport system is useless. Imagine. You have points A, B, C and D. all of those places have a teleporter, which can be unlocked by just going to it and being near to it. You want from point A to point D. It´s not like you can teleport there, naaaaaah. You need to go to teleporter A, you teleport to teleporter B, you walk all the way through the island to teleporter C, to teleport to the final teleporter D. That´s how the system works. You basically have 2 connected teleporters where you can teleport between. So it could be a disaster. If you forgot something at the beginning, like a Tomb with a piece of an antique rune. You need to get 30 (not sure) of this to get this rune. And with this teleporting system, I only have one advice: NEVER forget about something. NEVER. Ok, that where many negative aspects of the game. Is it still good? Yes. I play it for like the 3rd time and I still enjoy it. Oh, and i have something to say to all the mages: The magic-system is crap. You only have 3 spells (lightning, fire and ice). You can upgrade them to do more damage and have a bigger range, but it´s a shame compared to the older gothics. There are some scrolls, but they are exactly the same thing, as you can learn. Just a little bit better. Maybe. You can´t summon a rain of fire or a huge demon. Not with ArcaniA. I still enjoy this game, so i rate 7/10 points. Because it´s not actually that bad. The landscapes are beautyful. It´s just a nobrainer to play sometimes. But it also have contra-aspects. (I´m sorry for my bad english, if I did some grammatic mistakes)",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed the ever loving hell outta this game. First off it has some God awful design, it has repeating NPCs every three characters you come across, it's as linear as I've ever seen a rpg, and its so stupidly charming it makes me chuckle. I like the people in this world, I like how the protagonist gets sick and tired of helping out ever moron out there. It's what I imagine a game to be like when A group of the most talented developers on earth get forced to do something on a shoestring budget. That soundtrack however, is just fantastic. this game is far far better than the risen games, it's simplistic to be sure, but deep enough to get your money's worth, and entertaining enough to pay twice what they're asking for.   I bought this game a few years back on the 360, beat it and had a blast with it. When I found it on steam, figured why not give it another go? I'm glad I did, its fun to see it all again (only with a much better coat of paint) and have found that it runs fairly well on any modern hardware.",

            "review_text": "I am not a Gothic fan; I have not played previous games in the series. I came to Arcania without expectations colored by the previous games. I chose 'recommended' only because Arcania is not a terribly bad game. It's a fairly mediocre RPG. There are better games out there, no question. But if you're in an RPG dry spell and you can get Arcania on sale, it's not a bad 40 or so hours. It's also pretty stable, the only crash I had was after minimizing several times.  The graphics are fine for 2010. The game lacks AA but the jaggies didn't really bother me here. I did have problems with the horizon between the sky and sea blinking constantly, but I don't know if that's an original flaw in the game or it just isn't aging well with newer graphics cards and drivers. For the most part the game looks pretty good. The big exception is the human characters. In dialogs the hair is frequently translucent and faces can look horrible.  For me, the strength of Arcania lies in its combat (melee at least, I didn't use bow and arrow much at all). I chose to focus on melee and go sword &amp; board. The combat relies on flurries and power swings. The flurry system is very similar to combat in The Witcher. Combine that with dodge rolling to escape getting hit and you have a fairly engaging melee combat system. I thought melee combat in Arcania was more engaging than in any Elder Scrolls game I've played (even though, yes, every Elder Scroll game I've played is overall much, much better than Arcania).  The magic system is very simplistic - 3 types of magic (fire, frost, electric) with added features gained on leveling up the appropriate skill. The magic system enhances the melee combat nicely: you can paralyze opponents with the electricity spell or slow them with the frost spell, before attacking them. But it's nothing like the complexity in Two Worlds 2.  Crafting is a bit of a let down. It's all done in a menu, no need to be at a bench or specific location. I found weapon and armor crafting to be almost useless (except for the one quest specific crafting of a weapon). Alchemy and cooking was more robust with a decent selection of potions and recipes to buff/heal your character in various ways.   The story is fairly standard - an unknown man (you cannot play as a female) saves the world. The story starts off as a revenge tale, which would have been just fine, but by the end it morphs into a save the world cliché. The game is pretty straight forward. There is the main quest and various side quests. There are no factions to join or advance in like in Elder Scroll games or Two Worlds (1 and 2). Arcania is not open world like Oblivion or Skyrim. Various sections of the world open up as you advance the main quest, similar to Two Worlds 2 or The Witcher.  I've played worse RPGs. Arcania is stripped down and bare bones compared to something like Oblivion or The Witcher. I had fun with it considering its limitations. If I had to do it all over again, I would have waited to get Arcania on sale if I had a fantasy RPG itch that couldn't be scratched in any other way. It definitely wasn't worth the $50 I paid back in 2010. But given that I bought it, I don't think it was a total waste of my money.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls - a frenetic knights &amp; skeletons offering that puts the full emphasis of gameplay on combat, which is excellent if you have the machine to run it. Arcania 4, like the past titles in the series does not cater exclusively to the speed smasher of buttons, but does offer a bit of storyline, great graphics (remember, it's not a new title), enough action to keep the player awake and on edge and there's plenty of small details that push the game up the scale to an overall 7.8, in my humble opinion. Graphics are slightly dated as is the copyright so I don't slam the title for graphics that don't meet the standards set by Skyrim! Graphics 8 / Action is plentiful and combat is adjustable in the settings menu so you can adapt it to your personal style of melee combat. Our hero is seen from a 3rd person POV, a slight downer. Action 8.5 / Storyline is simple and straight forward, boy loves girl, girl's father dislikes boy, boy must complete 3 quests to win his approval. Along the way he finds others in need and helps them out, which generally means killing monsters and bad guys like it's a Olympic game and he wants nothing but gold! Weapons, armor, and bottles of potions are found in chests and these are accessed easy enough by pressing the 'E' key, there are no locks, or at least, I have yet to encounter one. Storyline 7 / Presentation is done with a somewhat humorous approach, though mostly dark humor is used. I only played for 3 hours, but I want to play a lot more, and I will, once I get some sleep! Being retired has advantages, but there are dangerous facets to it as well. I stay up at times for 36 hours, 24-29 of those spent in Skyrim, or in a pitched combat situation whilst playing Battlefield 4 on the PS4, and there are times when I simply randomly select one of the 40+ games I have on Steam and reintroduce myself to it. It's all good, but there's no time for other things, like playing excellent titles such as Aracnia 4 on my laptop. Overall game 7.8 but I always bear in mind the date it was first introduced and the number of serious upgrades from then to now, which shows how the industry really feels about us gamers, the ones who buy their titles without too much price ♥♥♥♥♥ing, and play them until we're blind.

This game however is fundamentally different then it's predecessors, so you have to set your expectations right. The story is rather interesting, but very linear. It does not have the same feeling of exploration as the previous ones, rather, feels like a dungeon crawl, where you clear an area, and move on to the next.  There is one great downside of the game though, and that's stability. I've played it on Windows 8, and after fiddling with the compatibility, and setting the sound quality on the system to 24 bit 48k sampling (both are recommended and helps a bit), it was mostly playable, but still frequently crashed. I recommend saving often.  I still think it's a decent game, worth trying if you liked the previous ones, but does not have much replay value.",

            "review_text": "This game lacks a lot. Gameplay is over-simplified, with only three spells for a caster and a very simple melee system. You can craft, cook and brew anywhere without using a workbench - hell, workbenches are in the game but don't have  any use , even if you turn on 'Roleplaying elements' in the options. There is no penalty for stealing stuff, you can't beat up friendly NPCs. Although you're playing in one big world, the pathing is painfully linear. You can't walk down edges (unless you jump), and exploring usually kills you - like when you touch the water surface of a lake you thought you could swim through. The new main character doesn't keep up with the previous nameless hero (how could he anyway?), the story is dull, quests are repetitive and most characters are unconvincing.  Most. What made this game for me was really was the opportunity to meet old friends. Especially Diego and Gorn really shine in this game, and seeing Lester and Milten again also didn't hurt. Besides that, the game is stripped down and shifted way more from the hard old-school RPG to a casual Action RPG, which - if you let yourself in for it - has its benefits: the game is incredibly intuitive, you don't have to put a lot of time to learn the skill system or whatever, and combat feels wonderfully dynamic. The game also looks pretty nice.  I started the game on difficulty 'Gothic' (of course...) which is the hardest one they give you. If you come from Gothic, do this! After about 3/4 of the game I put it down to 'Hard' and then 'Normal' because it started to get difficult and enemies had riddiculously high HP, making combats last forever. This made the late game kinda chewy. It took me ~21 hours to finish the game, which isn't incredibly long for an RPG, but some hours less wouldn't have hurt.  I'll give it a 6.5 / 10, mostly for 'nostalgic value', nice graphics and overall a very polished and smooth experience. If (and only if) you are into the series, it's worth playing!",

While the story is technically more interesting and coherent than previous Gothic games, the style of gameplay is significantly different as the design is aimed towards focused progression from point A to B. The world is technically open, but there is never a reason to backtrack. This design is not bad, however, as the developers make each step compelling enough with beautifully detailed locales and creatures to keep your interest. If a fan of previous Gothics, understand that the structure is significantly different. There are only a couple of decision points and there isn't a faction system to limit your abilities. Abilities are also acquired via a skill tree rather than being trained and purchased from masters. Still, this is a fun Action RPG and is worth a purchase when on sale.  [GET AT SALE]",

Another huge plus is the combat system. It is fluent and dynamic, which made it all the more satisfying and enjoyable to fight against enemies.  Character progression was kept quite simple, focusing on your average, casual players. Might not have hurt to go more in depth, maybe by giving us a couple more extra options to improve the character, separating stats and skills. But it didn't bother me that much.  It is not an open world game, which is not a bad thing, but the different areas could have profited from more indepth side quest and stories, maybe by adding various dungeons. Equipments are somewhat neglected, and not as thought out as I had hoped. Could have combined epic loot or rare reccources with side quests to get or to create all kinds of different armors and weapons, or make us overall more dependent on the crafting system. I believed I used it once to create 'Innos's sword' at the end. More weapons and armors like that could have been a nice addition.  But in the end I had a good time and quite enjoyed myself.",

Now when Arcania (the de facto Gothic 4, under a new name for understandable reasons due to studio changes) was announced, the old guard of the former group were pessimistic and people like me were hopeful. I wanted a more polished game that offered the sort of open-world exploration, side quests laced through the main quest, secrets to find, factions to join or oppose and engaging choices that made the last games great, coupled with improved visuals and controls but especially more options and items and goodies in general.  What I got was an unbelievably linear, limited game that seemed to strip everything that made 3 fun while keeping everything the old guard criticized about it. I couldn't even finish it. I was bored out of my skull before I could even save the capital, let alone figure out what the nonsensical plot was about.  Maybe it's a little better if you aren't familiar with the previous games, but even then it's an unfortunate use of money to buy. You want to play Gothic, check out the previous three and leave this on the shelf. Fair warning though, I have trouble getting 1 and 2 to work on newer computers.",

It is hard to recommend this game to people simply because of all the things you have to look past in order to enjoy it. The voice acting is hit or miss (and when it's miss its a HUGE miss), some character models specifically female characters) look really weird and poorly made, and the first couple of hours are just a huge tutorial filled with horribly boring quests, like 'kill the molerats invading my farm' and 'Bring me some mead' and 'collect some iron bolettes'.   The strange tradition in RPGs to start the player out doing menial tasks for other people, like the quests referenced above, is super over-done and desperately needs to be retired for something more meaningful and fun in the beginning of a game. This is especially true when the trailer for said game shows a bunch of awesome monsters to fight but only after you go through hours of 'go fetch me this' and 'kill these rats!' quests. The Witcher 2 did this great by starting out with that badass castle siege pretty early on. Another RPG to have a great opening was Skyrim where once you got to the first village of Riverwood, you had the ability to begin a quest that sends you through a dungeon filled with bandits and draugr, AND ended with you seeing your first wordwall.   Through all the horribly played out beginning quests and the god-awful voice acting and modeling, I'd give Arcania maybe a 6/10 at best.",

I've played all of other titles of Gothic series, and I am thinking that the series was losing blood just after the first game. The first game was a masterpiece, and Gothic II was only clinging on the first game's astonishment. Third game was also behind the standarts.   And fourth game was... lower than that.   The RPG elements of the game consists of just about the character development and thats all. There were no dialogues, no stealing stuff, in the end no role play stuff. Also there was no story at all. We (the proantagonist) only follow some figures' suggestions. If I couldn't continue on my own and register for a guild (for example Monestary) that what is there to play?   If u were Gothic fan u can play this game, only 2 or 3 hours I guess. You could smile when u see some familiar faces from earlier games and that's all you gonna get. If you are just searching a lousy RPG game, then may be you could play a few hours more.",

As a stand alone game, I'd not be so critical and would be neutral enough in my opinion over it that I'd not review it at all, as there is no 'Maybe' option on recommending a game.  As far as this game goes, it is a pretty run of the mill fantasy RPG fair with passable mechanics, a cheap storyline and pretty decent graphics and effects. It's definitely playable, but what this game is not is a game in the Gothic series.  It is completely clear playing this that the makers never played the original 3 games by Piranha Bytes and did not care at all about the actual story. The read the synopsis of the originals, the list of characters and they make up their own story that has nothing to do with the rest of the series.  In short, the reason I cannot recommend this game as a fan of the Gothic series is that this game is simply does not belong in the series and was a grab on the IP recognition of it alone. It should have been written as an original game.",

            "review_text": "I'm new to the gothic series and i heard it was good so i grabbed gothic 4. This is my first steam review.  Yeah i've played it all the way through and i felt that the story was weak, all it was to me is that the main character tells people 'Hey, i need to find X' and the other person says 'You want to find/speak to X? well you need to prove yourself worthy' and run to a cave and kill one random monster out of the 10 different types of mobs in this game and get a item to bring it back to the to prove yourself worthy to speak to X and then you move on the the next area/town and repeat.  As for the combat, it was a bit.. Eh.. I like that I have my bow, sword and magic equipped all at once so it brought a fable feeling to me. I havent dug deep into combat with a ranger or mage so I cant type about that but with the melee, i thought the flourishes were kool and the way you can combinate regular attacks with flourishes but your left vulnerble for a second or so. But heres the problem with it. Regular attacks are limited to 6 strikes in a row, so you can hit hit flourish hit flourish and chain another flourish if u have the stamina for it and thats a sick combo but if you max out one of the melee dmg and health tree (i forgot what its called) it'll allows unlimited stirkes in a row without being left vulnerable... which kinda defeats the purpose of using a flourish because most enemies dont attack if your hitting them, so you can basically smack them until they die. (cough cough demonlords and bosses)  Some enemies can charge up a skill while your smacking them and you would think you would stop your endless strike rage on them when they charge a move to hurt you right? Nah, if you get one of the three mage skills that allows you to stun an enemy you could just cast that spell while theyre charging a move and they would stop and you could go back to your endless rage with no worry. im serious... its like an infinite (fighting game gamers understand infinites) thats the only mage spell i touched in the game and just made me wonder 'how overpowered is a mage and oh, i forgot i had a bow'  Its about an 14-15 hour run, it kinda felt repetitive.. maybe because the way i played but if you played this game im pretty sure theres other ways of cheapness in the game. As for the ending **Spoiler**... i don't wanna speak about it, you walk to the boss and literally say like 2 lines and you fight him.. easy boss all you have to do is smack smack smack (endless rage strikes) until he teleports and throws beams at you which u can easily hide behind the portal doors and dont get hit by none of em.. he comes back and u repeat and he teleports and spawns enemies and comes back then, repeat and he dies. THE SECOND HE DIES AND TOUCHES THE FLOOR, NO ENDING CUTSCENE AND CREDITS APPEAR, AFTER THAT YOUR BACK AT THE MAIN MENU! so the 14-15 hour journey with a weak storyline comes to a end with not knowing what happened after shepard kills the final demon and you feel cheated of your time invested to see what would happen and nothing happens... All i can really say is thank goodness i bought this game on a steam sale for dirt cheap and i dont recommend you to get this game.  3/7/2014: Edit - I've decided to fight the final boss again because i figured it was weird there was no ending so i killed the boss and the ending scene actually showed this time... But i still don't recommend this game.",

The gameplay is stale, there are bugs that hinder gameplay such as: When trying to walk down a hill ( mind you, there is a dirt trail so you're supposed to be able to walk there ) it feels like you're walking down steps with invisible walls blocking you, breaking, allowing you to take a step, block you, repeat... You litereally don't walk down the hill, you walk straight as though the ground is level, get forced to stop, drop a foot, then you're allowed to repeat this drama all over again until you finally make it down the hill...  I was suckered in to pre-purchasing this game, a mistake I'll never make again with Nordic Games or Spellbound Studios. It was so riddled with bugs I tried getting a refund from Steam; had I waited until release and still bought it, I would've charged the amount back because this game isn't completed, it isn't playable and I'm not going to waste what little time I have left on this rock playing it; I'd rather wait until my dirt-nap than play this if this were the only game in my library.",
