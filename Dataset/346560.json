            "review_text": "YES! It's finally here. Been waiting for this from a loooooong time!  + The biggest 'PRO' of this game is that it's  EXTREMELY FUN  to play. It's relaxing, soothing, immerse, and most of all FUN.  +  Awesome Story : It's about how a common village boy struggles to save his sister and along the journey helps everyone he meets.  +  Casual, Fun, Relaxing : This is not a super hardcore game, just a casual one which will make you smile and happy! ;)  +  World, Environment, Aesthetics : The graphics may not be top-notch, but the aesthetics are awesome! You are really transported into another world. You can feel the stuff happening around you, you actually start believing that you are the protagonist.  +  Unique gameplay : It's purely point and click, but it's not like your common hidden object game either. It mixes hidden object, strategy, decision-making and RPG elements into one single combo and trust me.. it's worth trying.  +  NON-LINEAR : Unlike the first one, there's a plethora of things to do and a plethora of ways to do it. You'll have to make many smart choices as to how to proceed. I don't think it's possible to get stuck, but the game might get extremely slow if you keep on making bad choices.  Â±  Sountrack : The soundtrack is amazing. But it's pretty much exactly the same as the first game. I was hoping for a little change/variety.  - There are *SOME* objects which are very tough to find, and it can get frustrating very quickly. But if it does, you can always ask it on the discussions page and we will be happy to help!  - There's one more problem with the game. There are several skills which are unlocked later but it is very likely that you will do things and never know why you did them.   I killed tons of spiders and zombies to reach nothing but dead ends and no award. I kind of started thinking it was just a way to make me lose my gold until I unlocked the lock-picking skill after which it all made sense. Maybe a marker on locked objects stating you need to learn how to unlock would have made me less furious.    This game is built on the same engine as the First one, except that it has some better animations/bigger sprites and support for different profiles/save games.    Be sure to check out my  review  of the first part to get a rough idea about what you can expect.   Rating: 9/10 I subtracted a point from the original because of some more cons in the game. But added a point for an overall more non-linear gameplay.",

Just like the first installment, you go around solving problems and completing quests for the people you meet in return for their help that ultimately leads to you rescuing your sister who has been kidnapped by pirates. By completing quests you gain fame points, which mark your advancement in game.   The story is great. It's one of those stories you were read to as a child or told by your grandfather. The music is very soothing and only adds to the calm athmospere of the game. The scenery is breathtaking and the searchable items are not as tiny as in the first game, thus easier to find.   I have finished the game an hour ago and I am already experiencing serious withdrawal. 10/10 ",

            "review_text": "Just like its first part this game is a fun to play point and click game, although I completed it really fast. It took me 4,5 hours to get to the end, then I went for the achievements and also completed them very fast as you can see.   In the first part it was just a small world to explore if you compare it to this one. It took me more time to learn all the skills, so I had to go several times to the same place, first to pick mushrooms, then to find eggs etc. Just before the end, when I got achievements for finding a lot of eggs, and killing lots of wild animals, I noticed that when I got the master achievement, there still were some eggs to find (probably other stuff too, but I noticed the eggs). In the first part, when you got the master achievement there weren't any eggs left, so that's a little change. Nice for when you're short on money.  The whole map was used in a nice way, land above and islands below. The storyline was a bit better than the first one in which you had to defeat an evil wizard to save the kingdom. This time I had to find my sister, I found her and also my brother who left a long time ago, but got possessed by the devil and became a pirate because of that. Then I got a wizard by my side and had to defeat that devil and its creatures.  As opposed to the first part it was a lot harder to obtain the items needed, because during the first part I created the habit of selling almost everything I had, since I wasn't going to use it anymore. Due to that 'bad' habit I often had money problems during important (and expensive) missions, but I made it!  Just as its first part it's just a game to play when you have spare time and you don't know what to do with it. Also perfect for the beginning achievement hunter.",

            "review_text": "Hero of the Kingdom II is a very casual and relaxed game. There's no stress, no time limits and no 'action' to speak of. It's entirely based around economic puzzles; gathering resources in many forms and bringing them together to progress. Some you need to spend, others stay with you. It's simple enough, with the real test being the ability to remember where and how to get what you need. For an example, remembering how to get hay when later in the game you end up needing some for a cow's bedding. -- And yes, that's about how the average quest goes. You'll be slaying monsters as well, but you do it in the exact same manner. 'Now where can I get a shield, a mercenary and a torch to slay a giant spider?'  Even then, it's fun. It's very genuinely fun. I do need to warn you that the story, writing and dialogue are all awful. Sorry! :( I don't mean that as an insult to the developer, it's just the whole world doesn't show an ounce of actual creative thinking. It's a cookie-cutter save-the-girl quest in a cookie-cutter fantasy kingdom in which you face cookie-cutter pirates. If you want a story, avoid this game like the plague. If you want a chill, casual, resource-driven puzzle game, dude, go nuts. It's totally worth it.",

Graphics are basically the same, UI is exactly the same, gameplay is the same, there is just a bit more of everything. A bit more to do, a bit better story, longer time to play through.  But, while I enjoyed playing the first part quite a bit, the second part does not get me. I do not know really why, but the atmosphere was much better in the first part, and this is what made me like the first part so much. But here, I find the pirate setting not as atmospheric presented as the medieval setting in the first part, the music is not as good as it was in the first part, the new 3D elements lack detail and do not fit very well in the rest of the world and you have to do a lot more jumping between the diffrent places than in the first part, which is annoying.  Maybe I'm just the sort of person who expected too much from the second part of a great first part, but I'm unfortunate to say that I cannot recommend this game to anyone who likes the first part for the same reasons I do.",

The pixel hunting seems at least a little less tedious this time around, when it comes to achievements; eggs are more visible, mushrooms are quite common, though crates and barrels I did have to go and look for a bit. There's a few pixel-hunty quests too that aren't that great but ehh. I felt the storyline here was better than the last game, some plot twists, I think at least one minor character dies for real, among other things? Graphics and music are fine too. It's not a particularly deep game, but it's a fun time-waster and really surprisingly engaging. Not really something you'd pay full price for but if you can get it cheap or in a bundle then I'd say go for it. You don't have to have played the first one to be able to enjoy this one, either.",
