            "review_text": "Zoo Park is a great simple minded, simply presented zoo management 'simulator'. Although it might not be as inclusive as Zoo Tycoon or Wildlife Park, it's down to earth and easy to use controls and ideas are so easily and readily grasped no matter your age. Sure it might not be an actual simulator, but I have found myself losing track of time when playing. Gameplay wise, it is very much similar to any other zoo simulator: start with nothing but money (or points in this case) and build your way up. There is no rating system or critics critiquing your zoo, but there are challenges to be done. This game is more of an arcade style of simulator. Focusing on fast point and click fun rather than the slow climb to prestige that is only achieved through thorough understanding of the game. You start with a couple animals and you must research others to unlock them for placement in your own zoo (referred to as a sanctuary in-game). Although not really 'realistic', I have found myself always wanting to research one more animal and place him in the zoo before saving and quiting. Taking care of your animals is also quite simple. You can open up the animals menu and see the space, food, water, vegetation, and fence requirements of the animal. Simple satisfy all the needs to have the 'perfect' habitat and your animals will start breeding. You can also research other things besides animal usage, such as research to lessen the amount of time your animal gets sick or quicken the breeding time. As for the visitors of the zoo, they also need several things satisfied to ensure you get the most points per day (12 hours of in-game time, using the fast forward option, it would probably be around 5-10 minutes of real time). They are how well they can see the animals, how many they see, attractions/features, drinks, food, and gifts. There aren't many concessions types so you end up with a zoo littered with the same hamburger or hotdog stands which is boring, but hopefully there will be updates with more.  Overall I really enjoyed the game. The pricing for me is probably a little over (maybe worth $10 max), so if you are on the fence, buy this on a discount like I did (only $3!). However, if you like the simplistic idea and just enjoy animals, zoo sims. and playing a casual, relaxing game, I would say this game does a pretty good job of satisfying some of those simplistic urges. Notice how I used simple/simplistic so many times. If you want a hardcore, ultra zoo simulator GOTY deluxe edition 2020, this is NOT for you.",

            "review_text": "Not a bad game at all, especally for the price. Only minor annoyance is animals get sick without warnning half the time as you fast forward. And then finding all the animals and trying to click on them is difficult with all the plants they require to have. Add an option to hide the plants and notifiy every time one gets sick and it's a good game to pass the time.",

            "review_text": "Not a bad game but it does lack a few things that other zoo games have, like having your fence degrade and have your animals run loose which also means that when you get bored you can't fence of the entrace and relese all your animals to chase your guests (Evil Laugh) but it's colourful and easy to get into so i'd still recommend this game",
