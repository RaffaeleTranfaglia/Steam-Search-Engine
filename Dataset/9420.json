    "description": "The last days of man are at hand.. Two years after the Infinite War the once great warring nations now lie in ruins, and humanity’s hope for a brighter future is nothing but a bitter memory. A new, seemingly unstoppable enemy, supported by the zealots of The Order, now seeks to eradicate mankind: UEF, Aeon Loyalist, and Cybran alike.",

(I've seen an anti-air turret shoot down a nuke)  - Bubble shields  - MASSIVE experimental units  - Explosions  - Massive scale, the battleships feel impressive next to the smaller T1 units  - Scaling economy, you don't 'buy' units like in SCII or a lot of other RTS games, you build them, draining your resources over the course of their construction time  - 1000s of units  Cons:  - The unit movement is a bit weird sometimes  - If you're reading this review you probably don't own the game yet, luckily this con is easily fixable",

            "review_text": "TL: DR- 10/10, literally one of the three best strategy games i've ever played, and probably the best RTS.  This game can have a steep learning curve, and campaign missions may well take you two hours to complete if you go carefully, or twice that if you go full defensive on the hardest difficulty setting, but this just means that there's actually meaning to good base design, and it is incredibly satisfying to build up an impenetrable fortress then create an army that will flatten your opponent... hopefully. Then there's also the option of building so many nuclear launch facilities that you can overwhelm your enemy's missile defense systems and drown them in nuclear fire (for reference, nukes in this game are just about the hardest to obtain in any game i've found, but they're also the most visually spectacular and you actually have cause to fear them)  There is a good variety of options for the skirmish mode, you can put yourself in a cagefight with a trio of AI opponents that cheat just for added difficulty, you can customise some major gamemode settings such as completely disallowing certain units or tech-levels, or you can increase the rate at which everyone gathers resources to speed the game up a bit.  The graphics are very nice, especially considering the number if units you will have running around the map at any given time. the textures don't look that great if you were to zoom all the way in, but if you do that you'll zoom out again to find that OH GOD THE CYBRAN HAD A BUNCH OF STEALTHED MONKEYLORDS OUTSIDE MY BASE AND THEY'RE TRAMPLING MY REACTORS!  However, the place this game really outshines anything else i've played is its interface. you can customise so easily what the map shows you in terms of the range of your anti-air, anti ground, indirect fire, etc, your sonar, radar, omnisensor ranges... it offers you so much information but if you're finding it overwhelming you can just switch it all of with about two clicks. Unit control is so good in this game, in terms of automation. you can very reasonably set up a factory to produce infinite of a set of units, have air transports pick them up from your base, and airdrop into a different part of the map with no input from the player. this makes managing hundreds (or, with mods, thousands) of units so much eaiser, leaving you to direct your army, navy and airforce, and watch the explosions.",

It may seem complicated at first, but you get used to it pretty fast, as it is easy to learn.  The community is still alive and working here, usually hanging on the Forged Alliance Forever lobby mod, which optimizes the game further and adds working multiplayer lobbies, ranked matchmaking, and so forth.  Each unit from each faction serves a vital role in your great conquest across the the entire battlefield, lots of diversity into them as well.

Supreme commander focuses on ALL aspects of war; naval, air, land, radar, transports, defense turrets, resource production and managment, adaptation, vetranacity, nukes, nuke submarines (ftw), even shields and anti nukes not to mention the experimental units (extreme game changers). This game takes strategy to a whole new level with different factions and different units. The game itself wven gives you a menu to mod it, and the mods for this game are outstanding. But this is definatley a game for more experienced players, for those who are new or just getting into these games i would suggest supreme commander 2. the second game is...simpler...its known as a shadow of its former self but the gameplay is easier to understand and control but all the while ruining the game with the experimental factories.",

You can send an army to a enemy base or send over a colossus sized tank, spider, spinning saucer, and more to completly crush the enemy. every second is super important. When your commander sets down for example, and if you don't focus on building an army and sending it before you can be hit, your score on the top right of your screen will show you are lower than most others. The game is just. beautiful to put it. And there are 4 factions, the aeon, the uef, the cybran, and the seraphim. Each with a unique build design and a unique way to play. Cybran get a experimental spider named Monkeylord which deals 2k damage per second, and the average comm has 12k. The uef for example get a tank called a fatboy. Its a mobile base which has powerful main cannons, which deal 200 damage a shot. Weak anti air, 2 repair pads for air forces, and can build units. Please consider buying this game, check out forged alliance forever and on youtube check out gyle. The community is as activeas can be since this game origionally came out in 2007. There are also huge mods avalible to download from moddb and such to add even more, but be careful please. Every mod you activate in the lobby, builds up ram. The program can only hold 2 gigs and with certain programs can use about 2.3gigs of ram. (Large Adress Aware for me) but please keep this game going.",

I.e. it will take forever to get to the next tech if you try to jump too early, so the time building up creates a layering of the playing field.  + The single-player campaign is nice. If you are interested in this, get the package that has FA and the orgiinal game to get the whole campaign.  + The campaign is the only place you'll hear voice acting. All the sounds in a skirmish are just robotic machine noises and they are all nice to listen to.

There are ram limitations in the game engine which means that if you play with 4 ai bots or more your game will slow down to slow motion in late game. This happens because the engine cant use all the memory of your computer.  The game is still worth a shot though as it is a unique strategic experience that you wont find in mosto ther strategy games. I personally love it even though it has ram limitations. Good graphics, fantastic gameplay, good unit variation, every faction is different gameplay wise and the music is fine.

            "review_text": "Way back when, I chose the dawn of war games over SupCom. Those DoW games got me into the corresponding tabletop hobby, and I couldnt be happier with the people I've met and all the friends I've made from just buying one little game.  A couple days ago, I spotted this on steam and decided to give it a try, see what I would have gotten had I chose this game instead.  Before I go on, let me explain that I have always loved RTS games. DoW, AoE, Stronghold, C&amp;C, etc. So when I saw this game and the massively positive reviews for it, I bought it straight away! It looked awesome, whole armies crushing your enemies underfoot, whats not to like?  The game worked for me, only one crash while I was in the tutorial. So no problem there.  The problem was, well, the mechanics. I am used to a minimap, when I play againest my competitive friends, the minimap is needed for survival. The tutorial pointed out pretty quick that my screen IS my minimap. Great.  Not only did I keep forgetting about it, its also extremely awkward to use. I kept playing without using it, making it seem to me that I was alone, when in fact there was a huge battle going on around me, and I couldnt see it.  Secondly, there is a STEEP learning curve. The Controls take way too long to learn and master. I consider myself atleast competent when it comes to RTS's, I can normally figure out the controls in a game or two.   With this game? Well, you may notice that I only have TWO hours played on it, and also that I've returned it.   Well, thats because these games take HOURS to play. You can't bang out one game in a hour. Heck no. You have to be willing to SIT THERE and WAIT. Wait for your eco to boost up, wait for your buildings to build, wait for your units to be created.   Each unit has around a 7-10 second timer. Even the weak units. Yes it has a HUGE pop cap of up to 1000, which is awesome. But for one thing.  I can't get any resources. The game wont give you ANYTHING starting out, and resources come in at a TRICKLE. For my first skirmish game after the tutorial, I tried setting it on huge resources or whatever, and it does not have any. You are stuck with the regular resources, which let me tell you, are gone faster then ice placed in the middle of the sahara desert.   I had to use CHEATS. CHEATS. To explore the mechanics of the game more fully.   I am not one of those people who can sit down for 4-5 hours on ONE game. This game is for you if you like slow paced afternoon-length games. If you cant invest the time and effort it takes to play this game, dont buy it.    I spent two hours with this game. Only played ONE game. And I couldnt even finish it because it got boring using the cheats since it took to long trying to play the game with normal resources and setup.   Poor economy, poor unit build time, confusing map interface, extremely long length game battles without the resources to easily get said long games off the ground effectively, this is a MASSIVE dissapointment to me.   Buy if your a HARDCORE RTS player who can spend hours in ONE GAME.   If you like RTS' but dont want to invest hours in a single match, or are new to the genre on a whole, or just a casual gamer, SKIP.    When I think of the people who might like this game, I think of a old man in his mid 70s. It requires ALOT of patience. Kudos to anyone who can sit through it, I sure as h*ll cant.   Its like you build a beautiful mansion, but then don't install plumbing or power, and only use one room out of the whole mansion.   Dissapointed, gave it a chance, glad I chose DoW. Skip if you like anything thats not snail-paced.",

We were big fans of the game when it first came out, but there's no doubt it was one of the most complex, time-consuming RTSes in quite a while, and had an unapologetically steep learning curve. Many lamented that the three factions in the original, the Cybran, Aeon, and UEF, looked and behaved too similarly. And on the surface they do resemble each other, but after hours of playtime, you learn to appreciate the differences and understand how to capitalize and manipulate them to your advantage.  GPG seems to have two main goals with the standalone Forged Alliance expansion: faster action and more diversity. Diversity is inserted primarily with the addition of a fourth faction, the more visually distinct Seraphim. Though they, like the other three, possess similar lower tier units, higher tiers possess more individuality, particularly those of the experimental variety. Accessing these differences between factions, meaning teching up to tier three (T3), requires a different kind of resource production strategy since GPG moved mass fabricators from tier one (T1) to tier two (T2). You have to be much more aware of your extractors this time around, making sure to expand your base of operations across the map until you can start churning out T3 fabricators and power plants, since extractors seem to play a much more vital role in maintaining reasonable resource rates in the early game.",

The campaign is a solid challenge and you start out with most of the available units ready to use, instead of slowly unlocking them as you progress. The base skirmish AI is pretty weak unfortunately, but there are some great mods available, or convince your friends to get it and play against them!

You might base your strategy on overwheliming the enemy with low level units, or alternatively sit back and build your economy so you can afford a devestating experimental unit. And of course there's always the nuclear option.  While the basic game works fine and there is a multiplayer lobby inegrated with steam for the steam version you really want to download Forged Alliance Forever.

Too bad I didn't discover it until 2015. :(  If you like RTS games like Starcraft, Age of Empires or Rise of Nations, this is along those lines, but with some huge differences that make it unique and absolutely PHENOMENAL. The economy and production is different and takes some getting used to, but adds much more depth and strategy than you get with other games (even though there are only 2 resources!). It's not all about micro and having a zillion APM like Starcraft, but micro still matters and can mean the difference in a match. Cool units, well balanced.  The campaign is no better or worse than you'd get in other games, but I have always preferred skirmish matches in any game.   You may find the AI is stupid (isn't it in basically all games?) or too difficult, or that there is no acceptable medium between the hard and cheating AI. You should go to forged alliance forever  (faforever.com , download the lobby) for the multiplayer, maps, mods and improvements, which help fix this and give you exactly the challenge you want and tons of other cool stuff. (I regret not doing this sooner!)  Why has does no other strategy game let you so easily zoom out exactly as far as you want?!!!! I never realized how awesome this feature is until I played this game. I can no longer be satisfied playing other games because you can't do this.   Forged Alliance was revolutionary. Even with outdated graphics, I love this game. I haven't played Supreme Commander 2 because based on reviews it went more towards the typical, above mentioned RTS games, and the differences between them and Forged Alliance are what make this game BETTER. It is addicting. You will not regret the $15.   (Also, watch Gyle casts on youtube for entertaining replays of games and to learn tips and tricks to improve your game.)",

This makes the economic system on FA unique) and much more robust experimentals. I love this game, and if you pick it up make sure to look up Forged Alliance Forever.

It may not be the most complex or wide scale strategy game out there, but it offers players a fast paced, visually pleasing display of massive battles and base building. It takes a little while to adjust to the drain based resource system. If you're not careful, you can wind up zeroing out on both resource types and your war efforts drop to a crawl and you quickly become cannon fodder.  The one thing I absolutely love about this game is the custimization for gameplay. There is no set difficulty, you can pick and choose what kinds of AI you want to play against, whether it be turtles, air, ground, or navy based, or perhaps you prefer a rush style of play, where everyone is hurtling hundreds of puny tanks at each other until someone drops in a massive experimental to slaughter one side or the other. Either way, its the players choice. I also love how easily the game can be modded, I'm not saying its Minecraft where there are thousands of mods out there, but for anyone looking to expand the chaos and scale of the game, drop by the Total Mayhem page on ModdB or perhaps go for the Black Ops mod set.  Don't let the age of this game fool you, it may be a few years old, but even the best PC's will eventually lag while trying to handle this game. And yeah, I know, that doesn't sound great, and its not, and it can be annoying, but it gives you a sense of just how massive the game can be.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the best RTS games as of 2015. When it launched it was an incredible resource hog as it suggested 2 monitors and required a great deal more processing power than most people had. It is a beautiful game overall and the balance is quite good. The ability to make massive super weapons is a real joy because they are quite powerful but they take a long time to build and can be a gamble if the enemy blows them up before they are finished.  This game is oldschool in the sense that it doesn't have cheating AI that always knows exactly what you're doing. It will build the tech 3 radar that has a massive detection range... but that's a structure you can build as well. (you can always blow it up or take out his power to turn it off).   This game has a slight degree of technicality with your base setup (the wiki can explain it very quickly with a picture). Long story short you can put power plants next to factories and each will reduce the cost of things you build in the factories. The other game resource, mass, will also reduce building costs if you build a factory on top of a mass extractor (often called a mex). The danger with this is that a tight network of touching/linked buildings is more effecient but it is much easier to destroy because power plants are volitile,  The bad news is that the AI can't really compete very well on water maps. The AI is also somewhat weak to turtle strategies involving large defensive structure batteries. However one of the interesting aspects of this game is that you kinda need to learn which thing to build to counter what your opponent is building. Did I mention that anything you send at the enemy's base that gets destroyed can have the mass reclaimed by the enemy?  One more bit of bad news is that I don't think a lot of people play so you'll probably be playing against the AI. That being said the AI is a good opponent. There is a built in 'cheater' option if you want to play against a crazy tough AI opponent who will always be 1-2 steps ahead of you.   This is a really good game and the first time you see a nuclear missile hit the enemy base you will really be in for a treat. If you hear the words strategic launch detected and don't have countermeasures built you'll be in trouble.  This is one of those games you can play for hundreds of hours and never feel like you're still playing to get your money's worth.  ",

The only downside is the slightly complex economy, but once you figure that out there is an amazing amount of different strategies to play. To every move there is always a counter, so it's always fun to try different ways to win. The game let's you play at the strategic level with lots of building and unit tasks able to be queued. The zoom out to strategic level is fantastic. Most of all the big units are just fun to use.",

Buying it again was worth it. If you're looking for RTS, get this game. If you're not into RTS, get this game because it'll get you into RTS. I'm pretty sure actual reviews aren't really something worth reading since no review can really live up to the glory of describing what this game details, so instead I'll leave some advice form what I've learned after years upon years of playing. Don't train in skirmish for mulitplayer. In skirmish, your battle will feel like the way a war should be, with factories cranking out weapons and armies for you to lead to anihilate your opponent. You will lead your armies and crush enemy bases ending everything with a bang as you finally crush their commander. Multiplayer can only best be described through the question of, 'What would have happened if the Cold War went hot?' Nuclear warfare on a grand scale and combat revolving around reconassaince and survival wages on in the lobbies. That is, atleast when I used to play. Nowadays, you're better off relying on the third-party program that I won't bame unless asked because it's name has been uttered endlessly in the reviews you've already read.",

Still holds up graphics wise but this franchise needs to reboot as a modern Total Annihilation.",
