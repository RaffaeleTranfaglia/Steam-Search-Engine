            "review_text": "I finally picked this game up after reading some rather negative, and in hindsight, truly terrible reviews. Many reviewers claimed that there were no quest markers, which is simply not true. Perhaps they could not find the M key on their keyboards because once you press it you get....wait for it.... Quest markers! One review claimed that you had to choose all warriors at start if you hope to survive; I have chosen a ranger, fighter, black-mage, and custom druid, and I have happily found that the classes are so balanced that no character has a clear advantage, each becoming my favorite at different points in my adventure. And Finally one reviewer claimed absolute critical powers by claiming after only a few hours of play that the game was worth exactly 11.99$ less than the asking price. In line with this way of thinking I hereby proclaim that I find this game to be a detailed, lengthy, charismatic adventure Worth exactly 74 Dollars and 12 cents more than that reviewers opinion, or after arbitrary calculation, 25 bucks... or whatever it's worth to the preferences of the user...or maybe... 23?...3?...2000?  I guess i'm just frustrated because I have loved playing this game. It is my kind of rpg full of exploration and i can heartily say to anyone that enjoys classic turn based RPGs, give it a shot, you will most likely love it. ",

            "review_text": "OH, HELL NO.  Until they improve this game, it cannot be recommended. The game isn't just 'tough', it's straight-up brutal and masochistic in its 'difficulty'. There are many things to love about this game: smooth graphics/good retro-look, interactivity, the setting, UI/interface works well, different ways/strategies to do things, kill whatever NPCS you want, the blood/gore, great music.  Let me put it this way, when I run into games where I die like 10 times within 10 minutes, I say the heck with it, and quit/refund/done/finished/never-existed.  I think I can put up with punishing games a bit more than some people, especially older, retro-type games. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME. There is a lot of love.  But the difficulty, is really tacked on poorly, disturbingly unbalanced in all the most critical areas. Sucks that everything else is so lovely, but overshadowed by this.  Many say 'RNG'. That means Random Number Generator. 'RNG' is an annoying acronym, so that is why I explained what it is. Why is this mentioned?  The game stats/skills/abilities, well, they don't amount to much. The game feels like it boils down to a 'random number generator' system.  I'm used to that, a lot of old RPGS were like that. I used to play the old Pen/Pencil/Paper RPGs back in the day with all the dice. So if you play games like that, you can know what to expect. I can make do with that, no problem. I'm a veteran.  Taking that into account, the game claims you have 75% to succeed at THIS, or 85% chance to succeed at THAT. But after like 5 tries, you fail. That comes out to 0%. Or if after 3 tries, 1 time succeeds, that's 33.33333333333...(etc)%.  While you can say,'OK, maybe I will just luck-it-out.'  You can't.  Your party is limited to 4 people. Most fights are 4-5 enemies, always stronger than you by about 5-15 hitpoints, and doing about 2X the damage you can do.  What does it mean, when my party encounters a flock of seagulls that are so strong, they utterly demolish my party into piles of red paste (literally, when your characters die, they go 'ahhh!' and explode).  What could I possibly be doing wrong?  Archers...SHOOT ARROWS.  Warriors...HIT THINGS WITH SHARP OBJECTS. Wizards...SHOOT MAGIC THAT MAKE BAD THINGS HURT. Wizard that Heals...SHOOT MAGIC THAT MAKE GOOD THINGS FEEL GOODER.  BUT....this is how it plays out in 'AntharioN' (***and this is in the starting zone***):  THE PLAN: OK, start shooting, when they get close, let melee womp them. Average party of 4, with average HP around 30HP, random of 2-20 DMG per hit regardless of attack type.  ENEMIES: 5 SEAGULLS. They have 29-40HP, mostly the latter, average 9-11 DMG per hit, Seagull #5 is 'Diseased Seagull' and has 40 HP and can do damage-over-time poison DMG in addition to regular DMG.  ENEMY approaches. Shoot range attacks. Concentrate on 'Diseased Seagull', Seagull #5. Warrior uses bow...7 DMG. Archer uses Bow...MISSES! Wizard #1 shoots magic bolt...8 DMG. Wizard #2 casts spell...FIZZLES!  SEAGULLS' TURN: Seagull #1 does 15 DMG to Warrior. Seagull #2 does 8 DMG to Warrior. (One more hit, he's dead.) Seagull #3 does 12DMG to Wizard #1. Seagull #4 does 9DMG to Wizard #1. Seagull #5, with 25 HP left, cuz we focused on that one, and half of our range-shots missed or didn't do enough damage, 9 DMG to Warrior with poison. -Warrior is dead.-  PARTY'S TURN: Archer shoots at Seagull #5...does 17DMG. Wizard #1 shoots bolt at Seagull #5...does 9DMG. -Seagull #5 is dead.- Wizard #2 casts heal on Wizard #1...FIZZLES!  SEAGULLS' TURN: Seagull #1 hits Archer for 11 DMG. Seagull #2 hits Archer for 7DMG. Seagull #3 hits Archer for 15DMG. -Archer is dead.- Seagull #4 hits Wizard #1 for 24DMG. -Wizard is dead.-  PARTY'S (hahahah, 'party' ) TURN: Wizard #2, no one left to heal, uses his staff, which only does max of 2DMG (**not joking either**), attacks Seagull #1...does 2DMG.  SEAGULLS' TURN: Seagull #1 attacks Wizard #2...MISSES! Seagull #2 hits Wizard #2 for 10DMG. Seagull #3 hits Wizard #2 for 5 DMG. Seagull #4 hits Wizard #2 for 9 DMG.  PARTY'S TURN: Wizard #2 yells, 'I REGRET NOTHING!', attacks Seagull #1...MISSES!  SEAGULLS' TURN: Seagull #1 hits Wizard #2 for 20DMG. -Wizard #2 is dead.-  A picture of a bleak scene, words appear, that your adventuring days are over.  DUMPS YOU to Main Title screen.  -DID I MENTION, THIS WAS THE STARTING ZONE?-  Reload. TRY AGAIN? And AGAIN? And AGAIN?  I don't mind roughing in some RPGs, but this is just atrocious. It's like playing an MMO, where the 'rats' and 'critters' in the starting zone for Level 1s, are more like Level 5s, and outnumber you seemingly 75% of the time.  ----You're just not going anywhere.----  CONCLUSION: What a horrible design choice. Makes you worry if maybe the game is so bare and actually small, they did this to 'slow the game down' and hide that fact. I've heard people say the world really is big, too bad you have to get butt-hurted repeatedly, just to claw and scrape for every inch.  But failing.  Even at that.  Repeatedly.  It truly is masochism.  Like playing a paper/pencil RPG with a Dungeon Master who keeps using their own ('loaded') dice to roll for the monsters.  'DWARF NEEDS FOOD, BADLY': Money is an issue for the game, everything costs way more than you ever bring in killing mobs, lootings, or doing quests. An apple costs 15g.  You probably get 15-25g after selling all the junk that drops.  Why is this important? Because in this game, you can't rest without food.  Like in other RPGS, you can 'rest' to regenerate your HP/MP. But in this game, each hour you spend costs food, and it's all done per hour.  After a fight you might survive, any dead party members are auto-resurrected, with minimal HP/MP.  SOLUTION? Go into town, buy more food.  Every piece of food costs 15g, for my party (and I put Skill points into this). I have...37g so far.  Okay, I can buy 2 apples. 2 bloody apples. So now I have 4. Use 2 to rest up to full strength.  Go back out, uh-oh, attacked again by a party of overpowered crabs.  -DEAD. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. QUIT THE GAME.-  -RETURN. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. WIN!-  No money dropped, only 2 crab-meats, and a lizard's tail (WTF?).  Need meats for a quest. Rest, using up 2 apples. 0 left. Sell Lizard's tail for 5g. I have 12g now.  At least I got like 15-25XP, only 175XP still to go before we can level up.  **cries**  Go back out (what else is there to do? Stand around and stare at the screen?). Looking for loot.  Avoiding engagements.  FAIL.  Attacked by party of 4 Orcs with 49HP and doing like 15-18DMG per hit. -Party is dead.-  -RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. LEAVE.-  Attacked by mixed group of Seagulls and Crabs.  -RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. DEAD. RELOAD. WIN!-  No food drops, nothing dropped to sell.   Nothing.  -Minimum HP, minimum MP, no hope, no solution, except to quit or...RELOAD.-   -And then...at times, you have those moments...when you realized that you...FORGOT TO SAVE!-   THE FINAL THING TO ADD: (no, not 'Dead.Reload.Dead...') Those who play the game prior to some patches, might say the game is great, and they have THOUSANDS OF GOLD, and thinking they are HOT STUFF players with this game.  THEIR SECRET???  The game's Barter SKILL was so poorly done, you could put in points to where you buy items from a store, and sell it back to the vendor for MORE than what you paid! MAKING A PROFIT!  So those 'players' would do this repeatedly. Racking up thousands in gold in the starting areas. Then, go buy all the BEST GEAR and STUFF they could. Then making glowing reviews about how great the game is.  The developers updated/nerfed this completely.  SO...NOT SO HOT ABOUT AntharioN now, EH GUYS?  'Go RELOAD!'",

This game is not balanced in anyway. Gold is hard to come by. You have to build the perfect party in the beginning, or you're kinda screwed. There's definitely potential here, but it's not finished.  EDIT: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've had a change of heart. I still stand by comments before about needing particular party construction. The original party I started with, I can't recall the specifics, but it didn't workout. I admit I reacted too soon. This is a great little game and worth the $$. Any classic RPG fans out there: do yourself a favor and pick this up. :)",

However, there are some things that irk me about it. The A.I. in combat is pretty bad. Enemies pretty much just rush at you and frequently get stuck on barriers or switch directions for no apparent reason. Fetch quests. Dear god so many fetch quests. 'Oh hi, I lost my [insert item]. Can you get it back for me?' And that pretty much summarizes the plot too. There are some magical items, and you must fetch them to stop an evil power. If you can ease up your expectations where these things won't be a deal breaker, then you will probably manage to enjoy this game. Exploration, leveling up, and a good variety of cool weapons, armor, and other items keep things interesting as you progress.",

            "review_text": "I haven't finished the first play yet (about 40H/50H in it playing slowly and a few load back), but it seems relatively long, I enjoy take my time playing it because I enjoy the 'travel', and I enjoy it. So I wanted add my thumb up vote right now.  This CRPG is hugely influenced by Eschalon Book series but with a party, and a better feeling of larger areas. But all design points compared to Eschalon are more simple, less sophisticated, less deep. For example Eschalon Book III has ton of interesting secrets a bit tricky to find, more sophisticated stealing system, more sophisticated use of darkness/light with a stealth and vision system, many tricks to solve, and more.  Antharion gave up on this quality level but offers a world and areas and dungeons that feel much larger, and the party approach is a huge plus. Its world filling quality and density can't compare to Eschalon Book series, but it's more or less a fair filling, and it works relatively well. An important point, it avoids the feeling to be overloaded of combats even if there's many.  But the point of Antharion is the whole is much better than the sum of its parts. The more you play it the more it is cool. It's hard to say it's a great CRPG but it's very tempting to say it's a very cool CRPG. :-)  One successful point of Antharion is to have succeed to provide a good freedom feeling despite there's no enemy scaling. It feels like a light mix of Eschalon Book series (main influence from far) and Morrowind because of the freedom and various little thing you can choose do as explore with a boat all around the world, find some uncharted islands, try a a long travel through a desert with a low level party with dangers around and risk to lost your path if you don't put care and travel by night, search in a backside area and have the good surprise to find a dungeon, open a secret in a dungeon and find behind a room filled of gold (and the game put care to keep them rare enough), talk to a peasant and get a rumor hinting you some stuff, start pickpocket everybody in towns, more.  Remind that everything is light but the mood and the spirit is there, and again it is better than the sum of its parts, and the more you play it the cooler it is.  Still you shouldn't expect: - Story and characters that grab you, nothing like that in it, just a modest writing with the only quality to be very fluent to read. - Sophisticated turn based party combats, use more magic will help have a bit more depth, there's elements like agro, obstacles you could try exploit, some more. But overall combats are just a bit deeper than most (or all) single character turn based CRPG, but quite less deep than all party turn based CRPG released those last years. - Sophisticated quests, the best you'll have is for some quests to find some location a bit tricky, based on some tricks or information or rumor. - Sophisticated pickpocket and stealing system, there's a jail and guards system, but overall it's very basic, the only plus is to offer some more freedom for players who would like steal all kind people or some people in peaceful towns they feel bad. :-)  To conclude, a sort of last influence or link with previous CRPG, Eschalon Book series is definitely the main influence, Morrowind is a general mood and design idea influence, and the third link is Might &amp; Magic 3-5 with an idea of a light and fast paced CRPG but with some depth anyway through party building, exploration, party and resource management, and with effort to find good tricks the combats can even be good despite they are fast paced. But remind it's a light CRPG and an indie CRPG, you can't except any Morrowind or Might &amp; Magic 3-5 in it.",

Open-world (one of the best features) 4-person party, turn-based RPG Nice flexibility to build your PCs Trainers Lots of quests  Cons: Having to talk to a trainer anew for every single damn skill pt you raise! No scrolling or marking of mini-map (very frustrating and would have been easy to implement) No marking of world map either All PCs must be adjacent to cast spells when not in combat (why??) Lack of a clear ending (or even a good one)  Undecided: Graphics were borderline too ugly for me; mainly the PCs. Monster choices were uneven. Some were cool, but why am I battling seagulls, sheep etc. in a fantasy RPG? Enemy pathfinding (though this usually worked in the party's favor, to be honest)  I would play another game of this type by these developers, and hopefully they can improve on what they've started here.",

The frosting that deflated cake is a frustrating user interface with unchangable keybindings and a lot of forced mousework to do simple tasks. For instance: if you want to equip a helmet, you'd expect that a shift-click would get the job done for you. Or, if you wanted to move an item from one hero to another, you'd expect that pressing '2' or 'F2' would move the item to your second character. Instead, plan on click-dragging everywhere.  It's an annoyance I would have ignored in a game that otherwise demanded my attention. But this one doesn't. So the 1990s UI features were more than enough to tip me over the edge.",

            "review_text": "The story of this game is so ridiculous, I'm not sure if I should cry or laugh. I'll give you the first hour of it… (I played it out of steam) So, you're a group of prisoners. The guards all go away for some reason, and so you decide to escape. You open your cell with a nail (ever tried to pick a lock with a nail? But, well, that's a classic story stupidity, so I'll forgive that one). You get through a small dungeon (which, for once is really a dungeon) full of aggressive big rats (I suppose the guards bred them as guard dogs???). When you get out, you discover that this particular dungeon is build in… a fake well… Ok… The said well is in a hamlet of 4 houses. Yes, it seems the ideal place to build a prison, and they needed it more than a real well. And you really need to hide your prison, because… Well, I'm not sure why, but I suppose they must have a good reason, don't they? In the town, every one is dead but for a man. That's why the guard got away, to defend the village from some unknown threat. The man has come here to investigate the killing. Man, that was fast! He found something in here, a ear, that he feels is very important to its investigation, but he doesn't know why. Maybe it's its a sixth sense, or maybe he forgot of his intense reflexion on the subject that ended in the idea it could be an hint about the race of the people who did the killing. By the way, you learn a bit later these people are called necrophils… Yeah maybe they just killed them to have sexual relations with the corpses? What kind of insane man would call a race with the name of one of the worst human perversions? Anyway, the guy in the village explains his investigation is not part of the official one and that the two guys won't let him get out with the ear. I suppose anyone can wander in and look at the mangled corpses, just they aren't authorized to get out with anything. Wait, you said guards? And wasn't their first idea to explain the killing a rebellion of the big dungeon in the small village? Or maybe a rebellion of their army of giant rats? Nah! Would be foolish to check the prison! Or maybe that's why the prison was hidden in the first place? hmm… So, the guy after explaining his mission is too important to abandon it just hands you its clue of a ear. After all, you're a trustworthy group of prisoners he just saw escape, aren't you? And also, you are the only ones able to see, I mean, discover the unguarded passage out, just next to the guards. Which is actually bigger than the guarded one.  Ok, I'll stop here for the ridiculously unlikely story. Just know that you can create a necrophil caracter, or even an undead one (undead are a people, you know? Well in this game, they are), the painfully basic interface, the very basic/boring combat system, the fact that half the time, you cannot see what you are hitting because your characters hide it, the 'rats in the inn' mission once you reach your first inn, the forced resolution (1280*800) and of course, the 18€/$ (I could get it for 17.03€ on their site). The maybe two hours I gave this game hoping it would soon get better (can't get much worse anyway) were wasted. These people obviously lack some talent in their team to create enjoyable video games, and should try something else. Oh, and thanks to steam to have forced me to reinstall and reload Antharion for 5 minutes (and twice, at that) in order to vent my disapointment.",
