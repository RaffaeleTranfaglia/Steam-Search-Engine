            "review_text": "[Main campaign complete - the original review will be left 'as is' with updated comments in brackets. The original review was written between a quarter and one third of the way into the campaign.]  In my opinion, Legends of Eisenwald is first and foremost a turn-based squad level tactical combat game with a character development system that is focused almost exclusively on combat. The game ships with a campaign that tells a single story from the point of view of one of three possible protagonists. Your character will level and you do get to choose how your character develops in terms of the game's combat mechanics, but that is pretty much it. There are no game mechanics to provide any real character depth; and the story is very linear. NPCs with any real character are few and far between. The members of your army (really just a squad) are interchangeable generic constructs. I don't know why the devs even bothered to give them names. Thus (and there will be more below), I don't see how one can think this is an RPG in any way.   I am going to judge this game largely on the merits of the default campaign as that is what one experiences as neither of the two items in the Steam Workshop (7/5/2015) speak to me. The game's fundamental combat mechanics are easy to grasp, but there is plenty of depth. This is not unfamiliar territory if one has played game franchises like Heroes of Might and Magic or Warlords. Just know that Legends of Eisenwald is not a rip-off of those other games; it is its own game. Overall, I have no complaints with the combat mechanics or the skill tree for the knight. The tactical combat is the game's strength; and, if that is enough for you, then you may enjoy this game. However, the game's liabilities are significant enough that I can't recommend the game in its current form.   [There is an a scenario in the Steam Workshop that looks interesting]  Points to get out of the way early:     Use descriptive names for your saved game files as you are probably going to need them. I know I've done a fair bit of backtracking, and I wouldn't have been able to do so as easily with the default saved game file names.      Wrap-up side quests before completing the main quest(s) in each chapter. If you don't have good save game files, there is no going back to previous zones to complete a side quest once you finish a chapter. Obviously, if you use a saved game to go back and complete a side quest, you are going to be forced to replay the chapter ending event(s). For me this is a relatively minor annoyance, but that may not be how others feel.     The journal and notes system does not allow you to refer back to previous chapters as far as I can tell. There are two problems here. First, there is information that one would like to refer to from previous chapters. Second, the quest and journal system does not capture all the dialog that it should to eliminate the need for a custom note feature (which does not exist in this game). Thus, one has to use another application outside the game for taking notes. Alt-Tab or play in a windowed mode; or posses perfect recall!   There is too little documentation for the game. Yes. The devs did post a useful User Guide and a series of intro videos. However, this is not what I mean by documentation. There should at least be a text file that systematically lists and describes all skills, equipment modifiers, etc. There isn't one. For example, there are branching skill trees for NPCs, but there is no right-click or mouse-over to explain what they they are and you can't look ahead in the skill trees to know which one seems the most interesting to you. Thus, one is forced to save the game. Try one option, and read what it does. Then you load the save game, select the other option, and read what it does. The same is true with equipment with special characteristics. Want to know if a 'rugged' helmet is worth the hit to initiative? Save game. Buy item. Equip item. See what it does (sometime it is still not clear what an object does). This is the opposite of fun - it is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time.  Speaking of tedious and boring, there are quest objectives that require one to hit just the right spot in order to trigger a necessary event. Now I don't mind this much when there is the occasional quest that involves discovering something that should be hard to find. However, it is another matter when it comes to obvious things or when it occurs too frequently; it is maddening when one is well aware that one is wasting time trying to find the correct pixel to stand on for an event to fire. Once again, this is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time. Worse, it takes one right out of the story . . . and there is too little of that as it is. Yes. I would dispute that the campaign is 'story rich'. With almost every quest I am left wanting more story.  [The maddening 'find the pixel to stand on' theme does not exist in later chapters (and is limited to two instances in the early chapters), and is replaced with a slightly less annoying mechanic. Specifically, one has to hit a series of waypoints in the correct sequence. I found this annoying because I had gone off and done some exploring and grabbed some castles in advance of the story line. Thus, I had a pretty good idea where I was supposed to go in the quests; but I still had to follow the sequence of waypoints nonetheless.]  Legends of Eisenwald has an interesting story to tell, but there are few opportunities for role playing and most of those opportunities are ruined by the story. Specifically, circumstances will dictate your options and your actions. One is given few real choices as the story unfolds; and there is little point in attempting to role play as, more often than not, you will be railroaded into only one course of action no matter what you do. Your only real choice is how you develop your combat skills. Thus, Legends of Eisenwald has a story to tell; but it is not your story. You are merely a puppet. In some regards, this is a very medieval point of view; and, if this was a conscious decision on the part of the devs, then they have succeeded in conveying that world view.   [By the end game I was on rails; no choices at all.]  There are major missed opportunities with the campaign from both a reward and historical perspective. There was an opportunity to better distinguish between true followers, feudal levies and mercenaries - particular in terms of the transition between chapters; but the opportunity is squandered. Also, a player might expect to be rewarded by being able to carry gains forward from one chapter to the next, but this is an expectation that has not been met in my game. This may be down to a lack of skill tree depth for NPCs or perhaps it is a necessary concession to play balance. In any event, there will be unexplained losses of inventory and members of your squad between some chapters - the game doesn't even offer a simple dialog box with a plausible story for the losses. One is left to make-up one's own story to explain what came through and what did not between chapters.  I am at that point in the game where I am deciding if I am going to continue playing Legends of Eisenwald. I've completed several chapters; and, if the pattern holds for subsequent chapters, I think I know what to expect; and there is not enough on offer to justify taking significant time away from other games. I've done a little back tracking through my save game files to see if I can see where things might have gone differently, and I'm fairly certain that I've not missed anything obvious. Too bad. I'll monitor future release notes in the hope that better things are to come . . . as, to this point, I definitely feel like I paid too much for the experience currently on offer. That said, I suspect I'll keep chipping away at the campaign as I do enjoy the tactical combat portion of the game.",

            "review_text": "Okay.. phwoa!!... long game. Just finished it - in at around 100 hours - Final Fantasy eat your heart out. A few late nights let me tell you. I feel that this game deserves the time and effort for me to write at least something about it and how I felt about it even if to just say it was a good game. But I will do more because I felt this game really was something special and I have derived so much enjoyment from it that it is the least I could do.   I bought this game on sale for a few pennies (I can't remember now but I think it was for under $5) and didn't really have too high hopes for it considering its price and look but was then completely overturned in my opinion by what is essentially a really great game that in no wise is properly represented by its appearance. DON'T judge a book by its cover! Boy, don't judge this book by its cover, it is a great game for what its worth. I think this game goes for around $20 more or less on steam and that is about the right price for this game. You won't regret parting with that hard earned cash. If you see this game for anything less than $10 buy it straight away, don't hesitate, you won't regret it. You might ask if it is such a great game why is it only worth $20 dollars? Well that is what I will attempt to explain.  Although I did derive a lot of joy and pleasure from this game, it still very much feels like an Indie production, which is exactly what it is. A beautiful and well done Indie production but an Indie production none the less. There are a host of issues which will remind you of that time and again but they are heavily outweighed by the things that the game gets SO right. Like the loot, merchant and trade system which I guarantee will be the end of you. These guys have got it so spot on that its just scary how much time you'll be spending tweaking your characters inventories and travelling the four corners of the globe in search for new places of trading. Certain hero's you defeat will drop unique items that you will be on the verge of crying over whether you want to sell them for their insane item values or keep them and derive the benefit from them that few items will be able to match or you will need an assortment of items to do what a single unique or rare item can do freeing up those super valuable item slots. yep... thats the one.   You'll be doing a lot of fighting and some can be pretty intense and take up quite a bit of time so you won't be missing out on anything there. The battle system is a little different from what you may be expecting but just accept things for as they are and get on with it. Sure I felt as if some of the things in the combat area are a little counter intuitive, such as not being able to move your guys where you want and not being able to attack whoever you want but don't let that stop you from enjoying the game as a whole. This game is an experience but the game isn't designed around just combat. It is designed around a story, and it is the story that is the main hero of this game. The combat is just there to spice things up... and provide you with loot to sell to buy stuff at the merchants and traders... WARNING, get those sick day excuses ready cos you are going to need a few with some of the late nights you are going to be putting in.  The leveling up system feels right but is severly let down by the fact that you have to retrain your troops at the beginning of every chapter - 8 chapters I think - so all of that hard work to level up your characters (barring your main character) and tweaking their equipment and shopping around to get the best stuff will all be in vain by the end of the chapter as you will be stripped of all of your sellable equipment and all your troops. You will be forced to start from scratch all over again (very small but significant exeptions) at the beginning of the next chapter and collect all of your equipment - AGAIN - and level up all of your guys - AGAIN - but as dissapointing as that sounds, it is actually worse. You will continuously be at a compounding disadvantage as you will have to start with raw recruits each time and although that might not be too much of a problem in the first, second or third chapters, buy the time you are well progressed into the game you will need to start with raw recruits going up against enemies that are more matched to your main character who has advanced significantly by this stage.  The sounds, music and graphics are all very beautful. There is no voice acting, all dialogue is written so get used to doing a bit of reading. The story is generally pretty good with very few 'cringe' moments that you might expect from japanese rpg's but the underlying theme of the storyline is quite mature and developed and centres around choice, consequence, belief and ego. The character models are not redrawn for each character in the game but are simply taken from a dozen or so stock character models, given different outfits and then regurgitated as different characters in the game so don't be surprised when Joe Blogs from the smithy looks a lot like the Duke from the castle with just a different hat. Thats because that's all it is, just a different hat, different name and different stats. See... told you I'd explain why its only a $20 game and not a $40+ game. One particularly annoying trait is the lack of sideward camera scrolling. The view is centred on your character and although you can rotate the angle and direction you cannot move the camera off of your character which means you are forced to constantly give them move orders to the edge of the screen, wait till they get there, give them the order again and keep repeating this untill they arrive at their destination which could be a world away. Fun I know. Then there are the bugs which unfortunately can become very frustrating.  Do these things really make the game bad? No, they don't. The GAME is great despite these flaws but they are a reminder that you are not playing a big publishing house A+++ title. Thats what I was saying before about it being on the mark for its price. If I had payed top dollar for this game then these issues would have surely offended me but I can overlook them considering the value I believe I am getting for the game and the enjoyment and play length that it offers.   In conclusion the game is great. Great story, great graphics, great sense of character progression and most importantly, great fun. It offers countless reminders of its indie roots but these should be kept in perspective of the price you are paying and the quality and quantity of enjoyment you derive from the game. There are always gonna be people who can't keep the reality in focus and are going to dwell on the negative despite ALL of the positive that the game offers. But thats the story of the world really. Final verdict... 7.5 out of 10. Excellent score all things considered.",

            "review_text": "At first, I wasn't too sure about the combat system. It seemed too simplistic (i.e., there weren't going to be enough tactical options). however, I ended up liking it a lot and found the beauty in it's simplicity. It's quite different from any other turn-based strategy game I ever played; sometimes your options are limited but that just has to be taken into account when planning your strategy (the worst thing is when you are forced to knowingly send one of your soldiers into a vicious counter-attack).   Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to endure walls of text. And let me be clear I have no problem reading text in my RPGs. When it's well-written, I like it just fine. But some of the many legends in Legend in Eisenwald (usually encountered as rumors in taverns) are… shall we say, needlessly verbose. They just go on and on and on. And while they are usually somewhat interesting and may even play an important part in the main story, I feel that many of them could be cut in half without losing anything substantial.   Some other things I wasn't crazy about:   *At the end of most chapters, you say goodbye to most, if not all of your soldiers and their gear.. That means all of the units that you worked to build into powerful army will be gone and you'll have to pretty much start over building your army in the next chapter.. leveling up peasants and buying basic equipment.   I understand that this probably done for game balance reasons (and in particular, to give you incentive to conquer enemy castles, which allows you to hire additional units)…. nevertheless, its very irritating to lose all your veteran soldiers and their gear, and the game usually gives very weak rationale for this (e.g., someone tells you that a large force will attract too much attention so you can only take two units… But then as soon as you get the next chapter, you'll likely recruit more troops ASAP). I would've preferred if the game was balanced to take more of my units with me… You spend a lot of time rebuilding your army in each chapter, and while that can be fun for awhile, it inevitably feels like busy work.  *Moving across some areas in the game can be pretty painful… I constantly experienced misclicking as it's seldom clear where you can and can't go on each area... Lots of twists and turns. It would have been nice if you could double click on a point on the map and have it plot a course to the destination… Instead, you have to actually see the place you want to go to, and since your field of view is so small, you will have to constantly rotate the camera to try to see whatever town or building you're trying to get to.   *There were a few instances where enemies respawned. I could understand if they were vampires or something, but no, there in one chapter I remember regular enemies coming back to life and retaking the castle.  *There were some instances in the game where my character makes some morally questionable choices that I would not have liked to do… There's perhaps a couple times in the game when you can make a choice, but for the most part your character is going to complete their quest by any means necessary. It's a bit frustrating in a role-playing game when things like this are decided for you… In the final chapter in particular, it seems my character acts based on a decision I made several chapters ago..   The final chapter dragged on a bit as you have to clear a bunch of castles, but I found the battles to all be rather easy (except the final battle which had an insanely powerful enemy).   Other than that, I really liked the game overall and would recommend giving it a shot if you want to try something different. The music is fantastic and the combat / character class progression system is simple, yet effective.",

No issues getting it to work, I like the graphic style very nice and still runs smooth on slightly older machines.  Simple but tactical combat that has kept me intrigued, with plenty of items and weapons.  Meaningful progression of my troops takes some time, which makes me really value their lives and I feel adds more immersion.  If you are looking for a medieval world to fully submerse yourself into, this is it. Beautiful artwork and music really helps create the world.  Small elements of fantasy really add to this game, as anyone who studies history will know, many people were very superstitious during this period. Legends, myths, magic and real history were often intertwined in the peoples pyche.  In summary, a great game from a small committed studio. Help them out and get this game.

            "review_text": "This is one of many cases when I regret that Steam reviews can only be positive or negative, and not neutral.  There are aspects of this game I like: The graphics are nice, so is the music until it is repeated once too often, and a lot of thought went into the quest plots.  On the other hand, there is a lot I do not like: Quests require you to read lots of long dialogues, without voice acting (should be standard in a modern RPG!). Quest objectives are often described vaguely, which makes you wonder what to do, wandering around the land until you enter a village you visited before and encounter a merchant who just recently appeared (because he was unlocked by the quest progression) who can sell you an item that solves your problem... that is irritating, especially as in this game, lost time costs you a lot of money, as you have to pay your companions regularly.  I do not like that your tactical choices in combat are so limited. There is an arbitrary rule that you HAVE to attack if you can, and as a melee fighter you can only attack the enemies standing closest to you - more than once I was forced to attack a heavily armoured opponent with an almost dead peasant, which was a kind of a suicide attack; meanwhile, my healthy and well-equipped main character stood two tiles away, but could not intervene because a mediocre henchman stood next to him and was the only valid target. This example should make it clear that the strict limitation of tactical decisions makes it impossible to develope actual strategies, and as enemy groups often display the same battle formation over and over, the fights become repetitive quite quickly.  I do not like that you cannot see equipped items on your character or the NPCs, only in their respective inventories. This takes a lot away from the immersion, as your choices for armour and amulets do not have a visible impact on the world, just on the stats. My character in particular kept his looks identical through the whole process of levelling up, even though I changed his armour three times.  I admit that I did not play the whole game. But up to now, everytime I entered a new chapter, my whole army was disbanded and their special weapons and trinkets lost, as I had to begin the new chapter alone and only with what I carried on my body. This felt very frustrating, as I invested a lot of care into the hiring, levelling and equipping of my soldiers. When the game made them simply disappear with all their gear, those efforts and every imaginary bond I could have had with my named NPCs who fought beside me through heated battles - just became pointless in a second.  For me personally, the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones slightly, and I give this game a 4/10.",

In more than 60 hours I played in the main campaign, at no point the combats felt tedious, actually I was always asking for more !..  Don't let its indie game looks deceive you, this one is a gem ! With devs who not only crafted a solid game but are very dedicated to insure their players get the best of it, through support on the forums and quick patches on very little number of issues (encountered the first one after some 40 hours of playtime), big editors should take example !..

Has some flaws ofc. but compared to similar games of this genre, it quickly became one of my favs.  The combat mechanism is a bit boring after a while but the environment, music and graphics are very nice.Also i like the character development and how your choices form the world and the different factions, lords.Quests usually can be solved in different ways, Hopefully we will have some updates and DLC-s for this game.  Dont hesitate to get it, if you are a fan of turn-based rpg/strategies, this game is for you too.",

Okay on the pro side:  + nice sound + nice location + nice ideas + nice 'medieval' art style + easy handling / simple game rules  Now the cons: - very linear story telling - very basic combat rules / possibilities (nothing for hardcore strategy-gamers) - average story - minimal rpg-aspects - no freedom at all ( In the tutorial I bought some items for my party - which left me after the tutorial. I thought I lost 1000 gold in items. So I started all over again ♥♥♥♥ing up my stupid party in the tutorial - guess what.... After the tutorial I started with the same fixed amount of gold I also had before. Please my dear game-makers let us players have some freedom some openess and let the game world be 'realistic' I mean in the story of this game why did I lose 1000 gold on a boat trip ? Why do I have to start with the same budget helping my old party or letting them run around naked ?   So far so good ... overall it's 5 of 10 stars.",

The UI is clunky and the graphics and animations are on par with early 2000s games. I thought it would be like a Heroes of Might and Magic game with a longer unit upgrade tree but there is no tactical gameplay at all. The two sides just wail on each other until one side wins. I honestly cannot believe this game is being sold for 30$ it should be more like 10$ to even be worth trying.",

Boring, repetitive, no real RPG elements and the combat (which is a huge part of the game) is very limited and slow. The game is incredibly linear and though quest choices are meant to change your experience, they just don't feel like they change anything. In fact all decisions in the game seem of little or no consequence. Should I attack army A or army B? Yawn Should I have an archer or a melee unit? It doesn't really matter Should I buy some new armour? Why bother Should I take the time to equip some of the armour I won in a battle? No the interface is annoying and it basically makes no difference. The game just doesn't feel strategic, it doesn't feel like an RPG and there is no adventure to be had. I've played for eight hours and can't face any more ",
