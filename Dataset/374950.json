But if one likes MADLibs and that type of absurd humor then this game will provide hours of amusement. NOTE: In no way should this game be taken seriously.",

It's the same 'story' each time you start a new game with the same 4 scenes except that there are different unhumorous replacements for characters or items. Things like a firebreathing broom or combining 2 or 3 unlikely items to make a spear. The so called humor in this game is just dumb, not one bit funny.",

There's a basic storyline and a set of objects that get shuffled, then you go through the story that way. The game is very short right now, but it has workshop support and the dev is working on releasing a storyline editor for the next update.   Create lots of random things and new stories in which to see them out of place.  For $2 it's a fun toy. Check it out.",

Not much replay value except for getting the achievements. For less than $2, you get what you're paying for. I'd recommend it if there was more to it, but as it stands, not quite worth it.",
