            "review_text": "Smuggler's 5 is a broken, unpolished mess. About a third of the tooltips are missing quotes and instead say 'early release version.' This game adds very little from the previous iterations. The combat is singularly unthrilling, the clunky UI could have been done better by a freshman taking a class in flash. Smugglers 5is not ENTIERLY without charm; The RPG elements and the reward system is cool. I like the idea of earning medals and awards that show up on the character's lapel. The diversity of available ships and the choose your own adventure elements are a fun diversion from the rest of the wreckage that was slapped together to build this rubbish. Im a sucker for ANY 4xer which is why I bought it, but at the end of the day I would have had an exponentially better time playing Mater of Orion, which makes no sense seeing that MOO is over 20 years than this game.

            "review_text": "I tremendously enjoyed this game! I think it is one of the most underrated games on Steam. The series dates back to 2000 or 2001 and each game in the series has been more and more improved. It´s very polished (dev still making regular updates and listens to community) and has a great depth. I cannot understand some of the reviews here. I think they have been fooled by the easy accessibility and did not play long enough to get to the advanced features. In the base game you can fly everything from a fighter up to battleships. I don´t understand how one review can say they aren´t in the game. Also each profession has some unique skills, for example a trader can flee the battle and has special skills to defend and delay combat until reinforcements (which other game simulates reinforcements??) arrive or a pirate has special abilities focused on making sure exactly this doesn´t happen.  If you are looking for a very addictive 2D version of Elite, Pirates or Freelancer, don´t look no further. However if you prefer 3D or very good graphics, you have to look somewhere else.",

            "review_text": "This game has potential, clearly some effort has gone into it, but sadly it feels unfinished, unpolished and unloved.   Along similar lines to FTL (Faster Than Light) and SPAZ (Space Pirates And Zombies) with nods to classics such as Elite it's a good concept. Fly a spaceship around, trading, killing and / or completing missions to earn cash to buy better spaceships and equipment to complete harder tasks. You can start as a member of one of four factions and then choose a profession. Once your character is promoted (levels up) you can choose a skill to purchase which effects your options, (primarily in regards to combat). There are options to purchase pirate bases, take over areas of space etc... But at it's core it's just a couple of simple mechanics over and over again. If you havent played FTL or SPAZ and are considering buying this, then absolutely do NOT buy this, buy one of those instead, they are far more polished and feel like finished products. With all the typos, clunky UI design, jarring save system, lack of useful tooltips (which can sometimes be confusing to make sense of), Smugglers 5 quickly becomes a lesson in frustration. It's a shame, it has enough individuallity that it could have been a real hit, but for some reason it seems the developer abandoned it rather than give it the love it needed to succeed.  6.5/10",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game with reservations. On sale it's dirt cheap, so you probably won't feel ripped off, but it's definitely an odd game not meant for everyone.   On the positive end, if you enjoy those sorts of turn-based open-world games where you just do your own thing, this can be a lot of fun. If you like action, run now.  What you see in the screenshots is mostly what you see the whole game. This game has very little by way of simulation, and almost everything that is calculated is either randomly spawned on the spot or hidden away with very little player interaction. How's the war going? WHO KNOWS! It doesn't seem to change anything so far as what ships are travelling the not-sea-lanes.   There's also a frustrating lack of clarity in many tasks you need to accomplish. If you accept non-government missions, there is no mission review for you, so I hope you wrote down what you're supposed to do, and screw you if you put the game down for a while, there's no reminders of if you even took that mission on at all. Much of the game revolves around being part of factions, and if you start out as an independent trader or smuggler, there's a large chunk of the game barred from your access until you join one... and joining one is frustratingly vague. Apparently, it's a  random event , but everyone berates you for not doing something you haven't been given an opportunity to do... and for that matter, getting the person berating you for not joining the war effort  has to be bribed into offering you  that chance, and this is  not mentioned anywhere in the manual or the game .   Incidentally, this guy is the governor (always a male) that lets you marry his daughter and have kids if you bribe him enough... regardless of your own gender. Odd that the game even has an option to play female characters then, or is it that in the far future, everyone's bisexual, and IPS cells make lesbian pregnancies routine?   The game's combat is also crippled by its 1-on-1 nature. You're at the extreme end supposed to be a fleet commander on a battleship leading a whole fleet into battle against another fleet... and this is represented with 1-on-1 battles where 'reinforcements' are additional damage done to the opposing lead ship at the end of every third turn. This game begs for a tactical grid map.  Beyond that, combat is performed with a pseudo-card game. Your basic attacks are always present and can be used as frequently as you have AP for them, but you get a hand of action cards that refill at the start of the turn. These can do things like evasive maneuvers that decrease enemy accuracy or increase your own to scramble enemy computers or harden your own against similar attacks, or 'Luck' cards that discard your hand so you can draw a new one. (Which bizarrely costs you AP, as well, making them sometimes more punishment than help, as while they're supposed to let you discard useless cards, THEY are useless cards, themselves, and you can often wind up using a luck card to discard other luck cards...)   When you level up, (experience is obtained through absolutely everything, even standard trades,) you get a message telling you that if you keep on levelling up, you will eventually get a  RANK  up, which is the real level up. (Like everything else, they don't tell you how long you have to keep doing this to get the actual rank up, so the experience bar is a lie.) When you  rank  up, you get a new skill, which gradually lets you fill out a skill tree, and also can potentially give you a new card to use in combat. You have no particular control over your 'deck' beyond this, however, and each new skill is a new card in the deck that you can't remove. Passive skills aren't deck cards, however, so they are more 'safe' to take as a path up the skill tree.   Classes basically exist to deny specific game features to the player until they have played each class (from a new game) to get a high enough rank to reach the end of the skill tree, where only then are you allowed to buy property. Fleet Officers and Bounty Hunters get a fleet command ability that lets them buy battleships and lead fleets, traders get to buy factories, smugglers buy pirate stations, and pirates can buy pirate stations and found pirate empires. It's more than a little annoying, as, even if you do want to focus on one path, you generally are far more than rich enough to buy a factory if you are a trader before you have the 'skill' to be a factory owner, which is an arbitrary roadblock that forces you to keep shuttling goods around for far too long.   Trading basically just involves buying low and selling high, but involves whether or not you can tell what prices something sells for is utterly random - you have as good a chance of knowing the price of engines on the other side of the galaxy as you do the sector you just left. That said, war tends to make things easier: Sectors at war just plain double the prices they pay for everything, making profits large enough to pay for your freighter take only a couple trips and a minute or two of your time. It's so much more profitable than anything else that anything else is a waste of time, in terms of optimization, but it's also rather dull to just keep running the same routes over and over.   There are other things available, like talking to governors, talking in bars, exploring planets, and other ships in the sector, but they're generally so invisible that you have to go out of your way to remember to hunt them down. There should be more variety in the average game day than just having these things be the random distractions from the all-important freight hauling where you have zero human interaction.   In terms of plot, this game names all its sectors things like 'New Ireland' or 'New Germany' or 'New Italy', but the story is unabashedly Amero-centric. It straight-up tells you in the manual that the game is meant to be The American Revolution and American Civil War. So, the story basically goes that the Federation (or Empire, as it's called anytime it's supposed to be the bad guy, because empires are bad, 'mmmkay?) passed some 'tyrannical' laws, so some of the colonies started a rebellion after having a Tea Party. (Subtle!) What were these tyrannical laws, you might ask? A prohibition on slavery, of course, since the economy of the rebel colonies are based upon slavery. (No mention of race, though, that part's whitewashed out in more ways than one.) Needless to say, this kind of undermines the whole rebel unifying cry of 'freedom', or how 'tyrannical' it is to demand freedom for others, but hey, I guess I can give points for capturing some of the moral hypocrisy of it all. Anyway, the Federation is still portrayed as evil because they also burn Savanna - I mean, perform orbital bombardments, although EVERY faction commits similar war crimes willy-nilly, which raises the question of how the economy springs back to normal after half its population and its entire industrial base were incinerated.  In any event, there's two other factions besides the Federated States of American Imperial Union and the Colonial Confederacy: There's the Trade Coalition, which seems to have no particular backstory or role in this at all, aside from being a place for supposedly neutral merchants, although the AI that controls them is no less aggressive in trying to conquer everyone else. Considering their European colony names, I guess they're supposed to be Dutch traders or something. Then, there's the Syndicate, which is basically the 'LOL, we're totally evil!' pirate faction, although they're surprisingly hostile to smuggling rum,  themselves  for no good reason. They're given planets like Barbados, which implies they're the Carrbiean pirate nations, but also have New Moscow as their capital, because Haiti isn't threatening enough on its own, if you want real villains, you need them to be Russian!",

The space is 2-D and the ship battles are turn based still graphic (no movement) affair. It has more to do with rock-paper-scissor-shotgun than true battle.  The other big difference is that you can work for the army (A faction among four), be a smuggler, a pirate, a bounty hunter or a straight trader. There ain't much difference between all of them because you can do all of those no matter what class you choose at the start, but it's more difficult to do missions that are not for your class. Until you get a kickass ship big enough to do anything anyway.  The universe is lifeless and repetitive, the missions are always the same crap, the challenge isn't great either. All in all its a boring game. There is quite a bit of rpg element sprinkled in it, but for me it did not add to the story.  There is also an expansion called 'invasion' that you can buy. Maybe it add more to the game and make it better, but for me this game is far too dull compared to the millions other that i can play to waste my time here.  Verdict: DO NOT BUY  See ya",
