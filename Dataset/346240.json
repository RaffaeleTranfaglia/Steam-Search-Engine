            "review_text": "I really like tycoon games and amazingly (based on my user name) im a huge fan of skiing as well so I immediately bought this when I heard about it. What I really like about this game over others is that there is very little bothering about with the village, fiddling about with hotel prices is not what I want. It isn’t though only based on the slopes as restaurants and shelters need to be built to be successful. What I also really like in this game is that instead of people appearing at one point in the map isn’t in this game. Instead each map is generated with roads and car parks can be placed at any location flat enough to do so. 90% of the people then spawn at one of these car parks with the rest thought the day. Another thing I really like is the proper animations of people getting on and off chair/drag lifts (cable cars don’t have any animations) instead of teleporting. Personally I really recommend this game to anyone considering it. For anyone wondering about play time I now have 60 hours on this game, I have finnished the campign for the game and am about 20% of the way through the seperate senarios. There are also some addons (senarios but with real world locations) which I havnt even started on.",

            "review_text": "The game doesn't work. No one should have to downgrade their nvidia card driver. This game should be taken off steam until it is fixed. With that said I did change the card driver. This game has very little to do in it. There are very few buildings and you take a very small role in creating a lift chair and adding slopes. The create slope mechanic is straight forward but very limited. Trails need to go from top to bottom starting at the end a chair lift and ending at the start of a chair lift. Due to this alot of terrain is wasted. The role of the player in maintaining the resort is very limited as well. You can add a snow gun and place a snow cat garage. The maps you work with are also small.   Overall there is potential here but the game just misses. For $10 I would not recommend this game, for $.99 - 5.00 you will get an hour of almost fun out of it.",
