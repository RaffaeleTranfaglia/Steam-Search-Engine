            "review_text": "First of all, I recommend this game, it's a great tower defense. The main idea of the game is to travel in space with the ship, and to defend yourself from the enemy ships. The music makes you to feel like you are playing an old school game, awesome soundtrack. You start with only one turret, you can't pass the first planet without doing some upgrades or buying some new defense guns, lasers, turrets, rocket launchers etc., and you need some skill, it's not that easy to hit all the enemy ships and win. The game has some tasks, when you finish the task you get a reward, like energy, money and aluminium so you can upgrade your weapons. It's addictive, you want to destroy more ships, to get more energy, to travel more, to reach the next planet. Main problem of the game now, it's that starting with the second half of planet two, the game become a bit unplayable, 5-10fps drops, but the dev is already working on that.  Per-total, it's a great game, addictive, and worth a shot.",

            "review_text": "A fun, uncommon tower defense game where you play a bunch of space pirates on some kind of mission. (A piratey mission, I'd wager). You start off with a battleship equipped with one main cannon and as a result will most likely be massacred in the first level, but you keep all loot/side quest progress accumulated in a level after death, so you're able to beef up and tackle the level anew. The game is a bit rough around the edges, but I think it brings a lot of charm to the table.  The game can be acquired for a handful of pennies via the 16Bit Nights Bundle right here on Steam, and this game alone is worth the price of entry.",

This game in my opinon is worth hald of the price now.(unless more is added)  although i recommend the experience if you have a dollar that you dont know on what to spend.",

Therefore you crappy and seemingly useless low-level turrets get destroyed. So it's a game about hunting small black dots against a black space background. Simply incorrect tutorial text (press right mouse button to fire? The picture is of the left mouse button...) and poor localisation into English also grates. I would play this for a bit as a free flash game, I am not personally convinced it is worth money.",
