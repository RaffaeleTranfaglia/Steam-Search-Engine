It has an interesting dynasty mechanic which is more than I could say for Rome 2 Total War when it was first released and I wasted $50 on. It also has a fun and somewhat believable market system and decent visualized battle calculation which is more than I can say for Grand Ages Medieval on which I also wasted another $50. The reason I thumb this down is because it belongs on my browser. NOT on STEAM where it insults quality games such as Crusader Kings 2 by even being listed here.",

            "review_text": "Well, it's kind of like a facebook-style pay-for-speedups type of 'strategy' game, but with very little strategy imo, just lots of tedious leveling and researching of technologies, etc. When you attack an enemy, your victory or defeat will be displayed on a summary screen, with no combat displayed. I stepped out of the room for a minute and when I came back the game screen was completely white. If you like this type of game, then more power to ya, but personally its not for me, especially when there are better types of games out there. There is a free to play version of Age of Empires out there still (I think) google that and check it out for kicks.",
