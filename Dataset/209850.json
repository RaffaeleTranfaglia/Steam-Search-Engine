The gameplay is a bit like final fantasy tactic, but the tactics are waaay easier and too simple, the story is dull and i don't know, i just find it boring to play.  I tried to put some hours into it thinking it gets better later, but i could not get farter than a few hours before i was through. I don't think i'll get back to it again, too many other really fun games to play!",
