            "review_text": "I can't express my feeling after finished this game. That huge plot twist at the ending give me the 'WOW Effect'. Clever &amp; brilliant of storytelling made this HORROR ADVENTURE RPG game is enjoyable to follow. Music &amp; soundtrack that perfectly blend, and it can made atmosphere in this game eery and haunting but in some moment so peaceful, calm &amp; dreamy. It is no doubt, this game could be categorize as 'great soundtrack' in steam tag.  As an adventure games, this game has gameplay as point &amp; click adventure. Player can interact some object on screen, and NPC in town. Looking for item by clicking object, use item from inventory, combine item and use them. As an RPG games, this game has feature that player can get money beside defeating enemies are hunting &amp; fishing. Player can hunt animals, and sell their pelt to trader to get money. Or sell fish from fishing to get money too. By money, player can upgrader their weapon or armor, buying bolts for crossbow or potion to healing or get a tattoo for special effect.   Well, Dark Fear is retro-like MS-DOS game. With gimmick like booting game in old MS-DOS game, this game has a plus to be a tribute to MS-DOS classic adventure games. Great artwork, great story and great music made this game has everything to be called as the good game. And this game is one of hidden gem that lying in steam library. Recommended!!  Last word ... BE WARY OF JUMP SCARES !",

            "review_text": "Very good game for the price.  Positive: Great point and click adventure Fun combat  Negatives: Hunting / Fishing for money to pay for upgrades gets really boring really fast Short, even with grinding  Overall: It took me 4.5 hours and probably 1 hr of that was grinding for upgrades (which you need for combat). I would have liked more adventure, less grind.  This game does a great job of making you feel like a monster hunter. You need to know which weapons to use, what special ammo to stock up on, which potions and protective tattoos to apply. ",
