            "review_text": "Surprisingly fun casual game. It's a sort of a defense game where you set up your ships and defend/defeat the zombie enemy onslaught. The difficulty was perfect in my opinion; it was really hard to achieve diamond rank in some levels, but not impossible. The variety of ships and characters were entertaining. It has a comic story line and feel which makes it fun to play. I recommond it.",

When I finally gave up trying to get the keyboard to work and started a game, I found out that I was going to be called 'he' throughout the game despite being a custom named, (assumedly?) faceless captain. Yeah, no thanks.  Maybe this is a good game for men who can actually get it to work properly on their computers. Not so much for me.",
