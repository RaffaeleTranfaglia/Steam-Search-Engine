            "review_text": "Game looks OK and controls alright, but difficulty is wildly variant. The enemies tend to be trivial, but the game has awkward jumping sections where you get to contend with fiddly hit-boxes, jerky platform motion, and instakill spikey bits. The game doesn't follow normal platform game conventions for visuals - so while the elements are all plain-old platformer things, you're often surprised by how things behave. That was a disappearing platform? Really? I've played tons of platformers, and most follow visual conventions to tell things to players while still keeping a unique style. Eg. I just played 'You have to win', and while it's a tough game, it quickly communicated to me what I needed to know to play.  And it's not just visual, it's 'gameplay contract' stuff. Sometimes you have to blind jump. Sometimes blind jumps kill you. The enemies move erratically, like the frogs don't finish their jumps they just kind of come down when they want. Sometimes something is a functional graphic, sometimes it's just background (ie. you won't know what 'spikey stuff' will kill you until it kills you).  Most frustrating is that it has a 'lives' mechanic - so you can restart from a level checkpoint until you're out of lives. I understand this is how games used to work, but there's a reason games don't work this way anymore - it's frustrating and boring. It's not like the game is trying to get my quarters or something; all this does is encourage the player to kill themselves until 'game over' if they're at the start of the level with men down - because you don't want to work your way to a checkpoint if you've only got one guy left. Suiciding is boring.  Also, the power ups are lame (and, again, feel irrelevant since the challenges in the game seem to be mostly environment). Like, the ice projectile thing freezes an enemy, but you can't go hit it while it's frozen. That's lame. There's no joy to the combat. You don't feel like you're chopping at dark demon monsters, you're just kind of waving your sword hitbox around and dealing damage.   Anyway, enough complaints. The game seems to basically work, and I'm sure most players will get their $1 worth of entertainment here. But I thought I'd give some feedback that's hopefully helpful either to the developer or potential players.",
