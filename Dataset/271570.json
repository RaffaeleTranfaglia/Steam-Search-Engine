            "review_text": "Space Farmers is a very interesting game, but serious issues plague what could be a great fantastic co op game.  The game is basically a two player co op game where you play as two farmers who try to escape a space ship, by completing tons of goals.  The game consists of 30 levels which you can pick any of them to complete. After the first 10 random levels you can pick any route you want, since you can only do 5 levels per route.  The gameplay consists of you trying to solve with your friend and trust me you will need someone with a mic that you can talk to, cause you will need someone to figure out the puzzles with.  The puzzles range from trying to get to the end of the level by activating switches, killing robots with different weapons and gadgets. They very from shotguns to pistols, to explosives, you also have gadgets like jetpacks, x ray glasses and torches.  The game is incredibly fun with a friend, but there is also a lot of bad.  The controls are for the most part really fluid, but there are some bits that are incredibly annoying to control ( you will know once you see it).  First of all the soundtrack is atrocious. It really hurts the ears while you're playing, overall the audio design is really mediocre, not to mention when talking on skype or through any other software it's gonna be incredibly hard to hear what your friend has to say, cause even then the sound is way too loud.  The game also has some level design issues. Like some really hard stuff. Now hard stuff isn't bad, but some of the stuff in the game is incredibly unfair.   The game took me 4 hours to finish. There is some replay value to do the extra achievements and there's also a challenge room to test your skills.  Overall do I recommend Space Farmers ? For the full price no, but once it goes on sale definitely give it a try and give the second copy to your friend and have yourself a good ol time.  Pros: +Great puzzles +Fun Gameplay +Good Co Op  Cons: -Terrible music -Clunky controls    Final Rating: 7/10  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

            "review_text": "I've played two sets of Challenge levels. I can't judge the rest of the levels but so far I think I've seen enough of the game to understand how it plays. Solid execution of a puzzle game with poor visual appearance, preventing many from seeing how good this game is. 8/10 due to low replay value, not attractive art style, and not reliable for online play.  Pros: - The game requires two player effort: Some games that claim it utilizes co-op for it's level design don't usually need a second player. This one has at least 7 out of the 10 levels I tried that truly needs two players to work together or else either one cannot complete the level. My favorite was a level where each player has a bomb on their head and is timed to blow up after 10 seconds. Each player has to deactivate traps in sequence and even time when they pick up a timer power up to reset the bomb timer. It was a blast trying it.  - Variety in level challenge: Out of the 10 I've played, me and a friend played a level where we did an arena shooter where monsters spawned randomly and random dangers launched projectiles. We played a level where we had to guide a dinosaur across the level using a mobile cookie maker. Another level had me flying through active danger while my buddy shot at the enemy, effectively making me a decoy for the level.  - Cool Co-Op oriented weapons: One level I did used had a weapon that was a detonator while the other player launched potato mines. Another was a time me and another player used laser beam weapons where they are extremely powerful, but can kill each other if the laser touched us. Very cool stuff.  Cons  - Not appealing graphics: Passable art style, but was a major factor for most of my friends to not play it. Only by trying it when we were bored and deciding what to play did we play this. Makes the game look like it passed the Greenlight barrier because of the game being given away by the Dev, even though it wasn't.  - Requires a good internet connection for online play: I was able to play with 1 of 3 friends while we tried to get it running. The other 2 don't have the best connection, roughly broadband quality in their region of the world, so be weary when trying to play with online friends. Split Screen worked perfectly.",

The game has you solving puzzles with your friend and trying to get to a portal at the end, using shotguns, laser beams, gravity gloves and all kind of gadgets.   The game looks like something unfinished, and it kinda felt like it, but it plays well enough. Sometimes I was even suprised how little there was to complain about bugs, since there really weren't any that I noticed. Though, the enemies could have used some tweaking on their attacks hitting.  Would I recommend this? Yes, expecially if you're planning on letting kids play this, since none of the puzzles are too hard, are short enough to finish fast and are quite fun. I would however suggest buying it on a sale as I feel that 9,99€ for it is a bit too much.",

Well, you're depriving those two Brits from the pleasure of their tea so I guess they'll break out and try getting the f*** outta there!  Space Farmers is a two players ( only ) co-op isometric puzzle shooter thingy with cute and nice graphics ( subjective opinion ) and mindblowing music to boot ( completely objective! critics can bend over! ). No single player campaign and if you have a third friend ( who has the time for that? ) you'll need to ditch him/her - this is two players and two players only. The greatest thing about Space Farmers is that there isn't that much farming - it's truly co-operative puzzles.   'Like Portal 2?'  you ask.   'F*** Portal 2!'  I say. When it comes to co-operative puzzle games P2 has nothing to say against Space Farmers. An example; at one point you and your buddy are walking down separate corridors. He (or she, who's judging?) has a pair of blue goggles, you have a pair of red goggles. You see all the red enemies but can't see the blue and vice versa. You really need to communicate to come out of that place alive!  In all respects; but especially if you're searching for a two players (online or local) co-op puzzle game - this is it! IT IS IT!",

Each level presents a unique and fun way to complete the level and to kill your friend in humorous ways, like when you have to carry a bomb hat and you decide to steal your friends clock making his hat explode. For 10 dollars the game is a little expensive but if you find it during a sale and have a friend to play with then it's a must buy, since it can only be played in co-op due to the nature of the levels wait for 3$ or less or bundle like i did.",

Why the ♥♥♥♥ is it turnips and not something else that made sense. Weak point I know, calling it a joke would not be quite correct. It's a quick cash and grab for the develepors tricking people into buying it. Why do I say that? The game is filled with bugs and bad develepment. You can walk through walls, fall through the map and its so much more thats wrong with it. By the amount of bugs that is in this I am suprised this is not in alpha still. HRMF quick cash grab for the develepors.  This is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent, and that says alot because a friend gave it to me and said it would be 'fun'. This game... no not a game, some quick bucks for the develpors. It might attract some 7 year olds, that would have as much fun bashing each other with ♥♥♥♥ing rocks. Its just ♥♥♥♥, just ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. I'll give it one thing though, me and my friend had some 'fun' abusing the bugs and finding spots in maps where you just fell off randomly, plumming to your lonely virgin doom, other than that it was just crying because the game was way to buggy for us to complete a level or the fact that enemys glitched out so the killed us when we were behind walls. I belive I would have found more 'fun' watching holocaust documentarys, hey atleast I would have been ENTERTAINED then, other than just looking at my screen and considering the meaning of life while we failed one more mission or picked up 3 more turnips. It puts a shame to the Indie industry this pice of garbage was marketing itself like something good, like something people would have such a great time with. And it worked, people bought this ♥♥♥♥, wasted money. Cheeky lucky develepors made alot on it.   The only way you will find any sort of fun in this is: if you are a child, if you are a child molester, if you are mentally unstable and find ♥♥♥♥ and fart jokes HILLARIUS or if you are a pice of ♥♥♥♥ that find everything funny if you have friends to do it with, like me. But it was not funny, it was a pain. This game became a meme in the friendship i had with the lad, not because it was like: oh yeah lets do like we did in space farmers. Oh no it was like: Hey there Spidur why dont we complete all of the achivements on space farmers, followed by both of us lauging before we went back into the holes we came from.  To sum up please do not buy this game, what you are doing by buying this game is not only wasting your money. You would be supporting the quick cash and grab game industry. You would be apart of this cancerous community. Good luck anyhow this review has been way too long on a game like this.",
