So if you already have quicktime you have to uninstall it and then install QTLite to get this game to run. If you actually need to have quicktime installed for something else to function (iTunes), QTLite will break that. Even GFWL games gave me less problems than this game.  IF you can get it to run, it's a decent tower defense game. But I'd take Pixeljunk Monsters, Kingdom Rush, or even Super Sanctum TD over this,  since you can actually just install those and have them work.",

The devs really need to work on this and put out an effective patch with some good programming behind it to optimise performance. Without this the game is unplayable and will die, which would be a shame.  The basic problem is that the mouse moves like a slug and destroys all enjoyment, replacing fun with frustration.  It is a pretty game, but really not very high end and should not be experiencing these technical probelms. Compare it to defence grid for example. It's the sort of game that should work smothly on a basic android phone.  .....and it needs quicktine - what?!!! Get it fixed guys and I will review it positively, as the game has potential.",

So, having played this game, which I've done (I've done the action of playing the game - I haven't done the game), I can say this: It offers graphics and some sound effects and uh there's a colored and dreamlike universe and also a captivating reahahhashahgfafha ah ah aha hahahahhahah who gives a single godd­amn f­ucking s­hit about the lore of a f­ucking tower defense game ahahahahahasbashash ash ashahahhash asha sh ah ibg eihgbeh grwlha a fwqe i qewfuhe esdguobersw im dying r ffffewrb b  ",

            "review_text": "Built into this bog-standard tower defense game is a great story of a young boy fighting to regain his memories.   The dream world, where the action takes place, is moulded by William's experiences and reflects a mind shrouded in the dark fog of forgetfulness. All this is visualised using beautiful 3D graphics painted with the stark contrasts between colourful innocence of childhood and bleak grey of memory loss.   The bland and boring tower defense mechanics are spiced up a little through special challenges that introduce new rules and gameplay elements, shame there are only 2 types of those.   Overall a decent play if dosed appropriately, well recommended for the story and visuals.",
