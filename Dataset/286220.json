            "review_text": "I've seen a few reviews on here that were a bit too critical. 'I don't like the way the heal spell looks' is one of them, which is obviously just nitpicking. Anyway, I absolutely love and recommend this game if you like JRPG type games. I've listed what I liked and disliked, and will update as I get further into the game.  Good features: + Stylish graphics, switch between HD or classic 16 bit look + Great music, also able to switch to Sega Genesis sound + Quick to get you into the game, very fun upbeat story + Compatible with many controllers, even my SNES one! + Adjustable encounter rate: fight more or no enemies at all + Adjustable combat speed: great for when you're just training  Unappealing features: - Steam overlay is bugged. Will move/select when typing. - The controls can be strange. Not game breaking.*  * Holding a directional key seems to disable the use/talk button in the middle of dialog. When using a heal spell out of combat, there is a strange quirk where I have to hit the up button to scroll left, but the right button to scroll to the right. This is incredibly minor. ALSO if you do have controller issues, right click the game on steam, go to properties, set launch options, and write dxjoy. This might make your controller more compatible. Be sure to map buttons once ingame of course.  I'd like to add that games of this nature are very rare. The HD graphics have incredible, well-detailed environments with some classic 16 bit sprites mixed in. It's a timeless work of art; these visuals don't age and are very pleasant to look at. Give the demo a try if you are interested, and take into account that the bad reviews are only from a handful of people. If more people decided to try this game out, the ratings would likely go way up. In an oversaturated indie market, where some of the most lazy looking, blocky games are highly praised, I find it hard to accept that Pier Solar gets hardly any attention; it provides beautiful visuals, great music, a lovely story and classic RPG mechanics that are both intuitive and pretty satisfying.  - Sarah",

            "review_text": "This game was made back in 2010 for the Sega Genesis by the developers WaterMelon. The developers wanted to make this game as if it was released back in 1994. Everything about this game is FANTASTIC! Pier Solar is very reminisce to other RPGs of the time including Phantasy Star and Chrono Trigger. This game does have some issues, but every other game of that era had issues.   I have beat this game once, but I will be playing this game multiple times.",

It's not terrible, it's just boring. There are positive aspects to this game, like the ability to control the encounter rate so you can set it to never have random encounters or have an encounter every step. Other than that, however, the magic system was frustrating, leveling was underwhelming, the battles were a chore, and the story was sparse. Overall it's not the worst JRPG I've played, but I just can't recommend to anyone but hardcore fans of the genre.",

The encounters are very unbalanced, the environment is used to conceal critical paths and information, and the puzzles are unintuitive. The gameplay is depressingly linear, and uninteresting. You basically do the same thing each battle, with very little variety. The item progression is as expected from an RPG of this genre, but is still dissapointing. There are far better games to spend your money on than this one.",

The art style is to the point where the characters pretty much all look the same face-wise, and like theyre always smiling. As though someone took the same exact face and added maybe 1, maybe -2- small small edits to differentate emotion.  The writing is just, boring. It's a hard game to follow because you don't want too. The tropes are obnoxious with your superb male hero and that ONE mechanic nerd and that ONE gorgeous elven chick. It's just...  No.",
