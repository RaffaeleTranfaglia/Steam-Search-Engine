Reading folk who are jaded by flash-bang FX and blood and guts in their gameplay won't change that. This game was one of the first I played against others. You picked a race, set the conditions and went at it, talk about cut throat!  Decades later, I still enjoy this game, hence my buying it when I found it on steam. It would qualify as 'comfort food' if a game were to be compared to something that brought good feelings of good times to mind when eating it.  I recomend it to anyone who wants a true challenge to learn how to run a war at a base line level.  Hmph. I noticed that a lot of reviews complained about getting it to work. I followed the directions of the other guy who gave a thumbs up and it works fine on my win 10 OS.",
