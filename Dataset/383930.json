            "review_text": "  The Doorways games continue to impress me. This is definitely the biggest and most ambitious yet with terrifying new enemies, more complex environments, and a continued trend of innovative puzzles to solve.  Holy Mountains of Flesh is what I like to refer to as a game with “perfect pacing”. Unlike many horror themed games out there, the Doorways series always manages to strike a great balance between tension and relief. You’re not constantly being chased, but at the same time you’re not constantly being left alone. It continuously surprised me. You think you’ve entered a puzzle part of the game, but that puzzle turns out to be a chase sequence etc.   Also worth mentioning is Sam A. Mowry, who reprises his voice acting role as Thomas Foster, the main protagonist from the previous two games. He once again delivers a stellar performance that really lends itself to the Doorways atmosphere. The game wouldn’t be the same without him!  It upsets me that Doorways Holy Mountains of Flesh is the final game in the saga, but it’s certainly a worthy send off to a very enjoyable horror series. The small team at Saibot Studios have clearly put a lot of effort into making this, so I recommend giving it a try!",
