I do not think it is finished though, but since the idea and engine are actually pretty great, only a few minor fixes are needed to make it really enjoyable: - the tutorial is already better, but a few bubbles telling what the different numbers mean, might be of great help (it can be figured out but it takes quite a little trial and error) - Some stats would be really nice: a table listing all routes with the same info I can get when I'm clicking on it, (which I can order by the different columns) would help a lot to find what to focus on. - Might be nice to set the quality aspects separately for the different routes / or at least to be able to start sub-brands with different setups (as in real life: many big airlines also own low-cost alternatives) - and yes, some goals might be great, or at least some correspondence between how much money we make and how much legroom we get in adjustments (i.e. points I can spend in each turn) Anyhow: for the developer: don't give up, just finish the game For other players: don't give up on difficulty to figure it out, it is quite enjoyable once you know what you are doing ",
