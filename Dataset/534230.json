            "review_text": "Highly enjoyable. Initially, I had buyer's remorse (I usually always get this...) but was very pleased when it went away after about 5 minutes. I think the controls are fantastic. Really awesome to finally play a Vive game that is virtually a finished product. Probably needs a bit of fine-tuning, but this one is definitely going to hold my interest for a while. You WILL feel like a bad ♥♥♥ when strafing with a shotgun blowing enemies in half.",

In all seriousness, this game is a total blast! Each enemy type is unique and requires a different skill to defeat. In the last update, Ducking/dodging In real life now translates in-game, which made it that much more fun to play. I'm currently stuck on the final level of the first layer (grass/trees with flying bugs) - this Boss Battle is Intense!  I can see where the devs could take this 'interface' for a 3d shooter and translate it to a bunch of older 386/486 FPSes (doom 2, hexen, etc), which would breath new life into older games... Here's Hoping!",

            "review_text": "No dice: VR sim sickness from the artificial movement. I thought being able to control the speed of Mucus (your slime mount &amp; mechanism for artificial movement) would make it bearable but after only a few minutes I done. I can't recommend this game if you're susceptible to VR sim sickness from artificial movement. There are no blink-teleports nor alternate movement options.  On the plus side: The graphics are crisp and bright. The shooting (of the starter pistol) seemed fine -- no reload mechanic just like the old DOS FPS game days. I really appreciate pre-made levels and not 'randomly, procedureally generated every time' that's so in-vogue these days. (Sometimes we like to re-play the same levels and get to learn &amp; then master them.) Overall it felt &amp; looked like homage to Wolfenstein 3-D, and that drew me into buying it.",
