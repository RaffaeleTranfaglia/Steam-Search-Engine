THe difficulty level in this game is insanse, everything is random, some games you get powerups some you don't get any. The enemy spawn is also 100% random meaning you can get swarmed 10 seconds into the game, or have enemys literally all around you in less time then you can fire 6 shots (keep in mind some enemys take 2-4 hits) Better yet after you get 500 points and go for 1000 (The final achievement), they take away the best weapon and give you some POS laser that is worse than the default gun. Needs alot of work from the devs in order to make it playable.  Just avoid this game, not worth the trouble.",
