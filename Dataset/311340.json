            "review_text": "Now this is how its done. This is quality port right here, no crashes, stuttering or unstable frame rate. Running it on the highest settings at 60 frames. Its looks fantastic and its graphically superb.  It has full Keyboard+Mouse support or the 360 gamepad.  The sound quality is amazing, same with the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job voice acting Snake. It was a little shocking at first because i'm so used to the voice of David Hayter, but i got along just fine and i believe Sutherland will live to everyone's expectation in this game and The Phantom Pain.  The game might be a little bit short but the story is pretty good (If you played Peace Walker, you will understand). Besides, the pricing is perfect and the game offers some replay value. This is just a little slice of what we are going to get in The Phantom Pain and i cannot wait for it. I'm thankful for finally being able to play this on PC the way it was meant to be played. 9 months ago, i bought a PS4 for this game and i was about to order the game for the console, i'm so glad i've waited for the PC version.  Hats off to one of the greatest developers of all time, Hideo Kojima. Thank you so much for this, thank you. And thank you Gabe for making it happen on Steam  Rating: 10/10. Go for it right now!!",

This may or may not offend your sensibilities, but in my opinion it's worth the cost if you're not on a tight budget and find it on sale   Positives   -Gorgeous graphics -Stable and well-ported  -Tight and simple but not overly simplistic controls; feels very mechanically sound; takes some cues from games like Splinter Cell  -No count-down timers or radar make for a more tense, fun, and challenging experience -Useable vehicles -Sandbox -Non-linear setup allows for a variety of playing styles (i.e., stealthy, run-and-gun, etc)  All-in-all I give this a recommend if you find it in the $10-15 price range or lower. Though short, there's a few other missions that open once you finish the prologue, and the gameplay is rich and complex enough that it has a decent amount of replayability, the graphics are great, the sound is great, and it's a lot of fun.  It makes my Metal Gear... Solid.",

Fun, nice mixture of action and stealth and the ability for the player to approach the situation as they see fit. It's really setting the foundation of the story for TPP and after being kept waiting for a long while, the legendary Snake is back and boy is my Snake Solid.  I've got 100% on this game and it took me a fair while, you could play through the story once and complete all the side ops but I really think to get your money out of the game you should go for the full completion. Although it's not for everyone as it can be tricky getting everything on S, yet still, a challenge is entertaining. This is only a taster of what TPP is going to be and I can say with confidence it's going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.

This game is no different from any other Metal Gear, the gameplay was improved, it's more fluid and feels more realistic. The main mission is indeed only 2 hours long but you have other missions, which will take a LOT of time to master, even the main mission in hard requires more concentration than in easy. The AI is smart, they will see you at least 100m afar and will report when they are going to check it, and when they finish, they'll report it again. Kiefer Sutherland absolutely smashes it as Big Boss, I loved David Hayter but it's nice to freshen up the series. Having in account this port is made by japanese people, this is an excellent port, a lot of graphics options and the controls are smooth even with mouse and keyboard. I only don't understand why they refer to Boss as Snake, due to the fact that in the end of MGS 3 he was promoted to Big Boss and in Peace Walker they refer to him as Boss during the game. All in all this is Kojima proving once again that everything that comes out of his mind and work, is gold. 8.9/10 - Short main mission and Snake paradox.",

            "review_text": "There are bombs hidden in lady parts. 10/10  *Edit, 22/12/2014*   In all seriousness, this game screams quality. It goes to show that although PC gaming is thought as a small business investment in Japan, Konami really have gone all out to make this game shine on the Personal Computer. This “port” does not even seem to feel like it was created by a non-caring company that was only interested in your money; “Buy now, we fix it later”, but a well thought out, and developed game that has PC gamers in mind. Port: 10/10.  This game runs extremely well on many/any computer, despite it being on a small map, this comes as no surprise, BUT the model detail, and the amount of AI in your vicinity at once is still handled well on older computers. The AI itself is quite smart on the hard difficulty, although on normal they do feel fairly dumb.  The price can feel demanding for people that have heard there is only 20 minutes of content…Right, many people have said this is not true, but as many others have also said, it can be “completed in 5 minutes”. Let me clarify, both sides are wrong. The Ground Zeroes mission, the main mission, CAN be speed ran in &lt;10 minutes, whereas the entire game (for completionists), can range from 5+ hours. There is quite a fair amount on content in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and a lot of people seem to forget that. The gameplay itself is very, very good. Although I, myself feel as if Kojima is keeping 99.9% of the gameplay mechanics (goodies) hidden well inside of The Phantom Pain’s unbeknownst release date. The way Big Boss moves, to the way combat is handled does not feel like a traditional Metal Gear Solid game. I am a long-time fan, and was at first sceptical about the way it looked from the trailers, it did not look “Metal Gear Solid” at all. Instead, it looked like DICE and Activision had teamed up and taken over development and decided; “we should make it appeal to all of the Battlefield and Call of Duty fans!” I could never have been more wrong. It DOES still feel like Metal Gear Solid, it just needs some getting used to. You have to remember the entire game itself is changing, the theme of the game has changed, the purpose of the game has changed. This is not Solid Snake. This is Big Boss. Playstation 2 players will remember how different Snake Eater felt compared to Metal Gear Solid, and Sons of Liberty. Big Boss is a different character, and has a different story. So what better to compliment his return to the game with new mechanics, a new engine, a new voice actor and a new tone of the series?  Overview:  Port: me, personally 10/10, but; 9/10 (Still heard some people are having loading problems)  AI: 8/10 (Normal difficulty is far too easy. Hard feels more enthralling)  Gameplay: 10/10 (Refreshing. Fast paced, slow paced. Stealthy or loud. Your choice)  Content: 8/10 (Not many missions, of course. But if you really want to 100% it, you may as well make a coffee and be ready for frustration) Voice Actors: 6/10 (I used to love the codec screens, and the voices that followed. No, I am not whining like most about Hayter being gone. Solid Snake is DONE. It was a mistake to make Big Boss’ voice actor Hayter in the first place. The guy is talented, as is Kiefer Sutherland, and I cannot fathom why the Japanese voice actor has been kept the same; but, Kiefer is the better choice. Why the 6, though? Because only select enemy soldiers have a voice actor. Most have the “Peace Walker subtitles” to serve as its way of giving you the information you got out of them. The only lines they have are notifying the command post of your presence, and shouting tactical orders, this is not fun, nor immersive…It just lacks any interest in what is going on. Plus, another negative is Skullface. His voice does not command leadership, nor does it sound “Villainous”, it just sounds plain. Environment: 5/10 (I could not come up with negatives nor positives for this, yes it is “open world” to a degree. If you count Camp Omega, and Camp Omega alone as open world. There is much to explore, and much to learn about where you can place yourself in certain situations, but the map still feels the same as the time before. I trust The Phantom Pain will rectify this, and deliver what I hope to be a 11/10 experience. Thank you for looking! Please do enjoy the game. If you are looking for a reason to buy it, you should not have to. It is worth every penny, and the series itself deserves every player, and it does not cost much? If you are still sceptical, just take a look at some YouTube videos.",

The 'Story' may be short and end in a huge cliff hanger but if you are a fan of the series this is seriously a no brainer.  The mission is simple, find Chico and Paz and get them to extraction. However we all know this is a MGS game so there is always a catch ;). The trial missions are fun and challenging (Do you have what it takes to S rank?). The AI is some of the series best, and while this is the first time Kojima brought snake 'Open World' it feels natural. This is how he intended it. This allows new and old fans to become accustomed to the new tride and true CQC styles, get familiar with the dynamic AI, and best of all teaches us how to take on missions one at a time in MGSV The Phantom Pain when it releases. I mean lets be honest here, if Kojima were to just throw us in a huge open world in TPP without training us first, ALOT of people would have felt misplaced and uncomfortable. We are used to fixed routes and blindspots and tricks and most of them wouldnt have worked in this new amazing system. So why are you still reading this? Just go buy it now while its on sale and make up your own mind.. How do you want to complete this mission? By slicing everyones neck? Slow and stealthy? Take your chances blowing ♥♥♥♥ up cus its fun?

None of that annoying smoothing you have to disable in game files. Speaking of which, more than enough video options in-game. The many controls available aren't awkward at all on KB and Mouse. I can't comment on controller functionality, though.  'Oh look, another console PORT!!!!'  Nope, nuh-uh, you could not be more wrong, my friend! Kojima proves himself to be way up there, again, by caring about this project. I buy a lot of games. I don't have the best PC: FX8350 (OC'd to 4) - R9 270X - 8GB RAM and an SSD. Most games that have come out recently either had ridiculous fluctuating FPS, endless micro-stutter, and needed to be run on PC Gamer Life Support (Beta GPU drivers, file editing, bs life support software). These are the 'AAA' games we're getting now. Basic, 100% PORTS. This?  It defaulted to high on my rig. 1080, VSYNC on, high high high, borderless windowed. I have barely seen it dip in FPS, from 60. It runs smooth 'LIKE BUTTAH'. 'Oh, but ports always come with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse smoothing thing...' NOPE! Again! Raw input, baby! I'm telling you: This 'port', runs better than any AAA game you've purchased recently, and probably looks a lot better too.  As far as controls go, I'm also extremely satisfied. You know, when it comes to games developed for a stick, you usually get awkward 'robot movements' because it's just 8 directions, with WASD. Character animations take care of making it look fluid.  For content: Look at all the posts about people spouting out the running gag 'paid demo hurrrr hurrrr' crap. You CAN get a lot of hours if you're into doing side-missions which are different enough to satisfy you, if you're looking for more. If this is a 'demo'? Then it's the best god damn demo you'll ever play!  EDIT: Oh, you'll have to control menus with WASD, ESC and Space. If you aren't a Master Race diva and can deal with this, then that's really the only con I can think of.",

I guess how much you get out of it depends on how much you like stealth games (I love'em), but the production values, the fine details, the price of entry--this game is worth it.

From the first few moments of the game, you are encouraged to scout the base, and understand your surroundings through the use of the binoculars and observation. Using that information the player can approach the game in many different ways, but mainly through stealth-- sneaking through the base, interrogating and eliminating silently the enemy or an all-out Commando re-enactment.   The stealth mechanics are an improved version from the ones in previous Metal Gear titles as elements such as light, dark, weather, position, and sound come into play for the detection system. Meanwhile, combat also involves the use of cover, calculating distance, and choosing the right weapons for every situation including CQC from previous Metal Gear titles.  Where the game might face some issues is the length of its main story. The game plays similarly to a single mission, and it really limits the game in terms of the time one may spend to complete the sole objective given-- it should take about two hours to complete the game's story mission alone.  However, there additional missions and there's quite a lot to explore in the open world mainly due to the level design of the base is what makes it interesting to explore. The base itself is structured realistically, and it's also well thought as to where enemy patrols, vehicles, prisoners and other elements are depending on the mission.  What comes more surprising however is the Fox Engine, and how well-optimized the game is for the PC, the game delivers its advanced graphics, physics and animations meanwhile not destroying its performance needlessly.  As a Metal Gear game goes it offers mostly everything; its scent of sci-fi, the great dialogue, some background ideologies and the cinematics that could compete with blockbuster films, but sans the Metal Gear. There's no big bad Metal Gear to fight in this game, but it plays as a plot device instead.  The game is an enjoyable experience, and albeit short, it should help to introduce the player to some ideas that have been implemented in the upcoming The Phantom Pain. However, many aspects were improved, and polished for The Phantom Pain from the ones in Ground Zeroes, so it shouldn't be used to serve as a demo or preview of how The Phantom Pain will be.

I have everything set to Extra High and it's running super smooth, keyboard and mouse seems to feel pretty good although I still went for an Xbox pad as I just prefer it for third person based games.  After playing my first playthrough, I'm really exciting for Phantom Pain now, if it runs as smoothly as this but features the huge open world and of course the conclusion to the story, I shall definatly be doing several more playthroughs to get all the unlocks and do the side missions. I think I spend 20 minutes just listening to the lore/audio logs and taking my time, with an overall completion of just under 2 hours.  This might actually be the first game i'll try and 100% complete. Only at 8% currently, so much to do!  I've been a fan of the Metal Gear games for many years and was hoping that with the several terrible PC ports/releases this year, that Metal Gear would not fall into the same boat and happily it does not, the FOX engine seems really well optimized for PC. Hell, it runs so well I might even be persuaded to pre-purchase Phantom Pain, something i've not done since the whole Colonial Marines debacle.  It's good to get back to a Metal Gear style game, I've missed the action sneaking for a while now, there's others like Splinter Cell but I don't know, Metal Gear always seems to have it's own charm that nothing can match.  In closing I'd recommend this to any Metal Gear fan, especially for it's current price. Of course it's not a full game but it's not a paid demo either, there's plenty to do and yes maybe if you rush it and spoil it for yourself you can complete it in 20 minutes but that really isn't the point of this whole thing. The real fans will enjoy it and see it for what it is. A good taste of what to expect next year!",

It really manages to squeeze as much as it can out of, what is essentially, a small area for gameplay. You can also unlock extra weapons and also a Hard mode for the main mission and sides.  The graphics are also extremely pretty, with some superb lighting effects and lots of lovely details on everything. I was actually a little concerned before playing this, that my laptop would struggle slightly, especially looking at the recommendations. But I am running it perfectly on 1080p at 60fps with everything on Very High, except for Screen Filtering and SSAO, which I have set to High. My laptop has a GTX 970m with 3gb of VRAM. Sometimes it drops to 59fps but 60 is usually sustained.  The story, although brief, is extremely intense and engrossing, Having never played any of the other MGS games, I cant really compare, but I absolutely loved this one and I will definitely be picking up The Phantom Pain, so I can continue with it.  For what it is, the price is a little steep. There are cheaper places to find it online. However you decide to get it, though, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I currently am.

The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC. If you're new to the MGS franchise or a hardcore veteran, you need this title in your library.  Ground Zeroes is more of a showcase of the new Fox engine and a teaser to get people pumped for The Phantom Pain than a complete standalone game. The map isn't huge, but there are so many different ways that you can infiltrate the base and accomplish your mission that it makes up for the short story. The stealth mechanics are fluid and very responsive, and in many ways this is the best Metal Gear Solid game ever created. When this game was first released, some people were upset with how short the actual mission is. However, it's priced accordingly and worth every penny you'll pay for it. I've played over a hundred hours on my PS3 and still didn't complete all the challenges.  The main mission is Ground Zeroes, but once you beat that it unlocks several other missions (some during daytime) that show just how much fun you can have on a single map. If you enjoy the stealth gameplay, you'll be delighted to run back through the missions multiple times, trying to infiltrate from different angles, and trying to complete each one without killing anybody or being seen at all. It's much more challenging than you might expect, but extremely rewarding. I've yet to find another game that gives you that same stealth feeling as Metal Gear Solid.",

No only does it prepare players for the new mechanics in the upcoming Phantom Pain, but it bridges an important gap. While at face value there is not much content. (One story mission and a few side ops 'side missions') It does exactly what they wanted it to do. The point of the other missions is to show how different weather, time of day, and where you enter the base from change how you can play the mission. (Since Phantom Pain will be open world this is an attempt to show players how they can choose these later) I have played probably over 20 hours on my PS4 version of the game (currently at 90% of 100% total completion but these are mostly hidden things and trails on the same few missions the game has, not 20 hours of full new content) TL;DR I like it but if you arent a fan dont buy it.

It may only take you an hour or two to finish the main objective, but the game doesn't totally end there. In addition to filling in some of the gaps between Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and the Phantom Pain, Ground Zeroes introduces a new stealth system and an open-world format that's perfect for experimentation.With Ground Zeroes’ minimal HUD, a narrow third-person camera angle, and a sprawling base filled with potential threats , sneaking behind enemy lines has rarely felt so tense and immersive. Metal Gear famously stars characters with exceptional sneaking skills, but they also come equipped with fantastical gadgets that make their jobs easier by revealing enemy locations and alert states.Though it's unusual for everything to take place in a single location, there's so much to do and see, and whether you take a stealthy or head-on approach, infiltrating Camp Omega is a thrilling experience that shouldn't be missed.",

I personally Enjoyed The story of GZ slightly more than TPP but I'll get into my quams of TPP in my review of that. Story Wise, GZ is just slightly better even if it's like, 10 minutes long. Gameplay wise, TPP is much more fun. There really isn't much more to say about GZ so, I give this game a 7.5/10",

Don't simply complete the Main Mission and call it a day. Go for the Side and Extra Ops. They give a lot of background to MSF's previous operations in the Area of Operations. Also, despite it's short length, it's got a lot of emotional deepness, hidden in the tapes (which you can find during your missions, though you already own some), with Hideo being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and playing with your feelings 'like a damn fiddle'. You first grow to detest Paz, but then you *might(was the case for me)* pity her fate, and even have sympathy for her. And then you got Skull Face. Okay, how can we put it? Take Volgin, keep the sadomasochist part, amplify it, remove his easy-to-annoy personality, add intelligence, cleverness, and make of him a cold-hearded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll end up getting a character that is 100 times nastier and worse than Volgin.  To put it short, buy this damn game. Loads of replayability (28 hours at the time I made this review, trying to get 100%). It's deep. It's very fun as well ( many Easter Eggs and missions extras that helps to get the sad and serious ambient a bit loose). Also helps explain why Snake goes apparently evil in The Phantom Pain. Finally, it's only 20 USD. Combine a random Steam discount and it's left at $15 or $10 (I got it at $13,30 on the day of it's release). Another fantastic game from Hideo Kojima.",

You don't need 4GB of vram, at least not for 1080p. The most demanding shot of the game, for me, was where you first gain control of Big Boss. Looking at the whole compound, I noticed a drop to 45. That's as low as it went for me. The game looks great. The main mission took an hour and 20 minutes for me. It would have been slightly longer but I messed up towards the end and had to forget about stealth tactics. I can't comment on KB/M controls, I used a gamepad. After finishing the main mission I've only got an 8% completion so I have a fair bit more to go. If you only want to do the main mission then this probably isn't worth the price tag for you. If you have been dying for some MGS it will definitely be worth it, especially at the current sale price of $13.39 USD.  Kojima kept us waiting. I think it was worth it.",

Once beaten, you unlock other missions using the same map. Think of them as 'remixes.' You get new objectives like 'destroy this, kill that, rescue him.' There are collectible and unlockables.  This is a very well made PC port. Kojima Productions must be hiring wizards because this is one of the best console ports I ever played. It's obvious they put a lot of consideration into this port. Keyboard/mice is good, but I still recommend 360 controller because it's less awkward due to certain key bindings. The performance requirements are overstated.

It has run pretty dang smooth with very minimal FPS drop on my GTX 760. It does cap itself at 60 FPS though and I highly recommend vsync to be turned on. I turned it off because I don't like vsync, but you will definitely want it on. The screen tears are bad and possibly even worse than Titanfall's screen tears. This is, however, only been done in the beginning of the game where it's raining and it's at night. I don't think the daytime lighting will have any impact at all, but I've only tried one section of the game.  Again, I'm really impressed. I was actually expecting a pretty bad port, but wow... The performance optimization of this game has really surprised me. It does have it's fair share of issues (Like the controller crash, where if you have your controller plugged in at startup it crashes the game), but overall it's pretty solid. It's cheaper than what it was on consoles, so I jumped onto it when I had the chance.",

            "review_text": "Always wanted to play Metal Gear. My wishes have been fulfilled with Ground Zeroes. I have squeezed every ounce of gameplay from this prologue to The Phantom Pain, and to say that I'm waiting for September first is a massive understatement.   Edit/Update:   I believe it's time to actually state my impressions of this game in a bit more detail.  Right off the bat, the thing that Ground Zeroes nails perfectly is the level design. The map is just perfect in size, with different segments requiring proper planning and study of enemy movements in order to infiltrate stealthily. Now, the stealth in this game has been executed to near-perfection, and while you can go guns blazing - its much more satisfying if you are actually patient with the game and go with the stealthy approach. There will be a lot of trial and error involved, and granted that some may not be up for it, but you will develop a compulsion to perfect your playthrough. Think of it as the satisfaction that comes with nailing three purple sectors in a Formula 1 game. The level design of Ground Zeroes has a big part to play in this - it encourages you towards such a goal.  Another aspect of the game worthy of praise is the enemy AI. While individually the enemy is what you'd expect from a modern stealth game - each have their own routine within the area which they patrol, they look out for suspicious activities and check them out, one thing that sets them apart is that if possible, they always communicate via radio to the base HQ when they are about to perform some action that is beyond their normal routine - like checking out anything suspicious. This means that you have to track them till they radio back to HQ that things are fine. This adds to the immersion as you have to decide when to make a move on them - if you take them out when HQ expects some communication back from them, then the base will go on a level 1 alert, when nearby personnel are notified about the incident. Following this, if you are discovered, then the whole base goes on alert. This attention to detail leads to some very tense moments leading you to frantically search for cover or take the guards out carefully, as you're vulnerable out in the open especially on hard difficulty. That said, on rare occasions, the AI can be hilariously incompetent - once I was lying prone, perfectly still in tall grass when 3-4 guards were just a feet or two away and couldn't spot me. That's an exception though, not a norm.  Coming to the story, while it is clear that Kojima tackled something very politically charged in this game, I don't think he quite hit the target he aimed for. Even though this is my first Metal Gear game and I was willing to put aside all the things that happened in the previous games for the sake of concentrating just on this one, I must say that it wasn't as satisfying. For more details, check out youtuber Super Bunnyhop's impressions on the story of Ground Zeroes.  Oh, and the last thing - the optimization in this game is phenomenal. Considering how pleasing the graphics are, it took me by surprise that I could run it on my ancient 9-year-old PC with a Core 2 Duo CPU and a GT 730 DDR5. I left the settings at default with v-sync off at 1366x768 resolution and got 20-30fps throughout every mission. Say what you want about my standards of playability but I was absolutely fine with it. No crashes whatsoever.  Now I just need the time to get my hands on The Phantom Pain.",

I was not happy about the pricing at the beginning (even with the drop) but now the game is at a good price and is a good opportunity to have a 4k legacy version (this PC version).  It's a achievement based game (if you like that). So if take this as a 6 mission VR training game and you want to complete it at 100% you'll enjoy it. I find myself playing it a lot the last year.  Also I wanna mention that the game has one main cannon mission 'Ground Zeroes' and it's very very short and not very rewarding in story terms but is there.  FOX Engine looks nice, and works good on PC too (after a one year delay it was mandatory to have a good 'port'. Sorry it is not but a port but is the first game on PC with this Engine working OK...PES 2014...:V ).  Finally for those who didn't play MGS in the past.

From a prespective you can say its good and for the right price i definitely recommend it if you want to understand the events before the Phantom Pain, as its the Phantom Pains prologue.  But on the other hand its 2-3 hours long with the main storyline (I have been able to do it in 30 minutes...) if you play it more carefully. There are alternate side ops which are okay and take longer to complete in total than the main mission, but they are all presented in the same map, but under different conditions.  Finally I would like to sum this up as: A good game, worth the money if its on a sale and you want to get to know the storyline behind the Phantom Pain, otherwise its not worth it for the lack of content on full price.",

After spending nigh on 15 hours with the PS3 version, there was no doubt left in my mind that Ground Zeroes was worthy of being a Metal Gear Solid game. Say what you will about the length of the main mission, but this game clearly makes a case for the term 'content' being much more nuanced than how most people refer to it.  Camp Omega is the real star of the show in Ground Zeroes - feeling like an amalgamation of the very best levels from Thief, Hitman, and the Splinter Cell series in their heyday - and it reinforces how the stealth genre is more about the levels than anything else. Everything about Camp Omega feels like it was crafted by experts: The believable vantage points, the sparing-yet-dense use of both high and low grounds, the use of light and shadow, it's all there.  The PC version (both surprisingly and unsurprisingly) is the definitive way to play this game. The FOX Engine truly shines when left to flex its muscles on superior hardware. Seeing rainwater drip down the face of one of the many nameless soldiers I would chokehold into submission later on in the opening cutscene was the first sign of the capabilities of this new engine.  I feel like the bar has been raised impossibly high by Ground Zeroes as a prologue to the upcoming The Phantom Pain. If the levels in the full game can capture even a fraction of the craft seen on display in this game, it will be more than something special.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  -Amazing visuals. This is what a 'next-gen' game is supposed to look like. Hats off to Kojima's artists, they really earned their paychecks here. From the modelling, animations, texturing, etc. It all comes together beautifully.  -Tight controls. Gone are the days from older games where you had to check a menu just to figure out all sorts of button press combinations just to do semi-secret moves regarding CQC and such. It's been streamlined in a manner that's much more quick to pull off, without feeling overly trivialized.  -Solid gameplay. At no point did it ever feel janky or 'cheap'. Everything behaves in ways you ought to expect it, from how your character interacts with the environment, to the handling of weapons and the behaviour of your enemy.  -A couple of new tricks up Snake's sleeve. Interrogations and such are now a neat little thing.  -Lots of side-content. I didn't realize until I beat the game that you end up unlocking tons of side missions after the fact that you can play after, which is a good thing, because of a point I'll be getting to in the cons.   Cons: -It's short. Like. SUPER short. Way shorter than you'd think, even for a 15 dollar AAA game. If you knew what you were doing and didn't mind shooting your way through objectives, you could beat the entire 'main' game in 15-20 minutes easily. It took me roughly an hour and a half on my first playthrough, and that's because I went the wrong way initially and had to double back through the entire map.  -Stealth is kind of a joke. There isn't much punishment for getting spotted, and if you've ever played a third person shooter before, you can go guns blazing through this no problem. It's steath elements are merely a suggestion for the sake of challenge, rather than necessity, and thus, this isn't a real stealth game. This is action-adventure.  -Easy difficulty in general. There just isn't much in the way of punishment in this game, and it gives you too many means of just rambo'ing your way through should you mess up. Reflex time is a dumb addition clearly meant to hold the hands of newer players, but when you make such concessions, how do you expect new players to ever learn and improve? This little 'feature' can be turned off in options, but unfortunately it's on by default and you must go looking for it. Oh, did I also mention 'regenerating health' is now a thing? You can already bet your boots that Phantom Pain's online component is going to have unlock progression at this rate. Too many 'modern gaming industry' gimmicks sour the gameplay experience by removing all tension from stealth and combat.  -Ending cutscenes deprive you of interaction at some really cool segments. I wont drop any spoilers, but there will be points at the end when you scratch your head and ask yourself 'Why don't I get to play this part? Why am I watching the game have it's own fun?'  -Story wise, the game assumes you've played the more obscure titles on the PSP, a handheld that, frankly, not many people even owned in the first place. If games like Peacewalker were made available on consoles and PC, it would serve rather well to dispel some of the confusion of the plot that is loosely explained in text snippets that you have to look up on your own in the main menu outside of the in-game experience.  Overall:  I had a great deal of fun with this, even with some of it's shortcomings, they paled in comparison to the overall potential of the game. With only 8% completion after beating the 'main course', I've got a decent amount of replayability to knock out before I can truly write this game off as 'done'. While I'm not completely sold on this model of game distribution just yet due to how long it's taking to get Phantom Pain out, I can honestly say this game is worth the $14 dollar price tag it's asking for while on sale at the moment. On it's surface, it's got a 'demo' feel to it, but once you dive into some of the offered extra content, you're getting more bang for your buck than the typical 15 dollar indie zombie survival minecraft rip-off trite that gets regurgitated out of Greenlight at around this price range. I know one thing though: This game is a quantum-powered hype train for Phantom Pain. Once you make your way through this, the wait for the next stage of the franchise will be nearly unbearable, and thus, I have to fully recommend this game.",

In 4k, I get a Solid 60FPS with every graphical option turned up all the way (playing with two 980 GTX in SLI). In 1080p on my laptop with a 765 GTX I too get nearly 60FPS with some options turned slightly down, but never to the low settings. It is simply amazing to see this game so well optimized. I wish more were like it!  The game itself is short, but with a lot of replay value, so the price of $20 is very well worth it. If you're lucky, you can get it for less (I got it for $13.39 Steam Holiday Sale, and I heard Green Man Gaming may have it cheaper).  Highly recommened!

This is the prologue campaign to The Phantom Pain and does a good job of setting the stakes for The Phantom Pain, if you're on the fence maybe wait until it's on sale, especially if you only plan on playing through it once before moving into The Phantom Pain.  Like TPP this isn't a great port, you're key bindings will show on Xbox controller but there are community guides that will show you the real button layout. How Konami thought shipping a product like this without very basic UI elements and options is beyond me but in my experience this tends to be the norm for PC ports sadly enough.

You can't import your custom music to the game like it does on the consoles; No app companion for mobile devices to connect to the game like it does on the consoles. You can't release once you grab a soldier with CQC.  Full review:  More than 10 years have passed since we had a Hideo Kojima game on the PC! Metal Gear Solid V: Ground zeroes can be short but it has top notch graphics, great gameplay, nice music, the story is good, but like the main mission it is short.   You play as the legendary soldier Big Boss, your main mission is to rescue Paz and Chico, both are being captive on Camp Omega a Guantanamo black site, you do that by using stealth or either action moves (not advised). Other than that main mission you have 6 more side ops to do:  -Eliminate the Renegade Threat: Neutralize two targets for an unknown contact, then escape the area. -Intel Operative Rescue: Aid in the escape of a high-value undercover operative from the base. -Classified Intel Acquisition: Make contact with an informant, then retrieve the data and escape. -Destroy the Anti-Air Emplacements: Destroy three AA guns to make way for a U.S. helicopter assualt. -Deja Vu: Users sees Big Boss recreating scenes from the original Metal Gear Solid (1998). -Jamais Vu: Drops players into the shoes of Raiden (MGS2, MGS4, Revengeance) as he investigates a very strange occurance on the U.S. base in Cuba.   I thought my 2011 laptop wouldn't run this game but I was wrong, It can. This is with any doubts a AAA game and a really great port. If the port of The Phantom Pain will be like this one, I won't buy a desktop and more people will enjoy this masterpiece at it's fullness. Thank you for this port Kojima Productions, you won't regret porting it or any Metal Gear game for that matter.  Score: 8/10 + Great PC port and game! - One short canon main story mission only in one small open world area, some minor buggs too.   Congrats to Kojima Produtions and Kojima himself once again.",

Be aware though The main game doesnt last very long, however if you are a diehard fan and go looking for all hidden tapes you can squeeze out some decent time as you can see from my time spent.   However its recommended to buy it when it is on any kind of discount I picked it up during the christmas sale and spet 14 bucks iirc.  So if you are a fan of the MGS series, easy recommandation, if not, I dont know rather wait for the release of Phantom Pain I guess.",

If you're a fan of MGS and are willing to spend a hefty fee for a little insight into the beginnings of The Phantom Pain then you'll enjo this. If you're an outsider looking in, just wait until MGSV comes out.",

            "review_text": "Ground Zeroes is the latest entry in the Metal Gear Solid saga. It's story takes place after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid Portable ops and Metal Gear solid Peace walker. This game is the first in the series to make use of the Fox engine, a completely new game engine aimed at creating a new generation of games. Gameplay wise this definitely shows, movement feels more controlled and enemies seem to move around more realistically. This does seem to make the game a lot harder then previous Metal Gear games (especially with reflex mode turned off) which is something people interested in this game should take into account.  Now to cover the inevitable elephant in the room when talking about this game: It's pretty short. The game has around 6 missions all taking place in the same area. However only one of those missions really matters to the story and depending on your skill can be finished in about half an hour, with the rest being more like bonus missions with true Kojimaesque eastereggs. Some argue that this makes the game a paid demo. Now I wouldn't go as far as to claim that myself, but story wise the game definitely leaves it's players hungry for more.  Speaking of which, another major controversy surrounding this game would be it's macabre ending. Now I won't spoil it for anyone reading this review since they likely haven't played the game yet, but needless to say this game isn't for the faint of heart. Which isn't necessarily bad however. As it elavates the games plot to a more mature level not seen before in videogames.  So would I recommend Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes? Yes, but if players feel they might be getting too little bang for their buck I would recommend them to get this game on sale.",

The main story is about 2 hours long, depending on how you approach the mission, but there are also a few other 'side' missions that are separate from the main mission, like destroying certain structures or assassinating certain characters.  One of the down sides for fans of the series is that David Hayter, the original voice of Snake since the first Metal Gear Solid game, did not return for this, but Keifer Sutherland, does a great job as a replacement for the voice of Snake.

Regardless, its extremely nice to see such a high level of expertise on the optimization and developement aspects, but I couldn't be happier to see its Big Boss to bring some standards in developement back.   People say its not worth the money, but this is priceless to me, if only all developers strived to give us 60 fps. Also I now know for certain I can enjoy Phantom Pain at its max potential, which is gonna be amazing and I can't hype it enough to you. (just watch the vids).   I don't rate many products, but this little gem is more deserving of your money than most of the major titles that have dropped this year. It is more of a tech demo if I had to call it anything, but with 60 fps becoming such taboo and such a lofty unreachable goal with most devs and so many drop date games running at 20 fps maybe thats what the hell we need this day and age.     If you really get into the meat of it (and go passive/stealth) theres alot of gameplay and good practice for those unfamiliar with the series. Keep in mind there is nothing to make you sneak initially, but this is a world class stealth game you're playing here. Do remember that before you blaze through one time and complain how short it is, because the side ops you get afterwards are exceptional as well.    Maybe we'll get remastered MGS collection if enough people get this and Phantom Pain. MGS has evolved from an 8 bit origin to now offering some of the best graphics and performance with no need for patches and updates after the fact. If you're on the fence about this one and hardcore stealth fan the only thing I can tell you is that you'll be dying for Phantom Pain after you're done.  ",

Even if your not as mad about Metal Gear as me and you like stealth games that allow you to go Arni if you wish, there is a lot of fun to be had here with the slickest gameplay yet seen in a stealth game and a cool 80's action movie vibe.  It will take about 8 hours to complete if you take your time (trying to be stealthy) first time I played the main mission it took about 4 hours as I liked exporing the base. There is plenty of scope for emergent gameplay depending on how you react to getting into trouble.   The side missions are all pretty good with each offering something different and even the change from day to night makes a difference to the gameplay by taking away your shadowed hiding spots but it also serves to make the base feel fresh after many hours in the dark.  If you're the kind of player who wants to rush from point A to point B then I would wait for big price drop, if your the kind of player that likes to savour the game and explore every nook and cranny and find all the hidden (disturbing) story tapes and hidden weapons then this is for you. Oh yeah the graphics are simply beatiful, with some nice resolution options as long as your rig has the muscle. The shadows, light and textures are also petty good, the animations are fluid and the control is extemely responsive on both keyboard/mouse and controller.  To those new to Metal Gear, welcome aboard.

Since this is a deferred engine that means there is no or lack of anti-aliasing options. But despite of that the game is of 10/10 quality.",

Pros: - Excellent Optimization (Max settings @ 1080P, AVG 60FPS w/GTX 970 - Min Load: 40%, Max Load: 80%) - OPTIMIZATION!!!!! Yes, I stress this again, as too often I come across a game that I enjoy that has horrible optimization for PCs. - Beautiful control scheme (via gamepad) - Great small intro/story into P:Pain  Cons: - Much to short (main mission-wise) - Perhaps doesn't have as much 'eye candy' as some other games (Still an excellent and very detailed engine)  Verdict? - Leaning on YES, given the current going price of $13.39. At the original price of $19.99 I would have rather waited (considering what I just played) instead of paying 1/3 of the price of what Phantom Pain would most likely be ($59.99).",

The game, or 'demo' is very short, unless you spend the extra time trying to get all the achievements. Worth buying, especially if you are a MGS fan/veteran!",

            "review_text": "It's interesting how the Metal Gear Solid games went from a series with tank-like, often unintuitive controls, to one of the smoothest and best controlling 3rd person games I've ever played. However, it is hampered by some strange default key cofigurations.  After playing all of the previous games on consoles, playing with the keyboard is a little strange at first, but I eventually got used to it after just a little bit. Although, I did go through and adjust some of the default controls because they didn't make any sense to me. For instance, when you're using your binoculars (by holding F) and you want to zoom in you have to press 'V'. How they expect someone to do this, I'm not exactly sure since the 'v' key is right below the ' f ' key that you're holding. Also, it's a good idea to change your slow-walk button to shift, and set sprint to ctrl since you're gonna be spending a lot more time walking slowly than sprinting.  In total, I changed my controls to:  slow-walk: shift sprint: ctrl switch shoulder: f First-person aiming: v binoculars: t binocular-zoom: right-click  besides that, everything was comfy.  My first time through the main mission was awesome. I got caught a couple of times and had to fight my way out which was a little embarrassing. I'm actually pretty excited to play through it again and see how quickly I can get past everyone without being spotted.  If I had to give it a numerical score it would be a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "THE SHORT REVIEW: As a fan of Metal Gear, this is a must-buy, but if your a first time Metal Gear person...it could be hit or miss.  THE LONG REVIEW: Ground Zeroes serves as the prologue to MGSV: The Phantom Pain, think of it as the appetizer before the main course. But boy oh boy it is actually one hell of a introduction that gets me excited for the full game. The first cutscene where it plays the song 'Here's to You' is done superbly, and THAT ENDING, wow, quite the cliffhanger.  To be completely honest I really wasn't expecting a whole lot for how long the game was, and I have to admit I was right in some regard. But where the game lacks in content, it will most likely make up in replay value. The open-ness of the level seems to draw me back and try different approaches, and seek out stuff I might've missed the first time.   The game itself is essentially an overglorified tech-demo, but an impressive one at that. As I said before, the game retains a high replay value because it's open, and the design feels very 'alive' to say the least. Should you come into contact with a guard, they will alert the whole base, and everyone will be on high alert. They'll be running around looking for you, and ready to shoot on sight until they've decided to give up the search. Unlike say Far Cry, the game feels less-scripted and more 'open' to the AI or player adapting to the environment.  If your new to Metal Gear, here might be an okay starting point, and I say this because it's one of the newer games, with the new mechanics and what not. You'll get into it, but going back and playing the previous games might be harder to do. So I'd suggest either getting caught up with the story, or going back and playing the older games because a lot of what's in here is mostly just tease for the next game for us fans.  Now preformance wise, it's worth noting that the PC version was extremely well optimized for me and my Nvidia, it ran at a high frame rate and was still able to look great, and I have to applaud for them actually making a really good PC version. Did I also mention that the game only takes up only about 4GB and still manages to look better than Titanfall and Call of Duty (which require 50+ GB of space)? This is how PC games are done.   Admittedly the price is still a tad steep even at $19.99 I'd say wait for it to drop in price before picking it up, because you don't really get $19 worth of content, in a sense the value is more in the replay than the actual play (but that could be argued). I'm not saying you have to avoid this entirely if you're getting into the franchise, but if you've had absolutely no experience with Metal Gear then chances are the game might not have the same flair for you.  MADE FOR: Fans wanting a taste of what's to come in The Phantom Pain  NOT MADE FOR: People expecting a full-fledged Metal Gear game  METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES  8/10",

Metal Gear Solid has always been a favorite of mine, and while I question the validity of this portion being marketed as an expensive demo, I was actually pleasently surprised to find a large amount of replayability.   The main mission act as a prologue to the upcoming MGSV: Phantom Pain, and in doing so introduces me to the portable versions that I missed. While I miss their cannon, the premise is easy enough to grasp. Rescue two hostages, and get out. Classic Metal Gear, it's never so simple as it seems.   Finishing this scenario isn't the end, but unlocks alternate ways of tackling the island you prowl around. Lighting, weather, objectives, and utilities all change how you approach the game, as well as your attitude. It makes for an excellent playground, while also giving a good challenge and mind game for the stealthy.   Performance for this game is excellent - I run a good rig with gtx970, but optimization is always the final factor, and it's here. Let's hope this is a good sign for the coming days! However, I will complain that KB/M support needs some work, with just a few more options to tweak. 8/28/15  All in all, high hopes for MGS TPP!   ",

You can tell that it was initially a prologue level meant to be included WITH The Phantom Pain, but due to the need for (probably) more money for TPP's development, Konami forced it to be released as a separate title.   That being said, Ground Zeroes is not a BAD demo. The graphics are nothing short of fantastic, the gameplay is fluid, the enemy A.I. is intelligent and challenging, and the game runs superbly on almost all PC's. If you enjoy the stealth genre, this game will not disappoint you from a gameplay standpoint. Just be warned that if you're not a completionist, the main mission and accompanying 'Side-Ops' can be completed in less than three hours. You can only truly get your money's worth out of this game if you take the time to complete the missions on higher difficulties, achieve the coveted 'S-Rank' on each Op, collect all the cassette tapes, rescue all prisoners, and get all the achievements/XOF Patches. If those extra objectives interest you, then Ground Zeroes can take up many more hours of your time.

I got this on the 360 a while back and clocked up 30 + hours, it has a load of replay value for the creative. Even if your not as mad about Metal Gear as me and you like stealth games that allow you to go Arni if you wish, there is a lot of fun to be had here with the slickest gameplay yet seen in a stealth game and a cool 80's action movie vibe.  It will take about 8 hours to complete if you take your time (trying to be stealthy) first time I played the main mission it took about 4 hours as I liked exporing the base. There is plenty of scope for emergent gameplay depending on how you react to getting into trouble.   The side missions are all pretty good with each offering something different and even the change from day to night makes a difference to the gameplay by taking away your shadowed hiding spots but it also serves to make the base feel fresh after many hours in the dark.  If you're the kind of player who wants to rush from point A to point B then I would wait for big price drop, if your the kind of player that likes to savour the game and explore every nook and cranny and find all the hidden (disturbing) story tapes and hidden weapons then this is for you. Oh yeah the graphics are simply beatiful, with some nice resolution options as long as your rig has the muscle. The shadows, light and textures are also petty good, the animations are fluid and the control is extemely responsive on both keyboard/mouse and controller.  To those new to Metal Gear, welcome aboard. Ater a long time Metal Gear has come home to take it's place with the PC master race now if you'll excuse me I'm off to crawl around in the dirt and shadows choking 8itches out.",

I would also like to point out that the engine was developed entirely for the purpose of the upcoming game. It is simply incredible. Gameplay is smooth and visuals are stunning. You should be able to run this game maxed even on a potato.  If you are thinking that a game of mere 2 hours is totally not worth your time and money, well you are kinda wrong. Only the prologue mission is of at least 2 hours, of course depending on your approach. After prologue is beaten, extra side missions will be unlocked.

My first time beating the main mission took about one and a quarter hours, I can now do it in substancially less than that. However the gameplay is superb, there are a half-dozen side missions which are really quite varied, and the small base is dense. There are tons of conversations to overhear, equipment to pick up and a massive amount of tactical decison making to be done. Its not like many stealth games, including previous metal gears, where you have a couple paths and you choose one, there are a large number of options, and you really feel like you are following your own path. The AI is spectacular, if you are spotted a seach party is sent out and they fan the area. If a body is found they send reinforcements and if you destory a camera someone investigates. They also don't just pace in circles like robots, which goes a long way to raising the tension in the game.  Graphically it is easily the best looking game I have seen to date. I don't play a huge assortment of AAA games so maybe there is something else out there, but this game is pretty. Plus, unlike so many recent console ports, it comes with real graphics options. The Keyboard/Mouse controls feel a little rough sometimes, (the game was definitely designed with analogue movement in mind) but are completely re-bindable.   My only complaint is that it does feel a little short for $20 (Honestly just a little), but the length that is there is fantastic and unique and if you are a completionist there is a lot of time to be sunk into the game.

If you want my advice just go preorder Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain for 60$ and you get Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes for free. That is the only way I feel like this game is worth the money.

            "review_text": " Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes treads a thin line between tech demo and open-world sandbox   There’s been just one game that I finished in a single sitting, and that’s Metal Gear Solid IV: Guns of the Patriots on PS3. This fact is more a testament to the design of MGS IV than my unwavering commitment to the franchise. Let’s be clear: I’m not a Metal Gear Solid or Hideo Kojima fan boy. The reason it kept me hooked was the ebb and flow of the missions as well as even distribution of gameplay sections and long cut scenes (some long enough for you to consume entire meals while watching them like a TV show). But primarily it was the accessibility. MGS IV was a walk in the park compared to Ground Zeroes.   A QUESTION OF BREVITY   You’re probably aware of the biggest complaint people seem to have with Ground Zeroes. The game can be ‘beaten’ in around 20 minutes. If you’re looking to simply finish Ground Zeroes, it can be done with minimal to no effort at all, but bear in mind that you shouldn’t be playing it in the first place if that was your intention.  Ground Zeroes is a showcase. It is Kojima Productions experiment to craft an open-world with a difference—not one merely filled with side quests and characters to interact with, but one of an enormous scale in which you are free to explore everything without having to suspend disbelief. And by God, have they succeeded. It’s just a shame they’re asking you to pay $19.99/`1,200 for the recently released PC version. And while this is the definitive version of the game thanks to native 4K support and inclusion of bonus content from both Xbox and PlayStation versions, one can’t help but wonder if Kojima-san wanted to give away this game for free, and was promptly overruled by the evil corporate overlords at Konami who sniffed a revenue opportunity.   FOR THE COMPLETIONIST   After a trademark intro cut scene, you find yourself in the shoes of Big Boss with the task of extracting certain prisoners of war from an island prison. Do this successfully and you’ll open up extra missions and situations, as well as bonus objectives. For the completionist, Ground Zeroes is a wet dream, with different ways not just to beat missions but traverse the excellently designed sandbox of Camp Omega and discover something new every time you do it.  There’s a tonne of stuff here for fans (who have probably bought this anyway), but for those on the fence, there are several reasons to pick up Ground Zeroes. First, it’s the most complete stealth action game available today. None of the mechanics are watered down, it is intuitive but not accessible, and it’s mostly unforgiving to careless play. Guards may follow certain patrol routes, but they will surprise you with their intelligence and unpredictability on occasion. Get caught, and you’ll have once chance to headshot your potential captor—miss your chance and you’ll be in a spot of bother to say the least. MGS has been guilty of limiting gameplay scope, preferring to go down the cool-but-linear party tricks route, ‘meta’ gameplay and easter eggs. Ground Zeroes is the exact opposite, with a strong gameplay basis and true open-world mechanics.  However, you’re likely to get the most out of this only if you’re a hard-core MGS fan or find Splinter Cell too easy. For the rest, there are games out there with ten times the content Ground Zeroes offers, and with more variety (Far Cry 4, for instance). Without a doubt, I enjoyed Ground Zeroes, as I’m sure anybody who plays it will. But the game also makes you wonder at the type of company that charges ₹1306 for a demo.   My Rating: 7/10 ",

It manages to look good while not actually using alot of resources Controls well considering past MGS titles that weren't using the playstation and it's pressure sensitive buttons were notorious when ported (MGS 3 on Xbox for example) Map itself is fairly large allowing the player many different approaches and options, while the main mission is short numerous unlockable bonus missions allow for multiple revists with differnt objectives  Cons short as hell. The extra missions help to extend the game's life span but it's still really short. This is literally a bone to chew until the next one comes out. Sutherland does a good job but anyone who's a fan will miss david hayter here. AI is dumb, no polite word for it, it's absurdly easy to sneak up and get the drop on enemies now and they give up on patrols way too quickly, not to mention they dont search very large areas at all. Vehicles while initially scary quickly become hiliariously easy to get around as again, they are dumb. No first person mode, you can't even aim down the sights for precise long range shots hopefully this wont be the case in the main game  All in all it's still metal gear solid it's just unfortunately changing with the times...get it if you're a fan or if it's on sale.",

As someone who has played every single canon release, it's been interesting, entertaining, and sometimes frustrating dealing with the franchise's ups and downs. As a blueprint and teaser for what is to come, Ground Zeroes excels in terms of gameplay, story, atmosphere, and voice acting. Controls have been fine-tuned, the UI has been tweaked to create an immersive experience, AI has improved, and both the graphics and engine have set a new standard for AAA titles. I was also pleasantly surprised by Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Snake; he fits the role well and I definitely prefer him over David Hayter. The core experience is, pun intended, extremely solid. The only let down is the main mission's short length, and even though there are side ops set in the same environment, these will only satisfy completionists and score-chasers. It's best to wait for this title to go on sale before purchasing. That said, from the moment Snake pulls off his goggles and the camera turns to reveal the size and scale of the compound, an area larger than anything MGS has depicted before, Ground Zeroes flirts with greatness.",

MGS is sometimes Cheesy, sometimes over the top, but still, you feel the characters, you suffer with them, you experience an incredible Adventure with them. MGS is always full of Love from the developers/Hideo Kojima, full of Cutscenes, full of unique moments. For me, Ground Zeroes is no different for that matter. Sure, there is only one map, and you may have heard it's only one, single Mission, but don't get fooled by that.  There are actually 7 missions, that all really feel different to play, and so much stuff to explore, find, and most important of all, to perfect.   20 bucks might be a little bit too much, but if it gets on sale, and you're an 'average MGS player' like me, you should definitely grab it.

I particularly loved the cutscene at the beginning (The scene where the rain falls off Skull Face's hat). That is definitely a breath taking animation.  The gameplay is good, characters good. Weapons are limited and feature 1 rifle, 1 shotgun, 1 sniper rifle, 2 pistols &amp; a rocket launcher. They say that there are more weapons that are unlocked and available at the starting point, but I was unable to find it.. Unlike MGS: TPP, you can't upgrade weapons which felt like a let down to me. No Fulton Extractions or Supply Drops, but I guess that was to focus on the story &amp; give it a challenge to the players.  All in all, MGS: GZ is a good game primarily since it builds up the excitement. You do have the option of running the mission the way you see fit - Do you want to kill the guard in front of you or just knock him out. Do you want to sedate him or go for a CQC hold.  I have no regrets of purchasing the game, and I would recomend it. But purchase it when it on sale. You'll end up cursing yourself later if you purchase it when it is not on sale.",

If you're just playing this for the main mission then honestly, just look up a youtube video or something. The story of this mission isn't exactly all that important. At least get it on sale if you're determined to play through to see what happens.   The game has a decent amount to offer if you are interested in side missions, collectibles, trials, and those sorts of things. I don't normally go for all the achievements in games, but I decided to on this one which took me a bit under 30 hours to accomplish. Having spent only $5 on the game, it feels worth it to me.   Gameplay itself feels smooth. The two difficulties feel appropriately challenging. Gunplay is refined and satisfying. There are a lot of different approaches to missions. If you want to go loud and have a huge firefight as you do the missions then you can, or you can stealthily kill people, or simply sneak around and not kill anyone at all. It's pretty fun to experiment diffierent ways of tackling objectives. The grade you get on a level will unlock more weapons to start out with for the next time you play through that mission. Having access to different guns can change how you deal with enemies and targets.  Honestly, I'm surprised I put as much time into this as I did. If you're considering buying Phantom Pain, give this game a try when it's on sale. You'll get as much out of this game as you're willing to put into it, then you'll get played like a damn fiddle.",

Campy and Bizarre moments are plentyful if you take the time to play the extra missions, which are really well thought out and, despite all being set on the same fairly small military base, are surprisingly different from one another.  For newcomers to the series, this is the tragic backstory that leads to Big Boss' transformation into 'Venom Snake'. This game caused controversy due to its audio depictions of (what is assumed to be) ♥♥♥♥, which was made integral to Ground Zeroes' story. Kojima's newly found commitment to ultra-realism just falls short of being truly convincing, the writing is good but still very Japanese which I think makes that particularly disturbing moment rather contrived and a little hamfisted.   This is nevertheless a game that succeeds in being poignant and insightful, and the gameplay successfully tows the line of innovation whilst retaining the feel of previous games. It does the latter better than Phantom Pain, but the filmic and striking Phantom Pain, of course, will always be the real MGS meat we were all wanting.  An essential purchase and a great and slightly different companion to Phantom Pain.",

LONG REVIEW:  STORY: You play as Big Boss, going to an an American black site on Cuban soil called Camp Omega to extract two prisoners to get infomation on Cipher. The cutscenes are amazing and even beautiful at that, it'll suck you right in at the start and a great opening to TPP.   STORY: 7/10  GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is just like any other Metal Gear, sneaking around, snubbing out guards, you get the idea. But compared to MGS4 it improves the gameplay in every way, in that aspect it's amazing.   GAMEPLAY: 10/10  LEVEL DESIGN: The level design is great, I'll have you exploring every inch of the map to find different item or cassette tapes. But sadly after finding everything there is no reason to go back from more or even play it again.   LEVEL DESIGN: 6/10   FINAL THOUGHTS: Even though I prasied it so far, why don't I recommend it? Besauce sadly It's just a tech demo. I paid $4.99 and I still felt ripped off, it has good gameplay, level disign, and even a great story for a prologue.

            "review_text": "This is the prequel to Hideo Kojima's MGSV: Spooky Ghost Pain.  You play as Cartoon Network's popular character, Hoss DelGato, on a mission to save Billy and Mandy from the Grim Reaper on his Guantanamo-bay like blacksite that was never on the show. Grim sure did get pretty metal under the influence of Kojima's story-writing.  Anyway so you are supposed to save these kids, but you don't. You actually abuse the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, which is pretty cool. Watch in terror (or enjoyment if thats your thing, sicko), as Hoss proceeds to put these children in a sleeper hold, cut them open, and then kick them out of a helicopter so hard they explode and destroy helicopters.  Unfortunately Hoss saves these awesome abilities to abuse children, as his abilities in the game are pretty awful. This game just rips off Hitman Absolution, the pinnacle of stealth action gaming, as it attempts to be stealth action game itself. You can kill people, pick up bodies, and hide them, just like in Hitman Absolution. You'd think Hideo would come up with an original idea once in his life, first he stole a beloved cartoon network character, then he copied the gameplay of a popular series.  This game also idolizes the two anarchists, Nicola Sacco, and Bart Vanzetti. The only song in the game is dedicated to these two, which shows how much Kojima idolizes the anarchistic lifestyle, as seen by the fact you can arbitrarily kill anyone in the game. For shame Kojima. For. Shame.  Anyway, theres a number of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t side missions where you continue to play as Hoss, and you kill two people on vacation, vandalize US Military defenses, and saving his self insert after proceeding to blow up literally everything on the base. Sensing a theme? This game really shows Kojima's true anarchistic views.  There is one more thing I want to cover in this in-depth review of this game. This game has guns with silencers that break. And if I've learned anything from the popular FPS, Call of Duty: Modern Blackops World at Advanced Warfare, silencers never break. And we all know that game has 100% accuracy in portraying guns.  Artificial difficulty at its finest.  1/10. There was this part where soldiers got in a helicopter and a soldier spinned his hand around like a helicopter, and I use that in all my gang signs now. Thanks Kojima, that prevented me from giving this game a 0.",

            "review_text": "We'll start off with what's obvious from the get-go: This is a drop dead gorgeous game. It's beautiful. There are some really neat lighting effects and water looks great. Solid textures and some nice depth of field effects as well. It also runs terrifically on my setup. It's probably the single best PC port I've played since Splinter Cell Blacklist. It's a refreshing change in an industry that's given us duds like Assassin's Creed Unity that are hardly playable at high settings even on a strong setup like mine.  That being said, I have a number of complaints about the game. I finished in 4 hours. It's absurdly short, more a demo than anything.  In a lot of ways this franchise hasn't changed much since the second game, which is admittedly fine in some areas. I consider myself a longtime fan of the franchise -- Metal Gear Solid is probably one of my single favorite games of all-time. Fans of the series love the exclamation points, the cardboard boxes, and the weird, preachy stories. I'm no different. I love all that stuff, I eat it up. And it's important that the series doesn't lose its identity for the sake of progress. But there are some features of the series in this game that just plain haven't aged well, and that's where most of my complaints come from.  My biggest issue with the game comes from the foolish way checkpointing is laid out. Imagine you carefully and meticulously move halfway across an open yard of tents, taking care not to be spotted, only to slip up near the end due to hitting the wrong button. Now your last checkpoint forces to restart a football field (about 100 meters for our European friends) away and retrace your own steps. You also get to hear the same introductory codec message every single time, too. Not good.  Checkpointing is a holdover from older games that really does a lot to damage the experience here. There's no reason a semi-open world stealth title shouldn't have a save anywhere feature. Hell, the option to save via a codec message isn't even present in this game, so why even have checkpoints at all? It doesn't make sense to use them over a manual save function. This isn't even a question of save scumming, it's just a matter of modern convenience that Konami seems to have forgotten. I have the same issue with the Far Cry series. It's 2014. There's no excuse for these games to use checkpointing when they'd be far better served by utilizing a dynamic save system. Bad checkpoints are some of the most frustrating things in gaming, and it puzzles me that developers still use them when there are obviously better systems available. Seriously, checkpoints are down there with escort missions. Game developers: Kill them immediately. Please. I despise them in games, especially in stealth games.  I had some serious issues with the camera as well. There are times when you've got a roof or some kind of structure far over your head, and the camera needlessly zooms straight into the back of Big Boss's head. Why? It's nowhere near the ceiling. It doesn't work well with cover, either. It was frequently a pain to me when I would be creeping between small spaces, such a between cargo boxes or tents. I'd stop at a corner, move up into cover, and try to get a peek around the corner to see if a soldier was there. And more often than not, the camera would refuse to comply, just sitting closely behind Boss's head. They obviously knew that this was an issue because they included a shoulder switching camera mechanic, which rarely seems to do much. I was detected a few times simply because I was frustrated with the camera and decided I was sick of fooling with it, so I moved out. It's ridiculous to me that the camera is an issue in a game these days. I can't remember the last time I even had camera issues in a game at all. A poorly controlled camera is an issue that belongs 20 years ago in the N64 era. Not in a modern, next generation game. It's inexcusable.  Another holdover from the old games that seriously bothered me was the control scheme. There are menus within menus within menus when you've got a guard grabbed or when you want to customize weapons. You're holding a bumper, or flicking a stick, or pressing some random arbitrary button that just doesn't feel natural. The worst part about these menus is that there frequently is just no need for them. Games like Blacklist have featured the same types of things but made them vastly more simplified and intuitive. I find myself having to check the controls screen multiple times per session because I can't remember how to do something. That's a sign of having an unintuitive, overly complex, poorly designed control scheme. Movement, furthermore, is hampered by having a weird crawl/crouch/stand system, including a weird button to dive to the ground, which I didn't really understand or ever feel any need to use. Then there are a bunch more controls for when you're crawling. You can roll to the left. You can roll to the right. Hold a button to crawl more quickly. It's all just needlessly complex, and it feels tacked on when it's not really necessary.  There's no free climbing in this game like there is in other stealth games of the past few years -- And I'm not saying that it needs it. But movement in open-world or semi-open world stealth games like Blacklist, Dishonored, or Assassin's Creed, for example, has way more dimensions than it does in Ground Zeroes due to the distinct verticality in the form of climbing (or blinking, in Dishonored's case) up to platforms or roofs. It's nearly always present no matter where you are, and you know so intrinsically how to accomplish it that you don't have to think about it. Dishonored teaches you to blink once, and you've got it down. Assassin's Creed teaches you to free run once, and you remember. In Ground Zeroes, you can only really move up or down when there's a ladder present. Otherwise, you're moving simply on the ground, back and forth, to and fro. It doesn't have the verticality of those games. So why are the controls so damned complex and involved? It's how it's always been in the series, but with the advent of newer games with great traversal systems, Ground Zeroes' controls feature so many aspects that just seem totally unnecessary, and it only serves to muck everything up. I can't help but feel a simpler approach would have been far more successful here. Having an intuitive understanding of movement and being able to act without thinking is absolutely paramount in stealth games where being seen can lead to a very quick death, and I never feel like I have that down when I play this game. It's something that would come with practice, sure, but why should I have to practice at something that I can intrinsically pick up and do in pretty much every other game in the genre?  Look, I don't want Metal Gear to become Splinter Cell. I'm not saying that at all. But the step forward that Guns of the Patriots made in 2008 was excellent, and it breathed new life into the gameplay of the series and really saved it from becoming too dated. Gunplay was far better in that game. It was always wonky and unintuitive in the older games, with its weird go-to-first-person-and-then-aim thing. It never felt natural. You always felt like a bumbling idiot when you were trying to shoot somebody, and Solid Snake was supposed to be an expert with a firearm. Guns of the Patriots completely fixed that. They updated their gunplay to a more modern, third person shooter type system, and it worked fantastically. That is the type of step Konami needs to take with things like movement and checkpointing. Ground Zeroes, unfortunately, doesn't take that step. It just feels like a way prettier Guns of the Patriots. Which is certainly not a bad thing, and don't get me wrong: This is not a terrible game.  If you're a Metal Gear fan, buy it. You'll like it. But if you're just looking for a stealth experience, I'd heartily recommend Splinter Cell Blacklist over this game.",

They took away alot of the sneaking abilties, so if you get spotted you might as well restart cause no crawling under things or hide in things... This game feels like a alpha demo",

            "review_text": "This game is one unfinished pile of junk, you can't even imagine. It's short, we all know that, but that's not the problem: if you have the audacity to release a 45 minute demo for over 20 bucks you better make god-f*cking-d*mn sure that the game is the most polished piece of software out there. But as you'd expect from a publisher like Konami these days it's not: this game is a bug ridden mess.  The savepoints are infuriating: they are invisibly scattered around the map, once you run into them you are basically stuck with this one and only point of saved progress: say for example you get spottet and sh*t's on fire and you just so happen to enter an autosafe-area; well you're dun goofed. There's no going back, if you are lucky you only wasted 10 minutes, on a bad day you are 30 minutes in and you have to restart the entire level.  The biggest joke tho is the way your gameplay IS ACTUALLY saved; you drive into an autosave with a truck? Well guess what; when you load the point you are suddenly standing in the open, close to an EMPTY truck. Even if you position yourself smart loading a savegame will 9/10 times spawn you in a completely different location (in roughly the same area) and 4 out of these 10 times that will be right in enemy line of sight; genius, GENIUS solution!  Next thing; again savepoint related. If you walk into an autosave-area 7/10 times Snake will just keep moving in the direction you were facing while entering that area. It's like a constant force pushing your character in an unwanted direction; always a nice touch in a hard-as-all-hell stealth game. In my 3 hours of play I had 6+ occasions where this happened; you have to exit to the menu-screen to get the unwanted movement unstuck.  Another issue are the controlls or rather the 'next-gen' contextual actions; often Snake will just lean on a wall or stick to cover when you try to move OUT of of cover or break away from it. Since timing is essential in this game, little things like that can ruin your run and are just plain out obnoxious.  The overall character movement animations are very well done but especially when laying down the disconnect between camera and player-model is not handled very well: Snake will swivel his upper body if you ready your weapon, basically staying in position while being able to look around 180°; but as soo as you go ADS the body aligns with the line of sight and your whole character model just turns instantly, sometimes snapping out of cover without you even noticing it. AGAIN; super stupid thing in a hardcore stealth game.  I would strongly reccomend to wait until the full game comes out and see if these issues are fixed, if not I can only really reccomend it to hardcore fans of the series.",

AI is actually smart and realistic, graphics are goergious, and the little story here is quite gripping. Gunplay is satisfying, and the stealth is intense.   If that game was 5$, i'd give it a 10/10.",
