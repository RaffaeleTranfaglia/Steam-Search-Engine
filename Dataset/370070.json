            "review_text": "This game is really a very horribly done warcraft mod that somewhere between warcraft 1 and 2, first ill start off with the cons.  CONS:  1) The randomly generated maps are used on missions that they should not.  2) There are too many conditions to mission completion on most of the dwarven missions.  3) Storyline is bland and is barely worth reading.  4) The tech tree system seems like a good idea but it actually is slightly annoying, because you need to complete missions for tech points but you can reset your tech tree at any time for free.  5) Missions where you are not allowed to build and just have a set number of troops are usually very broken, this is due to the random map generation. You just have to keep trying to get the 'right' generation, and or reduce the difficulty.  6) The tilesets, other than the trees are really rather unatractive and gloomy. Regardless of where you are.   7) The AI having unlimited resources, is very annoying especially on certain missions, on a number of missions i had to play for an additional 20 minutes just because of this. Also the unlimited resources forces you down, 'the set conpletion path' meaning there is only one way to do each mission most of the time.  8) The AI is not very smart, in fact its really rather dumb.   PROS:  1) mhm... nope cant think of one.",
