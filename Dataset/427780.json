            "review_text": "Definitely nowhere near perfect. Buy 'Shadowmatic' on your iOS device instead.  I wanted to like this game. I really really really wanted to like it. I love the concept of rotating objects to reveal the shapes.  However, this game falls way short.  It feels like something someone made in Blender. Transitions are low resolution, plastic-looking, and low-framerate. The levels range from super-easy, to 'are you freaking kidding me?' with no coherent progression. (Easy levels and hard levels are all thrown together in no order)  The 'story' is cringe-worthy. Sure, I want to know what happens next, but the voice-over feels strained. The levels often feel like the end-object was arbitrariarly chosen just so it could fit with the story. But worse, at times it feels like the story arbitrarily bends itself just to justify whatever the object was. It makes no sense.  Some levels are so incredibly 'unfair', it seems like it's by-design how unfair they are. Oh, but luckily there's a hint system.  Click the hint button, and it'll show you the shadow of the object that you're looking for.  Not enough? Click the hint button again, to get a sort of 'radar' color, that will change to green as you get closer to the target shape.  That sounds lovely.  EXCEPT for the fact that you're only given 10-hints to start with. OH, maybe they give you more hints after solving a level on your own? NO!  Once you use up the 10-hints, your only option next is to BUY MORE hints.  Seriously? I already bought the game, and I cannot continue because I can't figure out this obtuse, intentionally frustrating level, because I don't have enough hints, and I must pay more to continue?  Skip. That.  Not to mention that the entire interface looks like it was designed for touch-screen. (Including some early on-screen prompts).  And there are ADVERTISEMENTS in the game directing you to their website for other (mobile) games. On top of the in-app purchases, in a game I already spent money to buy?   I'm done with this game.. I wanted to enjoy it so much. But there's no love here. Such a shame.  If you read this far, you really should check out 'SHADOWMATIC', which is available for iPhone/iPad.  I guarantee that you'll like it more than 'perfect angle'",

            "review_text": "Interesting concept for a puzzle game but as with all the mobile games which are thrown on Steam without any optimization for PC, it's surely not perfect.  The story is about helping a person remember his lost memories through solving puzzles and you unlock a scene with a caption each few levels, now that I finished the whole game, I can easily say that the story was a bunch of gibberish sentences badly narrated by a fake wise voice and nothing made sense at the end of it.  To solve the puzzles you move the camera until some shape pops out, which works well for both mouse controls and touch screen, but that mechanism could be used as a cheating method because the camera reacts in a certain way when you're near the correct angle in some levels. I also remember finding a correct shape in some levels but not passing the level because it wasn't the right one and that was kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Hints unlock every 5 minutes, and the first one tells you what shape you are looking for, not knowing what you're looking for isn't much of a problem except in some specific levels where it gets confusing, still, I don't see why hints should be raining nonstop since that's not how puzzle games work, and even though that putting an option to buy hints is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but since you can beat the game without someone 'forcing you' to buy hints, I don't see a problem in it and I don't get why a lot of people are giving negative reviews for this specific reason.  Recommended on a good sale.",

It's sometimes too hard, and sometimes too easy. Repetetive music, but good visuals, although game itself feels a bit like mobile port.   It's a fun game, kind of thing I always dreamed about. Game where you only rotate camera. It has some faults - paying for hints? Who's gonna do that, if there are walkthroughs? Also hints are well... showing shapes, and I expected something different.  I don't like story here - it seems very much senseless. Also voice actor is, um, reminding me of lector from Trine - I dislike him. And overall the sentences - might have got translated not exactly how it was supposed to be. (Remember, that's my impression).  EDIT: You need to change settings and go for 'with story', instead of 'new story' to get other guy speaking! He is way better in my opinion! ",

I think the music and the voice actor make this a really interesting and relaxing game, so I can't complain about that. The levels might be a bit repetitive, but I don't find that a problem. The graphics don't really affect the gameplay, so there's no problem on that either. Overall I think it's a really good game, different from your usual puzzle game, and will also occupy a few hours (depending on the player). On bought this game in a bundle but I can say that I wouldn't mind paying the whole price",

Great story teller: I really liked the way information was given, for example about the character and his memories. Trading cards: they are around 0.07 float so it is pretty good! Hard, starting from seventh map, but there're a lot of let's plays on the net, so it is easy to search for the answer. What? You think it is easy? Then try it out! The puzzle game based on optical illusions... 9/10 Thank you. The game is worth buying.",

This game is a mobile port and even makes reference to you playing it on a phone (which obviously you arent.)  However, that could be overlooked if not for the fact that as a port of a mobile game, it's also ported over the in-game advertisements (some of which alt+tab you out of the game) and in-game micro-transactions for 'hints' (a pay 2 skip wait system.)  Ultimately I enjoyed it though. If the concept interests you, it's probably worth the price.",

Suprisingly, this has a very interesting and philosophical plot that isn't to be ignored.  Even though this game gets hard at times, it gives you the ability to ask for hints that will almost always get you seeing the perfect angle. I recommend using some guides that people have put together to help you understand what you are trying to find as the puzzles get slightly ambiguous the more you progress.  Overall, if you want a soothing puzzle game to help you unwind at the end of a busy day, this is a game I strongly recommend to any type of person; gamer or non-gamer.  I r8 8/8 m8.",
