Graphics are good and very compatible with mods.  'But you have 22 hours...'  You could say I have 222. My CD key was actually stolen, but thanks to the amazing customer support at Bohemia Studios I was given a spare CD key for free as they were able to identify it was a CD key theft. This encouraged me to play the game even more and enjoy it. Thanks a bunch, Bohemia.",

            "review_text": "In 1947 the legendary general Forman swore to combat all who would dare create new fun games with the theme 'simulation'. While his efforts were largely conceived as honorable and patriotic, there were those who would create their games regardless of Forman's rule. Even though the ban on simulation games would be lifted in 2003 they were still regarded as low-class toys and shameless attempts at controlling the masses. People know to the public as simulation developers were shunned from society and declined their right to vote.  This all changed in 2007 when Bohemia Interactive released a game so superb, so innovative that it's release is commonly seen as the greatest moment in gaming history, in all of history. ARMA 2 captured the imagination of audiences the world over. Its riveting story and enthralling graphics made the game an instant hit, and at the same time threw the simulation games into the mainstream, no longer would simulation developers be banned from voting and eating using cutlery, instead they would now be encouraged to vote, as their opinion meant more than that of the common man.  Many have tried and many have failed at reproducing the feel and social and political impact of ARMA 2, Microsoft Train Simulator and Farming Simulator have nearly single-handedly cast the simulation industry back into the shadows from whence it came. Was it not for ARMA 2’s focus on replay value the world would not have survived the onslaught of terrible simulation games. Every attempt at recreating a game as tremendous as ARMA 2 has been futile… until now.  20th of May 2013 will go down in history as the day when Bohemia Interactive released their greatest creation yet: ARMA 3. Its gameplay is like nothing no-one has ever seen and will revolutionize the gaming-industry, if not the modern world. Bohemia has managed to create a game that will suck players into its massive world that encompasses a single island, and on top of that tells the most spellbinding and creative story ever told. One may laugh at the idea of creating a game where the player is expected to sympathize with an ENEMY MAN, 200 METERS and care for its actions, and struggles in the world, but Bohemia's extravagant game put’s those claims to the test and proves once and for all that Bohemia is the greatest gaming-company the world has ever seen.   11/10",

            "review_text": "Introduction:  ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is the standalone DLC (Downloadable Content) Pack for ArmA 2, A Military Simulator by Czech developer Bohemia Interactive. ArmA 2: OA is the only standalone DLC pack for ArmA 2. Multiple other DLC packs play part in Takistan, Including the BAF (British Armed Forces) DLC and PMC (Private Military Contractors) DLC.  The Map(s):  ArmA 2: OA is set in the fictional Middle-Eastern country of Takistan. Takistan has many towns, villages and cities to explore, with two airfields on either end of the map. The map of Zargabad, A Small desert city in the middle of nowhere, quite small compared to Chernarus or Takistan, but the city is hugh compared to Takistan's largest, Rasman. Zargabad also comes with an airfield and a few buildings here and there. the PMC and BAF DLCs use this map as well.  The Gameplay:  ArmA 2, as a military simulator has many aspects involved in succeeding. To me, and many others, the most important is Teamwork. You have to work as a team to get things done in this game, and I love that consept. It is very slow paced, very tactical, and aimed at people that don't like to get things done rambo-style. Movement is extremely fiddly with the inability to walk through clearly enterable spaces and breaking your legs on the oddest of places. The game is fairly old, however, coming in at a 2010 release, a year after the original ArmA 2.  Graphics/Voice Acting:  Graphics and Voice Acting are quite shameful, but the game is old and developed by a Czech developer making an english game, and the quality is tolerable.  The Multiplayer:  The ArmA Multiplayer is quite easily where the most fun is to be had. With excessive mods and gamemodes developed plus the original gamemodes implemented to play with your friends, i've spent 99% of my OA Experience on the Multiplayer. My most enjoyable moments on the multiplayer moments were on Takistan Life: Revolution servers. TLR, as it is abbreviated to, is a Roleplay Mission File for OA.  My Issue(s):  My only Issue with OA is the fact that when update 1.63 was released, it wiped out an extremely large fraction of all multiplayer servers. I took this as a sign of BI telling us to go to ArmA 3, which is quite rude. Luckily, servers are popping back up here and there, which is a very good sign.  Summary:  Overall, All ArmA games are amazing in my opinion, but ArmA 2: OA gets the cake. Congratulations to Bohemia Interactive for making such an enjoyable, but serious game and I hope this review was found helpful.  Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10 / 4.5 out of 5.    ",

See what makes this a great game is the community, now im not gonna say that everyone is super nice aand mature but the majority of them are. This is a fun ♥♥♥ game with a variety of gamemodes my personnal favorites are takistan life and domination but it isnt for everyone. If you like fast paced gameplay this isnt for you but if you like to have to get tactical or you like to roleplay or you like to snipe people from the top of a hill and afterwards have a huge feeling of triumph than this is the perfect game for you definately worth the money",

The campaign is not to bad, it's more fun playing either multiplayer or coop missions, two of the more popular online types Dayz &amp; Wasteland are what are generally played online, I personally prefer wasteland which is more combat orientated than Dayz. The game has been out for a good while now but with mod support and a powerful in game editor this game has been quite fun, if you haven't picked it up yet it's worth a try on the steam sales! 8/10",

Playing alone is kinda annoying and not that fun, but if you've a whole squad then it's awesome.

The game can be a bit frustrating at times however, there are stupid bugs, the players can be very incompetent ( Obviously not a fault with the game, but it's still frustrating ) The combat is quite clunky and you can get stuck on walls and doors trying to fight in CQB engagements and the AI have incredible aim it's like they have an aimbot.

The game has many Faction's. (RU, UK, US, PMC, etc) They're so many gamemods for this game.  (DayZ,ACE/ACRE,CO-OP,IslandLife,Realism  Unit, etc)   Cons:  I suggust they should add a underground system.

There aren't many servers of Arma 2 since most of them are Dayz servers but if you'll look more carefully you will find servers like Wasteland, Warfare BE, Domination, Insurgency and Island life servers. So when you get use yo the game I would recommend joining game community since they can offer you even more fun!  And if you like going solo then don't worry ArmA 2 campaign is fun too! Also ArmA 2 community has to offer alot of custom maps, weapons, vehicles, scenarios, campaigns... And if you like to edit well than you can do it too!

My actual time played is likely between 500 and 1,000 hours.  I can't recommend the base game without mods because I've never played the base game without mods. ACE and ACRE on a multiplayer server are what make the game amazing, and I don't think it's worth your time to play the single player game unmodded.  Arma II is riddled with bugs and problems. It's an incredibly demanding game, even on modern machines. It hogs your CPU and can crash for literally no reason at all. If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.  You'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.  Sometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.  Occasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.  Believe me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.  Arma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???",

I love the mechanics of Arma 2: movement, weapons, air and ground vehichles.  I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to play military simulations on a massive scale and also great mods and player created missions.  A small criticisms: Most of the scoped weaons do not work with NVGs (DMR, M4 ACOG do) and there are some night vision snipers FN-Fal, M110 (togglable).  I'd say at least 90% of my gaming is using Arma 2.  I do own and sometimes play Arma 3 mods and missions, but it's even more poorly optimised than Arma 2, the movement feels slippery, rather than accurate and land vehicles feel clunky.  For those who don't own Arma 2 right now, I'd definitely recommend a decent CPU and GPU. It's a rather CPU greedy engine.",

Then the DayZ Epoch server I played on shut down, shortly there after my friend who got me playing, stop playing and went on to other games, and my Arma 2 collections sat un-played. From time to time I would try other DayZ mods and servers, most filled with jerks and hackers... Then I discovered DaiZy a single player mod of DayZ, I started playing again and trying some of the different DaiZy mods available, I was having fun again...that lead to finding other mods for the Arma 2 collection like Day of Survival and a host of others... Now I play DaiZy, DoS and the actual game and I love it. I have to say it's the Best Military First Person Shooter I have ever played, and with all the different mods out there for it and the ability to edit your own missions it has a ton of re-play value!

I get the feeling that the mod will be popular for a good while yet since the standalone just isn't quite there yet and people enjoy mods like Epoch and things the SA doesn't have so there's that still. Apart from that, the game is amazing. It has a steep learning curve but if you can stick with it and get past that, the game is too good. The map(s) are huge and Chernarus in particular is something special. The amount of different game modes (excluding DayZ variations) is enough to keep you playing for many hundreds, possibly thousands of hours. Game modes go from small 8 player missions to massive 100+ servers / missions. I'm really ♥♥♥♥ at trying to say why this is good but there's an attempt.",

If you are taking off, and you barely touch a car or helicopter (that is on the right of the runway) with your wing, your plane will just turn to the right and be stuck until the server restarts or your reset your singleplayer world. It is pretty fun to mess around in the Editor. Driving with cars, is very awesome. It's one of the things I love to do most when I'm bored.  The camera movement is pretty realistic. I love it.

Pros: » DayZ mod and many more game modes. » good graphics for the time it was made.  Cons: » feels like my character is unable to follow simple 'turn the ♥♥♥♥ around' orders sometimes.  Main Review: unable to give a good general review due to only playing 1 game mode on game, but i know it has many game modes, hence the thumbs up however i doubt ill be playing any others since Arma 3 is out, however just for the DayZ mod (outdated, DayZ standalone is out, but highly unpolished) im giving it a good score and thumps up since it was a good take on a zombie appocalypse world and scavanging, hell it has cars too, making the trek across the massive map much more quicker. Good fun with friends, some BS shots by other players, but its anti-cheat is good, one of the best actually. i dont know if i should recommend to buy now since Arma 3 and DayZ standalone (unpolished) is out now, but it was good for its time.

Arrowhead is a different story. The game is still very alive, the issue with Arrowhead is the community is ruined. DayZ brought around some of the worst types of people. Before DayZ Griefers were very rare, now they are everywhere and the worst part is, they hack and destory servers and get accounts banned. The game in its current online state is poor, and that is sad, very sad, especially since I remember when it wasn't like this. Arma III is shaping up to be a much better game than what we currently have in Arma II, and the community seems to be holding together, more than likely because DayZ is now a standalone game. My gripes are more personal and subject to opinion though. Both Arrowhead and Arma II are amazing Military Simulators. The Singleplayer is realistic, and top notch. Nothing but the Original Operation Flashpoint can really stand up to it.  9/10 - Both great titles, but I would recommend not buying them anymore and just purchasing Arma III until maybe the DayZ fad finally dies out.",

Sure the campaign needs to be polished nobody can deny that , even if you hate the campaign there is still a plenty of things to do . You have a really powerfull editor at your disposal so you can make your own scenarios - for example you can download Balkan Wars mod and recreate Shelling of Sarajevo or get Russians fight against Us. Now i really recommend getting Arma 2 CO and all DLCs because there is just so much content. Yes , yes i know that Arma 3 is superior in gameplay , but keep in mind that some people may not have a powerfull computer or just don´t like the super modern warfare shown in the game.

The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fantastic, and overall, I think that this game is the best I have ever played. When you join a server, without the DayZ mod, you can join one of three teams, 'Blufor', 'Opfor', and 'Independant'. If you join Blufor or Opfor, you cant kill anyone on the same team as you, but you can work together to conquer the enemy base. But, if you join Independant, you can kill anyone you want, and conquer or destroy anybodys base. There are also a lot of vehicles, There are Helis, Jets, Cars, Trucks, and Jeeps. You can buy, or find most of these vehicles. If you join a server with the DayZ mod, everybody is on independant. You can work tegether, or alone, but the same rules apply as with the vehicles. But there is one more thing You have a hunger bar and a thirst bar, and you need to watch those. You can find food and water on the map you are playing on.

You need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air. This game is not for the Call of Duty or Battlefield player who just likes to run and gun. There are lots of places to explore in the map because it's so big but in a gamemode like Domination or King of the Hill, you'll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only. Lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where it's at. 9/10 - Only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements.",

The game runs smoothly even if you are being chased by 20 thousand infected or in a heavy firefight with enemy players. The game is full of action and intensity that I can't get enough of. Then there are those times I want to relax with friends and just socialize in the game. From time to time, I subject my squad to frequent helicopter rides just to sit watching the world pass below, wondering what would happen if I ordered the chopper pilot to drop us off in the missions below. Sadly, one mission was interrupted by one of our heuy helicopters crashing due to our pilot being shot out of the sky from a sniper below. This game truly takes a lot of dedication, time, and practice to become decent at it. The dynamic world that Chernarus offers, at 225km2, is incredibly beautiful and asthetic as the game can be.

But with games such as these, it comes with a host of problems, mostly everywhere. Although the campaign is good, and frankly fun, it is the glitchiest singeplayer I've ever played. I mean, Christ, I'll be in a convoy and it's Carmeggadon. NPC's are 'special', and 50% of the time don't listen to your commands and as I stated previously, it's like the army just took a bunch of rednecks who failed their driver exams and put them in a war-torn country as 'Marines'. Another problem with the campaign is that sometimes when you complete a mission, the animation to finish the mission will just not happen or it will glitch out and just stop midway through it, especially if you're playing with a buddy. The multiplayer is a tad better. There's so much potential in mods and there are loads of gamemodes, but once again, with games like these, it often turns into desync/glitch/lag fests. Another problem with OA is that unless you have a supercomputer, given to you by E.T. and/or Spock, you're not going over 30 fps. If you have any old computer, you're going to have a bad time/0.5 fps. If you want to cry, play this game on a Mac or Windows XP.  What really makes this game is DayZ. It wouldn't be close to the fame it has if it weren't for the mod, so try it out and have fun. If you want to play DayZ, I seriously reccomend playing a couple of missions on Arma first.

I have to say I have several friends who play Arma3 and have also played Arma2/Operation Arrowhead and they will tell you that Arma2/Operation Arrowhead is the way to go if your looking for replayability and variety! there are so many more things I can say about this but it is only fitting that I end this review with this: Get Arma2 Operation Arrowhead!",

It is very expansive (not expensive!); I feel it offers more customization and mod support than any other FPS shooter I've ever played. Sure it's a little buggy and the gameplay can seem clunky sometimes, but for the entertainment I've drained out of the game(s), I give it 9.5 stars out of 10.",

You can't help but have a smile on your face when you send a couple 7.62×39mm rounds down range through an AK kicking up dirt and dropping sprinting enemies in their tracks. Of course this game is way more intricate for the serious tactical players but for the casual gamers, gamemodes like Wasteland in multiplayer servers is a timeless classic.

It has a huge world that allows for you to tackle a situation any way you like. Even if you are playing with the AI, giving your AI squadmates commands like 'Hold fire' or 'Move 200m' can drastically change the outcome of a situation and I think that let's the player become more a part of the game, thus making the game more enjoyable.    Even though this might just be an expansion pack for Arma 2 I feel that Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead is better than just regular Arma 2 and if it was a seperate game and I had to choose between the two I would most definetely choose Operation Arrowhead.    Also this game has an editor which pretty much let's you make your own scenarios. You want to lead an assault on an airfield? Sure! You want to drop bombs on a city? Alright! You want to snipe someone from a mile away? Go ahead! The editor might be confusing at first and you might need to learn a few things, or even write some script's to get what you want but the editor has nearly - if not - unlimited potential. The graphics are still bad and the animations and controls are still a pain buy meh, I still have fun with it.",

The Dayz / Epoch mod and all variants of it are, even with the bugs this game comes with, the most fun game I have ever played. You can build your own base, attack other bases, do missions with AI and fight other teams/players. I have looked for games like this (Dayz Standalone, Rust, H1Z1 etc etc) but none come even close to this.  Do not expect a fast paced game like Battlefield or Call of Duty where you get a kill every other minute. You have to be patient, flank, fall back, become a master of stealth and learn to zero all different kind of snipers. When you do kill someone it feels so much more rewarding than other games. The skill cap is very high compared to most games and even after all these hours I still learn new things about this game.  I recommend playing with friends or a team. Definitely check out the wide variety of ways to kill other players. Vehicles, helis, boats, planes or just on foot. My personal favourite mods on Arma2 are Overpoch, Epoch &amp; Wasteland.",

Idiotic storyline, dialog is generic and most of the times out of place, music trying hard to be 'cool' same goes for the voice actors, their dialoge is strait idiotic, it's like listening to hispter teenagers or 10 year olds trying to fit in the older community. The in-game foreign language speaking people usually every third or fourth word they say is the word 'kurva'. It's like listening to idiotic hipster pooland people or hipster hungarians, it's like all they can say is 'kurva'. Oh and that will be the first thing you hear starting the campain. How lovely... Then there are glitchy bugged out characters animations, complicated controls and the list goes on. If you don't need to then don't get these Arma games.",
