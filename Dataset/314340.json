            "review_text": "Chess 2 was clearly developed with the intent of making Chess new and fresh again, and it succeeds completely at this prospect. One of the most intimidating aspects of Chess 1: The Original is just the wealth of pre-established metagame that's been developed over the many long years it's been around. With six (count em, SIX!) unique factions instead of just one, all the old material is completely thrown out the window and you have to learn Chess all over again, and that, I feel, is wonderful. No longer is it about memorizing countless openings or having a wealth of unfathomable experience. Instead, you play it like you would play a modern strategy game - thoughtfully pondering your own decisions and creatively coming up with your own solutions. The midline rule also keeps the action tense throughout and prevents the more boring, drawn-out endgames of Chess 1; it feels like the way Chess was always meant to be played.  If you have ever been intimidated about picking up Chess before, now's the time to join Chess 2. The sooner the better - joining in while the game is young will be an exciting opportunity to see it evolve, and to help shape the metagame and history of the game yourself!",

            "review_text": "This is a truly great game! It has some bugs and is missing some features but the core is great and that is what really matters when it comes to games. Some more options and features would have been nice but it has all the essential pieces and you will certainly be able to enjoy the game for a long time.  It is simple enough that you can get into it fairly quickly but advanced enough so it will feel fresh for a long time and surprise you with new combos and strategies. A must try for fans of the turn based strategy genre or chess fans. If you want a strategy game without luck then this might be the game for you.   The six armies manages to make new games feel fresh and you have to adapt different strategies depending on who you are facing. The mid-line invasion rule makes the games shorter and more intense and often result in heated battles around the chess boards mid-line. The game feels very balanced, there are no best or worst army.   If you don't like chess or think you are bad at it I would still encourage you to try this game, I think it feels different enough that you might enjoy it even if you don't like normal chess. Also, if you are bad at chess you will feel right at home here, we are all starting from scratch and are trying to figure out how to play this game ;) However, I think you get better at normal chess by playing this game so this might be something for someone who want to get better at normal chess as well.  If nothing else I would recommend this game so you can learn the rules and play it with a physical chess against your friends because it is a really fun chess variation when you get the hang of the new rules. I was quite skeptical in the beginning, especially about the bidding and the new armies but it actually works and fits really nice together. So do yourself a favor and try this strategy game, the worst thing that can happen is that you don't like it :)  Rules: 9/10 UI: 6/10 Fun factor: 9/10 Options: 5/10 Graphics: 10/10 Music: 8/10 Game modes: 6/10 Army Balance: 9/10  Score: 8/10",

This game is tactically rich and the different chess men armies make it very deep and every match up is diverse and colorful. Sparks fly in my brain when I play this. Its f*****g awesome.",

There are zero options: you cannot adjust resolution, quality, you can't even adjust the volume or turn off the music! The menu's don't seem to like being controlled by mice, you can only click on the deepest 'slice' of a menu, even if the other menu options are on the screen.  Online play also has zero options. You search for a game and pick an army, but have no control over who you play or extra rules like the time each player gets. There is no rating system for players, no chat system, no friends system, no ability to start a game with a specific person (!), nothing. This application is missing SO MUCH that paying $20 for it makes me feel ripped off. This is not $20 of quality. This is like $4 of quality. Maybe. I'd pay $5 if I could turn off the terrible music.  In other words: don't expect much.",
