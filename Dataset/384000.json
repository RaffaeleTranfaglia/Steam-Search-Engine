            "review_text": "Dutchman: Begins   2.2 hrs last two weeks / 2.2 hrs on record  Cross of the Dutchman is a subpar ARPG, and in an already weak genre like ARPGs, it's pretty down there. Actually, can I even call it an ARPG beyond the simplistic clicky gameplay? You don't build your character, you don't get experience and you don't level. The most you do is spend money to increase your health or unlock new moves.  'Filler' is the name of the game, as quest markers take you from point A, to point B, to point C, to point A again, then back to point B, then point A for some reason, then point C which opens up point D, etc. The only content outside of the bad main quest is just combing over the same maps to find treasure chests filled with gold. That's it. You don't find new weapons, hell, you don't even have armor. Calling this game barebones would be an insult to bones that dogs chew.  So what do you all actually do? Well. You point and click to your next destination as pointed out by your mini map, then get in some fights. Seldomly, you do some annoying stealth missions. All you really need to do here is just hug the walls. With that, I just described everything you'll be doing. You don't have puzzles to solve, you don't have side quests, there's no caves of monsters or beasts. There's not even stupid crafting or dialogue choices.  I have to ask: Why build these villages to be as big as they are anyway from a game design standpoint? I'm not gonna be doing anything else beyond the stupid fetch quests. So why make it harder for people to play your game by having towns with pointless NPCs that just clutter everything? It's rare you can talk to anybody in town that isn't either a store keep or part of the quest you're already on.  The combat has a strange stiffness to it. Where I would think a guy using his meaty fists would be really satisfying, I found myself more frustrated when he refused to continue his combo. There's just something wrong with the combat, and I couldn't put my foot on it until I unlocked this forward kick ability. Unlike in Diablo when you click something and your character does it on the thing you clicked, Dutchman has an oddity where Pier will just refuse to line it up. His uppercut works fine for the most part, but his kick just sometimes will refuse to aim at enemies - which proved to be the only frustrating moment of the combat until I just outright stopped using the kick, as the rest of the game is in fact a cake walk. I don't even know who this game will challenge. Children? People with one arm would have no trouble with this, even with the few keyboard commands this game has.  There's also two types of enemies: Footmen and archers.  Exciting.  The biggest sin when it comes to the lack of variety that this game commits, is just not having the little things like inventory management like health potions (because the game has regenerating health instead) or a real progression to the gameplay outside of getting a sword at one point.  The story cribs a few things from the legend of Robin Hood, like forming your band of merrymen or the bridge fight between Robin and Little John, but as is, it's only serviceable, but lacks personality outside of its cinematics, which depending on your taste for Tumblr art, could really turn you off. (Which at certain points, I thought the cutsey comedic art felt incredibly out of place.) I won't spoil anything, but like many origin stories, it comes to an abrupt end before anything really interesting happens, or letting you get that proper resolution. What little there is between characters is the usual RPG back and forth   'I'll do this if you help me.'  'Ya helped me, so I'll help you now!'  Oh, and did I mention this games REALLY short? Even despite all of the repetitive gameplay, and going over the same maps over, and OVER again, they really couldn't figure out how to lengthen it. It's not that I wanted this to be longer, it's just shocking that there's so little to do outside of the main quest. Even ARPGs know how to jerk you around.  My final time (except for the trading cards idling) was 2.2 hrs and I was THIIIIIIIIIIS close to being able to get a refund, which I might have been able to if I paid a little more attention and didn't fail the stealth stuff as much as I did. (I actually can't get a refund anyway because I got it from an indie game bundle.) Maybe you're the chosen one that can beat it and refund it... but I wouldn't risk it. The game is just... bleh.  The Pro's:  +In game graphical art style is pretty good  The Con's:  -Stupidly simple combat  -Stupidly simple quest design  -Absolutely nothing in the overworld outside of treasure chests  -Short as short can be ",

It wasn't a super deep plot, now were the combat mechanics the most sophisticated, but i had a lot of fun. a great art style, a story that doesn't take itself too seriously but is solid fantasy. I get the feeling its based on some real folklore but i doubt i'll look it up. The perfect game to lose yourself in for a sunday afternoon, finish it in 1 sitting and go to work Monday feeling like you've had a journey. Would totally recomend",

I intended to finish the game despite my disinterest, but the save game seems to be lost after a PC migration. I can't arsed to slouch through the poorly planned forced stealth missions and deal with the clunky and unresponsive controls one more time, just to be subjected to the same hamfisted story portraying Frisian men as amazing and everyone else as either victims, punchlines of jokes (the women) or mindless enemies (everyone else).   Can't recommend this game to anyone, but I do sincerely hope the studio will be able to make more games and learn from their work on this one.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this game a lot and overall I feel that the developer, who if I'm not mistaken had a small team, did a fantastic job with making a fun game. The leveling was ok and the enimies, while not exactly massively different, were fun to knock around and see them get thrown into the air. Basically the game is fun and the mecanics are there in this game.  However, it simply is to short. This game offers to tale the tail of this giant midievil warrior who weilded a giant sword and slew hundreds of man in battle. He stormed across the battlefield, avenging his family and killing these forces who had invaded his country and taken everything from himself, and the men who fought with him. He created a massive personal navy and became a midieval pirate lord, plundering and raiding ships, all the while defending a country he loved. He goes from place to place attacking these invaders who have now taken over towns and cities. He kills many and makes the land run red. As his life begins to come to an end hei pauses for a moment to think about what he has done, after fighting for so long. He sees that around, left in his wake, is untold death and distruction and this man stops fighting. He disbands his crew (some more forcefully then others) and convinces them, through conversation or by steel, that they need to stop fighting. After finally stopping his blood shed, he hangs up his sword, takes off his armor, and finally sits down and builds a new farm. He lives a simple like until he dies one year later. And this is what you can find on wikipedia for gods sake.   Peir Gerlof bacame a monster to fight monsters and he let this monster he had create run wild until he finally put it down, in favor of being a peaceful man. And if this story was what you wanted to be told then you get the first part of it. You get chapter 1 of the story in this game, not the whole story.   I wanted the whole story and it wasn't delived, thus I can't say that this game can get my vote.  I want this game to be great, and if the creator wants to make this an eposadic adventure I would be happy with it. I'd gladdly keep paying if I can keep having as much fun as I did in this game, perhaps for a lower price tag. I want you guys to succeed, but please not like this.   TL:DR - the game is good and fun but its kind short and doesn't tell the whole story of pier gerlof. Worth your money if you enjoy a good beat-um-up",
