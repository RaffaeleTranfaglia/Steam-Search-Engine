            "review_text": "An early Winter Wolves visual novel with 3 romance options (2 female + 1 male), an ok story with some mystery thrown in and decent characters (however this may be acquired taste, as always - personally, I'm not fond of John, who appears to be 'default' game romance). There is no trace of hentai there, although there are some mildly suggestive scenes that may not be appropriate for younger audience.  The main flaw is game length - I managed to complete all 3 patches in just below 2 hours. It's really short, but on a positive side - even little choices matter, and many answers lead to different branches (and sometimes unlocking or solving a quest).  There are no RPG elements, no stats building or daily routine planning, just going through the scenes and making choices - so what you get here is a steamlined experience - without tedious grinding element - which also may be seen as a plus.  All in all, 'Heileen 1: Sail Away' is an enjoyable little visual novel, which serves as an introduction to bigger (and generally better received) follow-ups. While 'Sail Away' alone may be not worth it's price point, if you can get it cheap and you plan to play through the whole series, it's an easy recommendation.",

I am a huge fan of visual novels and otome type games, so to see one so cheap on steam, I bought it right then and there, as i've been hearing nothing but good things about Heileen on many otome forums and blogs, I really wanted to try it, and legally at that. I've played some seriously heart wrenching vistual novels (like Clannad), but as I stated earlier, Heileen is a very fun read, but I grow a bit more bored each time I play it through trying to get different endings haha! I can tell you that I didn't realize I had put an hour into it until I stopped and looked at steam and noticed it, so it does stay interesting to some point.",

            "review_text": "If you're a fan of dating Sims Heileen is worth picking up on sale or as a part of the bundle. The II and III games are much better, but the first game acts as an introduction to the characters and sets the stage for the rest of the series. There is a lot of over the top melodrama, so don't take the game too seriously and you'll have fun!  There are only 3 romance options and 2 of them are women, so I hesitate to reccomend it as an otome game, but if you like otome you'll probably have fun here. The relationships aren't very deep, so if you're looking for touching moments and swoon-worthy suitors this is not the game for you.  It's not a terriby long game. It took me 4 play throughs to get all 3 endings (I messed up on Lora and had to play a 2nd time...)",

            "review_text": "This was the first visual novel I've ever played. I was interested by the description of it, but to be perfectly honest, the main 'sell point' for me was the possibility of f/f romance. What I remembered about this game? That it was disappointing, that I ended up with a character I wasn't interested in the slightest for some unknown reason and that, at some point, I started skipping huge parts of dialogue, because the story wasn't engaging in the slightest.  I decided to replay it now and I think it's even worse than I remember. By any means, this isn't THE WORST visual novel out there (or even on Steam). Characters looks alright, music is alright, the creators clearly wanted this to be something else than just any visual novel, since there's quest system. It's worth mentioning, that this was one of first if not the first game from Winter Wolves, so if you don't like this one, you shouldn't feel discouraged to try others (some of their games are really good).   That being said, you don't have to play long to see that 'Heileen', as a game, has a lot of issues. Haileen, as a character, too. Writing is fluctuating between bland and absolutely terrible, characters are acting weird, there isn't much logic in their behavior. I got used to annoying protagonists in visual novels, but usually there are other characters that makes up for that. Here everyone is annoying, because nothing they do make any kind of sense. There is a score system, which I don't think have much of an impact on a game per se. Plot seems almost non existent, everything is bland and predictable.   The good thing? Price. I'm glad to see that this one isn't sold for 10$ (like Love and Order, which is even worse). If you are a fan of visual novels, get 'Heileen' during sale. If not, skip this one.",

The anachronisms bounce between stupid and annoying. Also weirdly racially insensitive, as somehow returning the slaves that were saved from slavery to slavery is a good thing? They'll be safer there? I ... I don't even know ...   As for the romances, they're run of the mill to get the basic guy or best friend ending, and weird to get your uncle's mistress ending.  If you want an entertaining visual novel with romances, try Magical Diary. If you want a story with weird yet touching romances, try Hatoful Boyfriend. There are so many better novels out there with more choice and better characters. I cannot fathom how something this bad and boring became a series.",
