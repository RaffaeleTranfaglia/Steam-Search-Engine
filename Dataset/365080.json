            "review_text": "2.5/10  Interesting topic and good that it's steeped in history, and good that dev is trying to expose a topic not covered usually. Unfortunately gameplay sucks soo bad nobody wants to stick around. The whole thing is text based. All you do is click on villages, and a setence pops up. You go to a vendor and click to hire people and click to buy guns. Then you click on an area in captivity and then click attack. The combat isn't explained and doesn't make a lot of sense, or how to get money or do anything. I attacked a guy, lost my stuff and my money. But in reality game is soo boring and uninteresting to play I didn't really care. If you like reading go open a book, if you like only clicking on words go to any random website. Save yourself the money.",
