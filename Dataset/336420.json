            "review_text": "Do you like playing League of Legends, but only really enjoy co-op? Then you are going to love this game.  It's a bunch of MOBA-esque things, like building items, the top-down view and QWER abilities, but instead of going against another team you're fighitng against hordes of mobs. Surprisingly difficult, but an absolute blast to play with other people. Plenty of unlockables as you play on harder difficulties and work your way up the ladders with your favored characters, each of which have different flavors that are all neat in their own way.  And that five pack is just so damn affordable.",

I highly recommendy to anyone who likes Co-op games and/or Warcraft 3 &amp; its multiple custom game modes (like me).  (This Not a MOBA, its' purely PvE, it only plays in a slightly similar way due to the controls, but this is just because, like MOBAs, this game is inspired by a Warcraft 3 type of map, Hero defense. MOBAs came from the AoS map type.)",

Pros: It's viscerally fun, it's bloody, requires a bit of teamwork.  Cons: Not many classes, Endless mode is just the same 10 waves over and over, the item store is a little hard to navigate at first, and around the 3rd iteration it becomes nigh impossible to continue unless everyone specced to defense.  If you can pick it up for cheap, it's a nice time sink for a while.",

Everybody else should play it anyway, because it is sweeeet.  Imagine Enfo's, back in the days of WarCraft 3 UMS. Now take that, and make it AWESOME. Although there are a shortage of classes compared to enfo's, I really think it's better to have a good core than a multitude of ♥♥♥♥ nobody will understand anyway. Each class has an option of being more of the class, i.e. a tank/tank or a dps/tank. Or a healer/healer or a dps/healer, which is quite enjoyable if you're tired of always being the one that gets stuck with a certain role.  On a minor note, the channeling times for the enemies are a bit broken and unfortunately mean timing dodges are a bit of a challenge.  All in all, an awesome game.",

            "review_text": "The game is repetitive, I don't mind that though since I like these types of games. It's top down similar to Diablo and Dota, you choose from 4 types of characters - tank, damage dealer, disabler and healer. Each has different characters to them as well with different abilities. There are bunch of arenas much like tower defense games with different layouts but this is not a tower defense game. You have to defend the main core from the waves of enemies trying to get to it. There is something similar to skill tree or path where you unlock power ups for the characters by fulfilling tasks. You need those power ups to play on higher difficulties. The main issues with the game is that there are almost no people playing it, you might be able to find some in the forums though.",

            "review_text": "Note: This game was reviewed using a key sent by the developer.  Bloodsports.TV is a moba type game where the main goal is to survive with your team mates but will you want to play it ?  Bloodsports. TV has a very simple concept. It play's like a online battle arena, but the goal is not to destroy the base of other players. This game is a wave based survival game where the main goal is to protect a rocket and fight until the game is over.  Graphics are pretty awesome. The cell shaded look is really nice and some of the character models look really nice. Overall there's not much to talk about the art style.  The soundtrack is really good as it's composed by Mega Drive (Also did Hotline Miami). The sound effects in game though aren't that good. Some of the voice acting is incredibly bad.  The game has co op but there's a big problem. The game is already dead so if you do buy it be prepared to either get friends who play the game or play solo which get's boring really quickly.   You can choose how long do you want the matches to be. But the best decision is to make the matches four waves long as it doesn't last too long and it's just the right amount of time.   I didn't encounter any bugs while playing the game. There is a minor problem where sometimes my character wouldn't do a spell even though I had enough mana.  Overall Bloodsports.TV is a really good idea and the execution is really good, but the game is dead and playing Solo isn't that fun. I do suggest trying the game if you have friends who play it or you don't mind playing solo. I give Bloodsports.TV a 7/10",

However someway through a co-op game each of us start lagging out and dropping from the session like flies (despite all having decent internet connections), trying to re-join mid-session just greets you with an endless loading screen while still being able to hear the action as if you're in the game.  We tried for a good 2 hours and couldn't all stay in a game together for more than 10 minutes. Which really saddened me, especially now that I've since found out the game has basically been abandoned so we have no chance of getting that particular bug fixed.  As a single player game, it probably works flawlessly - but try to play with your friends and what feels like an excellently unique and fun co-op moba-brawler, will start to feel like a complete waste of your time.",
