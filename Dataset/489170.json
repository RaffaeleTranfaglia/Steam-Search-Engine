Pros: ++ Great ideas! you need to consider your ship's position and angle, in need to fire laser or torpedo, or in need to avoid body damage. + Good graphics and musics. + No in-app purchase items. + Not expensive actually.  Cons: -- UI is designed for mobile, so it's uncomfortable for PC. - Bad documents, both in Chinese and English. - Needs more hardware optimizations.",

            "review_text": "Always loved Space Gaming, However, I'm more of a First-Person flyer.   This Space Battling game is more of a Top Down type a game, with Weapon Upgrades and Engine upgrades, In fact, you can upgrade virtual anything.  Win other ships in a fight, Some really nice Graphics, Though I'm not keen on the Textures when ships explode, The close up view makes It look Cheap and Tacky, Please try fixing the Graphical look and feel of explosions.  If you love Gaming in Space, Then go for it, It's a great Game and Personally, I was surprised I really started to like it.  Get It, If you don't like what you play, Then just get a Refund, Easy as that and you lost nothing and Gained knowledge about the Game.  MORE '' DLC '' HD TEXTURES, SHIP TYPES, WEAPONS PACKS ETC.",

            "review_text": "Mobile(Free but epic grindy) Ported to PC(Epic grindy).  Simplistic Space Ship Battles that last anywhere from 5s to 5minutes per battle. If you are looking for in-depth tactical/strategic space battles with content and mind-blowing ship to ship action...this is not the game for you.   Lacking some content from the mobile ported game. ( Fewer by 5 ships available for use). 'Titan Ship Class' as a PAID DLC, as opposed to being 'free(grind to get for free)' on the mobile game.  Controls are non-optimized for PC, just a straight up port and whatever the hell as long devs make money.   For a game released on mobile and now in pc, the english makes me wanna slap myself. Plus a lot of ########## in some scenarios(unfinished texts). Lots of the game hints don't make sense( I think this is due to being translated from a different language to English)  On the plus side, it's a game where you don't need to use any brains. at all. Relaxing to play a few battles now and then, and just enjoy the gfx and ships exploding, although not for free, unlike mobile ersion).  Play the mobile version, you can get free 'gold' and 'khorium(2nd currency)' every few minutes by just force watching ads.  If you are looking for an intense ship-to-ship dakka dakka game, you are better off playing Battlefleet Gothic: Armada.",
