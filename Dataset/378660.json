A close point of comparison theme-wise for me are Heavy Rain and LA Noire, while True Detective seems to also be an inspiration for some quirkier ideas.   There's no open world or minigames here - we get the good old Telltale formula and its main strengths are characters, noir-dialogue gems and moody atmosphere. This first episode is short, but packs in quite a lot of content and twists to satisfy.The lead actor is the same as Geralt of Rivia. Try it, you'll like it!",

You play a retired cop in a dieselpunk alternate history who gets pulled back into a case, and it's a bloody one. As appears to be the norm with these sorts of games, the controls are absolutely wretched. It's particularly bad in this game due to certain sequences where you need to be very precise; be prepared to spend ages playing the accordion on WASD and randomly waving your mouse around trying to get your crosshair in the sweet spot. If the controls don't make you rage-quit first, you'll enjoy a fairly interesting storyline and an inspired take on the hard-boiled Frank Miller aesthetic. Certainly worth giving the first episode a shot if you're into detective stories or urban fantasy. I'll be getting the season pack.",

From the first episode that I have played all I can say is that if you enjoy games like Telltale where you have to wait for the next episodes to come out like a tv show you will love it. This like Telltale gives you the option to say whatever you want through 2-4 choices. The graphics may not be Unreal Engine 4 material, but it brings something else to the table that most games don't. It's only colors can be seen is in black, white and red. The art style is really cool and nicely detailed. This game is a game where your not fully into it because of the beginning but, in the middle or towards the end. In which I felt the same way watching Breaking Bad. It felt a little slow in the beginning but, it picked up after things started to make sense. Once you learn the plot and character along side the setting you will be more then just hooked on this game. The beginning is slow for a reason and a good one too. I saw this the first day it started to sell on steam. I checked it out then bought it earlier today. All I can say is that this game has a nice story to follow along to and it will get more interesting as the other episodes come out. The good thing out of this game was now I can say I spent my money well and can't wait for the future of this game. Good job to “A Crowd of Monsters” and Yes I definitly suggest that you should buy “Blues and Bullets” not just episode 1 but, the complete season.",

The story was very engaging and was the equivalent of a book that makes you keep saying 'one more page'. The voice acting, in my opinion, was very good, the added gameplay elements other than just dialouge selection were an added bonus, the music was incredibly well done, visually I think the game is beautiful, and for the most part the animations were fantastic.  The only real quarrals I have with the game is that some of the animations (mainly facial) could have been done a little better. I also felt like the base movement speed for your character is a little slow. I can't imagine anybody walks that slow in real life, however there is a button for a 'jog' which helps but there are portions of the game where you're forced to walk at his slow speed.  Overall I really enjoyed the first episode and like I said I can't wait for the other episodes to actually be released because I like where the story is going. I'd also like to add that the game reminded me of the movie Sin City so if you like that movie you'll probably enjoy this. So finally my actual rating for the first episode would be a solid 9/10 I highly recommend checking this episodic game out!",

The story starts the setup with the quintessential noir setup, but if you aren't familiar with the tropes, don't worry. Even if you are, things get a little different. This game has a few flaws, including the semi-locked camera angle, mistimed dialogue with character animation and some of the quick-time events are a little too quick. But these are minor gripes, with solid acting, gorgeous animation, and decent writing. But above all, the soundtrack really gets you. Definitely looking forward to seeing this game evolve.",

Noir adventures are my jam but even if you aren't a fan of the genre I'd recommend this for the incredible graphics, music and story. The game starts off in a suspenseful situation and you're given the whole timed decision consequence scenario that is well known among Tell Tale games. Though I haven't really seen any deviation in how the story plays out through different choices. The story plays out rather quickly as you can be in a calm conversation in one episode then thrust into a fight some couple minutes later.   There's a few gun fights that play out simply in an aim and shoot, also featured are a few quick time action events. And if by chance you do happen to die the game is very forgiving and restarts right before the event. In addition there are also detective-esque moments where you will have to piece together what happened at a crime scene. There isn't any side quest deviation but you do have branching paths of Eliot Ness and another individual which slowly become connected.  Despite the monotone graphic style with sparing use of red there are incredibly detailed and vibrant environments.The episode played out in just over 2 hours and the game does leave you at a bit of a cliffhanger at the end but it gives you enough stuff packed in the episode so that it's never boring. The music and voice acting also does a great job of getting into the feel of the era. It's as polished a game as you would expect from any of the top tier developers. I did experience a little bit of lag at certain areas but nothing that hindered my playing too much. With the intriguing plot this game and stunning visuals you'll be happy about trying this one.",

Some of the character animations can be a little rough, and the facial expressions inparticular look a bit dated, but overall it's an enjoyable, immersive, dark story. It is episodic however, and as of 11/22/2015 only one episode has been released thus far. The release timeline of further episodes seems a bit slow..",

Ocassionally it feels like a mouse look option would be nice.  When you get game badge cards etc awarded through steam it killed the game a couple of times for me. Not a big issue though as it only happened on auto save points anyways, so I lost only a few seconds to reload the game and that was maybe down to my hardware not just the game.  On the PLUS points...........  If you like LA Noire this has definitely taken a huge influence from that game. The puzzles are a lot easier and more linear.... For me that did not matter and for this game was probably a bonus. The reason why is that this game is also a lot like Tell Tale games. You are playing through a set story. Whilst there are choices to make its really just about the quality of the story telling and the story in this game.   For those who have seen the untouchables or know about Al Capone and Elliot Ness the alternate history of them working togtether should be a very appealing storyline in it self.  Graphically its like playing your way through Sin City and anybody who dosnt like that idea must be not just colour blind but BLIND! Its done extremely well.   The voice acting is great and soundtrack fits the feel of the game immensly well.  I bought episode 1 on sale for £1.99 and it took around 2 hours to finish on a casual play through with a couple of beers and a glass of good whisky....... Money well spent I felt like I was playing a £30 title and cant wait for the next episode.  Overall I'd give this 9 out 10. Extremely suprised by the overall quality and finish of this game.   Try it , especially while its on sale for £1.99 its a no brainer, enjoy :-)",

The dev claimed that the development is still going on, but the lack of communication from the dev (at least give us an ETA) making me disappointed.  Thank God, I got full refund from Steam.

It makes clever use of a crime board as your evidence map, complete with pins and string to show links. It has elements of L.A. Noire and other Film Noir Genre games.  It is a dark, gritty interactive detective comic with an art style reminiscient of old detective comics in the black and white, with colour thrown in occasionally to show important things like blood and fire. Help Al Capone find his granddaughter in the aftermath of his incarceration, whilst using contacts in the police and new contacts in the mafia.

            "review_text": "Okay so to start of this review let's just say that I originally thought 'Eh once you've played a telltale game you've played all there is to play of this genre.'. Well if I had a time machine and duct tape I would go back in time to that moment and tape my mouth shut. This game is a story telling masterpiece thus far, Episode 1 left me wanting more with it's unique twists and turns. Now with all of the things this game gets right it does get some things wrong so lets talk about those the first thing is the graphics/optimization. This game runs on the unity engine and that probably wasn't the best choice, but even in light of that fact it looks decent. The only problem is that if you're like me and have a 4k monitor you aren't going to be able to play it in 4k resolution. I'm sure that the devs are working to better optimize this game, but as of this review that is a problem. Another slight problem is the camera and the controls the camera is fixed and this is fine, but sometimes it causes the controls to act and feel a bit clunky there was one section in episode one at the docks where the camera bugged and it caused the main character that you control to walk backwards (Even though I was pressing the walk forwards key) until he got unstuck. Like I said the problems that exist are small and easily dealt with, but I feel like they are worth mentioning. Last thing I'll mention in this game is the art design even on the dinky 1920 x 1080p resolution I'm playing it on, the greyscale/monochrome (there are some reds but mostly black and white) is just beautiful the overall art design in this game is fantastic, but at the same time I feel that it's held back immensely due to the unity engine. other last thing (I lied in the last sentence) I feel that it's worth mentioning that this game does a better job in my opinion than telltale does in providing some in between options for some of the necessary choices in the game and I like that and I think telltale could (To quote telltale's the walking dead season 1) take a page out of Blues and Bullets' book. So to wrap this up I don't recommend many games, but if you're like me and are truly obsessed with the Noire genre and pay more attention to story rather than graphics I would reccomend buying this game.",

            "review_text": "I loved the first 2 episodes of this game. The story has been amazing so far, it offers a unique story with twists and turns and the use of historical entities in a fantasy scenario has been fun. The black and white with red works well with the setting of the game and graphically I love the style they used. The voice acting is pretty decent too. Gameplay is fairly similar to something like the TellTale series, where it has limited options and controls. But it's still a fun game and the story and art style keeps me glued to the game until I binge the entire episode in one sitting.  With all of these GREAT elements though lies a HUGE issue... You may never get to finish the story. Episode releases are near non-existent, with one every 6 months or so. I loved the game so much that I could have lived with this, if only the devs would keep us updated. But the devs lack of communication have made me think that this game is most likely abandon or in limbo now with rumors that some of the artists ect. have left the team. I got so frustrated and felt ripped off that I asked for a refund on my season pass and after alot of scratching and clawing with Steam support finally got one...  If you want to start a fairly decent game with an interesting story and graphical scheme and don't mind that you may never get to finish the story... It might be worth checking out, because I have enjoyed the first 2 episodes. But if you do get it, personally I'd suggest getting just episode 1 and episode 2, avoid the season pass atleast until more episodes are released because at this point there's a chance that you'll never see the final 3 episodes.",
