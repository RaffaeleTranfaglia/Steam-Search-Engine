While funny, the main gameplay is simply too easy to be too much fun. The reason I recommend the game is for the 'tower defense-esque' mini game, which you can go back and play after you are done with the main campaign (sort of like getting 3 stars on each level for Angry Birds). There are quite a number of levels to attempt to master, and I found this very satisfying.  ",
