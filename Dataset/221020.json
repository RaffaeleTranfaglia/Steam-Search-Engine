    "description": "The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. In Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?",

            "review_text": "I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam. I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.  The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.  The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.   Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own.   The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.  The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.  Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.",

Character pathing is problematic at best, and the UI is generally wothless and confusing. You would expect that a game with graphics this bad would make up for it in other areas like gameplay. NOPE! Just another attempt yo grab your money with little to no concern for you as a consumer.",

            "review_text": "Edited at version 14d, in which development seemed to have a heartbeat again.  The new update brings some cool new features, namely terraforming. This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their ♥♥♥ and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.   Man, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.    ---ORIGINAL---  I entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.  Boy was I wrong.  If you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start?   The early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck.   Lack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.",

            "review_text": "Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..  1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob.  2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore. 3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause.. 4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone.  5. Bugs. 6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.  All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit.   Really disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product. It's made me more cynical about buying into alphas, which isn't a good thing to be, either, I guess.   Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.",

            "review_text": "The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.  The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.  The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.  The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.  You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.  Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.  Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.  If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try  Gnomoria . It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.",

There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing. I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away. Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them. The game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs. They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage. There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears. Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.  Don't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.

Years ago, this game was fun. Nothing in this game hadn't been done before, but it brought a lot of things together in an enjoyable package, and new content was being brought out that added facets to the idea of managing a town catering to adventurers and trying to survive the dangers of a D&amp;D world. Now, the game is exactly the same. That's the problem; the end of Towns' beta came purely because the dev wanted more sales for less work.  It's really too bad that the development of this game became something of a hot potato due to fewer sales than the original developer wanted. Towns was developing in an interesting direction, and at the end of the updates had started introducing some enjoyably complicated ways to use basic water channels to make tasks easier. However, it never got to a fully mature stage, instead slowly petering out with updates being smaller and much less often. Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.  A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?  My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most. Something to stick on the wishlist and pick up during a steam sale.",

You need to establish a food and resource hub so you can build a bigger city and get more 'Townies' as they're called, then dig underground, build a tavern, attract some heroes, and dig deeper for better resources.  The goal of the game isn't to reach some unknown boss. I'm not even sure there is an endgame with Towns. I never reached the maximum depth because I never held it as a main objective. I played this game because I have a god complex and want to create a thriving city and watch my citizens thrive by my grace and strategic expertise.  The sieges are kind of a joke, but they're a good source of spiderite and goo. My only wish is that the devs went more in depth with the town defense aspect of this game, but it's no big deal. I have ~100hrs in this game, so I think I got my money's worth.  Personally, I don't understand all the backlash this game got. I got this game on sale roughly a year and a half ago for ~2.50(?). Worth every penny, given my playtime. I'm pretty sure if I knew how much time I'd spend playing it, I'd drop 10 bucks on it in a heartbeat.  I think a lot of the anger has to do with entitlement. Games in this genre now adays (legos with monsters: DF, Minecraft, Terraria) are being released as full games, and the devs are devoted enough to the games to continue to release content. I don't think Towns needs to release more content. I think it's fine how it is. Some people may not think it's worth 10 bucks. To me, it is, but I'm 100% certain it's worth at least 5. Then again, I didn't enter this expecting updates. They appear more as a pleasant surprise for me.",

            "review_text": "This deserves deeper analysis that I'm about to give it, but this is one of my favorite 'small game' experiences as of late. When describing Towns to people, I decided it was like telling 10 people how to play minecraft… but without the patterned crafting. So much of minecraft is lived in telling someone where to put something in a 3x3 grid, but in towns you just say 'Go make a wooden sword' and they must goto the wiki on their own and look it up.  Towns places you in the traditional omniscient 3rd person viewing angle that Christ himself enjoys. You get a randomly generated world with 11 citizens of your 'Town'. You drop orders for what to do, and the citizens go do it. Chop down all these trees I've moused over. Harvest this apple tree. Build this wall. Dig this tunnel. Oh crap, there's spiders in that tunnel. No, no don't die… run away… crap.  And then you start a new game and realize there's much more you need to do before you plumb the depths of your little block world.  Towns is an impressively deep game where it does not appear to be on the surface. I mean that literally as well as figuratively as while at the surface of the game it's about Townsperson happiness management (oh yea, they need to be happy, not over worked and if you can manage that, you'll get more people showing up in town… that's an important mechanic that I didn't think of until now… see… deep) and setting up replenishable resources so everyone doesn't starve and you've got plenty of wood for that epic barbarian castle you just dreamt up. Dig down only a couple layers and there's combat to be had. Not super impressive combat, just your people wiggling at the beast until one of them makes this strange death noise. You can't control the combat at all. Soldiers can be designated, even set on patrol routes, but they intervene somewhat rarely which makes taking them off labor to just stand around with the best sword you've made so far a little useless.  Again, this game goes so much deeper than I'm giving it credit for in this review… suffice to say, it's quite enjoyable. If you like economy heavy RTS, dwarf-likes or civilization games give it a whirl. I recommend buy-in at $10, but that's only because it's a little bit of a gamble as to wether you'll like it. I'd be willing to give this game $25, but that's knowing how much I enjoy it after playing it for hours.  4 Visuals 8 Gameplay 8 Slant  Overall : 67",

It's pretty fun for the money, and you'll get pretty engaged managing your little town. It has a lot of complexity, but not very accessible... be prepared for a little front loading on tutorials. The features are a bit haphazardly put together, but you can still cobble together a pretty good experience out of it.   The tragedy here is that the developer quit working on the game before it was completed. In all honesty, I wish Towns had been where it is now when it was put up for early access. Developers calling it quits or settling for 'almost good enough' is getting pretty tiring in the independant market.",

The tutorial is utter crap at the moment in time I'm writing this, so don't depend on it, I'd just watch a few YouTube Playthroughs, as that's how I learned how to play it.

I haven't played it since like 2 years ago, but I have to admit I liked it when I played it, despite its unfinished-ness and bugs. Like, there's Dwarf Fortress, then there's Gnomoria, which is DF-lite, and then there's Towns, which is Gnomoria-lite. Relatively easy to play and fun to build up your little town.

            "review_text": "[EDIT] Holy crap they released a patch Apr 2014 and are taking suggestions for v15. It's alive!  Objectively, the reviews below saying 'not recommended' are correct. The game is really not finished, and given it has an development for many years, and has not seen an update in a while, and the developer statement that he is 'burned out', I would not expect any more updates.  With that said, I still spent an enjoyable month or so playing this game. Coming from Dwarf Fortress and wanting something a little prettier, this game provides a nice twist on the genre, rather than mining you 'dig too deep' by hiring heroes who explore dungeons.  It provides an interesting and detailed tech tree, one of the best workshop designs I have seen in any such game (you place zones for workshops and then crafting stations within zones).  That said, I am obsessed with this genre and desperate for other games in it. If you want to try something like this but with active development and far more polished, I highly recommend Gnomoria (and keeping an eye on Stonehearth and Clockwork Empires).  I would still recommend this game, although given it is unlikely to see any updates I would personally want to see the price knocked down a little given its incomplete state.  I really hope the new developer breathes new life into this game, but I feel like once the game gets into a negative feedback cycle developers have little incentive to do so -- when everyone is panning your game on Steam and no updates have been released for a year and a half, what is your incentive to continue working on it?  Even if you decide not to buy, I would keep an eye on this game just in case things change.This game has a tremendous amount of potential, and is farther long than many games in the genre.",

Setting up a thriving town in this game is a real uphill battle, with so many things that can go wrong and things that can just tear your barely-surviving town apart. When you get new settlers to arrive at the map borders, it's also a challenge to make sure they can get to town safely. However, the more you fight and the more you work, the stronger your villagers will become, and the better they can survive in the harsh wilderness. It's a real satisfying feeling to beat the odds and set up a thriving community in this game... and then the seiges and the werepigs come in and wreck your day...  If you can pick this game up for about $5 or less during a sale or something (or you preferrably have ways to get it for free), I'd say it's worth looking into. Nothing mind-blowing, but a decent time-waster nonetheless.",

Let's just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example... You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.
