            "review_text": "A simple and basic strategy defense game. You start with a core building and build towers off of it. I don't think it's an amazing game but I don't think it deserves such a bad rating.  Some basic tips (use as needed; one strategy won't solve all levels): * The plain structures are money-generating ones, so it's like an investment for more cash later on. If you make too many money towers, they'll get destroyed because you don't have enough early defense. Make too little, and you won't survive the later waves. Some levels require little/no money towers, other levels need lots. * It's usually a bad idea to make tall towers because once a structure is taken down, everything further along is destroyed as well. Maybe there's a bonus but I didn't look into it. * You can even let your core absorb hits to save your structures when you have the healing structure. * The mine tower deals a lot of damage but limited range so some enemies will be able to attack from out of range. For example, in boss 1, if you make a horizontal line of mine towers and nothing above, the boss will stay in range of them. * If your cash rate is high enough against certain enemies/bosses that instakill a structure, you can keep building your cheapest structure as fodder for every attack. * You can build things underground and they're relatively safe but also don't protect your core.  I'm not good at real RTSs (like Starcraft, etc.) so I'm surprised a lot of reviewers had a hard time figuring out how to win. Once you figure out the towers and get the basic strategy down, most levels aren't as impossible as people think. If you're stuck on a level, you can just skip it: you can play any level of all the worlds immediately. I played my 1.5 hours and cleared most of the levels and all of the bosses. I don't care about score attack but that may appeal to some people for replayability. It may look pretty casual and the system is very basic but it can be a pretty challenging game that requires a certain level of strategy and luck to complete.",

It's not a bad game at all, but it has nothing special to offer over other tower defenses avaiable here.  If you wanna try out anyway, or if you're a achievement hunter, buy it for, at least, -80% or something, or in a bundle. This game will NEVER worth the full price.",

The game gets old after about 20 minutes due to repetition.  -No statistics or other indepth mechanics presented. It seems like the different room types have different amounts of HP, but how much?   All you do is stack different room types onto a building to 'protect' it. Some room types shoot, others just generate cash for you faster (and can be used as a meat shield of sorts), etc. A lot could have been done with the room types, but playing halfway into world 2 you basically have heal rooms, gun rooms, and cash rooms....cheap and expensive varieties, of course.   Very bland.",

It doesn't feel like I'm thinking and coming up with a strategy, bad rather desperately spamming whatever I have available and just hoping that luck favors me. The way resource gains are set up if you fall behind even slightly, you will not be able to catch up. Since enemies come at you fast and unpredictably and your healing is unreliable, one unlucky enemy attack will pretty much cause you to fail the level. I feel like if the game were set at a much slower pace, with less flimsy structures and a greater emphasis on planning, it could really work. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  There's a good core idea in here, but the execution is lacking.",

I've always been akin to tower defense games because I enjoy the increasing difficulty they bring with them and they force you to strategize. Bad Hotel takes this and adds a bit of flair by introducing music/beats according to what towers you build and the amount of them. This sounds like it should be a pretty interesting combo but sadly there are some flaws.  My biggest problem with the game was that there seemed to be absolutely no progression in difficulty. One level would be super easy and the next would be near impossible to beat unless you built it exactly as needed and had a bit of luck on your side. Maybe it is because of this that you needn't beat all the levels in a world to take on the boss; thankfully people who don't want to put up with the frustration of the insane difficulty curves can grab all the achievements due to this feature. There's just not enough customization (such as upgrading towers or branching levels of advancement such as in Bloons) to keep the game interesting.  If you're a glutton for challenge and love music then this game should be right up your alley. I give it a 6/10 because of my love for TDs and some ingenuity on the maker's part.",
