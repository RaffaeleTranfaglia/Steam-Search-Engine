            "review_text": "This game has some positives and negatives just like other games.   Positives:  It's a well made game The idea is cool Creepy  Negatives: The hands at the beginning.  Sometimes he kills you right away, but sometimes he takes you to the execution room where, after a long wait, he kills you. I'm not sure if it's even possible to get away from him with sprinting. The tesseract is a cool idea, but is annoying. Once I got to where it turned blue I couldn't get the door to open, no matter what I looked at, plus you move slower. It's like he has superhuman abilities, he can see you when you can't see him, you can't hear his footsteps. If you have your flashlight off, that should make it harder for him to find you, but it seems he finds you easier with it off.   I know there's a ton more negative than positive, but it's still fun to play. ",

The instant I booted up this game, dare I call it that, experience, I knew my life was at a cross road. It was at that point I realized that two roads layed before me. I could have continued living the lie of life that is life without Deliverance, or I could choose the path of redemption, the path of our glorious naked white grown fetus man serial killer. I chose the later, and since then, I've cured cancer, polio, down syndrome, and of course, erectile dysfunction. Deliverance has become part of my family since then. The games manifestation is watching over me on those always lonely nights, it delivered my newborn child, (who turns out to have also been a genetic cross of Barack Obama, Adolf Hitler, and Nelson Mandela), it even told me that drinking, wont solve all my problems, only some of them. Without Deliverance, I would not be the (Wo)man I am today. And to think, it all started with the ripping of my cervix.....",
