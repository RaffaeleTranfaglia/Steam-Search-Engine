            "review_text": "Don't let the rough, low-fi graphics fool you. This game has a soul of cast iron. A fast, twitchy shmup in the vein of Cave's best, but with a focus on branching progression (Clear levels fast and efficiently and more routes poen up) and dynamic difficulty. Stay alive and kill quickly and the game gets harder, with bullet patterns becoming more complex and enemies getting new powers. Thankfully, taking hits, using smartbombs or (ithe absolute worst) losing a life will drop things back down to something more manageable.  Even a crusty old coot like me managed to get the most basic ending after a few tries, although I've barely scratched the surface of what the game offers.  A single playthrough of this should clock in at around 25-30 minutes, but if you want to see all 15 stages and unlock every ship? you're going to have to play this A LOT.",
