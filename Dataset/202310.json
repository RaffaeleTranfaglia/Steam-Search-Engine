            "review_text": "Its not a ridge racer game. Its burnout meets trackmania without a clear focus. The game is based around beautiful destruction physics but in order to destroy other cars, you need to drift, chase, or destroy items. Destroying items is worthless since you get a fraction of the boost needed, so you tend to be drifting a lot.  However the ai just gains boost at a steady pace, meaning they will just boost whenever their meter is full. The boost itself is odd, its designed around strategic use to either power through a corner, destroy a city target to get more speed/shortcuts, or take out a racer but instead the game requires you to be constantly boosting in order to keep up. As well, there are no mechanics to allow players to catch up. None of the short cuts drastically change the map and the leader can use his boost to open it up anyways so there is no way for someone behind him to catch up unless he messes up.  Given the nature boost is gained, the late game is also to the favor of the leader as there are less targets available and players are more spread out.   Combat is also weird. There are no rewards for damaging cars, and you don't get boost if you frag someone in a special way ala burnout. Also unlike later burnout entries, there is only one type of car per race. As a result, cars with good acceleration and speed trump all else since they can drift fine and use boost to make up for any lose of speed.  The game does have one very interesting part and thats the special events. These include some trackmania esque maps where you have to get to the finish line while hitting targets.   But what sells the game to me is the sense of destruction. The objects you destroy remain on the track making the track feel more and more wartorn and whenever you destroy a car you see an amazing slow motion view of it bouncing. It never got old for me.  As for the default levels, they are pretty generic and some end up being confusing since they reuse prefabs in an unusual way. The events aren't always balanced, either, some will prove to be a pain since you just don't have the right car for it or others are so easy because you can use a car that the level wasn't balanced for.  The star is the player-made levels, of which there are tons, which use the ingame editor and allow for a nice variety of fun and bizarre levels. The game to me seems like a case where there was a pre-existing game that was adapted with the ridge racer brand and then rushed into development.  I say get the game if you like arcade destruction racing , the 10 dollar price tag is appropiate but with games like carmageddon and NCG, there are more focused alternatives.",

            "review_text": "It's criminal that this game has so many negative reviews so I guess I'll throw my opinion in the mix. This is a unique, skillful, strategic racing game with quite a bit of challenging single player content.  Just about all of the negative reviews don't seem to get it. The game is hard. It's not instant satisfaction win-first-try run of the mill garbage. You have to play races multiple times, build a route and create a plan on how to win: manipulating the AI so you stay out of their way when you need to, and exploit them when you can. On some tracks I would even start over multiple times just to get a solid start on the first corner of a lap.  If I had to knock it for anything, it's that the car balance isn't the best. It's not bad, but sometimes you will unlock a car later that makes previous tracks easier. So, it can be frustrating (but also fun) to try to beat a track over and over only to have it get retroactively easier due to an unlock.",

            "review_text": "Ridge Racer has a baby with Burnout ?  The 2012 released racing game Ridge Racer Unbounded is about the opposite of the previous releases. It features a more arcade-like feeling other than realism and introduces new features such as: -Different modes (races, drifting, obstacle courses, juggernaut) -Destructible environment -Destructible vehicles -Dominance system -New cars, tracks, music and so on  Some of these features are quite fun and fit well to the game while the destructible environment for example feels pretty wierd as in the beginning you don't really know if the wall you are about to crash into is destructible or not. Now I want to highlight the pros and cons of the game.  Pros: -Good graphics ( released in 2012 ) -Stable framerate -Fun gameplay -A lot of different cars and tracks to explore -Accessible shortcuts that need to be 'destroyed' -Takedown system   Cons: -No more multiplayer ( servers got shut down ) -Randomly occuring errors when leaving a race or tabbing out -Cars taking you over meters before the finish though you are on maximum speed -Extremely sensible drifting that sometimes sends you flying somewhere -No tutorial  All in all this is a very enjoable game, especially for the price of 10€. I would recommend this game to all lovers of arcade racing games such as Burnout, Flatout, Split Second Velocity, Blur and Need for Speed. The others should probably look for a more realistic game. 7/10",

You just need a bit of luck and experience. There are 4 different game modes which are all equally fun. The track editor works well. However there are limitation to what you can do. At the end of the day all tracks look the same.  The graphics are good and runs smoothly than most racing games on a PC. There is no issues with frame rate even on low end PCs. It almost feels you are playing the game on an emulator.  The sound effects are average. The destruction effects are good, but the cars are not. They repetitively go up in gears even at top speed. This can get annoying after a while. The soundtrack is brilliant and is worth having on during play at all times.  This is a game not to take too seriously. It is good fun and made well. Therefore I do recommend it, but only just and only on a deal.",

I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.",

It's a fun game so despite it's flaws, I can't say don't buy it, but at the same time it has a ton of problems that make it hard to recommend.   To start, it's a really fun super arcade-ish experience. A budget Burnout clone that is more Burnout than what we got with Paradise. But that is also a negative, since Ridge Racer was noting like Burnout, making this a very poorly executed Ridge Racer game. For better or worse, it's just not faithful to the license.   The game also suffers from some poor design decisions. The MP servers were shutdown, but each time you launch the game, you have to wait for 2 full mins while the game attempts to connect to those now non-existent servers. This gets really annoying over time as the game also crashes more often than I'd consider reasonable.  But on the flip side, the game has some amazingly well designed tracks and set-pieces that make for some tense and compelling action that really suck you into the chaotic fray.  All in all the game is a mixed bag. Almost a perfect 50 / 50 split between “this is amazing, I want to play this forever” and “this game is so broken it boarders on unplayable and should be pulled from Steam”, it's a bi-polar hodgepodge of awesome and awful.  I guess I'll give it the thumbs up, and say grab it on a deep discount, but just know, it's definitely a roll of the dice and extremely flawed. For every minute of fun, you'll suffer a minute of mysery.",
