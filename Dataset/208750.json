I logged into steam, saw this game on sale, and resigned myself to buying it.  It was amazing.  Media accurately depicting the Greek Gods is hard to find, and doubly so for video games. 'Someone is god of the wrong thing' is a square on my mythology movie bingo card. But Apotheon completely nails everything. This game wasn't written by people who read through a couple wikipedia pages and called it day; literally everything about the Gods is correct, from their attitudes to their ironic demise, and even their allegences. One of the most telling moments was having Dionysus on the side of humanity; someone who'd only done cursory research wouldn't know that he'd lived among mortals for years before joining the gods.  And don't even get me started on the art. This game is one of the most beautiful things I've ever played. Everything is stylized perfectly down to the creases in a character's chiton, and the color changes in the different realms are beautiful and perfectly fit the tone of the area. The architecture is accurate, as are the items and decorations. The NPC dialogue and major themes of the story even parallel important values of Ancient Greek life.  Basically: the devs for this game researched the hell out of Ancient Greece, and I kind of want to kiss every one of them for it. 10/10.",

There are heaps of boss fights and each level provides something unique to the world. I'm happy that not only does this game look amazing, they've spent a lot of time on the levels and is a complete game.  Combat is not hack and slash. You are going to need to block and time your attacks, and can get challenging at parts. Almost like a 2D Dark Souls. Except without the punishing difficulty because it still lets you Quick Save. (Although there are difficulty options that can make it way way harder for those that like that)  So other things that make this game awesome: + Fun challenging combat becoming more satisfying as you grow stronger. ENDING IS GREAT + Switch between weapons easily, carry more than 10+ weapons at a time because why not. + Weapons break after too much use, which forces you to rethink your combat strategies. Keeps the game fresh. + Works great with Keyboard + Mouse, gamepad works fine too. I decided to use Keyboard and Mouse as I prefer the precision of a mouse when using long range weapons. + Quick Saves, and multiple save slots.  Things missing for me,  - NEWGAME+ mode would be great  - Greek Language voice audio would complete the immersion.  Thank you AlienTrap for this fantastic game. I wish there were more games with Ancient Greek Mythology.",

I've played a few hours of the campaign mode so far, and it's fun. Cool weapons, bloody kills, fluid movement, beautiful artwork and sound. Also - YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR WEAPONS which is a good laugh, especially when they connect with a dude's neck.  I've been streaming a few hours of gameplay on  twitch.tv/w0lfrock  if you haven't seen any Let's Play video yet.  Using an xbox360 controller and the controller support is good. I can see how using a mouse / keyboard would be a little easier with aiming, but I'm happy using a controller.  Local arena mode is a little like Nidhogg, but with a variety of weapons and boulders. The arena mode is NOT ONLINE, which would be awesome if they had it but would probably add quite a bit to the dev budget.   Solid game, easily worth it at full price. Especially if you're buying it in CDN$ (Steam games are cheaper in Canada right now than in the USA because of the horrible exchange rate, shhhh!)",

            "review_text": "I have finished the game, and let me tell you, I really liked it. This game is the epitome of an indie quality product. The amount of inmertion thanks to the background music and, of course, the outstanding artstyle, makes this a game worth trying. I took 10 hours, wich for the price of this game, is pretty fair. Also, I haven't done all of the game's 'sidequests', so I still have more to do.  Something important that I didn't expect from this game (because it isn't stated anywhere in the store page) was the fact that it's open world, therefore, those 'sidequests' exists. Altough some are just are kind of dull, they give a change of pace to the game if the player ever wishes for one. But either way, the game changes the pace by itself. For example, getting to Athena is very diferent from getting to Poseidon. And in a related topic, let me tell you, I was surprised by the amount of creativity that the boss fights have   +Pros  1.-THE ARTSTYLE. You can see that the artstyle is not only unique, but well crafted and incredible. It's what convinced me to buy the game, and I wasn't dissapointed. You really feel like you are one big piece of ancient art, and it's amazing. 2.-Greek mythology. Many games think that just because God of war succeeded with Greek mythology, it's easy to abuse it. That has been proven wrong. But in this case, they nailed it perfectly. 3.-The controls. They are very responsive, and once you get a hold of the weapons, you find your own fighting style naturally.  4.-Level design. Once you finish the first level (which works as a good, non-boring tutorial) they give you a bit of freedom to do as you please (but thread carefully). In the levels themselves, the enemies feel in place, and the moments without combat generally serve a purpose, and last just long enough. 5.-Boss fights. If you are like me, and like a good, creative, brutal and old-fashioned fight against a mighty, fearsome and satisfying enemy, then this is the game for you. The classic feeling stays there even with the large amount of creativity that most boss fights have. Rarely are two boss fight the same, or even simlar, which is impresive. 6.-Pace of the game. The 'tutorial' is fun, and gives a good taste of what's to come. The difficulty curve is very smooth (unless you try to go too crazy and go, for example, to Hades before Apollo, you may have a bit of trouble). And as I said before, every boss is different, and also the common enemies tend to vary, so you must change strategies from time to time. This prevents the game for getting tedious at all times.   -Cons  1.-Hitboxes. Sometimes you are sure you hit somebody (or that you got hit) but nothing happens. If youlike close combat, you may find a strange and maybe awkward combat situation now and then. And this is way more common that it should. Most times it is actually funny, but when the game gets harder, it might end in a frustrating moment. 2.- Map design. It's not bad by any means, just that sometimes is a little too simple, and relies on changing 'areas' to keep the flow of the game. The again, the inmersion of the game makes it hard to noctice sometimes.   Veredict:  9/10  Highly recomended.  A fine piece of an indie game at a low price, with an artstyle that has never been seen. The fun factor is always present in this enjoyable experience.",

            "review_text": "Recently I've been looking for less graphics-intensive games to play on my mac laptop. I wanted something fun with cool artwork that would look pretty on my retina display and this game knocks it out of the park. The ancient Greek style artwork is really cool and well done, while the gameplay is exciting and addicting. I really did not expect to like games such as this (2D, platforming, sidescroller) because I mainly game on my desktop and play all of the huge, popular RPG's and action adventure games. But I'm really glad I gave this a shot so that I can game on my laptop when not at home. Apotheon is great and I look forward to playing more games like it.  **Update post completion of game  In my initial review I focused mainly on the pretty graphics and artwork and the fact that I could play this on my macbook, which in my opinion is not intended for gaming. Now that I have finished the game, I thought it warranted a second review of the gameplay and story.  As stated before, this game exceeded expectations. The gameplay, while simple, is subtly complex in ways that I did not realize until I was further into story. My favorite thing about this game is that it has many of the classic action-rpg elements, albeit a slightly simplified version. There are a variety of weapons to find/use, including 'special' weapons for which you must complete side quests that are not obligatory in the main story. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the game encourages the use of all weapons and items in order to overcome different enemies. Sometimes I found using a spear the best option as it gave me range when fighting multiple enemies, while other times I used swords or hammers for speed or damage. Sometimes, I would lay traps while luring enemies to their doom. Furthermore, all weapon damage can be upgraded using gold at weapon trainers in markets. Armor upgrades come with increased defense, as well as cosmetic changes. When I found the Strategos helm, a large Spartan type helmet, I was elated. You are also able to craft various items and use them to different effects. These range from a simple health potion or firebomb to summoning animals and the undead to fight alongside you. Finally, the movement in this game takes a little getting used to, but once comfortable is very fun. I found out late in the game that in the air you can press the dodge/roll button to do a front or backflip that came in very useful for avoiding projectiles and accessing hard-to-reach places.  As for the story I was pleasantly surprised. As far as plot, it is nothing new or unique but is still very well done. Whenever I beat bosses (typically greek gods) I felt a sense of badass-ness, and the final boss fight was as epic as I expected it to be from a mythic Greek hero story. I found the voice acting surprisingly good, which always elevates the story and game for me. Add in the beautiful art style and I was pretty impressed.   For a 2D sidescroller that I picked up for 15 bucks, this game was more complex and fun than I thought it would be. It provided me with 20+ hours of gaming, and a very fun experience. I highly recommend it whether you just want something to play on your non-gaming laptop or high-performance gaming rig.",

            "review_text": "I first encountered Apotheon through an article on IGN, and was immediately surprised that a developer had been both bold and creative enough to craft a game with such a distinct look. I soon purchased it and began playing in the company of my partner who, like me, is fairly interested in the history of art. To begin with then we were both positively biased towards it simply because of the art direction, and for most of our playthrough that was enough to keep us somewhat engaged. However, after making it through the majority of the game, our opinions had both turned towards frustration, and we decided to abandon the playthrough.  Needless to say, the presentational aspects of this game are top quality. It possesses a fantastically idiosyncratic visual aesthetic within the annals of gaming, and the animation imparts a sense of movement to the player-avatar and enemies that sits well within this aesthetic. Indeed, the game has a great sense of design unity between its gameplay, aesthetic and story elements that many games fail to achieve. What's more, the encroachment of cut-scenes and other non-interactive elements is pleasantly minimal.  Having said that, there are a few essential areas of design that are so disappointing that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend Apotheon. Firstly, if you are going to play it, do not use a keyboard and mouse configuration, as it renders the otherwise interestingly designed combat mechanics infuriating to use at times. Unfortunately, I was stuck using such a configuration for the majority of the playthrough as I had no access to a console controller, but I grinned and bore it as I recognised that the developers recommend the use of a gamepad. As others have also pointed out, both combat and traversal can sometimes seem floaty, and occasionally movement will glitch in irritating ways, but these are far from the designers’ biggest failings.  No, far less forgivable is the overall quality of game and level design. As a massive fan of Super Metroid, I expect certain standards to be met by Metroidvania titles. These include decent variety across level designs, a good degree of depth to exploration, and a reasonably high frequency of being surprised by what I encounter and uncover. Whereas other indie gems of recent years such as Cave Story, Guacamelee! and Axiom Verge triumphed in these regards, Apotheon severely lacks: level layouts are hugely uninspired and often seemed arbitrary; the breadth of discoverable items, treasure and upgrades is disappointingly limited; and there were next to no moments when I felt delighted, excited or impressed by a hidden/hard-to-find game element. By the time I reached the maelstrom of tedious traversal and bland level structuring that is the Poseidon portion of the game (no water-temple/IGN allusion intended), enough was enough.   In other regards the game wasn’t quite so disappointing. The narrative is suitably light and no more superficial than what I’ve experienced to be the general standard of game writing. However, unlike the visuals, the story-based elements did seem to lack ‘soul’, but I'm not the sort to be bothered by such things as long as the gameplay is well designed. In regards to audio, I recall not being induced to fits of unintended laughter or rage by the dialogue or voice acting - which is always a pleasant surprise given examples elsewhere in the industry - and I remember being suitably impressed by the semiotic aptness of the music.   Ultimately though, Apotheon lacks any great sense of charm or character outside of its aesthetic elements, and it doesn’t possess the level of game design polish or nuance its art direction seemingly suggests. The game is a triumph of visual style over gameplay substance, albeit in a way that differentiates it from AAA titles that could be described in the same way. Historically, it will likely become noteworthy for its experimentation with a unique visual design at a time when popular games were mostly polarized between pseudo-realistic hi-fidelity graphics and nostalgia-tugging pixel art. In the here-and-now though, if you're looking for something to scratch that 2D action-adventure game itch, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.",

So far I have less than 2 hours invested but they have been a fun two hours and I have enjoyed every minute.

My library is full of high-concept games that developers have obviously given up on, not up to the task of properly actualising the great idea.  I saw Apotheon when it first came out, and I thought 'beautiful, but I daresay that'll be it', and I ignored it. When in the steam sale it was something like £2.50, I thought 'why not...' How wrong I had been to judge and underestimate.  Everything is wonderful. The graphics are beautiful. The soundtrack is faultless, the voice-acting is brilliant. Level-design provides challenge but nothing is ridiculously difficult - it is well thought-out and achieveable.  Gameplay is very enjoyable - this is the most I've enjoyed a game in years, including games I've put dozens or hundreds of hours into. And as good as the gameplay is, it's made all the better by how much effort has gone into everything around it; as mentioned, the graphics, the soundtrack, the voice-acting... Everything works in unison to create something really special. Not to mention dozens and dozens of weapons to choose from, a nice level of customisation [tiered armour and several different top-tier helmets], sidequests...  There's niggles, but it's nothing truly annoying, just noticable - and nothing that isn't very fixable.  This is the game I would have given a foot to have played as a kid. I really can't believe something of this quality was so cheap in the sale.  I'm the worst sort of philhellene so this is a dream come true.

The game's got beautiful art and an impressive array of level design, with combat-heavy areas, puzzle-solving areas, exploration-based areas, some minor side quests, it's great. The story is pretty hands-off, but it works. Feels more like you are exploring and choosing where you want to go next, it's nice. There are tons of different weapons to use. I sort of wish the weapon drops were less plentiful, as I felt like I never had a shortage of weapons. In games where there is weapon degradation/breakage, you want to save the best weapons for after the crappy ones have broken, or for important parts. The crappy ones just keep coming though, so you never switch to the good ones when they run out, cause they don't. Bit of OCD annoyance there.  The one notable negative to the game is that the combat feels awkward. I think they designed it to seem realistic? There's no true combo system, making it an exchanging-blows affair in the end. However, you can zip around super fast, switch weapons super fast, but regardless of those unrealistic factors, the weapons never feel like you can wield them effectively in comparison. Slow clunky stabs/slashes, and the idea that you have to be a certain distance from an enemy (ie, if you're too close, it won't hit) with weapons like a spear ends up making combat awkward, especially against multiple opponents on the higher difficulty modes where you flinch when being hit. You get used to it after a while, but it's sort of aggravating. Moreover, there's a dodge roll, but no invulnerability frames on it. What's the point?  It's kind of glitchy sometimes. Enemies that throw you wind up the throw with you in hand, and if you're near a wall when grabbed you'll for a moment phase through the wall. This instant-kills you. Extremely annoying, happened to me 3-4 times in the playthrough. There should never be instant death on going out of bounds. That's lazy.  Aside from those two issues, the game itself is fun to explore and experience. Collecting and trying out different weapons feels good, the soundtrack is suitable, with a couple of somewhat memorable fanfares amidst a mostly atmospheric set of audio tracks. The level design variation is probably the best aspect, regardless of which God's area you enter, there's always a different setting and gameplay style to experience. Great stuff. In the end, if you can get over the combat, which does get a bit more enjoyable at the end due to upgrades, it's totally recommendable.",

The art, music, story, and level design tied together to create a compelling experience that felt like something Homer wrote. The game also does a good job with pacing; it's doesn't take too much time to feel like you've made a decent amount of advancement in it. I have two critiques of the game. First, the controls are a little awkward. The fights usually feel pretty epic, but if you stop too close to an enemy it gets really weird as your weapon swings go right past each other. Second, the inventory screen is a little cumbersome and keeps track of unnecessary things like obsolete armor types. Overall, I'd give this game a solid B+.",

            "review_text": "A clever, well made Metroidvania with a distinct art style, unforgiving combat focused on timing and precision, and a slew of content makes this an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the platformer/action game genre. While there's not much in the way of puzzles, the game is good about moving you from content to content, and no area ever feels 'too long'. Hidden areas and out of the way places abound, and you're constantly rewarded for exploring out of the way with a new weapon or piece of armor to use. Combat is fast and hectic, but button mashing can and will get you killed. Careful use of blocking and dodgerolling and counter attacking wins the day. Bosses are a variety of types and encounters. Upgrades are for the most part fairly minor - nothing so game changing as a double jump or a crazy new weapon tech. Most of it tends to be things like faster bow reloading, more effective potions, a small light aura so you don't need torches as much, and the like. The story is about what you would expect from an ancient Greek saga - but it stays true to those roots faithfully and respectfully, and presents time honored stories in a fashion that keeps them feeling mythic and heroic, rather than worn out and over-tread. A full set of well done voice acting for all the dialog helps a great deal as well.  This isn't even mentioning the fact that there's multiplayer arena in the mix, which makes the game even better, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, personally, but I could see how it'd greatly extend the life of the game.  Great game, would definitely recommend.",

The other things I liked were the open world elements of the game- you can go back and revisit nearly every area if you want. It's possible to beat the game in a pretty short amount of time if you don't do any of the non-essential side quests and activities, but all of these are fun and often give you extra powers. The combat has been compained about quite a bit, and this brings me to my next point: if you have really bad framerates, it's not very fun. Because of the nature of combat- very timed, not button mashing, directonal, etc- it's a challenge. I was getting ~20fps from my laptop, and that was no fun. However, once I started playing on my desktop PC, it was far more enjoyable. The combat is love-it-or-hate-it, I suppose, but I found it engaging and rather difficult. Most of the boss battles are great, as well. Storyline? It's kind of a standard ancient tale, I guess. Not much, to be honest, and your charcter never speaks. The deities are accurate in their personalities.   Overall, I highly recommend Apotheon for its amazing visual quality, refined combat, limited RPG elements, and atmosphere.",

The game also offers a plethora of melee and ranged weapons to use according to occation or to your liking.  Story wise    its the same old scenario where a man goes against the gods of Olympus, nothing we haven't already seen in other games, namely God of War, or in movies.     Level design is generally good and unique which helps to retain players' interest. On the other hand the total game length is rather short.  In addition, as in every platform game, there is some puzzle solving, alas not complex enough (or at all) in many cases.  As for the art style, a simple glimpse says it all. The use of ancient greek vase artwork for a 2D platform game is not only convinient for this genre but it bonds extremely well with both the theme, story and gameplay.    Overall its a very good 2D platformer and certainly its worth its price value, though it needs a little bit more features and content.",

A few things i recommend you do. -Turn on the subtitles, I feel it adds to the games design and flows well with the voice acting.  -The control combat is not your typical “Stick-Jock” style, there is a depth of strategy to the to the attacks that may take some getting used to. I personally had no issues with the controls on a game pad and it lead to some interest attack and shield defense moves.  As far as the game goes.  -Great Greek filled mythological story.  -Great soundtrack (DLC, well worth adding on). -Full Voice acting is superb. -Beautiful level areas along with secret locations held within. -Fun and interesting combat system with both mythological weapons. -The ability to improve your hero’s Armor and Weapon proficiencies. -Simple and nice inventory/crafting system.  -Adjustable Level Difficulty settings. -Complete gamepad mapping. -Multi-player Local (Have not attempted this yet). -Co-Op (coming soon).  It will nice to see if there will be any add-ons in the future to continue the story of Apotheon.  Having been playing games in all genera’s since my first commodore 16, there have been moments over the past few years that I was looking for something enjoyable and not bloated with all that “Look at all the things our game offers” and then to find out most of those things are broken or just weigh the overall experience down. Apotheon is a beautiful game that offers just the right amount of everything to make entertaining and continues bringing back for longer play sessions. It has been a long time since I played a game with such enjoyment or even looked forward to playing as much as I do with Apotheon.  The only thing I would like to see in the future is an equipable inventory system for a DLC continuation of Apotheon story.  Thank you Apotheon Team.",

It can also get quite annoying when some of your weapons overreach the enemies with weapons like the spear, the axe and the mace.  What I would like to see is the ability to drop inferior weapons because scrolling to the right weapon can get frustrating when there's ten weapons between the one you want and with weapons breaking quickly you can't really set one as a primary.

Then you have your ranged weapons such as differnent types of bows, slingshot spears, and even firebombs. There are so many kinds of weapons that you'll never feel stuck once the durability of one dies out, but because there are so many, you'll eventually find one or two that you really like and end up using it the whole game with the exception of some of the bigger enemies who seem to take different types of damage from different weapons without any clear reason.

There are also some fights that you can cheese because of the way some of the level are designed. +1 for things you can only do in video games like   Slashing horses in the buttcheeks through floors[/spoilers]   Travel/Scenery   Traveling from area to area isn't hard, but I did feel like the map was a little difficult to read at parts and was thankful for the ever helpful arrow telling me where to go. That being said, you are encouraged to explore as you will often find upgrades to your armor, materials for the simple crafting system, and replacement for your broken down weapons. And some of these maps are big.   Controls   Other than than the combat which did feel 'floaty' at times, moving around is not hard, there this fun little mechanic where if you keep running in one direction you will eventually pick up speed into a full sprint, but you will ever run in one direction for too long.  The platforming was good enough, but there was this little quirk where you can stick to certain ledges and slanted parts of the geometry that I never fully understood. It was helpful, but non-obvious.  My biggest problem with this game was swithing through weapons and various tools. I played this entire game on an X360 controller and the Dpad on this thing is horrendous, I ended up using the wrong tool or weapon very often and since you end up carrying so many different item by the end, switching in the middle of a fight was a real pain, I would have appreciated either a radial menu, or having the game stop time while I reached into the infinite space that was my pants pocket.   Conclusion   While the controls might be floaty, the map kind of vague, and the game short I highly recommend this game.  Each area you go to is varied and different enough to keep things fresh, you can play the game at your own pace, either explore everything or beat down ♥♥♥♥♥es with your hammer of justice. The combat is simple, but fun, seeing hordes of olympian guards fly through the map after laying down the law was a treat. The boss fights are simple enough not think to hard, but simple misteps will cost you a bit of health and armor.  Finally this game looks and sounds amazing. The voice acting was very convincing and the art style is mesmerizing. From water to fire to lighthing it all looked great and the art team did not skimp on the bloodiness that were the Ancient Greeks.  The time involved wasnt a huge commitment which for me was a godsend (pun intended) because I favor short and sweet experiences over those that drag on.   My final word was that this game is fun, fast, beautiful and, and offers a great experience.  TL;DR This game gud, kill gods, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up.      ",

            "review_text": "Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek Mythology  If you want to know why, continue reading.  Compared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.  The only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a 'Fed-Ex' quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some ♥♥♥♥ (the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.  There are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect ♥♥♥♥♥ (someone actually took the time to animated a ♥♥♥♥♥ on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they kill each other.  Oh, and the art style is pretty cool too.  Plot Synopsis:  You play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides 'ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥' and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's ♥♥♥♥. The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your ♥♥♥.  You roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.  I'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got ♥♥♥ for days.",

        {
            "review_text": "By now it's likely that you've heard of Apotheon's art style. If not, it is the single most remarkable thing about this game. The whole thing is designed to look like an ancient Greek vase, and it is most effective. The primary colors are orange and black, to resemble the clay and dark ink of the artifacts, with blue on the protagonist's armor and red on those of the enemies, along with occasional changes in background color as is appropriate for each setting (Green for the forest, blue for the sea, and so on.) The art style and animation generate a terrific atmosphere, as well, ancient and mystical and desolate and hopeless. Aesthetically, Apotheon is an absolute masterpiece and deserves every mote of the attention it's gotten.  The story is also excellent. With the dawning of the Iron Age, the Gods of Olympus are none too pleased with the direction that humanity has taken, and like Zeus's Christian counterpart, have decided to punish mankind with extinction. Demeter makes it so that nothing will grow, Poseiden stirs up the seas, Apollo denies the Earth light, and Artemis keeps the forests wanting for game. Enter Nikandreos, the hero. He wakes as his home village, Dion, is under attack by raiders. After defending the Temple of Hera from the outsiders, the Queen of Olympus charges Nikandreos with overthrowing Olympus and saving mankind. I won't say any more. While this isn't a game with a great many twists and turns, the development of the story is something you should uncover for yourself. The key here is that the developers really know their stuff when it comes to the Hellenic gods. Each one you meet fits their classical characterization to a tee, and this creates a number of great scenarios, my personal favorite being the Artemis boss fight. None of the gods are simplified or lionized as they have been in a great many modern sources, (God of War or Disney's Hercules this is not) and many of them have aligned against Zeus' abandonment of humanity. In addition, there is a liberal scattering of passages from classical Greek sources throughout the game, each placed to give you a clear impression of the particular obstacle or characters you'll be facing shortly. All in all, while the story itself may not be groundbreaking, it's well researched, well written, and creative, and is a joy to watch unfold.  The gameplay is where Apotheon falls a little flat. Most of the time it's fine, your classic action platformer with just enough backtracking and exploration that it could be called a Metroidvania (Though that doesn't quite fit). There are two hubs, the Agora and the Acropolis, with a shop, and each is connected to three major levels each based around a particular god, as well as both having two optional gods each: Aphrodite and Dionysus in the Agora and Hermes and Hephaestus in the Acropolis. These aren't required for the core plot but they are fun, help flesh out the world and each bestows you with a useful upgrade.  The place where the game falls short is the combat, specifically. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but it was simply clunkier than it had to be. Essentially, you have three attacks, an uppercut, an overhead strike, and a thrust, in addition to a shield bash. With the exception of the shield bash, which is done by pressing the middle mouse button with the shield up, the rest are far too difficult to pull off consistently or accurately. For example, the overhead attack is done by moving the mouse up and attacking, the uppercut involves moving it down, and the thrust is done by keeping it still. The problem is, the mouse is also used for aiming the attack and controlling the direction Nikandreos is looking. Couple that with highly mobile enemies, a problem that only worsens late in the game with the introduction of flying enemies, and this means that you'll have a hard time predicting exactly how your strike will come out or where it will go. The best thing to do is 'trade blows', attack, shield, attack, shield, and so on and so forth. However, this can be problematic in the frequent case that you're facing more than one enemy. At that point, I just used the bow and cheesed everything.  This isn't fatal, and once you get the hang of it, can be pretty fun. It's just something that will catch you by surprise and can annoy you throughout the game. The other thing to know about the combat is the weapon system. This is not a negative point, but it will be a turn off for some players. Rather than having set weapons that you unlock and can use indefinitely, you have a wide selection of weapons that will break after some use. This has two effects on gameplay: First, you must be a generalist. You can't just stick with the Doru (Spear) or Xiphos (Sword), unless you want to put a great deal of effort into making sure you always have decent durability. Second, you have to learn to preserve the most powerful weapons for the situations where you need them, like you might save the BFG ammo in Doom rather than using it on an imp. As I said, it's not a mark against the game, it's just something not everyone will like.  Is Apotheon a masterpiece? Certainly as a work of art. As a game, no, there's plenty of room for improvement. However, while it isn't perfect, it's still a very good time. Hell, the aesthetic alone is worth any gamer's time. I recommend it without reservation. Check it out, I think you'll like it.",

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Castlevania or Greek Mythology. Even if you're not, this is a worthwhile game to play.  ",

There is nothing more satisfying than picking locks and stealing the items out of strong boxes. The gameplay is unique, since combat is controlled by directional mouse movement, whereas ordinary movement is controlled by WASD. Though the game resembles any two-dimensional Mario game made, it is far more in-depth, and far less rage inducing.  My review does not do justice to the game.",

By far my favourite aspect was the art style though.",

Not only did I experience an excessive number of controling errors, but at random points throughout the fight my potions of invulnerability would cease to work. All around this is a decent game, but the pricing feels high for me at 15 dollars, I purchased the game on sale for 7.50, which feels much more reasonable.",
