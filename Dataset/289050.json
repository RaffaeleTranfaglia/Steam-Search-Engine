If you're absolutely desperate for more PvZ games, or you really, really want to see pictures from Gene Simmons' family albums, then game may be something that interests you. Otherwise, stay away. Play Plants vs. Zombies again. Play Anomaly or Defense Grid.  There's nothing really interesting here, even from a gameplay perspective. The level pacing is too short, the difficulty curve is almost non-existant, It's simply not a good game. Stay away.",

I have no idea who in the world wanted this game made or who would actually enjoy playing it. My rating is a big FU!",

I can only imagine how much more I'd enjoy this purchase, if I were an actual fan! And that's mostly because of the extras that come with the game! It's sort of like when you get a DVD, you get extras. Yea, like that. Only it's just a few photos of Shannon, Gene and the family. But like I say, lower your expectations, and (especially) if you are a fan, you might actually enjoy this simple and yet amusing little thing. I give it a thumbs UP!",
