I'm through and through a kb/mouse kind of feller. But you're probably going to want a controller for this one. Really feels right. This is the kind of game that's good enough that it's worth dropping the extra couple bucks if you don't have one on hand.  2. If you're looking for a casual wander-around and take in the sights sort of experience, you're going to be sorely disappointed. If you're bad at games, you probably won't finish this one. Not a lot of hand-holding going on here.",

            "review_text": "This is the best game I have played in a long time.  I hesitate to say the best Zelda-like game, because that would indicate that Zelda is better. And it's not. I don't say that casually - I love the Legend of Zelda series, but MAN, Nintendo got REKT here.  It is most like the original Legend of Zelda in that it is very free-roaming and is difficult, however, it teaches you the game in such a fantastically simple way. It requires no manual. You'll be able to get into it pretty quickly.  BREAKDOWN:  Gameplay: 10/10  The smoothness and variety of the combat and enemies is astonishing, far surpassing Zelda. You get energy for your gun by using your sword, making all of combat a mix of both. The dash and additional moves you learn make you feel like a master swordsman instead of a derpy Link. The elements teach themselves quite well.  Story: 7/10  This game uses absolutely no words, which is AWESOME. Dialog is done through pictures. It gives the whole game world a bit of an alien feeling, like you came to a foreign land. That said, I'm not sure I understood the overarching story very well. Extended cutscenes might help with that a lot.  Art: 10/10  The art in this game is absolutely astounding. I love it to death. Not annoyingly pixely, and very unrepetitive. It is beautiful. Just look at videos and pictures. SERIOUSLY.  Difficulty: 9/10  The difficulty in this game is almost perfect for me - it's difficult and the bosses will probably kill you several times, as will the levels leading up to them. The penalty of death, however, is merely starting the room over with the same stuff you had when you entered, which makes the difficulty really fun instead of annoying. Considering this light punishment, I would have liked some harder enemies to fight. I suppose though as someone who likes Dark Souls a lot, that means it will be perfect for a less masochistic player.  Overall: 9.5/10 - as awesome as Dark Souls, though in a different way  This is a must-buy. You won't regret it one bit. I wish there would be a sequel.",

            "review_text": "Hyper Light Drifter is one of my favourite games in years. I initially bought the game because I loved the visual design, but it ended up exceeding my expectations on every level. The visual style, the soundtrack, the storytelling, and the gameplay are all of the highest quality; they are complementary, and memorable.   When I initially played and finished the game, I was very satisfied and thought that I would probably play it again in a year or so. I ended up coming back in just a couple months, and found myself playing it through three times in a row, completing the majority of the game's optional challenges. I now know that this game will join a small handful of others that I return to and replay every year or so, which is probably the highest praise I can give.   If you want to play a beautiful game with an incredible artistic aesthetic, I strongly recommend this game. If you want to play a challenging but fair action game that is reminiscent of old classics, I strongly recommend this game. Support this game, we need more like it!",

            "review_text": "In an age where pixel indie games have become something of a cliché, Hyper Light Drifter brings some much needed life into the genre.  Hyper Light Drifter, or HLD for short, is an action-adventure game with its roots firmly placed in the Legend of Zelda games of yore. With a top-down perspective, a sword to slash around, an arsenal of weapons at your disposal, and a vast world to explore full of hidden secrets and goodies, it's nothing too alien. But yet, the world of HLD is entirely alien. While you might get a text crawl or dialogue in any number of Zelda games to explain what's goin on, HLD takes it in the complete opposite direction. There is absolutely no dialogue or text to speak of, save for a couple of lines in the tutorial and a note on how to use warps. Everything is represented through either pictographs, stories shared through images by NPCs, or directly by the environment itself. It is up to the player to understand what is going on on their own terms, much like the game Fez. But unlike the self-serving pretentiousness of Fez's presentation, HLD is a very gritty, brutal world that pulls no punches.  The graphical presentation is absolutely gorgeous. There is so much care and love put into the world to make it seem alive. There are tons of sprites and art pieces that are only used once, just for a small (or large) piece of scenery. The animations on the enemies, friendlies, and the player are top-notch and completely smooth. Each of the four zones are completely distinct with one another, united only by the center of the map. My humble opinion is that this is THE best pixel-style graphics you can see in any modern indie game today. It does so much with subtle color variations that it puts its peers to shame. While some might claim that certain games from the 16-bit era might fare better, that's not the point. When put in a group of its own stylistically similar peers, HLD is head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.  And what better way to suit the graphics than to have crisp, fun gameplay? HLD relies on three primary mechanics, each of them simple in their own right. Swing your sword. Fire a gun. Dash from place to place. But it's what you can do with your own personal abilities that can make it much more effective. You can upgrade to chain-dash endlessly, charge up your sword to whack enemies into the abyss, chuck bombs, fire anything from a shotgun to a railgun, the latter of which is helped by the fact that 'ammo' is generated by slashing your enemies. This promotes a quick and brutal style of combat, in which the enemies have certain patterns and behaviors that you can manipulate to your own advantage. Homing rockets heading your way? Easy, either slash through it or guide it into a baddie. Gunners shooting at you from afar? Reflect the bullets right back at them. On top of this, the amount of secrets, be it the mysterious monolith tablets to the 185 gearbits, to even outfits that help boost an aspect of your character, like faster bomb regeneration or an extra bit of health.  The soundtrack is wonderfully set to the mood of the locations you visit. Grungy, popping beats in the midst of battle to a quiet ambience in the gloomier areas, there's a lot of variation to find. What's more important is not only how consistent the quality of the music is, but how well they transition from room to room. Instead of having a fixed track for a specific room, they transition from the previous room flawlessly and often become incorporated into a single song. No matter where you go or what you do, you always feel like you're making progress in the world.  That doesn't mean the game is perfect, however. Finding those last few secrets can be a little bit of a chore and the underground map might as well not exist, because it barely makes any sense. Dashing from platform to platform, while a non-issue in most cases, it's rather hard to keep a straight path and you often find yourself veering off-center frequently. And not to mention, some rooms are almost unfairly brutal with their layouts.  In an age where the promises of a developer are more often than not hollow, short-sighted, and disappointing, HLD is a lovely total package that every game should aspire to be or at the very least, take some pointers from. It doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or present itself as something entirely new. It's a game that knows its boundaries, respects them, and instead perfects what's inside those boundaries than trying to be a little of everything at once.  Fantastic game, a must-play game for those who enjoy action-adventure games.  9/10.",

The controls feels just right and responsive, in almost all fights I have played there's a way to get all your opponents without taking a single hit from them, but that requires master timing and precision. As everyone said, the ambient, scenarios, music... all matches amaizingly well on this game. It is hard? Yes. Of course it will be hardest at first, but trial and error teach very well how the game mechanics works. Already one of my favorites on my library!  PS: The game has LOCAL Co-Op mode if you plug in a controller and hit start. It will take you one of your five health bars to spawn the second player, but it will have full health. The second player does not have medkits, and spawns without ammo. But, keep in mind! Bosses will have twice as much health!",

The game is hauntingly scored by Disasterpeace with a mood similar to his IT FOLLOWS soundtrack, eerie and dreamy. Difficulty isn't an issue, there's some challenging boss fights but with forgiving checkpoints and an upgrade system, every battle can be triumphed with satisfaction. I only played through it once and didn't find all collectibles, but I highly recommend it and greatly enjoyed by time.",

For character progression, the game rewards exploration rather than grind.  The Linux port seems to be working pretty well on a Radeon HD 7770 using the Catalyst driver. If you're gaming on Linux, this is most definitely worth it.  Cons: Any completionist will inevitably have to spend a lot of time trying to push through walls and peeking from cliffs. Some of the hidden secrets seem to be unreasonably difficult to deal with, in particular the dash challenges. Why would you ever do anything like that?",

There's a simple joy in exploring this mysterious world, filled with anthropomorphic creatures that speak in pictures, long dead giants whose bodies have become part of the environment, and an intiguing mixture of fantasy and sci-fi elements.  The story is kept vague and relies mostly on contextual clues from the surroundings, but that doesn't stop the game from having a cohesive if slightly cryptic narrative. The game encourages exploration and discovery, with many many secret rooms and items to uncover, and there's a genuine sense of accomplishment from finding little hidden pieces of the overall puzzle.  As for the actual gameplay, it's challenging but fair. The combat relies a lot on good timing and reading your enemies, and you can unlock quite a few cool guns and upgrades. The dash move is especially useful, and makes the battles feel very fast paced and nerve-racking. And even though there are still some pretty difficult parts (made worse by the fact that checkpoints don't happen as often as I'd like) it never crosses the line into frustrating.  All in all, a very memorable and enjoyable game!",

The game is gorgeous with fairly large areas and everything is just bursting with color. The soundtrack is extremely good and if you've played Fez, it's by the same guy and has a similar aesthetic (though i will say the town hub's song is a bit too fez like, to the point of copying IMO). Also, besides a few 'press button to do this' tutorial messages in the begining (theres like 5 like how to shoot your gun or dash) that's been it for words. Just pictures which, also, look gorgeous. So there's a lot of enviornmental and 'figure it out for yourself' story telling.

I wish there were more abilities or actions you could do to change up battle strategies a bit, but this is just a minor thing in my opinion.

You'll understand the gameplay basically by yourself (and have to, since there is only a very basic tutorial), and the story unfolds itself over time.  Even if you may not be a fan of the core gameplay, another important part of the whole thing is exploration, since you have to do a lot of it to find everything there is in the game. It does get pretty tedious later on, but certainly isn't anything unfair. Most completely-out-of-sight secrets are just additional content, and not required to progress.

I'm hooked and I can't stop playing.  The game is beautiful. The graphics are top tier even though it is a pixel art game. All of the diamond shapes and all of the colors really set up a nice picture. It isn't hard on the eye nor is it dull. It is quaint and mystic. That is the art style.  The sound effects for this game tie really well for what the game sound represents. The gun firing sound sounds like a plasma pistol and that sound gives you a vivid image of a hightech gun. The sword appropriately sounds like a light saber, although it does not sound entirely like a light saber but it gets the point across and paints a vivd image that you are weilding an energy weapon. The enemy sounds fit the enemies they apply to. It is all surreal sounding.",

I know this seems to be an indie darling right now, but already I find myself constantly annoyed with the game.  The artwork looks nice in stills, but in practice leads me to be constantly unsure of what things are. Is that something I can stand on, or will I fall? Is that a wall, or something I can walk past? Is this something that will block projectiles?  I am also annoyed by the animations. The animation for healing makes you briefly stand still, during which time you still take damage. When you are knocked down, you are still capable of being damaged as you get up - or in some frustrating cases, knocked down again. When you dodge, there is a brief period where it looks like your character is ready to attack but cannot. Sometimes when dodging I can pass through projectiles without taking damage, but other times I cannot - I still do not know which is the intended result.  Less annoying but still questionable is the decision to give as little information to the player as possible. The first time I went into a store, I had no idea why I couldn't purchase something. I was similarly confused when I got my first piece of currency, when I pulled my first purple arrow thing out of the ground, and when I had a key and could not enter a locked door. I was also unsure about which direction I was meant to set out in, and apparantly picked the most difficult dungeon first.  The negatives out of the way, I want to talk about the positives. The setting of the game is mysterious and beautiful, the kind of place you want to learn more about. The music I thought was very fitting for this, and combined with the sound effects the game was quite a pleasure to hear. The enemies are varied and interesting, and this leads to combat that is surprisingly well done for such a lo-fi game. The developers have put some great work into the game - it originally was released at 30 fps max, but after player requests they went back and redid everything to make it run at 60.  Overall, I felt the flaws outweighed the positives. I know other people will be able to get past them to appreciate the game underneath, but I found myself constantly frustrated by the problems above.",

            "review_text": "Just finished the game recently. And I have to say that its pretty good! First of all the art style of the game is awesome. I liked most of the areas, especially those areas with machineries and stuff. I would recommend this game to people who misses old adventure and metroidvania kind of games. Games like Castlevania, Megaman, Metroid, etc are kinda absent in today's current gen. But I would guarantee you that Hyper Light Drifter would fill that void in some way. ; ) It is a hard game but a very satisfying experience. And its a good game to play while you're also waiting for Dark Souls 3. Ok now time for bullets!   PROS:  - The Art style is amazing! It definitely took inspiration from animes like Evangelion and action adventure games of old.  - Pixel Art and Animation. There isn't much games anymore with Pixel art. And good thing Hyper Light Drifter is to the rescue. - The Combat is good also. I kinda felt like I was playing Zero from Megaman Z, but with a isometric view instead.   And DASH DASH DASH. If you love Dashing in games you'll definitely love this.  - Combat difficulty. Now this game is a bit hard, and I think its trying to appeal to the audience of the Souls Series and similar games. So if you like hard games. Get this!  CONS: - The Game is SHORT! Now this is a mix bag. A lot of people love short games for easy consumption. And a lot of people love long games to have more playtime and enjoy their money's worth. I think I finished it in around 7-8 hours. I want more :(.  - The distribution of the health packs along the areas and dungeon was a bit bad. Having a place to store your health packs would've helped. (You might experience reaching the Boss with 1 or 0 health pack, then you would backtrack to get more).  - Music. This is a mix bag also. Some people would see this as a PRO rather than a CON; vice versa. But for me the music of the game wasnt good. While it does fit the futuristic techno machine aesthetic and atmosphere of the game, it didnt really capture me. It wasnt really memorable, except for the song during the ending. And Most of the boss battle music wasnt good. Bottom line this isnt the type of game soundtrack you would listen to after playing the game.  - Frustrating Platforming. There are certain areas where you need to be quite good at Chain Dashing. While I like the Dashing mechanic in this game, it can be hard and inconsistent at times.   Despite its shortcomings. I think its awesome art style and combat is awesome enough to give it a recommendation. There are people who are gonna have trouble with its length, so maybe you can wait for a steam sale before getting this. But I assure you despite it being a short game, it is really good! So why delay it if you can get it now. ;)",

            "review_text": "Hyper Light Drifter is one of my favorite gaming experiences on any platform, of any genre, from any era...  I love games that start with something simple, like great combat, and then build and polish a game around that core idea. The Developers at Heart Machine clearly started with combat mechanics as the focus of Hyper Light Drifter, and they did a stunning job of creating combat that feels altogether unique and familiar. It shares many similarities to the strategic hack n' slash found in games like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls. You have to be precise and calculated with every action to avoid being punished, but enemies have clear patterns and tells to learn.  Hyper Light Drifter is an Action Adventure game with light RPG elements. In the air of classics like Legend of Zelda, Metroid, or Castlevania you explore to find loot, upgrade your gear and abilities, and open up previously inaccessible areas. A classic formula that Heart Machine clearly understands.  This game leans more into combat as apposed to the more puzzle oriented dungeons of LoZ. Hyper Light Drifter is more like a top-down Symphony of the Night or Aria of Sorrow in that sense. The bosses and dungeon hordes are both varied and challenging. You die often, but the game is always fair and you want to jump right back in to get better at the game. That is something that should not be overlooked in any game. Checkpoints strike a balance where you are back in the action quickly, but you don't feel like the game is helping you along when you haven't earned it yet.   On top of all of the excellent gameplay is a gorgeous art direction and one of the best soundtracks of any game in existence. The visuals and the sound bring this world to life in a way that gave me chills at moments. Hyper Light Drifter doesn't try to convince you of it's lore or gameplay with dialogue boxes of text or combat tutorials, it shows you with emotional cutscenes and smart game design. It's cryptic and thought provoking. You aren't given absolutes that ring hollow, but instead bits and pieces of information to put together to form your own conclusions about the who, the what and the why.   If you haven't played this game yet please do yourself and favor and buy it now...  10/10",

This game perfects a method in creating an experience, in telling a story, that goes beyond conventional narration and theme. It does this by both hiding and slowly revealing details at a pace that leaves you always grasping for more, but always satisfied by what you've discovered. While there are no words and the only communication with other characters is through sets of descriptive images of scenes, the player will understand the purpose and meaning of Hyper Light Drifter if they look carefully enough. You have one simple goal in Hyper Light Drifter, explore and uncover powerful artifacts of the past. Your motivation is as simple and deadly as any in the real world, a terminal and mysterious illness. As you explore more and more of the beautifully drawn and animated world of Hyper Light Drifter, you'll discover the dark secrets of the hidden past and why the Drifter is going down this path. The biggest strength of this game might actually be the ambiguity the story telling allows. Similar to games like Journey in this respect, you'll fall in love with Hyper Light Drifter becuase it lets you unravel the mystery of events in the game's universe rather than shouting a plot at you. This gives a special and personal significance to the character of the Drifter and the circumstances that befall him in the player's heart, not because they are told to like the character, but because they discover they do through their own experience controlling him. I DEFINITELY recommend this game, you will fall in love if you appreciate the deep care and effort an artist puts into their work. With the wonder of a Miyazaki film and the depth of a Souls game, Hyper Light Drifter is one of the best games to come out in the last year, and Heart Machine deserves much more credit than what they're already given for creating it.

Since I don't dig the whole 'prepare to die' vibe in games, it affects how likely I am to pick up the controller and start up the game between sessions ( A controller is a must - keyboard mouse works but it's built a little more intuitive for controller. More fun too). And that sucks, because all of the art, music and design are so very delicate, awesome, all-engrossing that I really want to spend more time in it... and I know I will, just not all at once.  To contrast the game comparisons, it plays closest to Bastion or Transistor. It plays very close to Transistor, but the upgrades are slow on the uptake (and don't really 'up'-grade, but alter your abilities). I dig the limited moves (~3) in the abilityset, it forces you to get creative and makes tackling even simple enemies fun.  I'm sure this reads like a negative review. I'm still thinking about that part. Maybe the game makes us observe inward on the shortcomings and insecurities we feel about ourselves, allowing us to confront the worst parts of ourselves. But overall I like this game since I am a bit of a pushover when it comes to pixel post-apocalypta lone hero slashers.

In Hyper Light Drifter you play a nameless wandering soldier with a sword on a quest of unknown purpose, plagued by an unknown illness and haunted by nightmares of death and destruction. You aren't given a clear picture of the goal, or even what you should do NEXT most of the time, but that's okay. Much like a classic Zelda game, you have freedom to explore and do as you please, and discover new secrets for yourself, and there are a TON.  The game is also much more action-packed. From the start you are equipped with a 'dash' function which can be spammed as often as desired (although there is a slight pause after using it 3 times in a row). The primary function of this dash is to let your character leap over short gaps between platforms, but it's also quite useful for dodging and weaving through the battlefield, approaching enemies for the kill and making a quick escape from a big attack. Players will be encouraged to use the dash as much as desired, and mastery will result in some of the flashiest, high-speed ninja fights ever seen in a Zelda-style game!  There are shops in town that sell you incredible but not-altogether-necessary upgrades, such as new moves you can do with your sword, more ammo for your guns (THERE ARE GUNS BY THE WAY), and a grenade to add to your movekit.  Heavy on story and gameplay with absolutely no dialogue (the game foregoes dialogue in favor of imagery), freedom of exploration reminiscent of oldschool Zelda games and some high-intensity action-packed combat for you hack-and-slash nuts, although calling it that is a dis-service as lack of care or thought given to when and how you move and strike will leave you dead. But, anyway, the game is amazing, okay?  Did I mention it's difficult? Punishingly so, at times, but in a good way that makes you feel like you're learning how to do something each time you 'die'.

Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.  The Good: +Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities. +Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes. +Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots. +Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons. +The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience. +Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.  The Bad: -The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one. -Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths. -Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow. -Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.  Bottom Line:  Hyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty. For those looking for a retro challenge this is it, however those looking for less action and more pure exploration should look elsewhere.",

Gameplay The top-down point of veiw was perfect for the shooter and hack and slash game we love, Hyper Light Drifter.

Major elements Smooth movement and a very steep learning curve at the beginning, this game is truely to be admired for its level of pure expertise put into every section. Every area I walk down is beautifully handcrafted pixel art, the best pixel art I have personnaley ever seen. A story, that on the surface, is simple but has so much depth within it. Set in a world similar to ghiblies nausica and the valley of the wind dystopian world. With a war long forgotten yet still leaving its imprints on the world around you. Great giant beasts long dead. And a very mysterious antagonist of dark power who is somehow a figment of your sickness but much more. A creature resembling a dog of great power that somehow, needs your help.  I gathered all this from pictures and the landscape around you. Its a visual story and an excellentley beautiful pixel one at that. Gameplay To put it as simpley as I can, legend of zeldas top down sword gameplay combine with a dash move that you have to master to not get hit. With the added bonus of a large mix of weapons to boot. And upgrades that basically add a whole new way to play but also make certain tasks slightley easier. There are also health packs which are scattered across the level to insta heal your tiny block health bar. And ammo that us used for all your weapons in your inventory recharged by slashing your enemies to pieces. You may also cross pits by dashing over them which can be sped up by spike traps littered on the platforms.  In short: A hack'slash'n'dash with guns and Isometric platforming. With pin prick accurecy built in to it all. Level design The level design here is just ♥♥♥♥ing beuatiful. Not only leading to intresting enemy encounters, but multiple paths to traverse the area and traps like sentries or spike traps to boot. There is a very adventureous feel to it and backtracking for mysterious never gets old because of the beautiful landscape or new items you find on the search. Puzzels and secrets are very well hidden but in a way to be enjoyable enough to find with the right amount of effort giving a great pay off when eventually do find them. The isometric parkour adds a lot as well, being so accurate that even non intentional areas can be landed on, which in my opinion is a blessing and a curse in the best ways especially because of the dash. The world itself is split up into 3 sections a forest, a snowey mountain and a aquaduct each with different types of difficultey but being about eqaul in how hard they are. Each one is better suited for certain abilities within the game that you can buy. There also warp gates you can activate inside the worlds which better help you replenish your ammo an health and make travel easier. While I won't spoil anything, the south area can only be played last.You acess all these worlds through a main hub world where you can purchase upgrades and do little minigames. To sum it up:  Legend of zelda's multiple worlds with a hub world, underground and upper ground gmaeplay and isometric parkour. With many traps and puzzels. Music It has the stylings of a mix of adventure 8bit music, varieing in different areas with a slight Journey instremental thing going on. Its pleasurable to listen to and doesn't get to repetative when your listening to the same track. A beuatiful OST with a very slow and mysterious theme only picking up during boss fights. It is almost always a beuatiful noise to listen to. So very simple put: A very mysterious, mood setter sound track that does it job very well. Not somthing I'd listen to while working though. Just excellent for what its meant to do. I love hearing it every time I enter a different room with different music. Graphics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) This is the best pixel out right now, no competition. Everything is beautiful to look at, everything is very well hand crafted, with beautiful backgrounds to suit. The shading and waters effects are *kiss kiss* un le buea. Though if you get motion sick easily then the backgrounds moving with you will make you very, very ill. but everything in the art department is basically perfect. in short: The best pixel art in the world right now. Boss fights: One of the biggest parts of the game, the boss fights lead up to the end of an area. They are also all almost impossible without better weaponrey. Ludicrousley hard without upgrades. And all with loving time in care into there very clever attack patterns. Though somtime I question their design choices. Each has a melee a ranged and a splash but the way they are dished out is very different (I think 2 don't have melee (-_- ;) ) You may find the bosses unfair, but once you've learnt their attack pattern you have no one to blame but yourself. In basic: Basic Isometric boss ideas, made creativley The game breaking glitch: I think this might be steam fault but my game keeps crashing on the end credits. This pisses me off to no end. Also don't leave it alone for to long then come back because the frame rate will dip like nachos in sauce. Summarey: 10 capes outta 10 -Excellent combat system -Zelda gameplay style with a unique spin -A no word story -The best pixel art currentley on the market -Isomextric platforming with great acuracy -Epic level design -mestyrious music design -Basic boss ideas with great new takes on them -Upgrades that make the game feel diffrent :O And all for its cheap price tag on steam at £15.00 (£14.99 = $21.33) is worth every penny and more   9.5/10 because 10 is just unreachable, nothing is perfect. This is prettey close.  This game barley ever gets old unless you do the same room again and again and again so its got great replayability to that 100%  minor negatives -disturbingley steep boss learing curve at the beginning of the game -Accidental deaths through unpredictable cirumstances -Frame rate dips from playing to long and a personnel not of I can not beat the game until steam bucks up how well it can handle the ♥♥♥♥ing end credits XD -a game prone to motion sickness for those with that problem ;(...",

            "review_text": "Main Explanation: (skip to bottom for quick overview) I picked up this game 1) because i saw it in a video stating its origniality. and 2) because I've had my eye on it for a little while. personally i liked this game you may see that i only have 7 hours when the game costs £15 i did finish the campaign but i didnt complete all the secrets ect. I liked hyper light drifter, quite a lot actually. it requires you to thikn about the story, not a huge huge huge amount but enough to where the story isnt simply handed to you on a silver platter. As for the story it can be a little bit different for everyone because you may infer certain events in different ways. I quite like this aspect of the game because if you have a friend that has also played the game i can garuntee you will end up talking to them about what they think happened, which can lead to an interesting discussion. The gameplay is smooth, espectially the combat which i have to admit is one of the best systems I've seen in a while, making it as equally satisfying as it is challenging. while the game isn't overly difficult you will die, and you will have to try again at some point. Boss battles are especially good in hyper light drifter as they ramp in difficulty as the game goes on and not just in the cheap 'more health, more damage' cheap difficulty. Things get harder to dodge and move sets get less predictible, you will feel an acomplishment when you down the next one you find. In terms of progression, HLD has a LOT of secrets almost too many infact which would be one of my complaints... if they werent so easy to find most of them. There is a special symbol that appears wherever a secret is to be found, making them rather easy to locate once you get an eye for it. Obviously, you won't see all of them and you will find yourself backtracking to find something a few times while playing. This can be fustrating if you have gone through the same area a couple times and still cant find what your looking for. But if you pull through eventually finding it can feel amazing. Unlockables are a big thing in HLD including weapon upgrads, costumes and firearms. I won't go over all of them as there are too many but there are quite a few for you to find. This adds a lot of depth to the game and finding a hidden costume or gun can help you out a lot in the longrun depending on how it fits your playstyle. The music in HDL is also very good and fits with the game perfectly creating an ominous, mysterious tone, because of this i would also recommend the soundtrack for the game.  In the short:  Pros:  Combat- extremely fluent and fast paced, enough to keep you quick on your feet. Story- while not obvious it does get you thinking and it portrays it in an original way.  Progression- it always feels like your getting somewhere in HDL as you always discover things you missed. Music- fits great with the game and helps to immerse you.  Cons:  Almost too many secrets- towards the end finding a secret feels a lot less like an achievement and more so like a task. Backtracking- this isnt necessarily a bad thing, it can just be a little fustrating when you have been through the same area more than 3 times and still cant find what your looking for.  Conclusion:  HDL is an interesting, fun take on an RPG adventure game with a story and soundtrack to fit it well. Overall: 11.5/13",

The frantic, fast-paced combat is reminiscent of action-RPGs like Diablo and DMC.   Like Dark Souls, this game is extremely challenging. Even basic enemies kill you very quickly and caution is advised when entering new areas.   The pixel art in this game is beautiful. Lots of mysterious geometric glyphs, and contrasting blue/pink pastel colours.   The bad:    This fast-paced action game is locked to 30fps, which could cause discomfort.   If you have poor reaction times or lack patience, this game will frustrate you.   The weird:    Similar to Dark Souls, this game has little in the way of dialogue or exposition. The story is told through pictures, the environment and vague cutscnes.   This game lacks clear instruction about the objectives, requiring the player to figure out what to do and where to go from enviromental cues, exploration and trial/error.     ",

            "review_text": "Hyper light drifter is a cool, edgy and very diffreent game, that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do.  The story is a cryptic one that tells itself through beautiful visuals of artwork and animated cutscenes with no dialogue or text to be seen at all. Even the characters in the game either speak with symbols, or the ones that do reveal some story of the world have a series of pictures that tell a story that you can come to your own conclusion about. All in all though the story is very mysterious and with every boss a little more is revealed.  Exploration is also a big part of hyperlight drifter and more often than not hidden routs, upgrades even weapons can be found all over the place as well as story elements too. There have been many rewards that i have found throug out the world just by trying to walk into walls and stumbing into a whole new area that didnt appear to be on the map at all. When you find one secret area it urges you on to search for more giving you plenty to do outside of fighting bad guys.  Now as beautiful the combat is, That combat it tough as nails at first, both on keyboard and game pad.Eeverythings very VERY fast paced and if you miss click by even one milisecond you are as good as dead. However this is a great thing and it keeps the combat fresh all the time because it keeps even the most insignificant enemies a genuine threat in medium to large groups. Even though the combat is very fast however, the way the controls work suggest that the player should stay calm and really think about what they are doing, especially during those boss fights.  To summerise... Hyper light Drifter is a beautiful, well rounded and almost perfectly made game but if your not up to the challange this game might leave a sour taste in your mouth, and is definatly worth playing if your a fan of zelda and dark Souls.",

(better not be some troll ♥♥♥♥ or i'll fight outside of Fry's electronic)  By far the best game i Indie adventure game i played so far in my opinion. The music is amazing and relaxing, the combat is really interesting with tons of move set and the range weapons are great also. I like the idea how you have to slash your enemies or objects to replenish your ammo. The platform is really hard and takes alot of practice to master it because if you're going for hidden items or gear collecting good luck to you pal but it will be rewarding with the unique effects on the costumes it self. The bosses are really unique and i think of it like Mega man you can freely choose which boss or zone you can take on and all of the bosses have counter and weaknesses. If you take on a boss without any upgrade or weapons it can be frustrating and hard but if you can can gett certain upgrades and or guns. This game is as and i know i'm ripping people off this joke but it's as hard as your wife/husband but can be forgiven and you love him/her.

Pros: 1) The game has good textures for a pixel type game 2) Combat is good especially when you're low on health with no heals during boss fight. 3) Interesting story. Even though its hard to understand what was happening a bit in the story I do often find myself thinking 'why is this here' 'what happened to these people..?' (seeing the skeletons) 'What are these robots?' 'Why is the Drifter blue?' but that isnt really a bad thing for me which is why I say its a good thing. I like using my imagination alot so yeah. 4) Fun boss fights. The bosses in this game were really fun to fight. You die a few times learn their skills...when or when not to attack with your sword...etc 5) Dungeons. If you like games with dungeons then this is a good game to check out. I liked exploring the dungeons in this world a lot.  Cons: 1) The MAP. The map confused me too much...especially when i went East where the ninja frogs were. I had a really hard time figuring out where I was due to how the map is made. Usually it shows where u are EXACTLY on the map but it doesnt in this game. AKA: When u move then check the map u dont move on the map.  Honestly the map is the only problem I had with the game. Hyper Light Drifter is worth the cash you spend on it. Its a very nice action game with good visuals for a pixel game and a good game to pass the time while having fun at the same time c:  Rate: 9/10 You should buy this game if you have a few bucks lying there!

This post apocalyptic neon covered action adventure game developed and published by Heart Machine is a very impressive introduction to the developer. If you're an aspiring video game designer using game maker studio, this is a perfect example of what the software can do.   What I liked: - Very atmospheric game - Varied enemies that attack differently and look very different from each other  - Several upgrades that keep the game interesting - Interesting bosses that all have diverse move sets and character design - Fantastic sound design and soundtrack  - Beautiful visuals that are teeming with color and character - The combat is incredible and feels amazing, really my main reason for falling for this game.  What I didn't like: - Bare minimum options  - 30 fps locked (C'mon, it's 2016) - Cutscene volume obnotiously loud - shakey start - basically useless map which will further confuse the player.  Some of my additional opinions: - The story is very confusing and never explained out in the open its for the player to decipher for themselves. I really like this and I'd rather let the environment and NPC's tell me the story without spoon feeding it to me. (NPC's speak in pictures which also makes it a bit difficult to understand) - This game gets really difficult and may not be for everyone - I really enjoyed New game + I feel like it changed up the base game more than other New game +'s  Conclusion: I bought this game for $17 and I do not feel ripped off, not in the slightest. This is a really fun yet challenging game that harkens back to classic video games such as Zelda and Metroid without ripping them off. The game envelopes the player in a world bursting with color and imagination. The combat is fluid and reminds me of dark souls (a game I might add, that has mastered melee combat) Lastly the soundtrack is jaw dropping and further immerses the player into the world of Hyper Light Drifter.

Sends mixed signals to the player. -Mechanics could use SLIGHTLY (and I mean miniscule) more explanation. This also ties into exploration which is encouraged because of upgrades but secrets were too tedious to look for. -Ranged weapon aiming is just straight garbage using controller or mouse. Where I aimed would consistently not be where my character would actually shoot.  Overall this would have been a 100% recommended game but I have little patience for games that promote crushing difficulty but hide it behind poor technical limitations. This game was shooting to be a 2D Dark Souls game with much better art direction and soundtrack but the loose combat and unresponsive controls made me feel like I was fighting the game engine instead of the enemies on my screen.",

And by 'mutant', I don't mean in the super ♥♥♥♥ed up way, I mean in the 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ it's the X-Men' way.  I've been waiting for this game since I saw it on kickstarter and it's finally here, and this game has overdelivered to all hell. Everything in this game is amazing and you tell they've put a lot of work into it. The Soudtrack, sound effects, art style, it all combines to give you atmospheric as hell game, despite it being in two dimensions.  The Combat is also amazing, it's as if they took Bloodbornes combat style, teaked it a little, and then almost perfectly translated it into a two dimensional plane. You'll find youself dodging around a lot trying to get behind your enemies to get a hit into them, or trying to back off so you can use a medpack in the corner and continue the fight. And the guns work well, too, they have some sort of soft-lock which can miss at times, but you can manually aim them if you wish to do so.  The game encourages you to backtrack to areas you've been before after finding things from different areas to find more secrets or loot that you couldn't find beforehand, and the game takes on A Link To The Pasts mentality by letting you do the areas in any order you like, reguardless of what gear you have.  The Bosses are well designed and an absolute blast to go against. At times it can feel as if a boss is too hard and that it has a cheap way of being difficult. it doesn't every boss I've encountered so far has the potential to be beaten without being hit once, and they all clearly tell you or let you know what the bosses attacks will be by the enemies you encounter in the area beforehand.  I've not finished this game yet, I have a feeling I've got another 6 or so hours to go, maybe longer. I'll update my review when I finish the game.  As of this point in time when I've completed 3 areas, I give the game an 8.5/10. If you've been looking at this game and thing you should get it, the answer is a resounding yes, as you will definately NOT be disappointed.  ",

The Story:  The story to this game is much richer than any other game I have ever played. It constantly keeps you in the mood to keep playing and I am tempted to play the game through another time. If this was just a book, I would definately pay $20 just for that alone. 100000000000000000000000000/10 story   Gameplay:  You won't find any other game that has boss battles that compare to this one. The boss battles inside this game are an essence of true challenge and are a constant fun. Though some may look back at this review and say ' that boss battle was too hard!'; that is also mainly because this game is almost entirely skill based. Though there are certain skills and such that would help, it is purely based on the essence of timing and reactions. If you aren't very good at skill based games, don't worry, because this game will almost teach you these reactions in a way. 10/10 gameplay  Soundtrack:  The soundtrack itself is just amazing and adds so much to the story. If it wasn't for the soundtrack I wouldn't have bought this game in the firstplace. The music inside the trailer tempted me to test the game out and see what it was really for; I can only say that it was well worth it. 10/10 soundtrack  Overall:  This game is honestly the best game I have ever played; that could just be because my bad choice in games but nothing beats the beauty of this game. Though it only takes 20 hours or so to beat and 14 hours for me in my case, it is well worth it. If you can't really afford this game save up and buy it another time because it will be well worth it. I would only not reccomend the game if you are just looking for a grinding type game and only want a game that you can grind a ♥♥♥♥ ton of hours for, however, if you are looking for a game that will make you cry at the end, this is it.  P.S. DON'T WATCH WALKTHROUGHS ON HOW TO BEAT BOSSES, I PERSONALLY NEVER DID IT (except on one boss and it ruined that boss battle for me) BUT FIGHTING THE BOSS'S OVER AND OVER AGAIN CAN REALLY BRING OUT A LOT OF FUN IN THE GAME. I WOULD ONLY RECCOMEND WALKTHROUGHS IF YOU ARE PURELY STUCK AND CAN'T FIND THE MODULES  I also reccomend watching a video explaining the lore ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED THE GAME. It ties so many ends and makes your day :)  Good luck, and have fun playing if you're going to get this game! 11/10 would definately reccomend buying this game",

            "review_text": "Alright. Played two hours of actual game so far with the other seven being the Preview Build.  So far, I have to say that the combat is great and requires you to think rather than just mash the button over and over to defeat enemies, there is a variety of things to purchase and unlock with the golden things you find through the world that make your character and weapons better, the soundtrack is great and probably my favorite from Disasterpeace, the intro cutscene was amazing from the looks to the music and forboding feel, there are many things to find and collect in the world along with many hidden areas that are sure to give the dedicated of explorers many smiles during their playtime, I like the game having no text to read from characters and such-all dialogue is done through pictures when you talk to a character, them basically showing you what they are trying to say which gives the player the feel of piecing the story together and wondering what has happened to these characters, the game plays wonderful on a controller-I dont understand at all people complaining about the dashing or the combat in the slightest because every feels very tight and crisp, the visuals are great with a varied color pallete that is distinct for each of the four main lands of the game, enemies are varied in my opinion and all look great and have somewhat different behaviors, and lastly the animation on everything in the world and distinctness between every character you see and meet is rather nice and makes you feel like these people are making do in a world with dangers all around this city.  I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rpgs in the veign of Link to the Past and the challenge and patience of Dark Souls style combat.  Part 2 - 17.5 hours full release completion  Basically all the stuff I said in the first review along with some extras. All the bosses were interesting and having some level of strategy to them with the things that made each of them unique from one another. The use of upgrades for both your weapons and your dash ability is super satisfying, killing the final boss with six of his projectiles reflected back at him was awesome. I personally enjoyed the story being told only through images, cinematics, and the areas instead of text like most other games. Each area was unique in design and asthetic and had some sort of backstory you could learn from the npc you can talk to in each area. As you play the game you are likely to grow attached to the other drifter you meet in each area   and feel terrible and it is your duty to avenge him when he eventually dies  . The six different guns in the game are, well, different from one another and call all be used to take on a situation differently whether you want to snipe at a distance, shotgun up close, or use a pistol as a utility between sword attacks. Half of the people in the forums are great people and have come together to find many interesting secrets, help one another, and even translate the igname language. The other half cant stop complaining about 30fps which doesnt bother everyone in the world and some people mentioned in the Special Thanks part of the credits (btw, the ST part of the credits is nearly always pooled from all the devs in any production, meaning that the ideals and thanks of one can completely conflict with the ideals and thanks of the others. It's like we're all human or something). All the different equipment sets provide you many different passive abilities that provide some extra replayability and thought when going into a boss fight or an area for the first time. Personally, my current favorite build is BlueWhite for my companion, Pink sword, and White cloak. There's also alot of collectibles for anyone that likes to get everything out of a game.  Overall, this game was a great 17.5 hour adventure rpg (nearly 100%) with great combat, visuals, soundtrack, and an interesting story with a bitter-sweet ending. I recommend it to anyone in need of a fun game that requires you to think and recommends searching every nook and cranny.",

TL;DR The game's good, but it's not nearly as good as I hoped it would be. I recommend you play the preview build which is much better than the final product in my opinion.  Full review (In no particular order): + Atmosphere is really good; excellent ambience music, detailed surroundings and animations. + Game looks gorgeous, and it's aware if it showing you few vistas from time to time. + I found the story intriguing from the very beginning, partly thanks to that creepy intro. It's minimalistic, mysterious. Its lore is interesting to dig up. + Fighting's done very well; it's fast-paced and you can always be in control.  + Level design of most areas is impressive, most secrets have some hint. + Overall boss fights are challenging and interesting. + Enemies are somewhat varied...  - ...although each has max 2 attacks and most have only one. - There are only few interesting characters/stories in the world. And they are short and simple. - In some fights game throws at you large numbers of same type of enemies - it's challenging, but it's not interesting (conversly some fights have waves set up really well). - 'open-world' doesn't work for me in this game. The world feels too small and cramped. I feel like it would work better in Demon's Souls style world with warpins only from/to selected places and no direct connections between the hub and the zones. - weapon upgrading is just redundant in its currect form. - some secrets require wall-hugging/sixth sense to be found. - map is useful only for collecting modules - Big problem is the amount of content that's not present in final product, although you can see it in 2014 trailer and Kickstarter goals. Bosses, weapons, areas, modes. Even without knowing about it you can fell the game is rushed, especially in South-surface area.  Overall the game's functional (for me), and it's fun that's why I still recommend it, but at the same time I know that HM can do much better. I think that just the scope of what they wanted to make was too much for them, that's why the cuts.  So why I recommend preview build? It's essentialy the best designed section of the final game, but designed even better. It feels much more complete and coherent. Every secret has some hint, no wall-hugging's needed. It has nearly all that final game nails, and omits elements that didn't work out as much. You only have to accept the fact that it's just a preview build, so it's 2h long.  PS I might edit this review later if anything will spring to mind.",

I honestly have very little understanding of what is happening in the story or why my character is driven to do the things he is doing but I'm really likining the game regardless.    The biggest problem with this game is the 30fps lock. I really wish this game was able to get up to 60fps.

            "review_text": "(10 hours of my game time is in BETA build)  Finally finished Hyper Light Drifter... I will regard it as one of my dream games.  I can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.  What I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.    PROS:     1) Fluid and Responsive combat:  that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.   2) Bosses:  seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the good old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!  Those negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average.   The key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.   3) Exploration:  The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.   4) Enemy Variety:  Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.     CONS:     1) Short:  yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.  The intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.   2) Upgrades:  Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine.   Bastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.   3) Lack of Adventure:  You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.   4) No proper quest system:  Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.  This could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.  The game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.     RECOMMENDED   If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare indie gems that comes out once a blue moon.  It has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.  Rating (if that matters): 8.5/10",

It's vague, a lot of it left up to interpretation, but told very well regardless. Expect a lot of debate over the game's lore and its meaning.  - Presentation is amazing, if you like retro stuff. Art is pixel art, all hand-made from scratch, and music is beautiful, most of it in the form of ambiance. Visuals and audio put together, it's a spectacle to witness. I advise lowering game volume, though, certain cutscenes in the game spike the volume extremely high.  - Game is hard. Very hard, in regards to both lesser enemies and bosses alike. Especially bosses. Not sadistically difficult, though, difficult in a forgiving, 'You messed up but can try again' kind of way. Doesn't hold your hand at all, but gives you many options to keep going. Death checkpoints are decent; some very forgiving, others not so much.  - Combat is very satisfying. Sword strikes and gun shots alike have a big impact to them. Very reflex-based, 'stay aware and keep on the move' kind of combat.  - Exploration is abundant. Good amount of ground to cover and tons of secrets to find and scavenge for.  - Progression is RPG-like; have to find gold pieces that combine into full gold to buy skills/equipment from town hub shops. Encourages exploration to further upgrades.  - Kind of short game if you take away difficulty. I beat it in around 7 hours, which is not bad, but depending on who you are, it may leave you wanting for more. Secret and achievement hunting will definitely elongate the play time, though.  - You'll feel very proud of yourself overcoming the harder obstacles the game throws at you.  - Main character is really cool. Masked warrior with a cape, who wields a lightsaber in reverse grip, and dashes around at high speeds. So much my aesthetic, it hurts.  - Comparable to Shinobi (PS2) in terms of difficulty and how your character controls, Mega Man in terms of how areas and bosses are structured, and Metroid in terms of exploration.  If the difficulty isn't off-putting, buy this game. This was ~7 hours well spent, and I plan to sink in more in the future for complentionism's sake.",

Gorgeous. The feeling and atmosphere of the game can be predicted by the 3 trailers, but what you couldn't know is the love to details. The Birds still fly away if you walk near them, so this is a thing. But where I really was suprised is when there was a mirror which had a) a reflection of the player and b) I hit the mirror and it broke! That is just such a need detail. 11/10 The music fits the game great. After hearing that the music of the first trailer (which i love to death) was not composed by the composer of this game I was disappointed. When the second trailer was released I was worried, because, well I didn't really liked the music. Suprisingly the music just melts wonderful into the game while playing and just underlines the overall theme of the game. The game has a feeling of solitude and mystery to it. There is not one english letter in the game so far. Just some mysterious symbols. The story is told by pictures. If you talk to story relevant NPCs they will tell their story by several pictures which you have to interprete as you see fitting. This was again rather suprising but in a good way, because this as well fits the overall theme great in my opinion.  The controls are pretty responding and feel very good, which is the foundation of such a game. It is hard. The combat is fast paced and punishing. If you don't time your attacks or movement well you will die. If you get hit by certain attacks you will get punished by falling to the ground, so if you rush headless into some enemys and one hits you once, it is almost certain that the others will hit you afterwards without giving you a chance to avoid it, because of the first mistake you made.  You have environmental obstacles which can kill you and will force you to think how you aproach a certain situation. So you will die a lot. Speaking of dying. You can't save the game whenever you want, it has like a checkpoint system. If you reach the checkpoint the game will save. So far these are in fair distances to one another and if you wan't to quit the game there's a message telling you how long ago the last save was.  The game offers a lot of secrets, path's you can't see on the first glance. Like in the beta there are invisible platforms, but it looks like that you can make them visible for a short time if you a) stand on them (makes the whole path visible) or if you are at the starting point you can use your companion (which gives you a signal that something is there) to make them visible.   So far I haven't understand how the level system (if this even is one) works (or rather what improves if you level up) or how the currency works in this game. Maybe those two are connected. The game will give you a really short tutorial, but it looks like you have to figure out most of the mechanics, which i really like. Hate those tutorials and taking all exploration out of a game by forcing everything down your throat.   Just one thing. When I close the game it will crash. That is probably not a big thing, because I wanted to exit it anyway, but it just shouldn't happen after such a long development time. A beta for a game was originally a thing to test if a game is running properly and if I will stumple about bugs or if the game won't start (error message) for other people (which i've read on KS) and other systems. If something the game crashes, bugs or similar, that is a no go. You (developer) deceided to exlude most of us from a real beta test and you did this intern for story and suprise purposes (which i can kinda understand), we got 'just' a preview build. So I hope you made sure that the game will work properly!   Anyway great Game.",

The game teaches you how do deal with enemies quickly without any sort of tutorial. once you have fought a med size enemy it likes to ambush you with multiple of them and a bunch of smaller enemies and tells you 'good luck'. this game throws you in head first into the deep and and I am enjoying every second of it!",

            "review_text": "Rarely a game comes along that gets me excited enough to buy it the minute it comes out. Hyper Light drifter is one of those rare games, and it doesn't dissapoint.  At the time of this review I'm only two hours in, but I'm already hooked. Hyper Light Drifter is a hack and slash that hits every note with perfect precision, and manages to add it's own beautiful twist that makes it unique. Let me explain.  The Atmosphere: You are probably already aware that the art style is absolutly fantastic, but the trailers don't give away the full story. Each set piece feels like it is well thought out, and each screen is beautifully composed. Even more so, the music adds to the atmosphere and mood without being distracting or obtrusive. The sound of this game strikes a fantastic balance between emotive expression and being a delicate background foundation to the game. Even the sound effects feel masterfully created. I can not rave about the way this game presents itself more. It is top shelf.  The Story: So far I'm only right at the very start of the game, but the story has already drawn me in, and it has managed to do so with absoltly no text. This game takes the idea of 'show, don't tell' very seriously, and it absolutly delivers. It didn't take very long at all for me to become invested in the characters, and the world feels very real and lived-in. It is hard for me to find fault. Granted, this early on it is entirely possible for the story to fall appart later on, but given how expertly the beginning of the game is constructed, I highly doubt the rest of the story will be anything but fantastic. I'm excited to discover more about this world and the people who inhabit it.  The Combat: No game is perfect, and Hyper Light Drifter is no exception. The combat feels tight and responsive, but beyond that it doesn't really introduce anything too exciting. Combat is neither brutally hard nor boringly easy, but it can be a little frustrating. Enemy's attacks will follow you accross the screen after you dash out of the way, which can lead to the annoying experience of dodging an enemy's attack only to have the enemy fly accross the screen and kill you anyway. Combat is a little punishing, with enemy's two-hitting you from very early on, meaning you have to play perfectly to progress, and might need to retry a fight ten or more times before you can move on. The ranged weapon feels pretty underpowered, with very limited ammo and an awkward aiming system. Using the gun often feels like a waste of time and effort. Your sword is much more effective, and doesn't cost ammo. On top of that your abilities are the same powers we've seen a hundred times over. One melee attack, One ranged attack, and a dash. Don't get me wrong, the combat is /fine/, but it is only fine where the rest of the game is great.   All up this game does not dissapoint, and I'm excited to see where the game takes me and what the company produce in the future. Solid performance.  TLDR; Game is good. Spend $$$.",

            "review_text": "Now, THIS is what Jotun should have been. Hyper Light Drifter is largely a game about spectacle, but it is pretty bloody beautiful, fun, and somewhat poetic.  Full disclosure, I did back this on Kickstarter and I am glad I did. The graphical style is stunning and beautiful in it's more retro look and manages some amazing aesthetics and art design. The game itself tells the story of the drifter entirely without dialogue and through short cut scenes and through your own actions. While it can be a bit vague, it's definitely an experience and I enjoy that it feels like a complete story even if you don't have all the details.  The design of everything is impressive and beautiful, with music that is equal parts ambient and haunting. The problem comes with the controls. While they aren't bad, they are a bit stiff and dashing out of combat takes some getting used to, as you can't dash through many attacks or enemies, like you might feel you can. Swordplay lacks a bit of punch, but is otherwise satisfying. Combat takes some getting used to.   I like this game, despite it's short length, however a problem bigger than the stiff controls is that not much is explained. The keystones for opening doors? The use of stone tablets? Extra powers from different outfits? You aren't told any of this through the game and even upgrades are a bit weird at first. This let's the story be a bit poetic, but also makes the gameplay aspect of the game...a bit weak.  Overall, it's a short experience with lots of beauty to behold, however unlike Jotun, there is a deep game that allows you to grow and improve, customize your character, and fight impressive bosses unlike much of what you have seen in other games.",

The game handles well, although some of the dash upgrades are a bit difficult to use. The game has a fantastic graphics that make the game breathtaking. The bosses in this game are pretty difficult, but once you get the shotgun, you should be able to take them down no problem. Each boss requires quick reactions, for they attack rather quickly. I wish you could get a health upgrade in the game, but the health restores upgrades are still good.  Overall, as I said, I LOVE this game. It is soo cool, and soo much fun.

The visuals are some of the most beautiful I've seen in the pixel art genre, and there are various astonishing sights to see, some of which I would stop to study for a couple minutes. The soundtrack is great too, Disasterpeace does some of the most unique chiptune music I've ever heard.  Before playing I was a little worried since a lot of people have been saying the game is too hard and frustrating to be fun, but after playing it through I wholeheartedly disagree. The bosses are very hard, that I wont deny anyone, but I found all of them really engaging and never frustrating, even though I died repeatedly on a few of them. Combat in this game is more about being aware of your surroundings and timing your actions than simply mashing buttons. I'm not against the idea of an easier difficulty setting for people who don't play this type of game often, but the experience of finally getting it down and sticking it to a boss is really satisfying. Some of the game's appeal would be lost without it.  I finished the game in about 8 or 9 hours of play time, though I feel like there were a lot of secrets I missed, and there is a new game + mode as well so replay value seems good. Definitely will be playing this more in the future.",

            "review_text": "  I got this game as a birthday gift. These are my FIRST IMPRESSIONS of playing the game a few minutes (I might update it when I finish the game).  - The graphics are just lovely and the music is too. - At first it was very confusing for me to know where to go or what to do next but, since I'm a persistent person and wouldn't give up exploring and clicking everything, things started getting a bit more intuitive after a while. - I have attention deficit and the color scheme for this game doesn't seem to be helping. I get stuck a lot, not knowing which path to take and I can't quite realize where the map ends, thus ending up falling down and taking damage from it quite frequently. I guess my brain will need a bit more time to adjust, but that's me. - I really like the jump ability. Not only it allows you to jump a significant distance, but it is also quite useful to evade long range mob attacks during combat. - I quite like the combat system. Most pixel RPGs have a turn based combat system. That is not the case with this game. The character moves effortlessly in a very fluid way. It reminds me of a pixel version of an mmorpg combat system. I just love it. - I also like the 'bullets' and the healing system. Make me feel like I have self sustain, even though I still die quite easily to the mobs xD - The way you go up and down the walls is also pretty cool. The teleport system across the map is nice too. - I just got to the first town and interacted with the NPCs in the shops. That was very confusing for me. The whole thing is images only and I'm used to text with dialogs and explanations. I didn't quite get that system yet (what the NPCs want and how I'm supposed to interact with them), but I'm sure I'll get used to that too. - At first I wasn't sure about the auto-save feature. Personally, I prefer games where I can control my saves. But this feature saves frequently enough, so it's actually a good thing. I can just explor the map and enjoy the game and not have to worry about saving.",

            "review_text": "This is definitely one of my favorite games of 2016.  Upon first glance, the game has a minimalistic yet beautiful pixelated art style that's well complimented by it's high contrast, neon-esque color scheme that helps bring a weird, alien atmosphere to the game world. The soundtrack, also atmospheric, is heavy on synths and filters that could very well be a moody take of John Carpenter's pieces. These two aspects together helps bring this torn and twisted world to life.  The game starts with a short cutscene with your character, The Drifter, as he watches his world crumble around him, and collapses during a struggle against a tentacled being. The Drifter is rescued by a mysterious man in plated armor and taken to a house in a village. The Drifter wakes up, and then he's on his own.  The game is definitely inspired by the likes of The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, seeming to be a mix between the two, but the action is much faster than the two. You're given a sword, a gun, and the ability to swiftly dodge as you're pitted against a variety of enemies across four different areas in the game. These areas are not only non linear and expansive, but they're also full of secrets filled with upgrades, called gear bits, and triggers that helps you open up more secrets. The gearbits, however, helps you upgrade your different abilities and give you extra ones as well. There's many ways you can upgrade your abilities, but the upgrades aren't tiered save a couple of upgrades, but every single upgrade is very useful.  One of the main attractions to the game are its boss fights. This is where I say the game may disappoint to some people. Some of the boss fights are lackluster in the boss's attack variety and some of them are pitifully weak, being able to be destroyed within your first encounter if you're a capable enough gamer. Only later through the game will your skills be truly put to the test as you're given tougher bosses to fight, although they're still considerably weak if you're using the right equipment. At least, this is how my first playthrough of the game felt on the standard difficulty. Compared to Dark Souls and even The Legend of Zelda, the bosses are subjectively easier than the waves of mobs you fight on the way to them. Despite this, most of the boss fights are still fun as each boss has abilities vastly differing from other bosses.  The game has some extra content, like challenge stages and mini games to play when you're not adventuring, but nothing too extraordinary compared to other games unless you count the secret doors you can access through the keys scattered around the game world. On a standard playthrough collecting some items, I'd say the game is around 8 hours long. However, I may very well give this game a second playthrough after I clear out some of my back log. I'd say this game is a solid 7/10 with a 5 being an average score. This game definitely stands out with its faster paced Zelda/Souls styled combat, but the game's climaxes to each area and even to the game itself fail to hold up to the rest of the game. It's a must-buy when its on sale, but if you have the money to spare, it's not a bad purchase either. At 20 dollars, this game has what I expect content wise, but the content in there is well crafted.",

Pros: * Simple UI * Simple Gameplay (but awesome) * Awesome artwork and animations (yes it was all created manually by hand) * You need to play in order to figure out the story, nothing is really told to you (some npcs show you images of what happend to them) * There are some upgrades which you can make to the character (such as gun improvements, bombs, new guns, new jumps, and many more.) * The bosses make you feel like you are playing some true retro game, because they have kind of special movements and they are not easy to beat (i've battled a big frog and for just 1 point of life i've won) * Soundtrack very simple but it fits the style very well * Sound effects are awesome everything you do have a special different sound effect that when you hear it you will sense what you are doing * It doesnt make you addicted to play more and more which is the profile of game that i am always looking for * It has a co-op option which i didn't tested but i think it would make my experience even better with a friend (which i dont have :V ) * It has some kind of puzzles inside the game and hidden items in hidden areas which make your experience even better * The game has a fast travel feature  Cons: * Sometimes the game gets boring for me (this is a personal question, you can feel different about it, it must be the soundtrack i think) * You don't have a tutorial about the UI, although that it is very simple to understand * The objectives are stated on the map but you don't know exactly what you are looking for, so when you are new to this game you will feel lost sometimes ( I dont know if i can state any other thing which i didn't liked, i think this game don't have bad features )  My actual note for this game is: 8 / 10",

You can quick-fire your gun in the direction you're facing without aiming. This works better with some guns than others.    Ranged enemies tend to fire a bit behind you, while melee enemies track your position more precisely.   Make good use of save spots and health packs. Don't be afraid to repeat a room if you think you can do it better.   The game has a lot of Metroid-like secret rooms. Hug walls and warp off the beaten path to get more upgrades.      You can upgrade the sword to reflect projectiles. This is even better than it sounds.         Many find East the easiest way to start. Some of the rooms are pretty hard, but the boss is less difficult than the other three and you get the shotgun right after, which is a game-changer.     ",

            "review_text": "Well I stumbled upon this game, when the devs where posting a notice that they'll release this game on the end of march. Intrigued I checked what this game was supposed to be and I was immediately interested. The game industry doesn't have many zelda-esque titles that spice up the game with story, dungeons and compelling boss fights like The Legend of Zelda. Though games that knock on the TLOZ like Dark Souls, Darksiders and Okami are a dime a dozen. So I asked myself will this be another dime. In my opinion it is a worthy game to play looking away from clunkiness and time.  The story starts wiith a cutscene that shows a catastrophic event. No further information, but the visual of the cutscene is given and it relies on your speculation what happened ( of course if you weren't spoiled). You are a drifter, who is haunted by mysterious visions, that you cant explain. With no more information you are dropped into the game and through progress you piece the story together.  Pros: - interesting pixel art that seems to capture the technological and eery feeling of the world presented in Hyper Light Drifter. - Exposition of the game world is not presented through speech, but by perception and visuals. More information about the game world is leaked by beating the areas, which for me is an incentive to pursue the story till the end. - hard and challenging bosses, that drop there unique weapon after beating them. -different platforming tools to experiment with and find collectibles. - a fast but hard combat system, that feels rewarding if mastered. -Boss rush mode  Cons: - The game is short and can be casually beaten in about 6-7 hours. - If you don't use the 60 fps mode of the game, the game may seem sluggish, since in order to master the combat you need to time your inputs.

            "review_text": "With top down gameplay inspired by zelda with a dash of unforgiving fast paced combat, HLD was worth the price of admission. The music atmosphere and animations make enemies and the main character a pleasure to watch as they attempt to dismantle eachother. The game is also dense with secrets, with unfortunately some boiling down to running against walls and leaps of faith.  I would wadger that a casual play through might clock in at 7-8 hours, depending on how many upgrades your willing to search high and low to finance. Almost all important additions to your abilities are bought from trainers, with the exception of guns that mostly lie behind the games major boss fights. Some are more useful then others: the chain dash is extremely important but upgrading your pistol clip or learning the slash into dash can wait.  There are issues: frame rate can make executing some of your moves difficult. Your character will sometimes drop dashes when chaining them and there's not much to do, and it gets annoying trying to execute a 7+ chain dash required to clear some of the more difficult puzzels and your imput dropping or your character skidding to his certain death. The secrets in some areas are well marked, but those same markers in the same broad area might just be junk on the floor. It is compounded partially by the style of graphics: the charming pixels with tons of doo-dads on the walls and floor mean that it looks like everything might have a switch or passage behind it.  You can't track where you've found things aside from the games diamond shards (which act as keys for progression) so you might wander an area for hours trying to find elusive secret collectables only to learn apon consulting a map that you've already cleaned it out long ago. Most of the rewards as you move to full collections tend to be minor: there are outfits that have different effects on them of varying use (some are quite subtle) but the most powerful effects they have are generally obtained past when they mattered anyway.   That being said there's a lot of fun to be had exploring and buying upgrades and fighting some very intense ambushes and bosses in the grim but very colorful ruins of hyper light drifter.",

        {
            "review_text": "I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this game at all, but there's some issues with the gameplay that cripple what could have otherwise been a modern masterpiece. I'm going to outline a few of those problems here so you can decide if you want to purchase the game or wait for a sequel.  One, the pace of combat is frantic and clunky. Your dash doubles as your dodge maneuver but it pretty much always puts you so far away you can't retaliate. When it doesn't, you still get hit so then dodging was useless. Enemies that keep up with you make it where you have to completely dodge out of the way of all of them to try to recover and get some hits in. Doing more than 3 dashes in a row causes you to spin out and do nothing or bonk against a wall, then get hit by the enemies you were trying to avoid. Your attacks only cause a few enemies to recoil and you have to learn by trial and error which ones those are. Not to mention, enemies are attacking pretty much constantly but you have to tap your dashes in such a way that the rhythm causes your first two dashes to be slow, which can make dashing multiple times inherently useless in certain situations anyways. There's almost never a good break to use your very slow heal unless you back completely away from everything. Midway through the game there are just too many enemies, and the developers knew this: That's why they made it where when you die, you respawn at an unseen checkpoint, usually the same room you just died in, with all the ammo and healing slots you had on you when you triggered it. If they knew the game was this hard, they should have reworked some of the movement or the enemies, or something to make the game generally less of a non-stop trial.  Two, bosses are unimaginative. This is kind of mind-boggling, considering how amazing the aesthetics of this game are and the premise, the environments, all of that. This game is beautiful but the boss fights are not designed to be interesting. One of the easiest bosses you can get to, and will probably find first, summons additional monsters. This is pretty much a boss design crime. The boss itself has incredibly good tracking and attacks constantly, so you never have time to breathe or punish him except for a split second right at the beginning of his attack cycle, or while he's still attacking you at range. The pace is just way too hectic and doesn't let you learn anything except that you need to brute force the fight by dodging and attacking with no breaks or pauses. It's almost like playing a side-scrolling beat-'em-up instead of an adventure game.  Three, there's a huge missed opportunity with the music. Yes, the soundtrack and the environmental themes are *astounding* and pick up at just the right times to capture your imagination. But at the same time, you walk into a fast-paced beat-'em-up style boss fight like this and you get the same music (or same kind of music) you got exploring only swelling a bit. It stops sounding eerie and mysterious and just sounds drab and lazy for a boss. This game has some really epic story telling moments outside of boss fights. It could have had just as good moments where the music would switch to something frantic and berserk that fits the pace of the boss battle. It could have also had a little more ceremony surrounding this like other cut scenes do.  Four, the vast majority of the upgrades in this game are straight up garbage. I can think of 5 of them I would change or remove completely. I spent my hard earned hyperbucks on some new dashing abilities only to find out they are hard to trigger and don't really do much of anything. One of them was that chain dash that I described earlier as being pretty much useless except for a very limited number of circumstances. It can take you upwards of 30 minutes to an hour to get enough money to buy an upgrade but getting that upgrade very often does little to nothing for you. There's two defensive upgrades that are obviously superior to everything else, and after that all you really need is to buy more charge slots for your healing tool. Moreover, you can get costume items but they have a very minimal effect on your character, none of which is explained, the cosmetic differences of which are pretty limited. This means customization of your character is virtually nonexistent. In a game this aesthetically pleasing and interesting, this is a little disappointing.   Overall I'd give Hyper Light Drifter a 6 out of 10. There is some *amazing* artwork and incredible ideas here, they're just not accompanied by rewarding gameplay.",

Go experience that sexyness again ;3  TLDR: Hyper Light Drifter was a wonderful experience, that felt and looked fantastic. Absolute recomendation to pickup full price or at a sale.  Hyper Light Drifter is a Top down, explorative Action RPG developed by Heart Machine through Kickstarter support a few years back.  The art, visuals, and controls feel impecable. Slashes have a nice swing to them, the dashes look excellent, the environment it beautiful on first glance, and the ambience music provides a wonderful vibe to the game. The controls feel like your standard twin stick shooter, but only rebindable for Keyboard+Mouse. Options may not be the best for some, and yes, it is locked at 30fps. I had no complaints, other than some sections where lots of flashing lights were present.  The game throws you in, arms open while you figure out which of the cardinal sections to go and collect some fragments. All of the game's cues are red herrings, as you can basically go any area you want (Except South). Most of the story is told through pictures, and sfx the Npc's make.   There is a very sudden learning curve, some may not enjoy it. Many have compared HLD to Titan Souls, or the other Souls variety, and you can feel that difficulty. You'll begin dashing around, slashing with guns blazing, but soon develop strategies against tougher bosses or opponents. The town sells skills/upgrades to your base dash, guns, sword, etc through credits you'll find over the world through fights and secrets. They only provide a singluar base upgrade, and most times feel fundamental in several fights, so come back from time to time and buy them.   Hyper Light Drifter has ALOT of secrets and thus backtracking/exploration of the levels. Most times, you'll have to take a dash of faith to see what lies off a cliff side, and can feel plain silly at times. The little widget, however, does provide ? cues when near the area, so slow down and mash the char against walls.   The game took me about 7 hours to complete, and does have a New Game+ mode making the game harder. You'll find yourself backtracking, exploring, and enjoying the minigames around town and the world area. Frustrations will happen. But if you take it methodically, and analyze your actions/enemy moves, the game becomes all the much more fun.  Hyper Light Drifter was a wonderful experience, that you truly can't experience again if you've watched other play it. So I recomend you snag it for yourself. It may be difficult at first, but you soon grasp what is happening, and come to ease with the difficulty. The game is well polished enough that you shouldn't run into many issues, and the experience should entertain you as it did me :3",

Yeah, no. I have difficult games which are actually fun to learn.  Beside that, my biggest gripe with the game is the enviroments and 'exploration'. Due to the art style, it's extremely unclear what's an active element, where the floor is exactly, where vertical elements are (collision boxes basically) and where it's possible to go. You explore by whacking every edge of the map, looking for 'secrets' or pathways to other locations. Nevermind the character would actually see them head on and that they're only hidden because of the angle of the camera and us watching from above. I'd hate to argue on immersion in a game like this, but it does frustrate me greatly to be constantly reminded I'm not a Hyperlight Drifter, I'm a dude playing with a toy soldier, looking at it from high up.  I appreciate what the game does with narrative and how it tries to convey everything without words. It's really cool. But it doesn't work for me.

If you have to slap a warning label on it, that just means it isn't designed for other systems. Which is exactly the case. The PC controls are unpleasant. The aiming cursor supplied for the mouse is barely visible, especially in certain environments, and you can't use mouse keys to aim in place of a joystick either. Also there's some kind of bug where the controls keep randomly switching from PC controls to XBox/PS4 controls, sometimes in the middle of combat. I must be playing hardmode.  Some people have been saying the PC version is also locked to 30FPS. It seems that way to me too, because the controls feel very sluggish... Combine that with losing track of where my cursor is due to the fact that the thing is literally transparent, nevermind that I need a magnifying glass to see it in the first place, and basically PC players are playing this game handicapped.  Also on the note of the terrible controls, the controls aren't explained at all. If I'm not mistaken, this game has no text whatsoever beyond the intro screen and button designations on a few menus. This sounds fine until you actually get into the game and discover that you can't trigger the upgrades you just bought because they're so damn particular about their execution. In fact, even now knowing how to use them, I find them downright unreliable in combat. I think this can be partially attributed to the 30FPS problem.  The environments have a lot of holes in them, and I don't just mean the intentional ones. I've fallen through the map countless times while searching the trees for hidden areas. This even happens in areas where there are no cliffs. Given the limited (and unexplained) markings on your map as to what the heck you're supposed to be doing, this gets pretty frustrating when trying to merely  find  the next objective to progress the story.  Furthermore the game's promo talk of, 'alternate routes', is flat-out nonsense. This game is incredibly linear. The only way it could get more linear would be if they had made it a side-scroller.  I would forgive all of this except for one glaring issue, which everyone has the right to know  before  purchasing this game:   The credits include a special thanks to    Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian",

It looked gorgeous, it sounded gorgeous, it seemed to play gorgeous.  It's a shame they should've probably called it Overhyped Light Drifter instead.  It's not a fundamentally bad formula, but it's poorly executed. The almost-complete absence of words is great... if the game is entirely intuitive, which it isn't. The basic combat is a fine idea... if the controls aren't crap(seriously, the pistol mechanics? Why? Just why. Spiral Knights did basically the same controls, better, with mouse-and-keyboard, years ago. And that's a free-to-play game, the bottom of the barrel.). An absence of invincibility frames means that combat usually means one hit leads to a stunlock and you getting piled down to zero health. Enemies usually aren't challenging, they're just tedious, requiring you to do the same thing over and over again to kill them. And a dozen other small issues, wnone of which kill the game by themselves, but all of which, together, make it pretty unfun.  I could have forgiven most of this and done my best to enjoy the game, though, if not for the checkpoints.  Who ever thought it was a good idea to not put checkpoints in between instadeath traps? Or in between a tedious fight and an instadeath trap? I don't mind having to take a few tries and a bit of brainpower to get through a trap that can squish me in one go, but if you want to take that tack, please, don't make me have to redo OTHER parts every time I get squished, too.  And if you're going to require me to backtrack to doors that open up as I progress in other areas of the game... for God's sake don't have respawning enemies.  I really can't recommend that anyone buy this at all, barring some patch that really and truly overhauls the game.  It does really look and sound as nice as it did in the trailer, though, so I'd suggest waiting for some very patient LP'er to give it a spin, if you really have to see what they ended up making.",

Instead of improving your offensive strategies, using this awesome dashing ability the game gives you, and all the cool sword moves, you wait, play it safe and avoid risk, because risk is punished without mercy.  The enemies can stunlock you. It is a frequent occurance that you can lose 4 or so pips of your 5 pip health all at once without you being able to move or prevent your fate. From attacks that take two pips and knock you back to fall into a pit, take more damage, then respawn and have your character take forever to get up waiting for another blow because of course you're vulnerable since there's no i-frames... seriously this sort of thing happens TOO OFTEN.  'Surely that's like a one-time boss-fight situation sort of thing, right?' you may be wondering. No, this is not at all limited to boss fights, common enemies deal attacks that take two pips, common enemies can stun you, knock you back, anything really. Don't expect i-frames to help you, the game pretty much doesn't use i-frames.  'How is this different from dark souls?' you may also wonder. Well, dark souls gives the player opportunities to defend themselves vis a vis more health and armor, flasks, spells, etc. Without getting too specific, this game affords the player few opportunities to defend yourself and punishes you heavily, often, and without remorse.  I'm 90% of the way through the game and I do not want to finish it; it's not rewarding. It's a shame because it's visually enjoyable and the sound design is top-notch.",

Beautiful graphics, a nice ambient soundtrack, the ability to refill your pistol ammo by using your sword, and a game that seems like it would be very fast-paced and intense. However, there are two major flaws that make me not want to play it.  - Controls. For the most part, the controls feel great. However, there are two main complaints I have about the controls, one for keyboard and mouse, and one for controller. For keyboard and mouse, the dashing is absolutely horrible, since you have to use the mouse to aim your dash, but the spacebar to activate it. This makes dashing nearly impossible even outside of combat, just to get over the many small gaps the game places in your path. However, you might be saying, 'Well they DO tell you to use a controller'. And the controller is just as bad, but for the pistol instead of the dash. While you can merely right click where your cursor is to shoot and aim with keyboard and mouse, controller makes you use the movement joystick while holding LMB to shoot and aim, then press RMB. This means you need to completely stop moving to aim, rendering the pistol useless in combat.   - Health. Healthkits are limited, meaning if you use too many, screw you. You either have to go without health or restart. Because of how the pistol works on controller, you have to get close to enemies to hit them as well, making you have to take damage sometimes. This can make the game literally impossible to beat if you do the wrong thing at the wrong time.",

It's absolutely gorgeous, the sound and music are incredible, the gameplay is solid, but it is very difficult. Twitchy difficult. Like you have to combine luck and perfect execution for bosses difficult. This would be fine if death were well designed. You have a slow death animation, and a slow revive animation, and it uses a checkpoint system; so if you were screwed before getting into a boss fight, you're still screwed. I quit and returned the game after the fourth time dying in a room of enemies I'd seen before being able to hit me off screen or insta-kill me the moment I dropped in. This is a solved game design problem. There are better systems than this.  I was really excited and hyped for this game, and I am absolutely crushed that I won't be able to enjoy it.

First of all, it is the most unforgiving game I have ever experienced. No where near enough autosaves, too many enemies in too small rooms and no where near enough health restorations. There seems to be a recurring glitch where the screen will turn one solid coulour, too.  As well as that, there're absolutely no hints given about what to do in the game. I cannot get my head around the inventory or how to improve the attacks that you can perform whatsoever.   Also, you will hate how the game plays with a mouse and a keyboard, use a controller. The combination of having to move a mouse to face enemies and the fact that it feels so clunky would make parts of the game i have played with a controller near impossible. Which it seems to very nearly be, anyways,  Yet, despite all this, I would recommend this game, for sure. The combat is quick and flows excellently and the art style of the game is like a mixture of Fez and Another World, perhaps with a little Metroid. IE, it looks damn good.

Exploration:  This is one of the most immersive 2D games I've seen. Every bit of the map is beautiful, well-crafted and unique - even the most obscure secrets have a lot of cool details. Thorough exploration pays off significantly as there are an insane amount of secrets to find. (for those who would prefer skipping a lot of backtracking and secret-searching, it's not required to find many secrets to beat the game)   Combat:  Combat is quick, satisfying, and challenging. It often requires good reflexes and careful planning. I died often, but I rarely felt it wasn't my fault. Enemies and bosses have rigid patterns and attacks that can be quickly learned and exploited. Bosses are especially difficult and multiple attempts are expected, but it never felt hopelessly hard. It helps that the boss fights are cool as hell.   Story:  The story may be a weak point for some. Everything, including UI elements and speech, is told in pictures and scenery. The story is very loosely given and it leaves a lot of room for interpretation. On the other hand, the lack of text makes the environment far more effective at invoking a sense of awe and wonder.   Music/Sound:  The music is excellent and perfect for the game's setting. It's subtle but very situational and it changes dynamically as you progress through areas to match the tone.    Length:  The game will last anywhere from 3-4 hours (if you rush through) to 15+ hours for those who want to find everything. This is not including the additional New Game + mode and achievement-hunting (a no-death run sounds soul-crushing)   After beating this game twice, I wish I could experience it fresh again.",

Head there if you're having any issues getting the game to load.  It is still aggravating when one has to do these kinds of things to play a game, BUT at least the game is playable now, and it was a quick fix.  And let me tell you, this. game. is. amazing.  It's beautiful. The gameplay is precise and crisp. The 'story' is told in bursts of images and strange pictoral interactions with denizens of the world. Interaction with the world itself is explained in standard Legend of Zelda style; approach obstacle in safe spot, figure out how to interact, then deal with same obstacle later with enemies around. Rinse, repeat. Throw some actiony puzzles and pseudo-platforming in there, and you've got one hell of a game.  I'm excited to dump more time into this beautiful pixelated world.",

            "review_text": "This game is very fun, with a challenging yet simple combat system, multiple weapons, diverse enemies, and more. My only problem is that the game really needs more of a tutorial. You get the gist that the giant shadow thing is the bad guys, you learn how to stab and shoot, and nothing else. When you start the game, you are pretty much just wandering around hoping you accomplish something. You walk in a random direction and see where it takes you. For me, I walked into the Barren Hills, which is completely walled off at the beggining, but how are you supposed to know that? Sure, there is a giant indestructable wall in the entrance, but I just thought it was a puzzle and spent 30 minutes walking around before I gave up. I then walked into the Lake, where I killed some frog bombers and mushroom ninjas, then left. This repeated a few more times with different areas, until I realized I was supposed to find the triangles scattered around the map to unlock the boss and kill him. I ended up killing the northern wizard boss first, and although he was pretty difficult, after a few tries you learned how to dodge his attacks and crush him. I went back to the Lake, killed the boss there after about an hour of searching, then went to the last area I could acces, the Crystal Forest. This place has (in my opinion) the hardest enemies, most confusing layout, and most annoying to get shards (triangles). Its an absolute pain to navigate it, and I pretty much got all the shards and to the bossfight by just walking around, getting lost, ending back where I began, then finally getting lucky and ending up somewhere. Despite all that negativity I just wrote, I still highly recommend the games if you are a fan of hack and slash RPGs.",

            "review_text": "It's not that rare to find an indie game inspired by Zelda, Metroid, Secret of Mana, etc. - that's getting to be pretty well-worn ground these days. What *is* surprising is to find a game that lives up to those inspirations while also carving out its own areas of unique excellence. Hyper Light Drifter distingushes itself through its stunning visual design, meaty action gameplay, moody soundtrack, and hauntingly minimalist world building. I have some critiques but they are mostly just nitpicks...on the whole, this is an absolute *must-play* for any fan of challenging action games.  + The combat feels incredibly satisfying, your sword attack combo hits with a heavy 'thwak' that just feels great. It feels awesome to pull off a combo on an enemy, dash away to avoid their attack, and then dash back in for the finishing blow.  + Oozing atmosphere, the whole game is a masterclass in savvy and thoughtful art direction. Almost every section of the world is filled with the rusty husks of old robots, the dead and decaying remains of giant monsters, the ruins of an old but super-advanced society, etc. The little bits we get of the world and its history are incredibly compelling and very cleverly done...I definitely wanted *more* but I know that would be defeating the point.  + Disasterpeace was an ideal fit for the soundtrack - you really feel like a lonely wanderer in an alien world, kind of a Vangelis/Blade Runner kind of vibe. And when that boss theme kicks in, you know that serious business is about to go down.  + Challenging but fair. When you die, it's your fault. It's mostly just practice and getting used to enemy patterns. By the end of the game, I was able to beat the final bosses in a fraction of the time that it took me to beat some of the first bosses. This was less because I got strong upgrades (the upgrades mostly don't matter that much, I felt) and more from just spending time with the game.  + To me, a game like this lives or dies on its boss fights, and I wasn't disappointed here. The bosses are very memorable and tough and well-designed, I especially enjoyed the boss of the western crystal lands and the final bosses. You'll need to use all of your techniques, skills, reflexes, everything the game has taught you, and every trick you learned to exploit an enemy's weakness.  + A lot of replayability. I've beaten the game, but I didn't find all the keys, get all the secret nodes, beat that dang soccer kid (you'll see, he might be the hardest boss in the game), etc. After you've beaten the game, your last save will start off just before the final boss, so you'll still be able to go back and explore the world. There's also a New Game + option that is essentially just hard mode (you get less health but you start with all the upgrades) as far as I can see, but that doesn't interest me too much.  = The dash mechanic doesn't feel that great to use when you need to chain together repeated dashes, I could never really get the hang of doing more than a few dashes at once. I know others don't have this problem, your mileage may vary.  - Not a lot of enemy variety...each zone has its own unique monsters, but there are also a lot of repeats. Not the biggest deal in the world, but you'll find yourself fighting the same mobs over and over.  - Exploration isn't always super-compelling. You discover these awesome secret tunnels and special passages and then they just lead to...a health pack or a money bit. There aren't really any paths that lead to super-secret dungeons or crazy weapons or ultimate bosses or anything like that. There are some optional bosses in a certain area, but the game map tells you where to go. I would have liked a little more payoff for going off the beaten track.  - The game map is really vague and just a little bit too cryptic, it gives you a general idea of where you are but isn't always that helpful.",

            "review_text": "What to say. Words that compliment such a great game escape me. So lets go through this one step at a time. Strap yourself in this is gonna be a long one.  -Visuals- It is an amazingly beautiful game. Colorful yet somber at the same time. Each area has its own style and the enemies you face are part of that style. I don't have much to say, it's just such a beautiful game I found myself taking screenshots every so often to capture some amazing new sight.  -Story- I finished the game just as confused about the story as when I started, and I love that. I love games with a confusing story, one that reveals itself one step at a time and through the players actions and not just on its own. I guess this is why some people compare it to Dark Souls. Indeed the way their stories are set up and displayed is very similar. Throughout the whole game I found myself wandering through this war torn land just wondering what had happened.  -Gameplay/Combat- Lets start by talking about the in-town stuff here. The upgrade system here is very unique. You go along on your adventure and collect gears, four gears equals one point. The usual cost for upgrades is three points, which is pretty reasonable seeing as I almost had every upgrade by the end of the game. And I must say, it is quite a rewarding feeling beeting a boss, getting some gears, and going back to town to upgrade. It's a nice feeling of progression that I love.  Now for the combat. I absolutely love it. It's inventive and fast pased and just so fun. I love going into a room and getting ambushed. I'll dash to the first guy take him out in a couple slices, snipe the farthest guy with my laser rifle, throw a bomb and take out five more, and finally dash slice through the last bad guy. I found myself approaching the same areas in different ways and adjusting my level of aggression based on what enemies I fought. If a ranged enemy shoots a missile at me from afar I'll slice it in two and quick dash towards him for a heavy slice. Honestly I could go on with this forever. So moving on then.  -Bosses- Bosses get their own catagory because I feel in a game like this they are very important. Each boss has its own move set one that as you die and retry, you learn and adjust to. They are hard, very hard, that is if you go into it head on. Each boss makes you take a step back and think about each action you make, if you have time to heal, or how you might dodge this attack. I had the most trouble with the northern boss (spoilers), his ground AOE attacks were hard to get used to and you spend most of your time franticly dodging. I might have died twenty times to that guy. But you know what, I had so much fun. And most of all, it feels amazingly rewarding when you take a boss out, you may feel a weight lifted from your shoulders, knowing you bested one of the hardest enemies of the game.  -Conclusion- Its a great game. If you like Dark Souls, adventure, wonder, great art. and great music get this game...please. I haven't had so much fun in a mere ten and a half hours in a long time.",

        {
            "review_text": "I loved this game so much! It is such an innovative experience, I wish more games were like this!  What I loved:  - 'Hands-off' Game Progression: The game espouses a welcome change from mainstream gaming and does not tell you how to progress, or force you into a single path of gameplay, much like its inspiration, The Legend of Zelda. There is a notable exception to this general rule, but this was done (I assume) for gameplay and story reasons.  - Exploration is Key: The game has done away with archaic concepts such as 'Lives' and 'Game Overs' or 'Continues'. Instead, the player is merely halted or impeded from progressing until the player solves the puzzle, or has acquired the necessary item to continue.  - Focus on Visual Style: The game relies very heavily on visual cues and detail to convey critical concepts and plot to the player, with sounds playing a secondary (but no less vital role).  - Excellent Controls: The controls and combat style is fresh and fluid, and has a unique dynamic that is only improved as the player upgrades his abilities on their adventure. The techniques available to the player have an endearing 'Easy to Learn, Hard to Master' quality to them, and radically alter the nature of combat in relation to the level of skill the player has, and his experience in dealing with enemy types. No matter how far the player has progressed, however, every enemy encounter has to be treated with a special form of respect or the player may find themselves surprisingly overwhelmed. I found this to add a welcome idea that even the super-skilled bad*** the player may become can still be done in by a rookie mistake.  - Superb Sound: For the most part the soundtrack is wonderful, the music and compostion are top-notch, and they lend themselves well to the various places and atmospheres the player will encounter in their travels. A side note: the sounds can grate on the senses after a while, especially if the player does not adjust the levels in the options menu to suit their preferences.  - Rich Level Design: What more can I say? Secrets abound in this game, and it stirs rewarding feelings in intrepid players who love nothing more than sweeping every nook and cranny of the map for treasure and hidden things! The top-down perspective really allows for some interesting ways to hide things and places from everyone but the most observant seeker.   What I Didn't Like:  - Rudimentary Map: The game in one instance borrows a bit too heavily from Legend of Zelda, in that the map is extremely limited in terms of function. This is mostly done to challenge the player to recognize their surroundings and where they are in relation to landmarks, but is it too much to ask to have a waypoint system? Or some kind of markers that can be placed on the map to make it easier to go back to secret areas or locked doors that you have found? I found myself (with my dubious art skills) trying to hand-draw maps on paper to remember where I found certain secrets. Immersion is one thing, but surely it wouldn't be very hard to code something like that into the game?  - Inscrutable Depth: Given that the greater part of the story is presented visually, it came as both a surprise and a bit of a gyp that there is text in the game, but that it is encoded in some kind of moon-man runic script, but the game itself does not offer you a cipher to decode it and find out what it means. I have heard rumors that some fans have actually run the script through translation programs and algorithms and gotten legible and understandable english text as a result, and that these shed more light onto the world of Hyper Light Drifter. I will admit that this is cool, but what about those players who do not have specialized cryptographic knowledge? Like me. I really love the game and the amount of love that the developers put into it, but the story of a game shouldn't play out like the Watergate investigation; I should be able to, without a guide or undue outside help, work on my own to discover the mysteries of the game. How hard is it to include a book or some kind of tablet somewhere in the game that would help you work out what these symbols mean? If anything, it would be a very good reward for players like me who are dedicated enough to seek out the answers within the game.  - Minigames: I don't wan't to spoil any secret minigames so I will refer to them in code.  (A) Dash: The second tier challenge is sheer torture. I wasn't having fun, and it is quite possibly the most horrible thing about the game. I can't imagine any reward in the game (or outside it) being worth completion of that particular minigame.  (B) Ball: Screw this minigame. Holy ****. Your opponent is way too hard from the get-go (he likes to trip you, the little ****), and if that wasn't enough, your character controls the ball like a palsy patient. Yeah, I didn't really feel an overwhelming need to throw myself with gusto into this one, which is kind of an insult considering how wonderfully inviting the rest of the game is.  (C) Fight: Nothing wrong with this one, just a good ol' endurance mode, and you can practice your skills here. I got the reward, and it had the same problem as the other minigames, which is that the juice doesn't justify the squeeze.  What New Players May Experience:  - Steep Difficulty Curve: New players may find the game akin to running their head against a brick wall repeatedly in the hopes that it will break and on the other side will be success. The game kind of dunks you into an ice-cold bath of mistakes, failures, and forcing you to use your head to solve puzzles and find treasure that many gamers might feel unappealing or downright impossible; coming from mainstream games that actually offer you tips and hints if you are stuck, or downright telling you where to go (as is the case with most modern First-Person Shooters).  - Negative Space Syndrome: Okay, this is my amateurish attempt at pop psychology. This game has a lot of quiet moments and a distinct lack of text when it comes to explaining things to the player, so the player might feel a certain distance between themselves and the game that is hard to overcome, especially pertaining to the storyline and the interactions with Non-Player Characters.",

Like a drug addict you always want more, so you push into the next area, ready to slice some scrubs.

Super high praise for this game.   • The controls are slick and modern. • The combat is satisfying and challenging. • The worldbuilding is beautiful. • The audio is lovely all around. • The upgrade system is rewarding. • It's full of charm/peace mixed with the right kind of disturbing in contrast • There's tons of secrets to discover • The consequence for death isn't annoying (at least 95% of the time anyway) • Things like UI, story panels, interacting with items, and general technical progression are unique and smartly done. (I love how you can't buy things by mistake due to the 'charge up to complete interaction' mechanic. Excellent)  This game made me want to make games much more and alot of designers should take cue from what is at work here.  My crits on this game are that the story has lots of things unapologetically unexplained and cryptic. When you finish the game you have a -slight- sense for what happened but not why certain things existed at all, their relevance all over the world, people's motives, or much of who you are. The main character could have used more a bit more digestable/relatable presence. I want a comic to go with this that fills in way too many blanks. Also there are some unrealistic expectations specifically regarding CONTINUOUS DRIFTING. Perhaps it was latency on my joypad or some disconnect with the core mechanic but I maxed out at about 9 or 10 simutaneous drifts at any given time despite a butt-ton of practice and watching tutorials. (And don't 'get gud' me. Hours of technically probing the timing requirements for drifting and it always arbitrarily interrupts for one reason or another. And yes I know it goes slow to fast then levels off in sequence.) The continuous drift system is far too unforgiving and headachey. A lot of secret places require drifting like 20-30 times in a row where you have to change directions several times during and one achievement wants *800* (The hell were you guys thinking with that, seriously.) I feel like either the timing on what it takes to drift should be made more possible or if not at first, allow us to buy an upgrade that makes the damn thing doable for people other than 12 year olds who just had an energy drink ♥♥♥♥♥.  My little rant about that hair pulling mess aside, I don't usually want to replay games and I want to get back into the HLD world again just to be there. Well done Heart Machine. Very well done.",

It's beautiful and there's so much to explore. I got to the final battle after about 10 hours of game play. With that being said speedrunners finish in about 30 minutes in Any% category. The game's primary objectives can be done quickly especially given the tight controls giving players the ability to get better and better over time at clearing rooms of various enemies. However, the real joy I find in this game is finding all the little nooks and crannies that the devs carefully placed just so that they are always there, always just visible.  I also fell in love with, that feels like, the call back to older classics (I know it is still used today but I don't get to see this near as much as I would like) that used level design to teach you how to approach more complicated situations. There is a primary tutorial area allowing you to learn the basic controls but whenever you come across a new enemy or new source of danger the game either has a way of letting you know or gives you health packs nearby.  The level designs are extraordinarily thought out and the visuals are amazing given the style.

Visually the game is breath taking for it to be 2d. The music is on point. It has a Tron vibe going on with it.  Imagine Zelda in a way. Its much more challenging though. Very tough at some points. You have to put in the time and learn the patterns of enemies and bosses. There is no leveling. Colllecting items is a must. You must do so to aquire new abilities!

Combat is rhythmic and punishes you for impatience but the game will reward you plenty for exploration.

You get broad sectors to explore but its never truely open world or places you in a expansive area. Its that kind of linear progression with hidden areas alongside- although there are hubs for each sector that come with a well-welcomed openness. In each sector there are routes that lead to several mini-dungeons that you can in which ever order you want. The exploration is mandatory for upgrades but the currency system is a steep 12 collectables = 1 upgrade. There are keys and cosmetic bonuses to find as well but the harsh economy removed much of the reward.  I wouldn't say its a nitpick but I also wouldn't say it preventing me from having a good time.

Yet very few pixel art games end up looking as impressively gorgeous as Hyper Light Drifter. I can't imagine how many hours must've been spent building and animating its sprawling world, but it has definitely been time well spent.  HLD is an open world action adventure with heavy focus on combat and exploration. You got your hub city where you buy upgrades with the currency gathered from the game's four separate wilderness areas, most of which are available for you to roam at any time. There really aren't any puzzles besides finding weaknesses in enemies attack patterns and figuring your way through the crumbled ruins of a once-great civilization.  Everything in this post-apocalytic fantasy world is dying, including you. The mystical intro sequence seems to depict some kind of great evil being stirred awake as a result of catastrophic event that annihilates most of the populus. While chaos and primitive anarchy embrace the remaining survivors outside the city, you as a lone drifter find yourself in the last bastion of civility, tasked with bringing the derelict machinery back into motion.  Much is left for interpretation. The story is told entirely visually, and there's no text or voice. And as mentioned before, those visuals have a heck of story to tell. The atmosphere in the game is ominous, mysterious, even dreamlike -- Elevated even higher by Disasterpeace's excellent soundtrack. There are small details and secrets everywhere that make the journey a constantly fascinating one.  The control scheme is comfortingly simple, allowing the combat complexities to arise from the enemy numbers. Very often you're fighting five or more enemies at once, bobbing and weaving around the battlefield with your signature dash ability and delivering lethal sword strikes at close range. Nimble fingers and a tactical approach are certainly required, especially when encountering bosses who can regularly end you with just a couple of blows if given the chance.  Hyper Light Drifter has a fully realized, imaginative vision, an impeccable sense of style and hours of satisfying gameplay. Last year I really enjoyed Axiom Verge's modernized take on retro game design, but I think I like this one even more.",

You are free to explore the world in any direction you feel like (I suggest you start with east) and every part of it, is filled with details and secrets (that I suggest you start looking for).   In terms of gameplay: it has very similar feel to it as Dark souls or Bloodborne (pacing is faster than Bloodborne), meaning that you need to dodge almost attack through the use of the cool dash ability. There is no way that your character will be able to tank the attacks. So as the Souls community would say: GIT GUD  The story is told in a very unique way, since there is not a single word spoken in the game, but neither is there a single writtten word.

Be sure to get the multiple dash upgrade........it almost feels like a requirement (I think they should've let you just have it from the beginning...but whatever) and it is ridiculously fun dashing around like a maniac.

Each fight feels earned espcially boss fights. Overall very satisfying  I got Hyper Light Drifter on a whim, it looked like a cute little game and I was looking for something that had some metroidvania elements and it looked fun. It started with an amazing cinmatic that had me going from ??? to !!! and then finally ?!?!?!   Story-wise, I'm not saying anything. HLD is one of those game that's best experianced the less you know about it. It never overstayed it's welcome and was very enthralling, having my attention the whole time I was playing.  There is no dialouge in the game, at all, the only text there is anywhere is in the menu and parts of the tutorial (like 'press Y to interact' or 'LB to heal') other than that everything is purely visual, and left up to Player Interpretation which is neat! NPCs will tell you (The Drifter) stories but it'll be in pictures where you have to peice together what happened and why. There's shopkeepers but even there is no dialouge or text for what you can buy, pictures with examples of what it is. The fanbase and the wiki have given them names such as 'Dash Master' for the shopkeeper who sells Dash Upgrades.  The combat is perfect and nothing feels out of place, while I'd love a parry ability I have a feeling that Drifter will get by just fine without it. You have only three swings of your sword at once before you will have to either use your gun or back away, most enemies only have 3 hits. It's fairly easy to balance using your gun, optional bomb, and your sword while dashing around the room. With various upgrades combat gets easier but it can also build overconfidence. Loads of times I'd walk away from the battle with only 1 out of my 3 medkits and still only have 1 hp left because 'oh I'll be fine, I have all the upgrades for my sword and dashing!' and would promptly get stomped.   The music is perfect, when things are calm it fits the mood and helps create a peaceful atmosphere. There's parts of the game where the sound is discorient and 'glitchy' to set you off and god does it do that well. The battle music is LOUD and intense especially when you're fighting a boss, I found it at times it was hard for me to keep my cool with both the music making me excited and the boss fight freaking me out with their respective attacks.   There's tons of secrets one can go find, lots of swords, cloaks, sprites (little robo dude who follows you around) as well as gearbits (currency) to help make getting the upgrades easier. Prepair for keyhunting if you're a completionist, there's at least one door that requires all of them. There's guns that you can only get through this exploration and it's really cool  Chain dashing was possibly the best thing in the game 10/10 would again smash my face against every wall, tree, bush, and rock in the game. Heart Machine really pulled through with making you actually fall down, make a crashing noise when you hit the surface, and then get up after a second. There's two challenges at Dash Master's for chain dashing, one for 100 dashes and one for 800 dashes. Do them, you won't regret it.  If you decide 'well I don't think that's challenging enough' there's an achivement for never dying ever in the game, as well as NG+ that strips you of 3 of your hit points. Normally you have 5, in NG+ you have 2. Welcome to hell",

Anyways the flaws of the game include the 30 fps and the fact that the second level of the dashing challenge IS TOO DIFFICULT I SPENT HOURS, but I never minded 30 fps games and didn't really notice problems with it (I might just be bad at noticing or it's just because I played a lot of 30 fps games). The positives of this game are the exploration, because you don't have to find all the secrets of the game, and finding the secrets of the game that actually reveal the plot are completely optional but there will always be noticeable signs that lead you to them if you keep your eyes open. In short, I loved this game, I loved creating theories while also looking stuff up that I couldn't for the life of me figure out, and a fair warning, if you're doing a new game plus run, the northern boss is the most difficult. I used a mouse for it and it felt like most fights were easier because of it except that one. Get ready to die. If you've played dark souls you should be fine.",

Pros - Great soundtrack. - Smooth gameplay, controls feel amazing and respond quickly. - Art and Style of the game are amazing to look at. - Has a New Game+, so if you want more on a harder difficulty, look further no more! - Local Co-Op. (Now, I played the game before this update, so I can't say much about it.) -Upgrade Trees. Almost like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Based on your play style, you upgrade certain skills to help that style. Ex: You get multiple ranged weapons throughout the game, and can choose which one to use in combat. If you prefer the shotgun, you upgrade the ammo capacity, or if you prefer the pistol, you upgrade that weapon. Cons - The story. Now, it is there, but it's very difficult to piece together, since the story is told through images. Not a bad thing, but if you want to have the story laid out in front of you, this isn't your game. - Game can get hard at times, making the player salty. Then again, I'm not the best at playing games. All in all, this game is solid. The price is ok, not the best.

It can be frustrating at times, but nothing a brief break wouldn't fix. It's still early in the year, but I have no problem saying it'll stay in my top 3 for 2016.",

If you are someone who can appreciate challenging combat that forces you to improve and get better, this is worth your time.

The game tells so much with so little, it's almost poetic.   The soundtrack is great, Disasterpiece made some incredible tunes. It can sound so lonely and melancholic at a desolate plain and energetic in the fray of a battle.  Gameplay wise, i think it feels great. Contrary from what a lot of people are saying, the 30fps lock doesn't hurt me AT ALL. The game plays slick and nice. The controls feels tight and responsive and the combat flows really nice. Some reviews mention something like 'too hard of a difficulty' or an 'unpolished combat', but i think this is a understatement. The game IS challenging and the combat CAN be rough sometimes, but it's nothing like an UNFAIR game or a design flaw. The game simply ask you to be careful and try your best. Death means little in this game, the lack of punishment for death means you can try again and again and become better as the game goes by.   Anyway, play this game.",

I picked up the game upon release simply because the trailer looked interesting, and I can safely say I was not dissapointed. The pixel artstyle is absolutly phenomenal, with the color scheme (neon greens, pinks, blues) reflecting the very chill atmosphere the game has altogether.  The soft electronic music in the background adds a very mysterious and almost sad atmosphere, and really serves to drive home the immersion. You are a drifter in a world run amock by unexplained powers, everywhere you look there is death and decay in abundance. Wandering (drifting, if you will) through these vast wastelands and gazing upon scenes of past conflict really brought me to complete awestruck silence.  As for combat, the game very much delivers. Hyper Light Drifter provides a fun, fast paced bullet hell enviroment to the player. Given you only have five health, and most enemies deal 2-3 damage on average, it really serves to amp up the pressure. Every attack seems like a death sentence hurtling towards you at breakneck speed, but given the drifter's dash ability I felt like a f****** ninja all the way through, dodging lethal attacks in an instant and dashing behind a foe to slice him in half.   Unlike many games now, HLD was very challenging for me. It is a very non-linear experience, and I always enjoy a challenge. The map was extremely vague whilst searching for certain items to complete the storyline, and I adore this idea. I had to find each one for myself, slashing at walls and bushes to see if any pathway was hiding in the undergrowth, or backtrack many times and find a place I had never explored before. If you are a person who enjoys exploration, I suggest picking this game up immediately.  As for the non-linear story, I also enjoyed it. It allowed me to go off on my own and find things out for myself, not just have the game's helping hand give everything to me without even trying. Another important note is that the game contains no dialogue, but rather characters tell the story through pictures. Each cutscene is also beautifully animated, and I like to think the games story exists for your own interpretation. (Side Note: If you like cryptic codes, there is also plenty of secrets in the game for you to find as well)  All in all, Hyper Light Drifter is my favorite game at the moment. It is stunning visually, and the gameplay has enough variation and enemy variety that it never seems repetitive. I would give this game a solid 10/10 because it is a fabulous indie title, very different and refreshing to see so early in the year.

The Drifter is young and is afflicted by a terrible disease that ravages their heart, causing them great pain and making them cough up copius amounts of blood. Despite this, The Drifter journeys across the world seeking a cure.   What makes Hyper Light Drifter such a memorable and special experience more than anything is that everything fits nicely into place. Exploring, Battling enemies, and finding items is what Hyper Light Drifter is all about, and each one serves the other in some way.  The gameplay consists of zipping around the world with your Hyper Dash ability. Drifter can dash a set distance at the push of a button. This mechanic makes HLD feel so incredibly slick. It's also a very versatile ability to have, as it helps you to traverse the environment, move insanely fast, and dodge attacks during battle.   Using your Hard Light sword, your EMP Grenades, and your Cell Battery Firearms, you'll Slash, Rend, Cleave, Stab, Slam, Blast, Shoot, Snipe, and Frag your way through hordes of enemies, all the while dancing through danger with your Hyper Dash. The combat is difficult to master, but very easy to understand. It's visceral and fast paced, without being impossible to deal with.  As you progress through the game and explore the vast, ruinous world. you will find treasures like weapons, clothing, currency, and Power Cells. But that's not all you will encounter. Around every corner could be gorgeous landscapes, or horrid and savage scenarios. The world is full of death, dismemberment, and fallen Gods.  The story of HLD is largely open to interpretation, and is a discovery in and of itself. You will happen upon gruesome scenes of violence and death, breathtakingly beautiful vistas, and mysterious, obtuse imagery that begs you to put more thought into what you're looking at. This to me is the real treasure of Hyper Light Drifter. Finding out what happened to this world, and learning your place within it is more fulfilling than any fancy gun the game could ever give me. There is so much to think about regarding the game's lore, and there is even a language in the game that you need to actually translate yourself to understand. If you thought your discovery ended inside the game, it does not. It seeps out of the screen into your real life and implores you to ask more questions.  &lt;TLDR: I highly recommend Hyper Light Drifter. If you love action, it has all the pulse pounding battles you could ever want. If you love exploration and adventure, there are treasures. and secrets abound. If you want to know more about the ancient history of a broken alien world, you have lots to investigate. And if you simply love beautiful, hand animated, colorful pixel art, this is one of the greatest showcases of Pixel art on the market.&gt;  Happy Drifting!",

Enemies animate very well, telegraph all their attacks, and projectiles are very visible. Music set the mood for the different areas and the sounds enemies made fit them well. There is a npc in the main town that plays guitar along with the game music.  The combat is very difficult, fast paced, and rewarding.  Dash around extremely fast dodging enemies and projectiles,  fire your gun to take out ranged enemies,  slash your sword to take out multiple enemies quickly in melee combat and regenerate ammo for your gun,  throw a grenade to blast enemies within a radius,  and die many times to finally kill a boss that can do all of those things and more much better than you!  The story is pretty cryptic and I like that. The game has its own language making everything hard to understand and look really alien. Some characters tell stories to the player through pictures.

The art style is great, too, in that it really conveys the tension and distress of the world as well as the illness you and others have.

            "review_text": "I bought this game on an impulse. I looked at it, and I thought it looked like an easy, fun way to spend a few hours on a Zelda-like adventure. I was compleatly correct in buying it, but oh so wrong about why. This game is essentially a piece of art. It is elegant, smooth, and simplistic, while also being tough, gritty, and downright difficult. It is truly wonderful.  Pros:  - Great concept, the dashing mechanic makes your character feel lightweight, making it engaging to dodge attacks.  - Gorgeous pixel art, seriously I dont think I've seen a more beautiful game than this in a while. The colors of the different sections of the game have a serious effect on you.   For instance, the light greens and the blue of the water in the eastern area make the setting feel free and open, while the dark blues and purples of the west make the area feel repressed and dark.    - Wonderful soundtrack, the creative electronic sounds add a certain weight to the music that I haven't heard from anything else.  - Tells you virtually nothing except how to execute basic actions. Nothing about where you're going, why you're going, or how you're going. This allows you to create you're own reasons for doing what you do, and to really think about what is really going on. This is an idea that is becoming popular in today's gaming, like Undertale or any of the Telltale games, but this game presents the idea in a different way. Instead of making you  choose  what you're doing, it makes you  wonder why  you're doing it.   Cons: - While the lack of direction in the game is extreamly well done in most places, there's a few things I wish were more clarified. For instance,   the goal in the first three areas of the game is to acquire four of these little white diamond things to progress to the boss fight. This is not made clear to the player, and it took me a good amount of time to figure out what was happening and what I was supposed to do. Also, the first three areas can be completed in any order you like, but this was somewhat confusing and it left me with a feeling of doubt as to what I was doing was the correct thing to do.   While I found these to be problem areas of the game, I'm sure some people would really appreciate these features, so remember this is only my opinion.  - Some of the boss fights, to me, felt much easier than others. I feel like this would be ok, if they approached the game without   letting you complete the first three areas in any order,   but if they implemented that mechanic then they should have balanced the fights more. For example,    I completed the first three areas in this order: North, East, then West. Out of those three bosses, the North was the most challenging for me, the West the second, then the East by far being the easiest. The North and West bosses I spent at least an hour to two hours trying to complete, and when I finally beat them I had already memorized all of their attack patterns. However, I beat the Eastern boss in one try, and it barely attacked once before I killed it. It was so easy that I thought for a good thirty seconds that the   real   boss was going to pop out and kill me. But that was the actual boss. The North and West bosses are probably equal in difficulty, and the North boss was probably harder for me because I fought him first, while with the West I already had experience with the game, but the East boss was just stupid easy.    Conclusion: While the cons section may appear thick with critisism, most of that writing is explanations for why I disliked a tiny detail. In all, those details do very little to affect the whole game, which is truly a masterpeice. I strongly reccomend purchasing this game, and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.  Verdict: 9.5/10",

The controls feel just right, and enemies rarely rely on cheap tricks, so deaths never feel unfair. Despite the lack of text, understanding the plot and systems is easy thanks to some vivid images and clear diagrams. Upgrades give you that sense of getting better, but are not so overpowered that you eventually steamroll the entire game. The only criticism is that the map is not as informative as it could be, only telling you the general area you're in and not your exact location. While it keeps finding the secrets challenging, it makes moving from one area to another a chore. Otherwise, this game is highly recommended if you're looking for a good challenge.",

I have some pretty strong feelings about this game, so it seems only natural that this be the one I review and explain my 'write-in' category nomination for. This game provides real, intense action like I've never seen in a game before, like you would never believe that pixel art can.  The art and music are amazing, before we forget to mention those, and were the things that first drew me in while the game was in development. Character design is diverse but functional; backgrounds, lighting, and color, are all striking and just pleasant to look at with their blend of darks and neons, natural tones and eerie glows; and all of it is tied together beautifully with that gorgeous soundtrack that gives the impression that you really have stepped into a lost, alien world. But artistic appeal wasn't a category in the Steam Awards and, as incredible as it is in 'Hyper Light Drifter', that wasn't even my favorite part of the game.  My favorite part was the action. Dashing, slashing, and shooting your way through traps, obstacles, and a whole lot of bad things lurking in the dark, you have all the tools you need to dance your way through them without taking a scratch right at the outset. You will not. As deadly as you are, you are very mortal and you must learn the flow of combat, when to press your advantage and when to withdraw, in order to survive each encounter.  Death, of course, is inevitable. This game does not hold your hand as you explore its ruins. You must learn through experience and experience is earned through some degree of repetition. Death is not cruel, however, and any sticking points can be backed out of to return to later, sometimes skipped over as optional challenges if necessary, and are engaging enough you probably won't want to anyway. The result is potent challenges which remain fresh and intense as you hone your skills until you surpass them. As an added bonus, once you have, the victory flourish your character performs after such segments is immensely satisfying.  Which brings me to the subject of victory, the sense of victory that 'Hyper Light Drifter' provides above and beyond all the other games I've ever played. There is more than a mere destination in Hyper Light Drifter. There is comparitively very little in the way of static upgrades in power to accumulate along your journey. There is a challenge, posed to you throughout the experience of playing, and there is the skill and drive you have to overcome it. Odds which once seemed impossible come into perspective upon playing through them again and, looking back, you can see how much you've grown. No artificial boost or cheap trick did it for you. You really, truly won.  I went back and played through on the harder, New Game+ mode, then went back again and again and again in pursuit of the elusive 'One Shot' achievement, and through my experience with this game I can truly say, 'Winning this game feels like real victory.'",

It depends on the game, but usually I am not a fan of collectibles.

Idk if it's just that the callenge isn'y made correctly or what but i just find it boring after a bit. Even though i've said that though i'd recomend this game to anyone who loved zelda.",

The soundtrack is insane and while a bit loud at first it truely captures and sets the atmosphere of the game perfectly. As for combat, I am a huge Souls fan, this game reminded me so much of dark souls in the simple to learn but near impossible to master. The dodging (or perhapse drifting?) takes a bit to get used to but after the firt 30 minutes or so of play I found myself incorperating it into the extremely fluid combat in this game. Overall this is definitely one of the best games I have ever played and for me it sits way up in the top seats for best expiriences and fun I have had with a game. (I wish I could check the reccomend box like 50 times)",

            "review_text": "Not so sure how to feel about this game... a lot of this game is just swarming you with enemies. When you dodge twice, you are immobilized for a second and all the enemies kill you, and if they didn't then you wouldn't be able to dodge anyway because of the snipers. Then it takes SO long to respawn, and is really obnoxious. Not to mention if you go too fast then you will slide off the edge into an abyss and take damage. And I feel like a lot of progressing the game is just walking around in no clear direction and trying to find the secrets, which ends up most of the time you thinking something is a requirement to the story and then dashing to it but you can't make it and take extra damage. I understand the difficulty, but sometimes it is just dumb. I'm going to play more but if it keeps up like this then I might have to stop. I really want to love this game, it is stunningly beautiful in an odd way, very cool, but these problems can be really frustrating.",
