When the Quake 3 engine was still king and everyone still waited for Duke Nukem Forever.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein's most memorable element to me is its simplicity. It is very similar to Wolfy 3D in that you basically do two things in this game: Kill Nazis and find treasure. Infact it is to the game's benefit as it has aged startlingly well for a game from 2001. It encorporated elements like secret areas, treasure, eating food to restore your health etc, and added slightly more fantastical designs like mutants and zombies. RtcW is more linear than the previous game, but it has extremely good pacing and map design. You uncover shortcuts back to prior areas, and always feel in control in gunfights.  It's a shame RtcW isn't talked about as often as other games from it's era, since it is one of the best games Id ever published. A game that is just as epic as the name it carries.",

Just simply doesnt peak your interest.  I however love this game and everything about it and yes I'm being a little biased as shown ovbiously there are some bugs here or there due to when the game was made but nothing game breaking maybe just a moment where in the boss fight they repeat dialogue or get stuck here or there. So rating this game off of it's time and pure nostalgia. 10/10 off of comparison to games now 4/10 however that wouldn't do this game right so yes i recommend it this game, ",

            "review_text": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a borderline Recommend (call it 3 stars out of 5). First, the good: the story that drives the game is a good one and, for a game initially released back in 2001, the graphics are pretty good. The cut-scenes and voice acting are also pretty good. The initial key-binding are awful, but with a little effort they can be made to approximate current bindings.  Now, for the less-than-good: there's nothing really wrong with the game, but the fact that the player can't affect the outcome in any way drags it down for me. Specifically, most levels have Secret Areas (SAs) and Treasures. But, whether or not you enter those SAs or pick up any Treasures is irrelevant. You get nothing useful outside of the box saying you've found all the SAs/Treasures when you leave the level (and maybe some additional health, ammo, or armor). Also, even though I used 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein Single Player v1.42c Unofficial Patch' to fix various bugs and allow me to use my standard 1920x1200 resolution, I still ran across a few glitches associated with those SAs. Specifically, in one case, even though I found, opened and looted a certain SA, the game refused to give me the credit for it. In another case, when I entered one SA, I couldn't manage to leave it. Also, in every level, you can go back to search for the SAs once you've cleared the it of enemies. Except for one level. But, again, that means nothing to how the game plays out.  So, all-in-all, it's an OK game. If you favor straight shooters over more quest-driven action games, you'll probably like this better than I did. It's currently listing for about $10 and is on sale for $5. At $5, it's a buy. At $10, you might want to think about it a bit.",

The game has more brown and grey then a concrete restroom at Taco Bell. Wolfenstein 3D has more colors. The forced stealth level at the begining of mission 2  Despite being almost 15 years old RtCW has held up incredibly well. Gunplay is tight and fluid and the weapon selection can pretty much fit any play style or situation. Level flow is very good, nither feeling overly confusing or like someone is shoving you down a linear hallway. If you're a FPS fan pick it up. It does not disappoint.",

The graphics are obviously a little old looking now, but the levels are still fun to head around and some of the secrets feel rewarding to find. There’s a few times in the games where you get your weapons/armour reset so once you’ve played once you can remember those times and use up all of the ammo etc in the last level before the re-set. When I had this game the first time round the multiplayer was a lot of fun, but it seems to be a pain to get running and find other players now. Might as well play free Team Fortress 2 for that. Took me less than ten hours to go through single player with a lot of the secrets from memory, but if you didn’t play it before you could get more time out of it – and at 75% off it is pennies per hour of entertainment!",
