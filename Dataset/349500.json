DON'T WANT TO READ? Here it is: Too expensive for its quality, weird for a game that beat KickStarter (1.6k) to have default textures everywhere. If it was cheaper, then I would recommend it.   About it",

I definitely share the sentiments of the other reviewers and discussion board posters that are appalled by this game using almost entirely exclusively non-original and RPG maker's sprites, artwork, and even music. And the game also got 1600$ from kickstarter. Speaking of oddly inspirational... that comes to mind. It's not a bad game itself, I'm enjoying it a lot. I think it's rather a great game. If you see it on sale for 3$ or less then you should maybe get it, but with the huge lack of creative artwork content and music [a big one], it's not worth 10$. The game itself though, bland aesthetics, disappointment bias about the kickstarter, and music aside, is pretty cool. Just not $10 cool.",

ESCAPE in early game, ESCAPE a trap, ESCAPE from reality. MUCH PARODY, MUCH SAVES ATTEMPT, MUCH ESCAPE ATTEMPT.  Actually bought this game only to get the trading card since the game was only $0.12 (after currency conversion), but it's better than i expected. Worth if you buy this game at discouned price and profit from trading card.",
