Nice touch with the light-hearted Kero Blaster promo at the end.  Definitely a game worth having only 2 hearts to start with, because 3 would really have been over powered.... despite having your first weapon a pratical Pink-Hadoken Machine Gun. I got to revive black and broken burnt husks of plants back into pretty pink Flowers with it.  Nice with its simplicity, I pretty much could have whipped this thing out myself with GameMaker 8.0 in about 2 hours. tops.  But on the other hand, it is a Demo given out as an apetizer for one of its upcoming games.   pros:  + Cute + A Nolstalgic tool to sweetly kiss 15 minutes away while waiting for a download  Cons: - When I first tried to resize the window to 2x in its window size options, the game crashed and force closed.. besides that happening, I re-opened the game again, and the setting 2x i selected went into effect.  that was the only con I found really.",

Also, Hard Mode is still a thing and holy amphibian on a bike, this is way harder than the first one, be ready to spend more than your regular 10 minutes on this game if you plan to master all the perfect jumps that you need to beat this. 10/10, just download it already, for frog's sake.",
