    "description": "\"Well behaved women seldom make history.\" - Laurel Thatcher Ulrich This is the game where good girls get better by being bad! In the 1920s, young women had a chance to change society--by misbehaving. Gather a gang of girls. Explore. Battle petty townsfolk with quick, naughty games: Fib, Flirt, Taunt...",

This is because they are boys and you are a man. A man can play a game about high school girls without feeling his masculinity is threatened.",

            "review_text": "While it sets uncommonly and interestingly in 1920s pre-Women's Rights era at a high school, playing the game itself feels like a chore as every choice you make has you either delving deeping into a shifty and overindulged plot by playing repeatitive card games that feel more luck-oriented than skill-oriented, or borderline-level-grinding your characters (via the same repeatitve card games). After about three hours, it felt more like I was watching a snooty teenage love story set in Victorian Era rather than actually playing a game and enjoying it.",

            "review_text": "I went into this game unsure- it seemed like it might not have enough content, but I had $20 to blow and was ready to take the risk for a really stand out game. The concept seemed really interesting, and I liked the idea of a diverse cast of high school girls.  I actually don't really want to write a bad review of this game because, there's a lot of potential. I hope the creators continue, fine tune the art of the mini-game, and go on to create characters with greater depth and the player can actually feel an interest in. But for $20 it's a big disappointment. The minigames are really boring and that's basically they're all you'll be doing. I think it may have built up to more interesting storylines, but I was too bored to continue. The art, considering there's so little of it, is really sub-par. There is also way too little strategy and long term planning in this game so I felt like I was meandering around. I felt the 20s era felt inauthentic and too based on stereotypes and slang- perhaps if the characters had a little more depth or backstory it would feel truer to the period.  If you want a truly awesome dark, involving detective game involving high school girls I would recommend Black Closet. It's by Hanako games, and though it is planned for Steam release soon (the creator is fine tuning it) it is currently available through their website. Of if you simply like the fun of a brightly colored teen girl unraveling a mystery in a dangerous setting (and possibly dying horribly) you'll love Hanako's Long Live the Queen on Steam. And no, I'm not affiliated in anyway with Hanako. I just love their games and their nuanced portrayal of girls.",

When I started playing it I was skeptical about it, but as I got to know the story line and felt to be the characters in the story I was truly amazed and mesmorized with the incredible work that the designers had done for this game. I highly recommend everyone to play this, especially my very muscular and manly male friends that takes pride in their sexualities.  Dangerous High School Girls In Trouble is not a game, it's a lifestyle!",

            "review_text": "Ok a game like Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble by title alone should tell you that this is not a title that will have universal appeal, and true to form the game does have a couple of interesting ideas on top of unfortunately repetitive and ultimately uninteresting mini-games. Although the concept of an old style board game is fairly clever, the 1920's speakeasy music begins to grate after an hour or so of gameplay, and it is very unfortunate that the entire gameboard is not visible at all times, requiring a scrolling of the mouse to see and reveal objectives. The character art is interesting and fairly well done but overall this game simply lacks the interesting core play that would encourage me to pick it up again. Combined with a lack of both Steam Overlay and no widescreen support, I would recommend my friends pass on this game.",

It's in a board game format if the board game were far more complicated than necessary, You're a sexy ♥♥♥♥♥ who goes and recruits other sexy ♥♥♥♥♥es, and you go solve mysteries.   If you don't like slow gameplay, repetetive mini games, or reading a whole lot you'll probably hate this game.   If you enjoy an intriguing storyline, like boardgame play, or if you're a connoisseur of unique and interesting indie games, you'll probably enjoy this one.   I have to stress that this is not a game you sit down and play for hours on end, I've had it for ages and I play it in small spurts and still haven't finished it.",
