Does it have any other flaws - sure. Are they that severe the game deserve this appauling rating - NO! Being an oldtime fan of the series - I took a lot of time gawking at the world of ... (forgot the name, sorry) in Sacred One. I kinda played Sacred 2, but I don't remember it properly. Now we have Sacred 3. Why 3? No clue. I bet the game'd've gotten a wave of more positive reviews had it been smth like 'Sacred an ARPG story' 'Sacred Haxxxorz r3v3ng3'. That way people who really care about the franchise would not get really p/o at getting a very different game from what they've expected. Now, is it a good game? Yup, definitely it is. You will play it for like 10-15 hours (get a couple of buds - much more fun this way!) of fun relaxed gameplay and get a few laughs (for some, myself included, their humor is on the sillyish side really), move on to the next title, no biggie. You will get experience comparative with the much warmerly welcomed and appraised titles (Victor Vran... ahem).",

            "review_text": "Sacred 3 is a very good game. It's a beat-em-up brawler similar to Gauntlet just better, although that's probably a matter of taste. The only thing this game is not is Sacred.  I am not aware of any other game on Steam that received as many negative ratings as Sacred 3 has. The reason for this are unfulfilled expectations. That's because Sacred 3 has nothing to do with Sacred 1 or Sacred 2. The game is neither an open-world game nor a role-playing game and the only thing Sacred 1 and Sacred 2 share with Sacred 3 is the name. If you can accept that and you like hack and slay games Sacred 3 is a very enjoyable game.  Pros:  - nice graphics, beautiful landscapes - character specific weapons, armor, special attacks - weapon upgrades - armor upgrades - special attacks (upgradeable) - 15 diversified levels in the main game - good DLCs - good music - co-op - multi-player, lobbies are currently full (October 2015) - co-op in combination with multi-player (two co-op, two mp) - you only collect gold (which keeps you from searching for scrolls and any other hidden stuff) - very easy to join games - you can join or leave games at any time - four difficulty levels (last difficulty is accessible after first play-through)  Cons:  - it's not Sacred - leveling up can get tiresome. Once you reached level 30 it takes a lot of time and fighting to collect the necessary experience points to level up further.  There are dissent opinions about the dialogs in the game. Please take into considerations that the game supports different languages with different translations and speakers.  During your journey you are accompanied by Aria, a telepathic, informing you about upcoming events, enemies dangers, areas, etc. She keeps talking all the time and at least in German her voice acting is great. Then you can select a god that inhabits your weapon, providing some special abilities. The selected god keeps talking too. The gods talking strongly reflect their diverse personalities and they tend to exaggerate. Dialogs are often childish with a strong use of youth slang. They tend to not take the game seriously and are very grotesque. It's the grotesqueness that makes the dialogs funny again, provided you have the right sense of humor. I like them, especially Aria is great in German.",

            "review_text": "They should have made this a spin off. It feels almost nothing like older Sacred games. Just calling it 'Sacred: Uprising' or something would rise the reviews up to 70%'s.  Before I bought the game I read the reviews, I played the original Sacred and loved it. But I bought the game anyway because it seemed like a good couch co op to play with my family. And this is what this game is all about, a co op action rpg.   Keyboard/mouse controls are not that bad, but turning animation is non-existant. I recommend playing it with a x360 controller. Keyboard/mouse + x360 co op is working thankfully.  Graphics are really good actually. A little bit too bright from time to time but really good visuals. Aside from non-existant keyboard turn animation, all other effects and animations are very well made. There are so many different backgrounds to fight on, I wonder if they intended to make a instance based a-rpg when they started.  Music and voice acting are also good. Not too great though, dialogues almost always sarcastic, most of the time it will make you smile but sometimes it gets too corny.  Story is not all that great, I only got upset a bit when *spoiler alert* our narrator got captured and we had to rescue her.  Gameplay mechanics; everything works fine, abilities and heroes compliment each other, balance is good. Weapon spirit mechanic is creative and fun. Your weapon spirits will make voiced commets while you play and it can be really funny. There are many different types of minions but types of mini bosses are only two. Actually there are some more but differences aren't noticable. Fighting big bosses can be really fun or sometimes really frustrating. Co op mechanics exists like one player turns a wheel wile other tries to fend off minions. They made really polished create opening animations but they only drop health/energy orbs and gold. Weapons, armor and weapon spirits are upgraded at certain hero levels. Weapon spirit drops are even worse. They drop randomly and cover half the screen when they do. There are items which drop at side quests such as potions and wards, I with other items droped like that as well.  Conclusion; I'm going to give this game a thumbs up, it frusturated me from time to time, it wasn't what I expected from Sacred but I had fun with my family and this game looks, sounds and plays too polished to get a negative from me. I didn't let my past experiance ruin this game for me. If you have one or two controllers and a friend to play with, this game is a good co-op experience.",

The RPG elements are tuned down, but frankly sometimes you dont actually care to spend hours tweaking attributes and juggling gear scores... Sometimes you just want to dive in and murder the crap out of hordes of monsters!! This game is very enjoyable, but more Golden Axe than Diablo... (Or Sacred 1/2) and that's not a bad thing. It DOES however feel like it started as one game, and ended up as another in some ways. The voice acting isnt bad, but the writing seems out of place? There are a lot of really bad jokes and some dumb one liners in there, but in a way it still comes off as charming, but seems incongruous with the presentation of the rest of the game. That said, maybe the corn is better than having the game take itself too seriously and come off as unintentionally hokey? Anyhow, it's a satisfying romp with lots of flying bodies and smashed set pieces, and that's pretty damn fun in of itself.",

And if only they took the OTT silly voices and stupid comments out the game would be sooo much better.  Fun factor 8/10 .... Story 4/10....8/10 If they sort out those stupid constant jokes.   I will be lvling all the classes because they are fun to play , Its nice to just switch over onto the big screen and chill out with the game pad and smash it up and it does look really nice aswell and the sound it great through a good system.

There is no inventory and constant looting. This makes the experience more arcade-like, and ultimately a different experience but still very interesting. Team up with three like-minded friends for a bunch of monster-smashing, and Sacred 3 has plenty to offer. For all intents and purposes, Sacred 3 is a beat ‘em up that can be very fun. Game is so very different from previous installments in this series, this game dedicated to consoles and 'couch gaming'. But if you put aside your prejudice, you could enjoy Sacred 3 - it's a pretty good action game with a epic fantasy setting.",

            "review_text": "It's a decent game when you get passed that it does not fall in line with the other 'sacred' games.   The game itself is not too hard, being there is diff levels, play at your own toughness. I really wanted this game to be a good timewaster but I feel that it's going to be one of those beat it and be done with it kind of games.  The loot is pretty much non-existat there are a few things here and there you get, however, I don't think they in much RNG involved more of where you are at the level or the story/  The skills and abilites are nice, but the lack of attacks make me wonder why, one of the warrior attacks does not even do damage is more of a debuff or stun/interupt which is fine but when you only have 4 I feel it's a waste of a free action move.  Graphics are ok. Playing this at 2560X1440 helps it look good, with some odd very odd coding, as my 780ti will ramp up and get as hot at 79c while most of the time it sits at 66-67, seems as if parts of the game were not optimized fully.   No sli support out of the gate, (should not need it though)  Biggest Con for me though is the very bad voice over scripts not so much the voices but what they say. Very corny, The telepathic helper if you call her that can be very annoying, when you have 500 mobs on you and she deemands you spin the wheel, I mean wtf can't you sense that I am trying to but have to deal with the mobs first. I understand why they did it, to move the story along for perhaps the 'unaware'   Oh and don't get me started on the spirits, the ones the fuse to your weapon, most of the time they bad stats out weigh the good ones or they become a wash to what's the point in them. All they do is provide more 'Corny' dialogue that is not needed, I mean you already have one annoying person talking to you, do we really need another? Not to mention the enemies scripts. It's just really really bad.   However, if you can get passed all that, and I mean it might take a strong willed person, there is a good game under it all, as it stands it is a beat em up, with a small RPG element to it, and I say small because its more of a straight line RPG, sure you can go back and gain some levels, but then all you are doing is out leveling the content to make it easy, why not just change the diff then.  I don't feel rewarded enough in the game, but I will finish it and most likley edit this review, as it stands it's a good game, with many holes.  Worth the 49.99? No  If you can get it cheaper the better imo.   I feel this game should of been released at 29.99 being what it is right now. Finishing the game and seeing what is beyond might change my tune, but I paid full price and knew going into it I was not going to get my moneys worth at least right away.",

            "review_text": "Much like Dungeon Siege 3, Sacred 3 has little in common with its predecessors besides a name, setting and bright, colourful visuals. It's not so much an 'action RPG' as it is an 'arcade RPG' - more Gauntlet than Diablo. Pick one of four (five via preorder or DLC) pre-made hero/ines and get down to the business of clicking stuff until it dies.  In many ways, Sacred 3 has more in common with the download-only Sacred Citadel than its heavier RPG brothers - it's a button mashing brawler at heart, with linear levels and only as much level-up and customisation option as necessary to give the player some agency. Collectibles are limited to helth, energy and gold - the latter being used to buy upgrades or new skills when you level up.  There's no denying Sacred 3 won't be everyone's cup of tea - it is practically designed for couch co-op with friends and beers, or breezy online play while you and your mates mash buttons and talk trash. It has that quirky European sense of humour that made Sacred 2 surprisingly funny, although tempered by what the developers clearly think an American audience will find funny (and spoiler alert, you probably won't). That said, it has an awkward charm about it that'll either make you snicker, or at least roll your eyes with a smile.  Performance wise, the game runs flawlessly on my machine, the first $50+ game in quite a few months to do so (Wolfenstein, Watch Dogs I am looking at you). The visuals aren't amazing and shouldn't tax most systems, but the art style is big and colourful and mostly pleasing on the eye. Playing on my 46' TV it can be a bit hard to make out what is going on when there's a lot of enemies on the screen, but it's usually only a few seconds until everything is dead from one of your combat abilities.  The music is good and the voice acting is serviceable, although leaning towards the annoying end of the spectrum. There's a surprising amount of it too, with various 'souls' you can equip for a passive bonus, and each one has its own personality and one-liners. Word to the wise: the default guy you get is super annoying, so don't forget you can switch him out after a mission or two.  All in all, Sacred 3 is a competent hack &amp; slash adventure, one best experienced with friends and in shorter sessions. It's far from perfect, and it's a departure from its predecessors, but with Divinity: Original Sin out there to get your more traditional RPG fix, this is the perfect antidote for when you just want to switch off your brain and bash some orcs.",

As well as hardly any attack or skill variation: light attack, heavy attack (shield breaker), and 2 skill slots with 5 alternatives to use in each, that's it, no diverse combat, just button mashing. Linear and quite limited maps instead of a living, breathing, npc-settled open world.

Apart from the story, it doesn't have to do anything with its predecessors. Compared to Sacred 1 &amp; 2, this game is actually a huge step backwards: - only 4 character classes available - you can't name your character - there are no items - no open world, only a linear way (and what's making it worse: you can't even go back) - the player character doesn't autogenerate its health over time (instead you have to collect green balls to refill your health) - you just have 2 skills + 2 different attacks with your weapon - the player character and enemies don't comment their actions - fighting against enemies turns into stupid click orgies - the game doesn't remember the resolution  On top of that I miss the typical Sacred-style humor, when the game doesn't take itself serious - be it quests or comments made by NPCs, enemies or the player character when doing certain actions.",

The background dialogue is extremely cheesy to the point it's almost as if they were not trying. I got tired of listening to it, and I had to turn it off, which if you knew me, you would know I can exert a fair amount of patience, but this was consistant inane chatter that didn't in any way provide to the story.  2.) I was admittedly taken aback by the genre change, I consider it my fault that I did not research about the game before it came out, however I did not expect them to make such a drastic change in gameplay from what was a great breath of fresh air if you were either tired of or not really into diablo. Anyways, it is very linear, no choices, and your guided by an annoying half-wit.  3.) Character customization is rather limited, you have weapons to choose from that have various percent chance passives, and 2 sets of skills with 2-3 choices each, which inside, have only 1-2 customizations inside there. Which is a drastic reduction in skills from the previous Sacred titles. As far as loot and weapons and feeling the 'reward' from killing a boss just forget about it. You get some gold coins, which you lose almost immediatly because the game was designed for you to farm the same levels OVER and OVER and spend it on upgrades for your character.  4.) In the story levels, you are forced into silly scenarios where an elite just happens to have the key you need, to a door that will continue your journey. Maybe it's nothing, but with previous arguments of the perception of them not trying very hard, this kinda rubs me the wrong way. I spent more time thinking of why the first antagonist did the classic 'AHA I have destroyed your only way to me, EXCEPT for this one LOCKED door, to which I put the key in my minions hands! I shall make this mistake repeatedly, over and over, and NEVER learn from my mistakes!'. You would think the emperor would eventually put out an all points bulletin reminding his generals NOT to leave keys with their subordinates.  5.) Oh and something was buggy with the online portion of the game, I wanted to try teaming up with random strangers and was stuck in offline mode for some reason. If I even cared about the game at this point maybe I would look into it, but after I click 'Post Review' I am just gonna delete it from the hard drive.",

            "review_text": "Forward ------------------------------------------------------------------  'Let's play the name game!' the developers said.  'You guys have been working on a shell of a game, might as well release it finally.' said the lead developer.  'Ya let's call it Sacred 3!' they all said together in a bro-fist fashion, with teeth grinning and head banging, they shout from the mountain tops 'SACRED 3!'  Sadly the story ends there, on a sad note. This ladies and gentlemen is not 'Sacred 3' (well it is but not in the vein of...you know what, you know what I mean), it's not even 'Sacred 2.8 uncut finalcut master faith 360 degrees drop edition'. It is not even worthy of holding a candle to its name, but does that mean it isn't good?  For starters Sacred was known for its killer diablo like ARPG mechanics. It was a loot all ask questions later type of game and we (the fans, myself included) loved it. Sacred 2 followed the same formula except updated it in a more modern way, lots of faults but still the same Sacred type of play we love. Now we come to Sacred 3, this abomination of a game set in the 'Sacred' universe. Let's go over a few things, as to why I don't recommend it.   WHY in spaghetti monster's (insert your own diety here) name did they have to call it Sacred 3!?!? -------------------------------------------------------------------  This question baffles me, they could have named it anything else, ANYTHING and it would have been absolutely fine, but no it wasn't enough, they had to drag the name through the mud. If it was called 'Sacred: Mini Adventure', 'Sacred: Not Serious Edition', 'Sacred: Battle of the Bads', I mean absolutely anything this would not be a question. Everyone would see it as an off-shot and not a sequel, just a fun extra. Instead they have the balls to call this piece of trash SACRED 3, it is not an ARPG, it was turned into an Action Battle Arena and a very basic and limited one at that. So enough about the name, I think I shared my thoughts on that quite enough.   Combat -------------------------------------------------------------------  Extremely basic press key/button to slash, press key/button to do a special, press key/button to dodge/block. That can be good or bad I suposse. On one hand it is easy enough for a basic gamer to pick up and tackle without any confusion on the other it just leaves combat to a lacking unimpressive grindfest. The responsiveness of the controls is fine, they are tight at least and you can interupt your skills to dodge/block which is a highlight, 'the knight in shining armor' one would say. So the combat gets a sideways thumb from me, not bad/not good.   Voice Acting/Story -------------------------------------------------------------------  Excuse my french here but HOLY ♥♥♥♥ is it ever bad. Not only is the story completely off the rails down right stupid, everything must be a JOKE! It's like the writers sat down and were like; 'Man this game is horrible, let's just make the dumbest thing we can think of and constantly make fun of it throughout the entire game'. I can not think of any other way this was made except for the extreme reason to punish the developers/publisher to even unearthing this thing. You will constantly roll your eyes and soon just skip the story cutscenes (art with text/voice...). Nothing and I mean nothing is taken serious about this game, the main villians are portrayed as idiots. Like a dumb laughable cartoon villian except you won't be laughing, you will be crying at how bad it is. Your companions are even worse! They never shut the hell up, they just keep gabbing as you try to fight your way through a horde of murdering orcs! When you think it couldn't get any worse, it gets worse. Absolute thumbs down, you will not care about the story ('story' right) or the characters.   Areas/Zones/Set Pieces --------------------------------------------------------------------  This is very repeatitive and reused, tons of set pieces are the same and you will see them through the game, ruins, camps, arenas, fire, jungle. Same stuff, throughout the grind. There are some story zones that shake things up a bit but they are all linear paths, if it braches off it is just to grab a chest and then come back to fork X and go the other way. I'll give this a sideways thumbs, again not great but there was some effort...I guess.   Level Restrictions/Skills ---------------------------------------------------------------------  You will hit these hard mid game and even worse late game. So the base of the whole system is you get xp from killing enemies and completing the mission on the map you are on. This will then give you some bonus and let you buy skills in the menu. The skills however are not very different and the whole system is a joke. Some level ups will grant you companions or lvl up the companion. You can only go into areas that are your level or lower, so you will get level blocked at some point, what that means is even if you are doing the extra side quest areas you will need to redo a story mode or arena map multiple times just to level up and move on. Trust me this made me want to quit more times than I can count but I kept treading on. By the end of the game you aren't even half way leveled up, they have the balls to say, 'well play the game again!'. No sir! no sir I will not. This gets a huge thumbs down from me, level blocking is a horrible system to make a player waste more time in their game doing the same crap they already been through, no one likes that, no one has fun. No Fun Allowed!   Online Co-op/Drop In-Out ----------------------------------------------------------------------  So if you are lucky to even find anyone online (I found one guy once...) you can drop-in their game or they can drop in yours. This is neither fun, nor does it help, nor does it hurt. They are just there... It's like a ghost on your screen, killing stuff while you kill stuff as you have been killing stuff, with no gain. There is no reason to play this game co-op unless you just want to play with your siblings or friend. It is a system that works, but not desired. Sideways thumb.   Closing Arguments ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It's an action game take it for what it is worth. Is it worth playing, that is up in the air. From the fun I had with it (extremely short time, rest felt like I was doing it just to finish it) I would say it isn't worth even bothering loading it up. It's not a Sacred game, I made that point very clear. So take it for what you want.   Final Verdict ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Combat - Sideways Thumb, ok Voice Acting - Thumb so very far down I'm pointing straight at hell itself Areas/Set Pieces - Sideways Thumb, meh Level Restrictions/Skills - Thumb down, shame on you developers! Online Co-op - Sideway thumb, alrighty then  Rating: 2 Stinky Fish and an octopus (You might not mind the octopus, but the stinky fish will deter you otherwise)  Please friends! Move along, nothing to see here. For those that dare to dream, I'll just say I warned you.",

            "review_text": "This game is slightly better than its reviews suggest.  Oh, it's bad - a poorly conceived and designed mess, but with lowered expectations it's a passable timewaster. The kind where you just switch off your brains and mow down enemy hordes.  On the one hand, the fundamentals are kind of solid (if uninspired), the graphics are decent and there's quite a bit of variety. On the other hand, you've got nearly everything else. I'll get into its writing in a second, but I do need to mention that the design is awful; some of the character progression is actually ok for this sort of thing, but others just... pop up, randomly, with no explanation or logic. Some of the combat systems are ridiculous, too - there's a 'fatality' type move that you can pull on bosses where you just... immobilize them, and inflict tiny bits of damage. Took me a while to figure out that it's meant for co-op play; as a solo player, it's ridiculous that it's still available as an option without getting buffed up. You expend your healing Items throughout the missions without any way to recover them, which means that you may reach the end boss- where you'll likely need them the most - without them unless you refrain from using them.  None of the design problems are a huge issue except when the difficulty spikes up, in which case you'll spend a fair amout of time cursing at the screen (the last underworld mission, especially its boss, is one of the worst '♥♥♥♥ you's' I've ever seen designers aim at their paying customers). But that's an isolated case, difficulty has been fine elsewhere.  I got this mainly to play co-op with my wife, who loves this sort of thing ever since Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance; the problem is that after watching me play a couple of levels, she wants nothing to do with it. The writing is just that ♥♥♥♥ing, offensively bad. Offensive in its stupidity, not in any sort of premeditated, comedic way. It's disposable fantasy twaddle without the slightest hint of personality except for a smug sense that it's the funniest thing ever, even though it doesn't seem to understand the basics of a joke. You get bombarded with its noxious brand of humor throughout the missions, and it's almost painful. Let me put it this way, it throws in a Larry the cable guy quote at one point. It's even less funny without any sort of context.   TLDR version - It's a brain dead, ok-ish action-RPG with a really obnoxious personality and some pretty stupid design decisions. I'm kind of enjoying it... kind of, and even that in a sort of MST3K way. However - even if it sounds like your kind of thing, wait until it's at about 10% of its current price (shouldn't be long!).  It won't be worth it even then, but it's not like there are a lot of couch co-op, controller-enabled games for the PC.",

            "review_text": "Oh my god, what has become of this fine hack&amp;slay rpg game... it may be that i should have informed myself a little bit better, but i'm utterly disappointed. I saw the ad for the game today in steam and having played the first two iterations to the extend that afterwards i doubted my decisions in life, i had to have the game immediately. It was total news to me, that they even made another one, so that absolutely brightened my so far dull saturday. But it wasn't for long...   So at first, everything i say is just based on the first mission and maybe i can bring myself to play it a little more, even if it was just for the money i spent, but i doubt it. But here are some warnings for some people like me, who are extreme fans of hack&amp;slay rpgs like Diablo, Dungeon Siege, Torchlight etc. It plays more like a beat'em up, something like Devil May Cry or something similar, with some minor rpg 'components' and here are some points why (and again, i haven't played much):  1. No item drops  Yep, thats right, no item drops, just some cash here and there and of course health etc. No stash, no backpack, but then again, what would you store in them...  2. Straight as Hugh Hefner  This game is so linear, that i can draw you an exact replica of the first mission in ascii art (not really exact, but you'll get the picture): _________ _____ _____ |___| |____  |_______________ fin  3. Missions?  There seem to be no quests (and therefore no side quests of course), no maps, no running around tryin' to get every corner of the map light up, .... nothing. Just Mission 1 - 27 (don't know the actual number) which you have to wade through one by one.  4. No in-game shops   If you wanna buy something, you have to complete a mission and after the outro of the mission, you get to the lobby. In the lobby you have some (utterly ugly) menues, where you can level up, buy potions etc. No merchant, no blacksmith, just a plain menu between missions. I've seen 1,99€ indie games with way more innovative or at least cute versions for something like this (of course real in-game merchants is by the far the best way to go in my opinion).  5. The HUD  The HUD looks like it comes straight from Street Fighter 2. If you liked the gothic style HUD from Sacred 2, you will be disgusted by it. The whole time you play the game, you just wait for a camera pan into 2d and a fiery text saying 'ROUND 1 ... FIGHT'.   Okay, so far so bad, and by any means you could say i should have informed myself better, but to call this game Sacred frankly is ridiculous. This s not an action rpg, this is a 3d beat'em up game with some minor rpg elements!   And the last thing i wanna add is, the voice over is totally idiotic and annoyed me after the first three sentences (and i liked the sometimes witty sometimes even a little cheeky humor of the first two parts). Everytime your guide popped up (of course in a comic style which reminded me of some classic games from the early 90s, which is totally fitting for a medieval style game...) i got so angry i started smashing the screen close to where her picture was, just to get some release. And i've been playing the game for 10mins at that time!   So, in conclusion, i wouldn't recommend that game for rpg fans, especially the ones who like the classic hack&amp;slay games like Diablo. I wouldn't recommend it for beat'em up fans either, there are far better games in that genre.   If someone thinks this review is not justified and show me some footage or can persuade me otherwise, i will update this review if possible and give it another shot. I would be extremely thankful for something like this, since i paid way too much money for 20mins of gameplay... :(     ",

Some of the pathways and environments are so linear you almost have no room to move your character.  The best way to describe the change is what happened to Dungeon Siege going from 2-3, the disconnect is exactly the same. The open world with quests has become set 'missions' in a bound area which you complete, get a score, cash reward and a lackluster item.  Its very pretty, production values are high, fights are fun but it is NOT Sacred.

While it's not a terrible game, I don't think it merits the price tag and it certainly doesn't follow along the open-world, Sacred 2 style of gameplay. Instead you end up with an instanced game that loses a lot of the depth and customization of it's fore-runners.   It's not a bad game per se, but I can't help but feel let down. I really enjoyed Sacred 2 and looked forward to a sequel. If anything, this feels like it should be a seperate, stand-alone game.   tl;dr It's not a bad game, but it doesn't feel worth the price tag. If you like this sort of game, you may like it, but if you expect a sequel to Sacred 2 (or the expansion), the gameplay is different, there's less depth and it's no longer open-world.",

There's something gratifying about finding that new special weapon, or upgrading it just so.  Then there's Sacred 3. Linear storyline. No open world. You are driven from room to room in 'mission' like episodes instead of picking up a bunch of quests and picking and choosing.   There is no loot. None. Nothing. Zilch.  The weapon upgrades you can get are once every 4 levels from what i gather.  The hack and slash is still there, the combat is fun, but this is not Sacred. Sure, you can pick from the original classes (still no gender choice of course), You play in Ancara, and the battleskills are still there. But this is not the game i thought i bought.  The story so far seems... an odd mix between an attempt at comedy and a tacky storyline. I might play on, I'm not sure on that yet, just to see how it continues, but so far? This is not Sacred 3. This should bear a title like Heroes of Sacred, or some such alternatively named game, to indicate it deviated from the original that much.

It's has nothing to do with the gameplay and as such I won't change my review. But Deep Silver (who the devs lost the franchise to) is now on my blacklist for being real life vilains.  I enjoy this game, had it a different title to ease minds and a 20$ price tag I'd recommend it as is.  Yes the levels are really linear but I wouldn't call them boring, they challenge you in a variety of ways that will have you adapt your gameplay. The options you get aren't that limited as many make it sounds. The cut-scenes are well-polished, the dialogues are funny, I like the different characters (heroes and vilains alike) and they are supported by a more-than-decent voice acting.  About the franchise: I don't care much. I played the 1st and 2nd titles as time wasters while waiting for game able to outshine D2 (or at least come close). You probably know that already by now (everyone seems to be mad about it), Sacred 3 is a very different game. But it has nothing to do with the fact I do not recommend it. However, if it bothers you, well, that's another reason why you should stay away from it.  To me the root of the problem is that it wasn't meant to be played on PC, it's a really poor port of what seem to be a good console game. From the settings to the controls it really doesn't fit (yet). Some examples: - It's easy to lose sight of your cursor and on high difficulty it often means insta death. It wouldn't have been hard to design one that is easier to spot. - Pressing space to dodge (if you still use dodge that is, you should get block) will have your character rolling toward your cursor even if you were moving in the opposite direction. It's very unintuitive. That also could easily be fixed. - Limited options due to the initial target (console). - Zero way to use the keyboard to chat, you'll have to use the in game voice over IP that everyone mutes so it won't be much use. Unless you playing with friends using skype, TS, ... you won't be able to say anything to your 'co-op' partners.  On that last note, I wouldn't call it a co-op game. Multiplayer? Check. PvE? Check. Cooperation? Very little. It doesn't mean it's not fun to play with others, but you do not need to cooperate.  TL;DR: Different from Sacred 1 &amp; 2. Good casual arcade time waster that can even be a bit challenging at times. Poor PC adaptation. Way too expensive for what it is.",

On top of that game is trying to be funny in every possible moment which just makes you puke puns after 10 minutes of non-stop word games and puns. I got it for free from giveaway and i still feel ripped off.",

            "review_text": "I didn't play Sacred 1 &amp; 2 yet, so unlike many other reviews, I'm not comparing it to the previous titles (as I understand it's not made by the same company anyway, someone bought the rights). My judgement here is based purely on the games own merrit.   The game has good graphics, controls and general gameplay are O.k. but nothing special (except the evade command, it throws you in totally random directions and as such is quite terrible). I also would say the voice acting isn't bad... but the actual scripts the voice actors had to read are REALLY REALLY bad. I feel sorry for them. Whoewer wrote the scripts has no idea what a fantasy RPG entails. It's simply terrible. You defeat some enemys and as you pick up loot you hear stuff like (and I quote) ''Sexy!'' or ''O baby!'' or ''Feels good!''. There is also no atmosphere in the game worth mentioning.   If you want to even remotely enjoy the game, turn the character voices OFF! You also might want to considder turning off the games music and using your own for better atmosphere.",
