The sound effects were very well done and made my heart race a few times. Not difficult at all. Can easily be passed in under and hour. Very nicely done. Easy point and click game.",

            "review_text": "QUICK THOUGHTS: While it isn't necessarily a BAD game, it's just pretty boring. The main game moves along through two maps. The first is an outdoors map where the only real landmarks are a random plant or one of six dead Mary's strewn about as your being chased by a 'demon', and the other a log cabin where you have to perorm a ritual in order to survive. It's easy to get lost in the first map, not to mention overlook the key you need, and that's the biggest flaw. No map exists, so you have to rely on memory in a land that all looks the same.  Other than the fairly bland surroundings, the game's mechanics work well enough. You click the direction you want to go at key spots on the screen, you pick up items like a hidden object style title, and solve random puzzles in typical adventure game fashion, once in a while relying on you to combine things you picked up. The soundtrack isn't bad either, and the monster that chases you isn't all that bad.  I received both the bad ending and the good ending, and have litlle interest in playing it again to get the 'alien' object. But, if you pick this up, know that there are walkthroughs that will help you find the items and paths you need (mostly in Russian though) so use them like I had to in order to figure out what I need and overlooked.",
