            "review_text": "If you're here, and you're reading this review, you're probably one of two things: 1. A furry. 2. Confused.  If you fall into that first category, this might be a game for you (as a self-professed fandom member, I don't think I can help but be a little biased). If you fall into the second category, you might want to think more carefully. Either way, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this game (although I would love to), but can only advise that you think very carefully. I'll try to explain all that, and I'll try to be as thorough as I can in this review, because information on this game is very scarce online.  The story is pretty simple, although it tries to have some depth. Everyone is a walking, talking animal (they actually try to explain this, but it's all left very intentionally vague and mysterious. You should have no trouble picking up what it's getting at). The citizens possess a magical orb that allows them to predict the weather, and without it things will get pretty chaotic. You play as Rif, a fox who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time; that is to say, the orb is stolen, and everyone blames you. Because all foxes are thieves, apparently. Rif's girlfriend is kidnapped and he's given a limited amount of time to recover the orb and prove his innocence. Otherwise, bad things will happen. You're accompanied by an Elk and a Boar from two respective tribes, and thus your quest begins. You'll meet some interesting characters and some are actually pretty cool, if underdeveloped. The game's too short to really give any character besides Rif a lot of time to shine, but the developers made the characters fun and lively. Some of the problems with the script result from issues within the developing company. Apparently they wanted to make a rather mature game, with themes and issues and characters adults could enjoy; traces of this shine through. In one conversation I had, a character made some veiled innuendos and (very tame) sexual advances (the kind of thing no child would ever pick up on). And although the developers were pushing for a mature game, the publishers saw animals and immediately assumed it was a game for kids. The script was toned down and scenes were cut, as were all scenes involving death. The result of this dispute is a little sloppy. The story never quite lives up to its potential and everything feels just a little too cheery. It turns what could have been a decent adventure into something much more suitable for children. That's not to say an adult couldn't enjoy it; it just isn't what it could have been.  Inherit the Earth is a point-and-click adventure game. If you don't like those, you're going to hate this. You're not going to be fighting enemies, platforming, shooting, racing, looting, or grinding. You're going to be walking around, picking things up, and taking them other places. You might have to use one item on something to open a new path. It's that kind of game.  It's biggest flaw is that it isn't very deep. The characters are fun and the graphics are very nice (more on that later), but there isn't too much to the gameplay. Myst and its sequels are some of my favorite games, and their draw is incredibly difficult puzzle solving. Those games are the pinnacle of the point-and-click genre. Inherit the Earth, on the other hand, does not have any real puzzles. It doesn't have much that could confuse or stump you. There were only a handful of moments where I wasn't sure what to do. That may be because I'm a seasoned adventure gamer -- I'm not sure. It would definitely give a younger player a bigger challenge.   Music... Eh. You're not going to like it. There's very little music here, aside from fifteen second loops that go on and on and on... But I can't fault them. Some of the little loops are a little catchy and, hey, they add to the game's charm if nothing else. The sound effects all sound fine, and the game's fully voice acted. The actors don't do a bad job, but they're not going to be winning any awards for their performances either. But I do applaud the decision to add voice acting. In a game like this, where the story and gameplay are both rather thin, the cast of characters is going to be one of the bigger selling points, and I couldn't help but be won over by these characters. Rif in particular was a joy to play, and the little, sometimes stupid things he would say as I guided him around made him altogether very likeable. Every character was like that, to their own degree. The world really felt alive with its characters; it was even hard not to like the bad characters. And for that, I say the voice acting is a major plus.  The graphics are one of the game's biggest selling points. They're not phenomenal or anything. On today's computers they look pixelated at best, but somehow they still look excellent. Unfortunately, the camera angle is almost always zoomed in extraordinarily closely. It made even the nicest of environments hard to see sometimes, and sometimes made the game harder to play. However, when entering new rooms or areas, the developers occasionally opted to display the new room/area in a smaller window overlapping the first one. It was a neat effect, and while it didn't add much to the gameplay, it aided the overall look of the game, which I found myself liking more and more as I played. The animations are, for the most part, clean and well executed, and the sprites large and detailed. Everything is vibrant and drawn in a wonderful art style and helps sell this game's charm.  And that's really what this game has going for it -- charm. It's not the most terrifically fun game to play, and the story isn't really going to make you think. But the world itself is lovely and the characters entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent playing this game (which took me 5 hours to beat), and I think you will too, if you're looking for something that will make you smile or feel like a kid again.  When all's said and done, this game is probably better suited to kids, and when I have children of my own I'll look forward to the day I can sit down and play this with them.  As I said earlier, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. It's flawed, yes, very much so, but it does have some wonderful things in its favor. Furries and adventure gamers might find more to enjoy here than the average player, but it's simple and breezy enough to make anybody smile. There's a lot that isn't working, but if you can look past all that, you'll find a very charming game with a lot of heart.",
