    "description": "Righty Tighty XL is the third of three games in my minimalist arcade series that share aesthetics while having different control and game play. It is an addictive 'just-one-more-round' arcade score chaser, perfect for playing while waiting in queue for another game.",

    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7 (you could try XP, but you know, it's XP) Processor: Dual Core+ Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 512MB+ Storage: 500 MB available space Additional Notes: If your computer has 'Blast Processing' you should be able to do what Nintendont, which is to say, run Righty Tighty XL.",
    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: Core i9 X? I literally just discovered this was a thing, I bet it wouldn't improve performance since this game runs on a toaster, but dude, would you feel cool having it. Memory: 5 GB RAM Graphics: GeForce GTX 1180 (2080?) They could call it anything really. Storage: 501 MB available space Sound Card: I see you turned to page 52? So clearly this bit wasn't working for you? You probably think it was a waste of time. But how do you feel about me making this rhyme? Additional Notes: We may not be winners, but we can be spoilers. History is filled with losers who never won anything themselves, but who ruin the success of others.",
