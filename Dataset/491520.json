This is genuinely quite a pretty game, the visuals are excellent, but that's as far as it goes. The only thing you do in this game is fly through rings. The game does not used the tracked motion controls like it claims, you have to steer yourself by looking in a particular direction and the only thing the controllers are used for as the triggers, which apply thrust. It's certainly not room scale in any way either. The physics in the game make little sense, since there seems to be a lot of drag.  The game also does a number of things which it shouldn't; for example it forcibly moves the player down a corridor at times (which is painfully jarring), and for some reason it has out-of-body cutscenes at the beginning of levels.  Ultimately, it's quite dull. Could not recommend the game.",
