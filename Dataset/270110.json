If you love voxel games you should buy it, it is a fun and cheap game. However, it still has flaws, and you can find better voxel games on steam such as 7 days to die or creativerse (this one is now free and it is incredible). Let's hope the developers continue updating it Also: it has microtransactions, but you can avoid them. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Unpolished and unfinished game. The physics in the game are just weird and the resolutions and huds are unpleasing. It's a great idea but poorly developed.  (English is not my first language).",

            "review_text": "Block Story is a Minecraft knockoff, with more bugs than the underside of a mossy log. I gave it a try and I really just can't recommend it. The texture pack they used on Block Story, looks a lot like the High Def texture pack mod that can be downloaded for Minecraft. Parts of the world load so slowly that NPC's, and Animals look like they are floating in the air. The action bar only lets you hold a few things at a time, and the inventory space is smaller than Minecraft. I'm not entirely sure about the crafting catalogue as I didn't go that far into it, but what I have seen I was completely unimpressed with. Honestly folks, if you want to play a game like this, go with Minecraft. You can download Mods to add NPC's, or upgrade the textures, and you won't have as many bugs.",
