I recently purchased some A grade titles, like Battlefield 1, but I can confirm that NOTHING meets the standards of this mint ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game. Firstly, in Battlefield you play as a piece of waste, but in Sluggish Morss, you have the option of controlling a furry purple ♥♥♥♥ or a brown ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er. With memorable quotes like 'dog ♥♥♥♥♥' and memorable levels like 'The hood' no one can make me ♥♥♥♥ing quit playing this ♥♥♥♥ing game. now if you dont agree ♥♥♥♥ing kill yourself and Merlin Cardin is a ♥♥♥♥ing legend. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nigger♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥",
