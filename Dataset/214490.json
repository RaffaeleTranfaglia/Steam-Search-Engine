            "review_text": "I am not a fan of survival horror, first person games or stealth-gameplay and I actually flat out refused to play A:I at all when it was released - eventhough I really love the IP and consider ALIEN (1979) as one of my favourite movies of all time. But the premise of being there, personally facing one of cinemas greatest creatures seemed just terrifying and not much else.   In a funny turn of events I got to see ALIENS (1986) on the big screen and on that very same weekend the Humble Store offered A:I for a low-low price and being all hyped from the movie and Sigourney Weavers kickass performance, my curiosity got me registered on the Sevastopol space station.  Let me just say that I am very positively surprised how much I actually enjoyed A:I. Basically, you play hide and seek with the xenomorph, gradually building up an arsenal of tools for distraction and destruction as well as uncovering a lame plot about corporations willing to end hundreds of lifes for profit. Seriously, the plot is just a megamix of every idea the original two movies had and you can sense the plottwists hours before they happen.  Gameplay consists of finding safe and secure areas, checking out waypoints and avoiding any actions that draw attention to your position. A:I demands both patience AND nerves of steel. It is also a game about choices and deadly consequences should you choose poorly. In order to help you make those decisions, Creative Assembly gave you a bunch of tools - like the motion tracker and an excellent map. However, your most important asset for survival are your ears. Up to this point, I haven't played a game that put so much emphasis on its sound as a means of navigation and well, deciding what to do next. The xenomorph makes a lot of distinct noises that allow you to 'read' the current situation (like: is it even there, is it currently in the vents, is it busy murdering other people or is it actively hunting you). You may be just running back and forth between checkpoints, restoring power and opening doors - but it sure feels intense. And they managed to do that without artificially crippling your actions - so, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to take control out of the players hands and make matters more 'EXCITING!' by making them more awkward to handle.  Another reason why A:I works better than other games of this genre that I have tried, is the fact that you know A LOT about your surroundings and most of the imminent dangers in them. In fact, I love the level design for the most part - it strikes the perfect ballance between being linear but allowing you a couple of different tactical options and routes to take. Mind you, there are exceptions to this and later levels have a tendency to introduce choke points where you are forced to encounter hostiles - but the first half was really great. In fact, all levels do a splendid job of conveying that you are being inside the bowels of a massive, man-made, mechanical mega-structure floating in space. All areas feel like real places that had a purpose before they were abandoned (or... shall we say... redecorated by certain creatures) - there are floor markings and signs helping you navigate and further turning Sevastopol into a place that makes sense, becomes believable.  What really sets A:I apart from the competetion (and is ultimately the reason why I got it in the first place) is its license and the way that license was used. A:I is all about atmosphere and looks as well as sounds fantastic - Creative Assembly did a near flawless job of recreating the ALIEN universe aesthetic of retro-futurstic spaceship corridors, computer terminals and heavy machinery. Some of the corridors look so great, you can almost feel the damp air, the heat of fires, and the frizzle of electric sparks on your skin. Now you combine the insane artdirection with the awesome sounddesign and you got your current benchmark for every upcoming science fiction game. All those rumbling sounds, sirens, shutters and alarms - they really make Sevastopol feel alive. As much as people praise (and fear) the xenomorph, for me the real star of the game is the space station itself.  Talking about fear, I actually didn't find the game to be as frightening as everyone makes it out to be. In fact, I was more afraid of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Working Joes (because harming them makes either a lot of noise or isn't very healthy, and it gets worse when they start wearing hazmat-suits). I think the game is rather light on jumpscares and shockvalue - if you pay attention and move cautiously. This might be different on harder difficulties - but then again, it 'just' insta-kills you even more - so, what is there to be afraid of? And this doesn't mean this game isn't exciting or intense - it is the thrill of getting caught instead of being paralyzed with fear.  Finally, there are a bunch of issues I have with the game that need to be mentioned as well.  First of all: the anti-aliasing in A:I sucks. I am talking PS2-era jaggies here - not cool. Also, the lighting did wonders on the levels - but did not really work too well on the Alien itself, it looks kinda flat - even though the model seems to be pretty detailed - you just never see much of that quality.  Occasionally I had a bunch of clipping issues - the worst was when the alien suddenly clipped into me while I was hiding under a desk, making the ai go berserk and immediatly kill me. There were a bunch of other weird occurences, mostly when Androids were around - if they spotted me and the Alien was around, the xeno would never calm down and suddenly know exactly where I was, almost like androids and alien shared the same info. What made matters worse was that I wanted to open a vent security door (from inside the vent) and all enemies 'knew' exactly where I was (even though that was impossible) - they just couldn't get to me because of that security door, but once it was open the alien took a dive straight into the vent, three times in a row. In the end I snuck through the 'harder part' of that area without encountering either Alien or Android. Weird and annoying.  At times the controls are a bit finnicky, running (with the Alien in hot pursuit) into an elevator, I died because despite the control buttons being in the center of my screen, the button prompt didn't show up because I wasn't properly looking at them - same goes for some vents, standing exactly in front of them won't do - you gotta look at 'em right.  Needless to say, A:I is a game with tons of potential for frustration as you will be playing a couple of areas a few times before you figure out how to best tackle them. Wether or not you will enjoy it depends mostly on your admiration for the Alien-IP. It is definitely a good game and is quite a departure from the stuff I usually play - and seeing how I am quite happy that I actually did play (and finish) it, says a lot about its quality. It's a unique experience and does wonders with the license - reason enough for me to recommend it, even to all those people that normally would not touch a game like this.",

            "review_text": "Atmospheric  I have quite an extensive selection of categories in my steam library, and one of them is 'Atmospheric'. After completing Alien Isolation, it made me think about all the games in the category and compare them to this. Do they have the right to be in this category. This is such a solid product, but I cannot recommend it to everyone. Before playing watching the first Alien movie is a must. Watching all the other Alien movies is unimportant, as this game mostly uses the world and the xenomorph from the first movie.  First of all. The game has five different difficulty levels, novice, easy, medium, hard(recommended by developers) and nightmare. Novice and Nightmare were published later in a patch if I understood correctly. I first played with Hard to mission 5, then medium to mission 5 and then completed it with Easy. The reason I am mentioning this is the fact that the game is a totally different experience if played on different difficulties. With harder difficulties, the Alien is an all-present terror, that you need to trick and bypass almost constantly. In easier difficulties the Alien is more of an unseen terror that pops out every now and then, especially when someone has to do something noisy or important. Added to the Easy difficulty, I also was doing achievement that required no humans killed by me, that meant also no stunning. So these two heavily effected my experience of the game and therefore my review. Some of the things mentioned above are only valid if played with the same difficulty.  Basically the game is first person stealth-game with survival being the aim of the game. Your aim is to survive in a hostile space-station filled with scared people, immortal xenomorph and androids with anger management issue. The game consists mostly avoiding enemies, by hiding in certain objects or behind cover. To accomplish your goals, you can use some items or weapons. Most of the game consist of crouching behind objects or walking from hiding place to hiding place since the main antagonist, the omnipresent xenomorph, is immortal, cannot be killed or harmed. It is afraid of fire though so after receiving flamethrower and molotovs, one has some chances to repel it for few seconds, enough to escape and hide.   The environment of the game is brilliantly done. The station is claustrophobic, horrible and beautiful all at the same time. The graphics are still looking good, level design is great and the sound effects build constant terror while the music is great homage to the first movie. Almost from the start I got shivers because the music brought the first movie into my mind. Occasionally the music can be a bit of pain in the ♥♥♥ by playing too loud while one tries to hear the xeno's movement. Although the game is mostly quite linear, one can backtrack quite a lot if they want, although there isn't much to gain from it. Also the game cleverly builds the maps so, that after visiting a new place you almost always end up in a previously visited place from a new direction. It kind of reminded me of Dark Souls but in a more claustrophobic way. So eventually you will visit some places many times, but almost never it feels like a chore. During the last missions I hated the station, not because it was boring but because it was so terrifying. I honestly could relate to the character. I didn't want to go on to another deadly place because I was alive in this current one. Yet I had to go on to actually get out of the station and complete the game.  The main gripes this game has received is it's antagonist, the xenomorph. Unlike most survival horror games, the developers took a different approach. Instead of totally scripted moments, the alien is almost always there. If you make too much sound, it will jump down from the vents and start looking for you. While you can hide, it is said that the alien in the game can learn from your manouvers and essentially the more you succeed avoiding it, the less likely you will succeed in later game. This was something that was mostly missing from Easy difficulty. Although I could kind of prove it by luring the alien many times a row and repel it with flame thrower. Each time I had to use more of the precious fuel to repel it and eventually it killed me just by ramming me. Although it's not explained how the alien knows to start looking from closets if it never found you there, it gives the game a constant tension. Instead of learning all the tricks he can do, he learns all the tricks I can do and the game keeps staying intensive, although I'm given new ways to deal with it. The more time you spend going about, repelling and luring it, the more harder the end game becomes.  But the gripe isn't about the learning, it's about the prevalence of his appearance. On harder difficulties the alien roams the hallways and rarely goes to the vents. On easy he stays more in the vents and roams less. That means, the harder the difficulty, the more the player has to play aggressive to avoid it and yet progress in the story. The problem is the game is quite unforgiving, some save stations are far and between and there are only few ways to avoid the xeno in the first few missions. So the game isn't easy and it punishes the player for any mistakes. ** So if you have found this game too irritating or hard, I suggest trying the lower difficulties that change the game quite a lot. It's not about damage and amount of items, but the whole game mechanic that comes different.  There are some flaws that I can point out. The biggest of all, the xenomorph is a bit blind. This isn't obviously clear from the start, but it can mostly see only infront of it. This means that one can almost sneak right next to it without it seeing you. Also it cannot see the player if she's behind a small object or a table. At some points, where the alien is scripted to linger in the area(in easier difficulties too), the common tactic is to find a box or a small table and just go around it while the alien walks the other side. The blindness of the xeno is sometimes almost baffling, he can walk just right by you and then the next minute he finds you from the vents or from a closet. So the core mechanic of the game encourages to do gamey things. It's less intelligent to hide in a perfectly dark closet instead of hiding under a small table or behind a small chair. In my opinion this kind of breaks the immersion instead of creating it, although the music seems to love me being so close to the alien on the open.  The minigames are a bit of a chore as they are mostly only related to going through door or opening some computer or hatch. There's rarely any rush and they are quite easy. The power junction mechanic seems a bit underused and underpowered to justify it's presence in the game. I encountered a couple glitches that gave some comical relief but mostly the game was rock solid with no major bugs or problems.  So for me this was one of the best games I played this year. It was the most atmospheric game propably of all time. I'm terrified enough not to play it again anytime soon and have to recommend it to anyone with a love for Alien, survival horror as a genre and computer games in general. Although if you hate any of the three mentioned above and have little patience to somewhat challenging game mechanic, you propably will have a better life with out experiencing this one.

The door that leads to the exit is offline so I need to backtrack a bit to reboot some systems and restore power.  I see a save station so I save my game. I check my motion tracker. It blanks out for a few moments but it eventually reveals nothing on the scanner. I walk confidently into a dining area. There is damage: some fire and lots of debris everywhere. I need to watch my step. I see the generator at the far end of the room and a terminal. My objective. That's when I hear a blip from the motion tracker. I panic as I hear something large slump down from the vents with a large THUD. I hide behind a couch and peek from the side of it. Amidst the flashing red emergency lights and all the smoke I can see the outline of an elongated head and a tail whipping from side to side. The  alien  is here, in the room with me. It starts walking about, searching for any kind of movement. If it spots me I'm dead. I sneak in the opposite direction and hide in a locker. Through the narrow slits of the locker I see the creature checking every nook and cranny of the room. Then it turns and takes a good look at the locker I'm in. It starts walking slowly towards me.  Oh god no  I have to hold my breath as it inspects the locker closely. It feels like an eternity has gone by until it leaves to search another room. It's gone for now.  I exit the locker and check my motion tracker again: There's movement far behind me but its far enough to give me time to restart the generator.  I walk to the generator and I restart it. It makes a loud whirring noise as some of the lights in the room come back on. The sound makes me panic as I hurry to the computer terminal to reboot systems. I heard a loud hiss somewhere in the distance. I navigate to the utility folder and do what I need to in a jiffy. With the power now on I turn around to make my way to the door. The alien is right behind me. I SCREAM as it grabs me and proceeds to make a whole in my skull. Game over.  Lucky I saved my game recently. xD  Really great game that pays tribute to the first Alien movie. Excellent sound and visuals and a deeply terrifying atmosphere. On  nightmare  difficulty this game made me jump out of my seat in a few segments. xD  There are a few issues, like the sometimes annoying AI, some silly drawn out sequences, plot holes and a nonsense ending - but aside from that this game is worth it if you're an Alien fan. It's better than the other ones!",

            "review_text": "When Alien: Isolation was announced back in 2011 I thought: 'Great, another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ alien game that will continue to butcher the franchise.' But the moment I saw the presentation on the creation of Alien: Isolation at EGX Rezzed '14, I was instantly hooked and somehow KNEW this will be good.   Alien: Isolation is a natural and faithful extension of the original Alien universe in a way that movies would never be able to portray. It's crazy that it took 35 years for a video game to pay proper tribute to one of the best movies ever made. Creative Assembly really embraced Alien and it's showing every second.   There's not much to be said that others haven't: The art direction is outstanding, the visuals feel truly 'next gen', the music draws from the original soundtrack, the sound effects are haunting, and the Alien really is the perfect organism.   I've also played the experimental VR mode with the Oculus Rift DK2. The sensation of presence I've felt was just astounding, especially while being hunted. Instead of pushing buttons when hiding behind a corner, I literally stood up and leaned my head. It was a bit too much virtual reality for me; my heart is pounding, my hands are sweaty and my pants are soiled.   Thank you CA for such a wonderful experience and restoring (the) Alien to it's former glory!",

            "review_text": "I'm way too late with this, I got this game in launch but never finished it up until now.  How I didn't finish this game MUCH earlier is a mystery to me, perhaps I was busy or something, because Alien is possibly my all-time favorite sci-fi movie, this game treats it's source material with such passion and respect, I can't say it's anything else but a masterpiece crafted by people who feel the same way I do about the Alien franchise.  It's in all the detials, the very opening theme looks like a distorted VHS tape, all the props, terminals and sounds in the game look and sound as if they were taken straight from the original Alien film, I lack the words to properly say how amazing and dreadful that felt, it's things like this that make games like this an experience, one that'll stick with me.  Luckily look &amp; feel is not all this game has to offer, the Alien, the 'perfect organism' combined with the other threats and hazards on the station make for a very dreadful and intimidating experience, in a good way, anxiously watching your motiontracker as you hide wherever you can.. the best way I can describe it as is imagining yourself in an Alien movie, 'I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathies...'  In many other Alien games, you get a gun and shoot the Aliens, that's not what makes the Alien franchise special, this game embraced what DID make it special, you are inferior to the Alien, you cannot kill it, ﻿you cannot outrun it, all you can do is hide and use anything available to you to distract it, the sheer adrenaline rush of knowing the Alien is coming for you is fantastic, I've surprised myself with split second decisions I made just to keep it away for just a moment longer.  The beauty of this game is how unpredictable it is, there have been so many moments where I made plans to get to my goal, crafted all the tools I thought I'd need, and then the Alien throws it all overboard by outsmarting me, it makes every encounter fresh and frightening.  My only gripe is that you'll also face hostile humans and rogue androids, while these encounters can also be very tense, sometimes I caught myself being more annoyed by the fact that some prick with a gun is trying to stop me for no clear reason, I get that the station is in a state of anarchy and everyone is just trying to survive, at some points this can feel great, but every now and then it can be annoying.   Though the game redeems itself with this later on, you can throw noisemakers at humans to have the Alien pop up and deal with them, there was a tense but great moment for me later on in the game, I had told myself I would not kill other people, but eventually I reached a state of total panic, the Alien was after me, things were falling apart, people yelled at me to back off and fired not long after that, and then I pulled the trigger, not because I wanted to, but just out of panic and adrenaline, you truly feel like a survivor, with all the good and bad things that come with it.  Eventually I finished my fresh playthrough in a little over 2 days, no dull moment in any of that time, when the credits rolled I sat back and just watched in awe, my childhood dream (or perhaps nightmare) of being in the shoes of someone who has to face the Alien threat had come true, and I want to thank Creative Assembly for letting me experience just that to this degree.  If you like the movie, or a frightening adrenaline rush with plenty of surprises and even a good story, you have to pick this game up.",

            "review_text": "This game is amazing, and one of the few that I regard as 'full price worthy' even years after its release.   Artwork, Atmosphere, Feel: The artwork is spot on and a real love letter to Ridley Scotts Alien movies. Every room feels authentic and is full of detail but never feels cluttered or overloaded. And it is not just the bigger areas, even those little dead end hallways that are only there to make the level layout more believable are rich with atmosphere.   Gameplay: At its core it is a hiding and sneaking game but you also get weapons to fight back. You can't kill the Alien but pretty much everyone else. On top of that is a light crafting system that lets you build distractions, bombs and other little helpers that allow different solutions to a problem. But resources are rare and require additional exploration = more risk to gather.   Another great aspect of the gameplay and this ties in very well with the lvl design is the obfuscation of the engagement areas. A lot of similar games make the mistake that they send you down a linear path with no hiding spots or dark shadowy corners and then all of a sudden you see a room full of them which makes it a clear tell that an enemy will show up and breaks the game apart into safe exploration areas and dangerous engagement spots. This game does it differently, you will often find rooms with conveniently placed hiding spots that would allow a safe route from one shadow to another, a clear tell that an enemy encounter is up, huh? But nope, no one is there. This might sound like a minor detail but it adds so much immersion.  The alien itself doesn't use a fixed patrolling route, rather some sort of clever AI which works pretty well. Only downside to this, and this took me a while to get used to is that you will see it a lot. I would have preferred if it would stay more often in hiding and only come out when it sees a good opportunity to attack you directly, like in the movies.   Overall I would score it a solid 9.5 ",

            "review_text": "While many credit Resident Evil with inventing the survival horror genre (and Silent Hill with expanding upon it soon after), I've never played a game truer to the genre's ideals than Alien: Isolation. It instills in the player a sense of helplessness and sheer terror (and, of course, isolation) as well as and, in many ways, better than any other game ever has. In addition to capturing the soul of the movie Alien - down to the dim, claustrophobic spaceship corridors filled with steam and dust particles, retro-futuristic computer interfaces, and ambient noises and music, this is a living, breathing homage and love letter to Alien fans - Isolation captures the soul of the titular Xenomorph itself. The 'perfect organism' will hunt you relentlessly using the same vents, hallways, and stations you do to traverse the sprawling abandoned space hub Sevastopol, and its AI is a marvel to behold. Unlike other survival and stealth games, there is little to nothing you can do to predict enemy behavior as there are no set patrol routes to memorize or programmed reactions to remember - enemy behavior is contingent on your behavior and the context of the situation. In addition to the Alien itself, you encounter dangerous rogue androids and other humans who will usually shoot on sight simply out of fear which you can use to your advantage as their gunfire is likely to draw out the Alien who will quickly clear the room while you hide (one of many dynamic strategies you'll learn to employ). And hide you will - much of the 20+ hour long campaign involves a game of cat-and-mouse with extreme levels of tension (in addition to being a survival simulator, this could be considered an anxiety simulator - many moments are simply too intense and require breaks in between to catch your breath). If you attack the Alien with conventional weapons, you're dead; if you're hiding and it hears you breathing, you're dead; if it even sees you, you're dead. This combined with scarcity of ammo and parts (used to devise gadgets like noisemakers and Molotov cocktails) forces you to make smart, tough decisions as you progress through the story.  Unlike most modern games with checkpoints and automatic saving systems, save points are manually triggered and scarce, and since you die frequently, you will have to repeat certain steps in some missions which can become tedious. This could be considered a fault - I certainly got annoyed about having to backtrack and repeat around ten minutes of progress because I let my guard down for a little while and was killed before reaching the next save point - but it also strengthens the game's emphasis on realistic survival in a hostile environment. You are not a heroic protagonist - you play as Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda after the events of the first Alien movie, and though she is smart and brave, she is simply no match for the Alien or hoards of androids or armed humans. In her shoes, you must move carefully, stealthily, and tactically, conserve ammo, and do whatever it takes to survive. While many consider this a game-breaking flaw (including IGN and GameSpot, both of whom panned Isolation and rated it 6 out of 10), I consider it extremely dynamic gameplay that rewards players for their patience and good decision making and punishes them unrelentingly for rushing to the next objective. Your most valuable tool comes in the form of a motion detector that picks up the relative location of enemies and comrades alike. What it does not do, however, is give exact locations, and since the Alien has the capability to use the environment to its fullest, even if you get a ping on your tracker indicating it is close by, you have no idea whether it's in the next room, clambering through a vent shaft above you, or ready to pounce from a blind spot. Audio plays a huge role here - in addition to having an amazing soundtrack that pays homage to the movie and gives the space station you explore a personality as much as the equally brilliant visuals do, simply listening to the Alien's footsteps and raspy breathing aids you in avoiding it effectively and adds to the overall atmosphere in ways that put many other AAA titles to shame.  If I've not made it clear yet, Alien: Isolation is a thrilling, harrowing experience, and I mean this in the best way possible. If you're a fan of the film(s) and/or enjoy survival horror such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dead Space, BioShock, and especially Outlast (which is the most similar in its ability to make the player feel deserted, petrified, and outmatched), you owe it to yourself to play this game. However, it would be a mistake to approach it like any survival horror game that came before as it is significantly less action-oriented (you'll hardly fire a weapon if you play it smart, which is really the only way to play) and its highly dynamic &amp; adaptive enemy AI is unlike anything the genre and possibly even videogaming as a whole has ever seen. An optimal PC port and instant classic.",

If what you want is a faithful tribute to the original Alien film, lovingly crafted as a survival horror, you will not be disappointed.  To be frank, this game isn't perfect. It's got a few technical niggles and some voice acting/lip synching problems. That said, in the time I've played it, it's evident that this game was made with real love and respect; something which frankly in my opinion forgives any minor issues the game might have. I can't say for sure as I haven't reached the end, but from what I've seen so far, I cannot recommend this game enough!  Finally, an Alien game that's not a cash-in, half-baked or a direct attempt at fraud.",

            "review_text": "First of all, there should be the possibility to write  neutrale reviews . I neither can recommend it nor can't recommend it. But I really want to let you know what I thought about this game when I finished it.  Alien: Isolation started really strong for me. What I saw in the trailers and first gameplays made me feel like I have to play this game really bad. A Alien game with survival elements? That HAS to be good. So I thought at least. The first hours with this game began and everything they made wrong in the last Alien: Colonial Marines where made better or are even fixed. Graphics are brilliant, the story in the first hours was very thrilling and even the survival part started to get interesting with more materials you are able to collect and crafted items which will help you to get through your journey.  But thats all about it. The missions you get while continuing the game become more or less the same. Go to that place X - turn on the generator/press that button/get that item/code/keycard - go to the place X back - find out you need a something else and go to place Y. After a while it really gets annyoing if you have to walk back through the whole section just to obtain something you need to progress. Everytime you think you're finally at the destination something happens and you have to accomplish something else first. That might be the sense behind that game - while you are also chased by that Alien - but after 5 hours it really IS repetitive and feels like artificially extended.  Apropos Alien. Yes. You're getting chased by ONE Alien, thats not killable and will be more and more aggressive in the lategame. Thats not bad at all to have the feeling you always need to hide or run away, right? The problem with this Alien is that it will kill you instantly on sight. You can't run away anymore if you don't have a molotov or the flamethrower with enough ammo to scare it away. Near the end it just appears again and over again in situations where you can't really hide or wait too long till it will go up the vents again. I am patient but not patient enough to wait on one place 5 mins with the hope it will disappear again. It also reacts to sounds/noises, e.g. fighting/shooting/running. After you first encounter that thing you really have to sneak or slowly walk 80% of the game. It slows down the progress but won't be a big deal if you're patient enough.  The next point I really didn't like was the fact, that you can't gather all materials which are lying around in the area. You always have a limit for every material you will find. Some are limited to 3 per material, some to 9 per material. That makes the crafting part really difficult. You don't know when you will find the next sensor or the next cable. That made me stack up and just craft items when I really need them. I always left a lot of materials behind through that and this destroy the whole crafting element.  Let's cut a long story short:  This game is neither good nor bad in my opinion but I will tend to NOT RECOMMEND it. I can't really describe how the fun I had turned into boredom, hate and in the end even a rage-uninstall. I just want to let you know that this game isn't worth it's whole price and you should only get it when you're very very patient and have no problem with repetitive elements.   All in all:   6.0/10.0",

            "review_text": "I got to say this game is absolutely astounding. The lighting in the game is perfect and the Alien AI lets just say it's super smart. The first time I encountered it was in a vent of all places right before I was actually supposed to see it for the first time. Knowhere is safe no matter where you hide. I've died so many times from getting pulled out of lockers and storage cabinets just when I thought it would leave. However I figured out later on that you can hold your breath and lean to the back of the cabinet or locker if it senses you. You have to be really quick though and you can't be leaning back already which is most likely the reason I died so many times.   The Alien itself looks exactly like in the movie and is very unpredictable. You can hear it crawling through the vents above you. You never know when or which one it will come down from. It will hear you running, walking, or if you bump into things so you spend the majority of the game crouching and looking where you walk. If it sees you you can either scare it away with fire which will ♥♥♥♥ it off or it was nice knowing ya. It can't be killed. The sound effects and music are brilliant. They play just at the right moment and keep the atmosphere of the game tense.   Aside from the Alien itself there are other dangers like Androids and other humans. The humans are not much of a problem because you only have to lure the Alien to them (you probably know what happens next), but the Androids on the other hand are a problem because the Alien is not interested in them. Also the only time you can save in the game are at 'Save Stations.' When you die you'll start next the last one you were at. This can be frustrating because in some parts of the game you won't run into another save station for a good while. This along with backtracking through the same areas you've already been through in the second half of the game is quite rage inducing.   For this being Creative Assembly's first take on the survival horror genre I think they nailed it. They really did the movie honor and it seems they truly cared about the content that went into the game. This is the game that Aliens Colonial Marines wishes it was.",

(No excuses for TLDR, this is an indepth and well worded review of the game)  (With only a few hours of gametime, I personally was scepticle to review this game, however I would like to upon the great enjoyment I'm having so far.)  Firstly, it's clear to say this is definitely a more thrilling and money-worthy game than Aliens: Colonial Marines. The game promises the real fear and intensity of facing the incredible and ferocious Xenomorph and portrays the alien in a much more darkening light. Most previous games that feature the Xeno's are all about killing masses of them whilst not really being that scary. Alien: Isolation turns this around and instead of gunning these creatures down - you're really wanting to stay as far away from them as possible.  The gameplay evens out nicely, whilst it's not too challenging, it's also not a walk in the park. There are different routes around specific areas, a plethora or opportunities and items to accumilate or interact with along your way. You can make items such as the Smoke Bomb, or Noise Maker to use as a distraction - but make haste - for your decisions will surely need to be quick, careful and precise. There are weapons in this game too, however, they way you want to use them is entirely upon you - just be catious, guns make noise... and noise attracts unwanted attention...  The atmosphere is well done. Whilst arguably it may not be 100% perfect, it's definitley as good as the orginal Alien movie and suits well to the game. You'll find a lot of dark areas that will make you reluctant to traverse through as well as noises, such as engines or the humming and odd beeping of machines that may make you stop and listen. The atmosphere can often trick you into thinking there's something around, sometimes it's not the case but... be cautious!  Other than just the game itself, there's some great and nifty little features. The map and menu systems are nicely done, with the poor quality of 80's styled computers, paying real homage to the original Alien film. There are collectables too which gives you more reason to have a good explore around and keep an eye out for items you can use as well as these collectibles. There are many interactable objects that can be rather fascinating and you can even use to your ability to aid you in the environment you're in.  None the less, this is definitely a game that most fans of the Alien saga should check out and even try. There's an amazing amount of detail and it's clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into this game, especially so with the help and insight of the original movie cast. Fans will be immersed into this incredible and gripping game and it's fantastic ways and familiarities to the classic film back in the day.  I recommend this game to fans alike as well as people who enjoy a good immersive horror survival! - 8/10",

You have non-stealth options, but they're not the smartest. You need to be patient with everything you do. The stealth aspect trumps the horror aspect even. It's more stealth than survival horror. You can sneak through everything undetected if you're methodical and careful.  The atmosphere of the first film is nailed perfectly, and the mechanics are fun and interesting.  The minuses for me include character dialog animations, which with the characters looking as good as they do basically look like sock puppets when they speak, which is extremely unusual and slightly immersion breaking. Additionally, encounters with humans are not particularly interesting, though they are tense.   The best part of the game is the AI and how it operates via senses and learns (yes, learns) what you are doing to counter it.  Example: in an early encounter with the alien I threw a smoke bomb, and it ran to investigate, letting me escape down a hall and lock a door.  In the next encounter I tried the same thing, and it turned to the smoke but did not investigate. Ditto for the third.  By the fourth time I did this, it decided, 'Okay, smoke bombs are not where food is, so I am going to look around elsewhere.' This forced me to change up my tactics by dropping smoke bombs on myself.

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation - or - Totally Accurate Alien Simulator  This game, man. Firstly, its unbelievably loyal to the first Alien film - aesthetically speaking. (I'm not sure when Rips Sr is supposed to have had this kid, and why she was never mentioned in the film). The way every piece of machinery looks, works and sounds is so bang on that you feel as though you are in the Alien universe. I'm sure its incredible in VR. The tension created by the encounters with the Alien is unbelievable, especially when you are not someone who gets scared easily. I think there's something about space that really heightens this sense of fear (see also: Dead Space). The game itself is really nicely polished apart from some of the moments in low light and during cutscenes (I felt as though the framerate was quite choppy).  The controls are really tactile (using levers and reloading things like the revolver) and the minigames at terminals, although somewhat cut-and-paste, provide not only some interest to activities that could quickly become boring but also in some moments more tension, especially when you are evading enemies.  The trope of you knowing that things will never be as simple as flicking a switch to get access to somewhere gets played a lot here and there is some back tracking at times, but you do get to know some areas of the ship suprisingly well, both because of the aforementioned linear style but also because you won't get through the game without dying at least once. Probably considerably more times than that. The Alien AI is very intuitive too. Every time you use one of the items in your box of tricks, it subsequently becomes less effective for the next time. Something I discovered first hand in the closing stages of the game and was chucking everything I had at this thing to leave me alone.  The other NPCs however I would have liked to have had more interaction with, perhaps being able to befriend random civilians who might have rewarded me with a secret keycard to a weapons stash or something.  The crafting system is simple but very well done, decisions about where components are better invested could become quite tricky for someone who is too gadget orientated, although I never had a problem with running out of anything. Two things about the inventory wheel though: it sometimes changed weapons when I didn't want it to and I would have liked to see a description of each item whenever I wanted, rather than only on the crafting screen. The story I felt while engaging was a little hollow but perhaps this was superfluous given the very clear protagonist/antagonist relationship.  A word about a certain weapon:   there is a weapon that is gotten about 1/3 of the way into the game that changed what were suspenseful encounters with the Alien into something more trifling. The Alien does learn from overuse of this item however I never felt it really did prevent its effectiveness, apart from in the very closing sections of the game (18/19).     Top 3/ bottom 3  1) Very true to Alien film 2) Always suspenseful 3) Alien AI switches up gameplay  98) Occasionally bad graphics 99) Slightly limp story 100) Heavy reliance on certain weapons  85% would hide in a locker for 10 minutes again",

I literally shake when I hear the Alien crawling around in the vents. Prime example. Gotta distract the Alien to advance. I think ill shoot the pistol. Grab its attention, bypass and be home free. I shoot, I hide in a locker. The alien climbs out of the vent closest to me (by the way the animations are so god damn nice its borderline life like) and I stay there for 10 minutes crying because I can't hear it anymore but I know its close. So I decide to get out where I fumble with the reload, start putting the rounds into the cylinder of the pistol when I hear this huge thud behind me and its hiss, not even a meter away from me. I stay still for like 10 seconds when I slowly turn around and then it pounced. Creating this truly terrifying animation where I had to pause the game and revert save as it was too much. This is the first game to have ever made me feel this scared in all of my life and has truly set the bar for new horror games.  CA have made a beautiful organism which it truly deserved, as said before, it could have just pounced and got it over with. But instead, it knew it had me, so it was basically just toying with its food. That's what really scared me. The fact that in the 10 seconds I was just praying for it to get it over with, it didn't. It just decided for me to either run or to turn to look at it. CA have made this creature have a fantastic AI which is fantastic   The game just oozes atmosphere. You don't even see the Alien for 2 levels. Its only till the end of the 2nd mid 3rd you actually see it. But I was still jumping at every hissing pipe, vent noises. Anything which could have been the alien.  Bottom line is. This game is truly a great example of what gaming can make you feel.

I beat the game going through in about 12 or so hours on hard mode, died many, many, many times. I shall do an easy playthrough to collect everything and gain the remaining acheivments.",

            "review_text": "Alien Isolation is a first person stealth horror game  while i don't necessarily think it's a scary game, maybe because i played so many that i find them hard to be 'horror' but it does an excellent job in this aspect.  The environments are designed so well, the visuals\\lighting, sounds, voice acting and the story is superb, everything stays true and loyal to the atmosphere and aesthetics of the first aliem movie.  The story is huge but here is a glimpse  you will play as Amanda Ripley(daughter of Alien protagonist Ellen Ripley) with the objective to find the flight recorder from her mothers vanished ship the Nostromo that is located in the sevastopo station. Upon arrival at sevastopol she finds that the station is damaged and largely deserted, its inhabitants reduced to small bands of frightened, paranoid looters hoarding scavenged resources who react violently to anyone outside their group. all due to a 'monster' that is loose aboard...    Gameplay    The space station is divided into multiple sections, each section is composed of a set of rooms and corridors separated by doors, some doors will require a keycard or a numbered entry code, while others need to be cut with a plasma torch or hacked using an electronic device and of course stealth tactics in order to survive against the alien and other threats. you will be able use a motion tracker to detect their movements, craft several items like emps, noisemakers, molotovs and pipe bombs by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game to be used as distraction, weapons to deal with some threats if necessary because you will have limited health and ammunition also most of these weapons will attract the alien. the game has several save terminals spread along the areas some between levels so you have to be careful because if you die you will rollback like 10-15min.    Length   It took me around 23hours to complete    Pros   the storyline level design atmosphere\\sounds and soundtracks (Headphones are a must) execellent graphics and visual effects with good performance unpredictable alien AI behaviour. you have to adapt and change to outsmart it     Cons   some issues with the AI in nightmare difficulty(i dont recommend this mode, if you want more challenge theres plenty mods out there) Somewhat linear storyline. Although you can choose many different paths/options, the story sticks to a script. It would have been nice to have more control over the story. DLCs are just minigames but they are almost for free so.. unbalanced flamethrower ammo in the last hours of the game, it felt overpowered because the ammo was too common some unnecessary levels(just to extend the time of the game( you can't pick up weapons from survivors(scripted), they re only usefull against humans anyway.      Final verdict   I enjoyed this game from start to finish, its simply a quality game. the gameplay and plot are well done. it has some minor problems related to item balance(you problably wont notice). the first hours of the game is bit boring until the alien shows up. it has many puzzles but with the length of the game they can be repetitive and too much stealth require in some levels that can lead to frustration and annoyance  i will give a 8.5/10  Is this game for everyone? maybe not.it requires patience, this isnt fast paced fighting the alien face to face, the game can be frustrating for some...   you might find the experience too much to handle    if you like sci-fi \\ horror or you're an Alien film fan, you will enjoy this game.",

It is long but well paced, and contains so many winks to the movies, and respects the franchise to an amazing degree.  The visuals are simply amazing, I was really impressed multiple times by the smoke particles and the lighting, as well as the level design and how faithful it was to the movie. Some people have complaints about the game being repetitive, and being about fixing machines and opening doors etc. But if you take a look at the movies, that is pretty much all they are about too, they make a plan to escape, do some SCI-FI stuff and it usually goes sideways and they need to adapt and make a new plan.  The game is a perfect adaptation of that, and in my opinion it was just the right lentgh. I enjoyed the Stealth mechanics (played on Hard) and I really enjoyed using the tools that the game gave me to distract/attract the Alien. I finished the game without killing any humans, I would instead attract Androids/Alien to kill them for me, and that felt very satisfying and cool.  All in all, this is now one of my favorite survival horror games, not because it's scary, but because of how well the world is crafted, and how immersive it feels.",

            "review_text": "Review after the first playthrough.  I was pulled into the story right from the beginning. The atmosphere has been masterly crafted to resemble the original Alien movies. The story is well written, save for some tedious bits towards the end (see issues list below). I won't repeat it here as much has been written about it elsewhere already. In general, the story is gripping, understandable and not too convoluted in contrast to too many titles nowadays which try to unnecessarily outsmart the player/viewer. Some twists and turns are there as should, but nothing too wild. Stays within the realm of 'could happen', as a good scifi piece should.  Visually the game is among the best I have ever seen. You probably can't do a much better job with today's technology. The environment looks almost as good as on film. Objects are modelled in high detail, with style that always stays true to the film. Some areas are cozy, some cold, and often I just found myself looking around, letting it all sink in. Lighting stood out to me as particularly impressive, really adding to the authenticity of the world.  Character models are very good but not perfect, still a long way to overcome the uncanny valley. Interaction with NPCs also left room for improvement. I would have liked to see more lively friendly NPCs in particular. The sense of being stranded in a space station with a hideous monster was not apparent in their behaviour.   Audio is top notch. From the station's creepy sounds of decay to the alien's growls and hisses, the soundscape together with beautiful visuals truly create an immersive universe. Voice acting is good and casting Sigourney Weaver to voice the original Ripley is a nice touch.  Gameplay at its core is a pretty standard first person adventure: collect / craft items, collect keycards to access closed areas, power up/down this or that system to advance. Using tools and operating control panels in the game requires different button sequences and combinations, adding to the illusion that you are actually operating a more complicated instrument and not just pushing buttons. To avoid the alien and other threats you need to sneak around quietly, hide in closets and pay attention to the motion tracker to keep you safe. You can craft weapons and distractions (EMP grenades, noisemakers, etc.) to help you on your way.  During the story there is some going back and forth between areas you have already visited, but I only found that positive as it contributed to the feeling of being closed in the space station with no way out. The game is also semi-open in the sense that it allows you to visit some areas that are not directly on your path, i.e. it is not a strict tunnel run.  Gameplay and design is mostly great, but I did encounter some issues. Here's a non-exhaustive list: - The first WTF moment was in one of the early missions where you encounter hostiles for the first time. They are armed, so when you knock them out their revolver drops on the ground. So you are alone in a hostile environment, with a revolver at your feet. You know it's real because you can kick it around. You would surely like to pick it up. But nope, you can't. You can kick it around, but can't pick it up. At the end of the day, a very small detail but this kind of stuff should never end up in a game of this caliber. - Pulling away from computer terminals etc. takes too long. Designers rather chose to show pretty animations instead of letting the player snap out immediately, e.g. to knock out that android who's just about to strangle you. Unrealistic and annoying. - Jump scares. Personally, I don't find them scary, only annoying when used in excess. For me, creating a truly scary atmosphere needs to be a long process, a steady build-up of tension using subtle tools of design and storytelling. Luckily the designers did well in that department, so jump scares are not the only tool they used to keep you on your toes. Again, a small dent in otherwise shining armor. - Sometimes the alien felt a bit too psychic. Many completely unavoidable deaths. - Unmarked doors in mission 11. Some open, some don't, can't really know without bumping into them. Some event triggers in this mission were too fiddly. - The alien derelict mission was a bit of a filler. Maybe a cutscene would have done it instead? - The map is sometimes confusing since it doesn't indicate clearly on which floor your goal is.  - The ending of the game drags for way too long. Some of the twists that prolong the game for yet another 15 mins felt artificial.  Anyway, the positives FAR outweigh the negatives. Never before has a movie universe been turned into a game this well. Bought it on sale for -50%, but on hindsight would not have regretted paying full price either. If you love scifi and adventure, get this game. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": " Alien: Isolation  .. is an absolute success as a survival horror.  (The  TO LONG, DIDN'T READ  part is at the bottom of this review)   Atmosphere:  This game is visually stunning while keeping true to the franchise. When you play this game, you  really feel  like you're in the Alien universe. The audio and music really impressed me, due to keeping the mood steady and having you feel paranoid when nothing is happening... until it happens. After playing for almost 10 hours, I haven't grown tired of the scenery nor the game's setting. Really nice seeing a game hold up strong with just this concept.  Since this is based on the PC version... the graphics are stunning. Some gameplay actually feels like you're in a cutscene, but really you're in control of the character during this. Particular segments are even breath taking if I dare say, which is of course, later in the game. The overall lighting and attention to detail is much appreciated in this game. Even looking at the character models, the Alien's design or other features were golden. That, and the environment never gets old so you'll remain immersed. There is some back tracking, but not to much where it becomes noticable.   Mechanics:  The design of this game was very well thought out. While you can 'fight' off enemies, it's far wiser to stick with stealth. Any noise you make from kicking something over, to slamming the locker to hard, or activating anything shall in fact cause chances of the Alien coming in from the vents or drawing unwanted attention. The Motion Scanner is perhaps the most vital tool since it helps locate where living organisms are at. You can also craft items to help you in tight spots such as the Noise Maker or Flashbang. The game can be experienced in multiple ways in depending on how you use this tools to your advantage. Did I forget to mention that the game really punishes you for carelessly causing noises or wasting materials? Because it sure does and feels like a good challenge. Try going in the vents yourself while the Alien's crawling around... you might want to check your map for other alternatives.  What I love about the game's core is that it truly feels like you're trying to survive. Don't expect to walk around blasting through anyone, especially the Alien. You are required to think ahead, plan where you'll wonder about, and be careful again in making noises. There's segments where you must hack doors and devices in order to continue onward, and at any moment... you can die. There's never a safe point, even when actually saving your game. The emergancy phone (aka to save your progress) will warn you if enemies are nearby.   Oh and even though you're not friends with the Alien, let's just say you can use the creature to your advantage in getting through certain situations such as heavily guarded areas by crazy survivors. One toss of, say, a flashbang or causing them to shoot at you will instantly alert the Alien to spring out and waste them away. It's really fun to see.   AI:  Honestly, the humans are a bit weak in terms of AI along with the voice acting. Besides the main character Ripley, who acts realistic when either facing a tough call, or getting emotional- everyone else kind of brings you out of the immersion. First off, the other survivors feel like they're reading off a script. Sometimes, they will stand still and not fire at you despite recently doing so for some reason. There are even occassions that the people will suddenly stare at you despite you're running at them with a wrench. I haven't ran into anyone else who has given me a reason to care about them.  The androids in the game have been done correctly. Simple, emotionless machines that talk civil but are frightning all the same. They don't chase the player by sprinting, but somehow manage to cause tension to rise regardless. Unlike the humans, you can't simply take them down with gunning them or wacking them, as they shall brush it off and assault you. This is where the beauty of the mechanics comes in as you use tools to delay or destroy them for good. Also, they look very devious and voiced perfectly to fit their role.  ... Now, what about the actual threat? The  Alien ?  Cannot lie to you guys, it's one of the most SMARTEST AI's that I have seen yet. Literally acts like an actual animal, traveling in the vents and coming out at random. When I say random, I mean it can actually come out whenever it wants from either hearing noise or noticing movement beneath it. But it doesn't just wander mindlessly, it'll actually hunt for you in ways you couldn't imagine. Hiding isn't even the best solution at times, for the Xenomorph will pick up your tactics and crush any hopes you had. The Alien also isn't out just for you... it will take down any survivors that are with you or against you in this terrifying journey. The Alien alone has brought fear in me that no other Aliens has done before in the previous games... especially Colonial Marines *cough* Trying to outrun the Alien or fight it shall result in an immediate death so plan carefully. It's not easy at all tricking this AI.   Story:  There is an actual plot in this, with terminals and recorders for you to look up. There's a lot of hidden context here and there, and only if you're brave enough to travel in optional rooms will you uncover the truth behind the events. Personally, it's worth investigating because some details are important for you to grasp at exactly why there's an Xenomorph here and why the people 'behave' in certain situations. I won't spoil it for you, but once you get far enough in the game... it'll surprise you how deep the plot actually is.  The main focus, however... involves Ripley trying to find out what happened to her mother 15 years ago. Of course, things go for the worse on the ship they were inspecting so now Ripley must survive and escape the ship while helping her crew mates pull through the challenges.   DLC:  Personally, I have not obtained it. Might purchase it after I beat the game, but for me it's a bit pricey so I shall wait to see. I apologize for not having a review on that (yet).

Awesome sound and visual design, everything is set-accurate to the original 1979 film, from the wailing emergency sirens to the basic DOS-style computers and stark white environments. The game is broken up nicely and never gets repetitive as there are plenty of exploration stages where you don't have to worry about being attacked to break up the tension of constantly avoiding the Alien and frenzied androids.

Lets put this game to comparison. I was barely scared playing Outlast, Not even as close playing the Amnesia Series, and The Evil Within was just a joke.. I jumped into this and I kissed my ♥♥♥ goodbye. When I say this game is scary, its ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. The alien is absolutely unpredictible. Not only that but the alien itself is very smart and can detect you by making the most simple of movements. Knock over a chair that happens to make a 'thud' with the alien close by? Dead. Try to run while the alien is a couple rooms away? Dead. Get too close to the alien? You got it, Dead. The game got me to points where I had to stop playing due to getting some sort of sensory overload. I'm not kidding, this game has gotten me to the point where I couldn't stop shaking. It finds ways to put you in such bad situations that its just unbelievable. The parts before the ending as well were incredible.  Now the game isn't all about the greats, while the game was insanely fun, there were some problems I had throughout the game. One being is that the alien can be TOO smart, meaning if he goes by you while your under a table, theres a 50% chance he's going to find you. (Yet again I was playing on Medium, not Easy nor Hard). In other points in the game there would be enemies barely noticable that could one hit kill you ruining the tension. Several enemies do this. Lastly, the ending wasn't the best. I definitely hoped for much more, but I dealt with it and in the end it wasn't all so bad, original but it left me hanging.   Pros and Cons - Pros: +Amazing AI +Good Mapwork/Detail +Nice Gameplay Elements +Insanely Scary +Holds Tension greatly in some parts +Very Slow Gameplay that leaves you looking into details for clues. +Another Terrifying Type of Enemy. +Unsuspecting Jumpscares (Mostly Original). Cons: -Dev says some passengers aboard the station are nice.. Thats a lie. -AI Can be too smart -Game has around 2-3 points making you think its the end... Nope. -Some Sections are pretty difficult -The game requires Extensive thinking, not puzzle thinking, more like survival thinking. Not easy. -Some parts can kinda drag on and be boring. (But there are very few parts like this, most of the game is awesome). -Ending could have been better... Wasn't bad but there was plenty of room for improvement. -Some sections require insanely long walks that get boring quickly - Especially if you mess up. -A few Cliche Jumpscares.  Storyline - 9/10 Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics - 9.7/10 Ending - 6/10 Overall - 8.7/10  This is in MY personal opinion, I have a extreme love for horror games and out of the many horror games i've played, this one takes the cake. If your a horror junkie and want to get the ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you over and over, this is the game for you. As said, the ending is a bit meh but the rest of the game definitely makes up for it.",

            "review_text": "This game is the best tribute that can be given to Ridley Scott's original Alien movie. I got this game for free for buying a new AMD graphics card. I'm so glad I played this game.  Playing Alien: Isolation is a truly terrifying experience. This is a very serious and dark game and it's definitely not a game to play if you just want to have fun. I played it in hard difficulty mode and that is the best way to play it. Your heart races through and skips a beat at every alien encounter. There are moments when I squirmed, jumped on my bed, closed my eyes and coiled. The alien crushes your hopes every time you think you made it through a mission. The alien is intelligent and unpredictable. You cannot kill it with your weapons. You have to avoid it by hiding under tables, crawling through vents etc. You can know where it is by using a radar-like tracker. But if it's close to you, it will hear the beep from the tracker and spot you and kill you in a gruesome manner.  The alien is not the only enemy on board the space station of Sevastopol. Just when you've escaped from the alien, you'd come across an android whose program has been changed to eliminate all life forms. At times I've felt I'd rather deal with the invincible alien than these androids that are extremely hard to kill. And then there are other human survivors who shoot at anyone they see for no reason. Every single enemy is so difficult to defeat that you'd very rarely use your weapons and rely on stealth instead.  The game starts very slowly. You won't even see the alien for the first 3 hours. The game also moves at a slow pace and picks up pace towards the end. So I think many people may not like this game until they've put about 12-15 hours into it. I'd recommend this game for anyone who liked the original Alien movie and are looking for a serious horror game to play.  Pros: - Gameplay experience - it's a huge plus for the game - Represents accurately the situation a desperate and desolate space station - The horrifying encounters with the alien - Sound : You'll be crapping bricks at every time a door opens, or a generator powers on, or when you turn on a switch wondering if the alien heard that. There are sounds that let you know when the alien comes down to floor from the vents or going back to the vents. They help you plan your strategy of escape - Music : There isn't music at a lot of places which builds up the suspense. And then suddenly there is loud dramatic music that would make your palms sweat in fear leaving you running and hiding just out of the fear  Cons: - Slow pace initially and a little bit longer story - Though the space station is huge, this is not an open world game. There are no side missions. The main story is the only mission you have - Eventhough you play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley from the movie, the story doesn't have much connection with Ellen and you feel the protagonist can be anyone else",

            "review_text": "Okay first off if your a huge fan of the Alien series and a huge fan of horror games then you'll love this, going into it you can be goofy and mess around, make a lot of noise, every once and a awhile you'll hear a scripted bang or clang in the background, I do believe that's preparing you/jumpscares.  Once the xeno shows up, it changes, you have to be very quiet, and hide as much as you can, but it's not just the xeno that is after you, it's humans and andriods as well, if your a fan of the first Alien then you know that WayYu had created inferior andriods and they went nuts and tried to kill the crew, it's kind funny to be hiding and hear the driods say to the alien 'Unidentifed life form, please identfy yourself, logging report with Apollo.' Like the xeno would actually respond.   I like how the game gets smarter and forces you to change tactics to complete missions, only problem with that is the xeno kills you so much that you get frustrated, at one point there was three in the hive/nest, three! and I was freaking quiet!   I know I wasn't playing on the worlds best computer, or the highest graphics but I ran into every glitch there was to be had...Luckily I searched up every one and was able to find fixes, but I really feel like the devs should release a bug fix for these, cause in some cases people can't get any further and they keep resarting hoping it'll work, I dunno maybe I got lucky there because they actually worked.  I may write a guide on the bugs I encountered and how to fix them.  I loved how at first the game made me paranoid, like every sound, every time I would kick a can or something I would worry, oh did he hear it?  I think it was a bit too long and the chapters tended to drone on...especially with dying and not able to find my way anywhere, sometimes I would watch vids for help, most of the time I followed the map.  And whats with the facehuggers insta kills? like seriously no one could pull it off by spamming a button?  Trying not to post spoilers, all in all its great game, buggy as heck and needs fixes, but I really enjoyed it, I hope there is a sequel.  Do I recommend, yes if you can handle high anxiety and handle frustration and bugs.",

            "review_text": "With Alien: Isolation currently being discounted by the Summer Sale I find it necassary to write this review as the game may not justify a full retail price, but most certainly when discounted.   Alien: Isolation does almost everything right in regards to horror as a genre, and this is coming from someone who typically avoids horror games as I frighten easily. It does not rely on jump-scares to induce fear but rather the constant reminder that you are the prey and rarely are you at any type of advantage. At times I found myself almost holding my breath between save-points but the satisfaction of progress makes it all worthwhile. The only only type of leverage you have over the enemies aboard the station is your wit's, ability to analyze your surroundings, and the few tools you have to distract or slow your attackers.   The level design, gameplay, graphics, sound effects and music work together so fluidly that it won't take long before you're immersed in this beautiful and unforgiving game. In regards to the slightly controversial AI and the arguements that at times you feel cheated or that your death is not justified, I believe that in a way it adds to the fear. While this may not exactly be fair, it's still a rare occurence that only inches you one step closer to the edge of your seat.   I'm sure there are many like me that passed this game up because of it's few mediocre reviews/ratings but it's large amount of pros outweigh what little cons you could find. I can't recommend this game enough and for a discounted price I truely believe it will cater to more than just those with an interest in horror and sci-fi. Lastly I 'strongly' recommend wearing a headset while playing as it will without a doubt increase the tension and let you fully experience the game the way it was meant to be played, terrified.",

Easy to follow with plenty of references to please the fans. - Alien AI is immense, its unpredictable and never gets old. - Menacing bots offer a good alternative enemy, the way they charge at you with red eyes and take quite a beating remind me almost of Terminators.   CONS: - I actually felt that the story was a bit too long. As the game is so tense and gameplay slow I found myself bored 11 missions in and actually revisited several months later though it was easy to get back into. - Vsnyc big meant I got major slow down solved simply by turning it off. - The flamethrower, whilst its a great weapon and the fire effects are stunning, it partially removes the fear factor away from the alien as its quite easy to make them back off. At the same time though you feel like an absolute badass,  VERDICT?  This is the Alien game we've always wanted, I can't believe its taken them so long to capture an obvious formula but they have delivered right down to a tee.

I have to say- I was really regretting my purchase, especially because of the fact that I was so excited that I bought the version with the season pass and dlc's and everything. However, I was able to pre-load the game and when I began playing it, all my worry faded as deep immersion and legitamate terror created one of the most pleasant horror survival experiences I have ever had. I am completely satisfied with this game. My only few complaints would be the occasional glitch, the couple of times the human or android AI seems to be a little stupid (the xenomorph alien AI has allows been hyper intelligent), and a few of the voice acting lines in the start of the campaign (specifically from Amanda Ripley) are a little poorly given. With that said, none of these minor problems interrupt my immersion or absolute love of this incredible game. If you are a fan of the original Alien movie or horror survival as a genre (in the way that Outlast could have been if the AI was smart), then you will love this game.

My one note-worthy gripe would be the endgame... probably due to a combination of my game-fatigue (as a result, in part, of the binge-playing), the overall length of game being a bit long for something so intense (I was very thorough, so it took me 30+ hours), and a few too many narrative climaxes crammed together in the last few chapters (resulting in a shift in tone to the ending gameplay that I didn't entirely need or want). I also didn't find the concept of Survivor mode interesting enough to pursue/puchase.  In short: I loved it, despite a few flaws. My fingers are crossed that the rumors of a follow-up come true.",

Instead of following the tropes of recent AAA games, the open world environment of the Sevastopol space station is not yours - it's the Xenomorphs hunting ground and you're just another living piece of food. And that lead to the mixed reviews it initially received: the game plays with you.  The game doesn't take you by the hand. Where other sneaky action games like Dishonored are power fantasies and present the players stealth abilities as a strength to overpower your enemies, hiding is your only option to survive. Alien: Isolation is extremely slow, it's repetitive (depending on how much you die) and it's unfair - and that's why I'm absolutely in love with it.",

            "review_text": "Quick Review:   Overall score 9/10. Much like the original Alien film, AI’s biggest strength is its incredibly immersive atmosphere. Even when the alien isn’t around, the constant sense of paranoia that the game creates is outstanding. I wouldn’t call this game “scary” in the typical horror sense, but no game has ever made me feel so on edge or filled with pulse-pounding tension. As other reviews elaborate on, the action-oriented sequences leave a lot to be desired and are completely underwhelming in comparison to being stalked by the perfect organism. In the end though, be prepared for the most tense and stressful gaming experience in recent memory, if not ever.   Full Review:  Gameplay 9/10 – Intense. That is, perhaps, the best one-word summary of the gameplay in AI. Much like seemingly all of its recent horror-gaming cousins, AI sticks you in a violent world that you are simply not prepared to face head on. You must hide, stay in the shadows, and keep your composure if you want to survive. The few weapons you do find in your travels on Sevastopol are only effective against the scattered human and android enemies you’ll come across. Go ahead, try them on the alien. Just make sure you tape it so I can laugh at your feeble attempt to live. Where this game differs from other related games is, to me, in the masterful sense of tension that it creates. Even playing games like the much-lauded and deservedly so Amnesia, I never felt the same level of drawn out, heart thumping goodness on display here. Every bump behind you or above you, every creak of the ships’ hull will have you anxiously scanning your surroundings. When you find yourself caught in a cat and mouse game with the alien, especially for the first time, your every waking second will feel like an eternity as you struggle to push on and predict what your hunter will do next. Some of the most memorable moments in my gaming history were when I breathed a sigh of relief as I found a clever way around the alien’s path only to hear it scurry into the vents and appear just beyond the next door, mere feet from my face. As I crouch on the other side of a table with the alien across from me, sniffing the air, it begins to move around toward me and all I can do is a delicate dance of almost certain death as I try to keep just that one inch ahead of its gaze. Unfortunately, these amazing moments of terror are sometimes interrupted by haphazard bargain bin FPS action sequences where you must ward off the far less menacing threat of humans and androids. While I certainly agree that the player needs a break from the unbearable tension of being hunted, I’m disappointed that this was the best way the developers could think of. Still though, what this game gets right, it really gets right and if a pulse-raising thrill ride is what you’re after, then I guarantee you will find it here.   Graphics 9/10 – The graphics in AI aren’t jaw-dropping in their majestic beauty or surreal color palette, but for what they are trying to do, they are close to perfect. Every detail is faithfully recreated from the original Ridley Scott vision of the environment and the optional film grain adds a nice touch of nostalgic ambience. The mood lighting in the game is also excellent with brilliant contrast between dark corridors and hopeful glimmers of light, though it never feels too dark. My biggest gripe with the graphics is in the animations. The alien sometimes appears to move about a bit awkwardly and when it does, it takes some of the menacing quality away. The way that the game forces you into completing every single animation also has a tendency to annoy, especially when it’s simply logging off a computer.   Sound 10/10 – A huge part of why the gameplay is so effective is because of the phenomenal sound design. With headphones (you better use headphones foo!) the sound is so immersive and detailed that you will truly feel like you are trapped on the deadliest space station in the universe. Echoes in the halls, the slow creaks of the walls, and certainly not least, the adrenaline boosting thumps and shrieks of the alien itself. I prefer to play with music off as I find it much more immersive, though for the purposes of this review I tested it and found it genuinely effective at fleshing out the atmosphere.  ",

I think Creative Assembly did a fantastic job with this. Seeing another Alien game from SEGA had me...concerned, but as I said, this one is very well done.  The first hour or so is a little boring aside from maybe building up the tension. Once the Alien is introduced, that gets turned on its head.  The Alien AI was quite impressive though it did tend to follow a routine after awhile. Needless to say, I was still on the edge of my seat whenever it was in the level with me. Once the player receives the flamethrower I felt that the tension of hiding from the alien degraded a little (though I assume the amount of fuel pick-ups you'll receive is dependent on the difficulty).  I will say this: certain enemies added later in the main story were frustrating if you did not have the proper 'tools' or anticipate their arrival.  The environment is fantastic, a lot of attention to detail when it came to this. Being a big fan of the first Alien film really brought out a great deal of happiness as I was exploring Sevastopol.  Had fun playing it and I'll likely give it another go.  9/10 (Because of my bias and my love of the Alien film).   DLC's Could have been better and were rather short but I got em' for free so...eh.",

This game makes you use your wits to get out of situations where it can be almost impossible to escape. You WILL Die A Lot in this game.

This extremely immersive experience will have you both paranoid and filled with adrenaline whilst you're being hunted. Not only does this game show how adaptive the xenomorph is, but it keeps you constantly on edge since you won't feel safe anywhere.  I highly recommend this game to anyone willing to survive against the iconic xenomorph and Seegson's not-so-ethically-programmed androids.",

BUt hardly close to the experience this game gives. You HAVE to be cunning, swift, fearless, and curious to make it in this game. You're an engineer which is badass and you must use your mechanical knowledge and enginuity to survive which is way more then I can say for all the games I listed to compare- they are all sub-par action games w/ attempts of horror/survival but their lack of realism and surviving left them w/ nothing left to do but cram action and huge gun fights.  Hats of to this wonderful game. It truly is a game of wit and endurance and i've yet to even play the expansions hahah, I totaly recommend this game to anyone but watch Aliens atleast (the second one because it recaps all the story and what goes down and the Marine part of the film is classic it always makes me laugh.)",

(This only happened a few times) The last problem I had was very late in the game when a load sequence wouldn't ever finish. All you have to do is lower the video resolution a bit and then attempt to load again, and when it finished loading you could turn the resolution back up to how you had it.

I'm a huge fan of the original film and i can honestly say that i consider this to be a true succession to the story and addition to the canon of the Alien universe. This game stays true to the amazing Lo-Fi SciFi art style and makes you feel like you're walking around the set of the original film. If you're at all curious about this game I say buy it.  Many people had a hard time getting through this game because of the advanced Ai that the alien possesses. While its true, the Ai is very strong and intuitive its not all-knowing or impossible to beat. The game will give you tips on the loading screens.. one of them is to 'keep moving' and do it 'quietly'. This is the best piece of advice you can take. Just because you hear bumping in the vents doesnt mean the alien is about to jump out at you.. its just reminding you that its there. 90% of the time you will have plenty of warning to either deter the alien or hide. Be careful not to use your motion detector when an enemy is close and be careful not to bump around world objects as the noise will also attract enemies. Walking around the corridors while out of sight is perfectly safe (though scary). Thats the thrilling part.. just keep walking... stay on the move. That's all I'll say the rest is up to you.  NVidia users might have issues with the AA graphics options. You can turn them on and they will make a difference in picture.. its just not super effective. So no matter what you set it to you'll still have jagged edges unfortunately. Best solution of AA in this game for NVidia users at the time I'm writing this review is to downsample from 4k with AA turned on. If your graphics card can't handle that the game is still very pleasing to the eyes regardless of AA.",

Graphics worthy of a 2014 game, a maybe for a couple of years too. Voice acting is superb and likeable characters are there. History is pretty good, you actually felt you had a purpose. The ship has an amazing design and it is HUGE. Terror is always there, no jumpscares but sounds and ambience. A very long game, in medium took me about 25 hs to finish it.  Great DLC content.

You really feel like you are in that station, isolated, lost and vulnarable. Ammunition runs out FAST and you have to play extremely careful, but it is so bloody worth it when you shove in your save into the slit (no pun intended) and save another hour of progress, it feels so good haha.

Personally I am a huge fan of the alien franchise and enjoy sci-fi movies/games, so i couldnt resist buying this game when it was on special.  In this game, you play as the main protaginist, Amanda Ripley (Ellen Ripley's daughter), and you board a ship called Sevastapool to pick up a flight recorder from the missing ship, Nostromo, which is supposed to hold the information to your mothers whereabouts. That's when everything goes wrong and you are split from your group. From that point on you must rely on your survival instincts and the recources around you to survive and escape from Sevastapool in one peace, only there is something on board - the alien (oh and also those damn androids)  The in-game and cutscene graphics are phenomenal, the voice acting is spot on, the ambience is spooky as hell and the overall gameplay is amazing.

            "review_text": "TLDR; 9/10 'Great for Alien fans, and anyone else who likes stealth, horror, or scifi.'  I will start by saying that I waited way too long to play this. After the tragedy that was Colonial Marines, and some shoddy reviews I'd heard about this title, I was apprehensive to say the least when approaching Isolation. I must say that it was so very wrong of me to wait.   Isolation starts off slowly, building as it teaches you the basics. Before you realize it, you are crawling around like a little kid, staring at your motion tracker as you frantically search for a desk to hide under. This game presents Alien fans with the ultimate version of Hide and Seek.   However, the Alien isn't the only threat. Killer robots and desperate survivors will block your path at varying intervals. There are several segments of the game where you'll have little fear of being hunted by the xenomorph. Alas, those damned bots will do their best to choke the life out of you if you let them.   There is some crafting, but if you are like me, you used most of your resources to make medkits, and noisemakers. I went through almost the entire game without making more than one of any advanced craftables.   By the midway point of the game, you will likely start feeling pretty confident with yourself and the fear will wear thin a bit. The introduction of some weapons in the late game will shift your experience from one of hiding and hoping, to one of untouchable confidence. This feeling comes and goes with certain events in the game. The last couple of hours are by far my very favorite. from start to finish, the game does very well at keeping things tense. In summary, this is one for stealth, survival horror, and Alien fans alike. If you haven't already checked this one out, I highly recommend it.",

And I think no higher praise can be made to an Alien game, than saying it will be perfect for Alien fans. I don't remember well the movies, I just love H.R. Giger's art and vision, I definitely need to re-watch them. I'll try to go by points Pros: - the game engine is a masterpiece. It will run well on toasters, and look good while doing so. Have a good gaming rig? You can realistically play it at 4k @ 60fps. (I am playing it now at 4k downscaled to 1200p) - it's a work of love made by Alien fans, for Alien fans, and for people who love challenging survival horror games. - gameplay is AAA+ good. It's everything a game of this genre should be. You will be actually afraid of making any noise, you will find yourself trying to not move stuff too much, out of fear the Alien will show up. - the game is LONG. And I mean it, it's really taking it's damn time. I tried before buying so my hours played counter is not accurate, but I'll def re-play it and see how long it really is. I guess it's around 15-20 hours of solid gameplay. - you'll go back to places you've visited before, in different situations. This is a mechanic I love in these games.  Cons: - the game AI is a bit on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ side of things, survivors tend to be suicidally stupid, and the Alien tends to walk in fixed patterns, it's obnoxious in one stage of the game, and fairly annoying, but after that stage (I'm talking about Medical) Alien behaviour will make much more sense. It's not a game ruining thing, it will provide a couple of 'What?' moments, but that's it. - there's aliasing everywhere. I had to force Sparse Grid Supersampling 4x ON TOP OF playing it at 4k downscaled to 1200p to have a smooth game.  - only BIG gripe I have with the game: SINGLE SAVE SLOT! If I invite friends over to play the game I can't make them try it from the start, or they'll delete my progress.  I still haven't finished it, but I'm having a blast so far. Very very worth buying.

So many of the details from the Nostromo are present on Sevastopol station, like the dipping birds, the cassette-playing boom boxes, the style of the rooms and bulkheads, the 70s era low tech look and feel to everything. You even get to visit the iconic alien derelict ship in the game via a flashback. Cool! But the most important thing it captures is the feeling of dread, the anticipation of death around every corner. The alien is terrifying, but you are most afraid when you don't even see it, just hear it stalking the halls or scuttling around in the air ducts.  Alien: Isolation features a simple but suspenseful story, fleshed out by logs, radio communications, and a few direct interactions with other survivors on the station. The length and pacing of the game is excellent, there is never a dull moment. The manual save system that I was worried about is actually implemented very well, and I like how they incorporated the save stations into the game world so organically.  Visually, the environments are wonderfully detailed, believably authentic, and sometimes spectacular. I was disappointed in the character animations, however, which looked more like something from five years ago, and the dialogue was not always synced up well with the mouth movements. I hope CA focuses on this more if they do a sequel.  My only real criticism of the gameplay is with the last thirty minutes or so. Without giving anything away, after a certain significant event happens to your character, the gameplay suddenly changes from a stealth/survival game to a consoley/XBox linear action game with cut scenes and a final scene that is a god-awful quick time event. For a game built on the dynamic of completing your objectives while using your wits and limited resources to avoid detection by the alien and other human and android enemies, to end with you mashing keys when prompted was a real letdown. This game would have earned a 10/10 if it had a worthy finish that had you utilize the skills that got you through the first 97 percent of it.",

The story was OK (as was the voice acting, though i found Ripley to be a relatable and likeable character) , however I dont think anyone who has seen the first 2 Alien franchise movies will find anything here to make them become hysterical.

            "review_text": "Although being a fan of the franchise goes a little far, I like the Alien movie and some of its sequels, so when I heard about a horror-themed game based on the first movie, I was genuinely excited. For me, the game is solid enough the recommend when it is around $15. But this comes with a caveat.  First off, the game aces the atmosphere from the movie. It fully replicates the 80's perception of a gritty future and remains completely true to its source. I think this is the main draw of the video game. A second thing the game does really well is replicate the story from the original so as to allow us to relive that movie for ourselfs, while adding enough new content to stand on its own. Classic moments from the movie are relived, which will be to the liking of the fans. The new content mainly comes from exploitation of the themes of the sequels, as well as a deleted scene from the original, which is very well integrated. I genuinely loved the EVA sections, and I hope they put more of them in a hypothetical sequel.  The game is criticized for being too long. Though I understand the sentiment, that quality comes before quanity and that it could be reduced a bit for the sake of a better narrative, I cannot say that the game is overly long. The story kept me motivated enough to push forward. Yes, it is long; but it doesn't drag on and there is variation enough to keep the game interesting. There is a clear break in story somewhere half-way through, but it doesn't feel as if the game drags on. That being said, there are a few sections which started to annoy me because they seemingly didn't end.  In terms of story and atmosphere, the game is rock solid. As for gameplay, however, there are a few issues. The alien is very unpredictable. This is a good thing, we're playing a horror game after all. One of the more annoying things however is that there is often no way to really hide. In one section I had to move from room A to C, going through tunnel B. I encountered the alien at the end of B. There was no place to hide, and outrunning the alien and hiding somewhere in A was no option (the alien runs fast, you can't slam doors shut, and the only useful places to hide are lockers and under desks). Here, luck begins to play a role, which isn't very nice. There are some issues about half-way through, when it becomes more shooter-based (think Penumbra and Dead Space). Ammunition is rare, however, and the enemies are bullet sponges, taking a full clip on normal difficulty settings. Luckily this section ends soon. The final four levels of the video game are particularly powerful. The final point of criticism is that the save system should've been overhauled. The final level uses a checkpoint system which works better than the savepoint system. Most of the tension in the game came from the idea that I hadn't saved for a while.  A final note on the horror aspect: for me the game was not particularly scary. In his movies, Hitchcock exploited the 'fear of the unknown' trope to great success (it is also that which differentiates the original Alien movie from its sequels!). This game is much more explicit, which is exactly why it isn't that scary. I'm not lying when I say that Gone Home kept me more in suspense than Alien: Isolation.",

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation is a stealth-based survival horror game from the Alien franchaise taking place 15 years after the original movie that puts the player in the shoes of Amanda Ripley, Ellen's daughter and also an engineer working for the Weyland-Yutani corporation, as she tries to discover her mother's fate aboard Sevastopol, a derelict space station on a serious crisis.  To begin with, fans of the Alien series will totally be pleased: the general design of the game (on top of displaying nice graphics and level design) heavily borrows is art style from the movies and the sounds departments is particularly rich. The developers have also made their best effort at putting in the videogame that old horror/helplessness feel the first Alien move had, but see below for details.  In true stealth-based fashion, the main objective of Isolation is to follow the directions you are given towards the goal you are currently given till you are directed to another while basically a horde of enemies is after your blood and you don't have enough health or advanced weaponry to defeat them all safely, so you have to resort to sneaking and sitraction tactics. The enemies you'll have to evade are Sevastopol's human survivors (who wield guns and easily dispatched or dodged with stealth), Working Joe androids (which are synthetic enemies incredibly resiliant to damage and better left by themselves) and, of course, the titular alien.   The Alien is the reccuring enemy of Isolation and will stalk every level in an effort to kill you, something it's very adept at doing: it's completely undamaged by all your weapons and devices (althought some can make it retreat for a while), very easy to allert, capable of killing Amanda in one hit, not afraid to use stealth tactics against you and provided by the developers with an adaptive strategy (for instance, a hidden spot will rarely fool the alien twice or thrice, forcing you to change distractions and position frequently). In short, the alien provides the main horror source for the whole game and dealing with it should be your first priority. The beast also interacts with the other enemies and the environment, althought provoking its attention may be fatal to you.  In order to proceed in your mission, Isolation provides you with different tools you can either find lying around in the levels or craft yourself with the components you can find during moments of (relative) peace. Some are proper weapons which, in true survival horror flavor, should be used sparingly and are more or less effective depending on the enemy; other are tools you can use to create a distraction, like flares or noisemakers, althought they could attract unwanted attention; other still are mainly utilities required to survive your journey, like batteries for your flashlight or medikits to recover health. Resources aboard Sevastopol aren't exactly abundant, forcing you to use the items at your disposal only in a pinch or when there aren't other alternatives. Your most important tool remains the motion tracker, which allows you to get a glare of your enemies general location and prepare your next move and also serves as a guide towards your objective (but it should be noted that in some instances it can get painfully inaccurate, which could as well lead to your death while you desperately try to figure out where to go or what to do next). Amanda can also use her engineering talents to activate various devices aboard the station: some are required to progress through the story, while others can sway the alien and the other enemies.  It's also worth mentioning that the difficulty levels in Isolation are rather meaningful and drastically change the whole experience: the easy setting will often make your enemies miss your presence entirely, medium is a rather average stealth fare and hard basically makes the alien susceptible to even the smallest action you can perform and enemy attacks nearly one-hit kills.  Isolation's stealthy and horror-driven gameplay works well in the long run, save for two minor issue. First, the mission introducing the alien as an active threat is arguably the hardest sequence in the entire game: the beast is far more aggressive than anywhere in the later levels and the whole mission happens rather early (around the fourth or fifth mission or so). Second, the game's main story pace starts to really fall apart in the later stages: while the game seems to end for good at two or three points in the narrative, you discover soon enough that there are still filler-ish things to be done for an hour or two longer. At a certain point you'll just try to waltz through the remaining areas hoping to finish the game as soon as possible and be done with it. Aside from the main campaign, Isolation also offers a Survival Mode, which is about putting up an endurance round against the alien for as long as possible using the tools and environments you are given.  In short, Alien: Isolation is the videogame with an Alien license the fans of the series were waiting for all these years and an excellent stealth horror title for the rest of the world",

This game does an excellent job of immersing you into the world of Alien. It follows the movie extremely faithfully, as even the signs next to doors can be found in this game (Pro tip: By learning what those signs mean, you can predict what kind of room it is and what would be found inside before even entering the said room!). The game can get extremely tense as the alien's smart AI adapts to your behaviour, and constantly hunts you. The game encourages exploration (even though its quite risky) by the various terminals and logs litered around the place, which can give you some backstory to what was happening previously on the space station, give you codes to gain access to some extra loot, or even logs from the Nostromo itself, voice acted by the actors from the film. That's not to say that the game is perfect, however. The other enemies in the game are much less interesting than the alien (even quite annoying to deal with at times). Also, there are some sections that can drag on and become a little boring, especially towards the end of the game where you pretty much explored most if not all of the space station. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of survival horror (the only reason I bought this game was because it was an Alien game), I can safely say I had quite a lot of fun with this game, and I would definitely recommend it to other Alien fans.

I wish I could have played it with its highest graphical settings, but my computer is too old to run them. Nevertheless, this game was brilliant. I will be playing the DLC and the other modes for the game as well, and then I'll edit this review once I've had enough fun with those.  PROS of the MAIN STORY: -Story. LOVED the story. It was a little slow at some points, but for the most part it was very... captivating. Yes, that's the word. -Fear Factor: For me, this was a near pants-crapping experience. I recommend playing it on 'Hard'.  -Atmosphere: Spooky enough to keep me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Very few horror games can do that to me. I'm a tough guy. -Ambience/Soundtrack: Ambience was as spooky as the atmosphere of the game, and the soundtrack was absolutely brilliant - and in some cases nostalgic.  -To quote Markiplier: 'SPAAAAAACE!'  CONS of the MAIN STORY: -Cat and Mouse: This is the big one. There are numerous situations in which you will be playing Cat-and-Mouse with the Alien. Because there is no way to kill it, the only thing you can really do is hide from it and hope it doesn't find you. Even when you get the... um... certainly lovely weapon of mass destruction, you'll likely find yourself hiding from the Alien. It is vital that you watch how much of that weapon's ammo you use, because if you're not careful, you'll be left with no way to defend yourself - I learned this the hard way.  -Androids: Trust me, you'll wish they didn't exist for pretty much the entire game. There are WAY too many androids stalking the halls, and they NEVER leave you alone.   Overall, quite a wonderful game.  EDIT #1: Do NOT play this game on Mac just yet. There are some things that need fixing.",

He loved watching grownup things like the X-Files and horror movies, and he let me watch them with him. One fateful day, he let me watch Alien with him. It was a lifechanging experience: I haven't seen such a scary movie before! It was amazing. I had a nightmare about the xenomorph later in the night, I was really terrified of this otherworldly beast.  Anyway, the next day, I went to school, and in those days I was a timid nerd. And like any such nerd, I had a gang of bullies who picked on me. They noticed me in the school hallway, and rightly stuck my sorry, weak ♥♥♥ inside a locker they padlocked from the outside before class. It was very dark; I was locked in there for the whole hour! Finally, a janitor heard me crying inside, curled into the fetal position.  Ever since then, I had feared the inside of a locker. As I grew older, I have learned the value of strength. I turned from a timid nerd to a buff jock - yet, my most primal fear loomed over me still, reminding me of my past failures every time I changed my clothes in the gym dressing room. The inside of a locker, so foreboding, so dangerous, so claustrophobic. I had thought this fear would cripple me my whole life.  Then, I played Alien: Isolation. And it made me realize something that eluded me my whole adulthood. The locker is not my enemy. The locker has always cared. It is always there, waiting openly to embrace me when I need it the most. It is everlasting and dependable in ways that make me hold my breath. The locker... is the safest place there is. It is the only friend that won't betray me. It keeps me safe from... well, the things I *should* actually fear.  Thank you, Alien: Isolation. Your ability to give me heart palpitations gave me the clear mind needed to discover the error of my ways. And oh, locker? If you're reading this... I'm sorry I have kept you waiting so long. I know you're there for me; I'm here for you, too.  Hell, these days, I spend more time inside you than inside my girlfriend, anyway.",

            "review_text": "I am writing this review at 20 past 7 in the morning, because I made the mistake of playing this game's Survivor mode tonight in which you are plopped in an area with temporally-decreasing point valued objectives (for leaderboard positions) and the end goal of simply escaping the area. I had forgotten this mode existed after I completed the campaign. However when I went to try it today, it was such a concentrated dose of pure terror I scared myself half to death and have nothing better to do now than review this game as I could not sleep. I just kept hearing the alien's footsteps continually getting closer and closer but never quite reaching me every time I closed my eyes. This game broke me today.  Now I'm not going to sugar coat the plot: it's full of so many redundencies, false endings and pointless sidetracking to pad out the game's length it can at times make you forget WTF you're even doing on the station in the first place. Half the time I couldn't quite recall why I was where I was, because I'd gone on so many sidetrips in pursuit of simply getting off the station I had no sight of that ultimate goal. Even when escape does become the priority, the game's last hour is needlessly padded out with multiple false ends and probably the most linear and boring level design in the game. Couple that with a badly handled actual ending (I'd talk about it but, you know, spoilers), and the last hour of the game I found unsatisfying and somewhat of a chore. It's a shame because the penultimate set pieces in the decaying, exploding, pitch black corridors of Sevastopol (the station, not the recently-Putinized port) are as terrifying as any other encounter in the game.  And indeed, it is a testiment to the quality of that survival horror experience that is the game's core that I can forgive the padding and the backtracking and the subpar plot (and forgettable characters, all of whom but the player character die (obviously) and none getting any meaningful development). And indeed, this is a true survival horror - as in, it is about surviving an overpowering threat through intelligence and guile rather than any kind of badassery. This is not Amnesia or Outlast in space - those games are virtual haunted houses. This is an actual GAME, with MECHANICS and levels designed to INCORPORATE said mechanics (are these concepts ringing any bells, Frictional Games? No offence but other than sheer terror your games have little going for them; good thing they're ♥♥♥♥-your-pants-terrifying then, yeah?). It is a game not just about completing whatever mind-numbingly redundant or semi-important task the excuse for a plot has assigned you, it's about scavenging offices and tables, nooks and cranies for those classic nuggets of classic survival horror, resources. Because let me tell you, with fuel for the flamethrower, EMP mines, flashlight batteries and noisemakers your life becomes not only harder but quite likely short as well.   There are three enemies you will encounter in your quest to escape/♥♥♥♥-around-for-hours-before-deciding-it-might-be-a-good-time-to-escape, and I'll address them in order from least to most awesome. There are human survivors who are so unhinged from the sheer terror the alien has distilled in them that they shoot at anyone they don't know, meaning you as well. I find it hard to believe the justifications for these people trying to kill you given the greater looming threat fo the alien, and with their AI being the worst of said enemy types (sidestepping to hit me instead of continually firing at the wall is something even the COD AI has figured out by now) I really wish there had been no human enemies altogether. Luckily after the game's opening levels almost everyone on the station si dead and you stop running into them.  The second type fo enemy, and the only kind other than the alien that are genuinely creepy, are Seegson's (the budget-price alternative to Weyland-Yutani that nobody buys from) Working Joe androids that maintainance the station. They are controlled by APOLLO, Sevastopol's central AI, who, as we can all imagine, actually works against the survivors so that no harm comes to the Alien. The Working Joes don't look real, like WL synthetics, but they lie in the uncanny valley and thus are genuinely unsettling, especially when their eyes turn glowing red when they become hostile, all the while spouting off standardized friendly greetings and advice while APOLLO directs them to beat people, like you, to death. Luckily they can't run, only walk, so you can outpace them - the trouble is to not get cornered by the buggers, which can easily happen if you frantically start running from one and bump into another.  The Alien itself is the star of the show. It is truly one of the greatest enemies ever put in a game, and I say that quite seriously. This game is channelling Alien, not Aliens. This thing - and there is only one, not hundreds as in the sequel movies - cannot be disposed of by some pistol rounds to the cranium like Vasquez so badassly did in Aliens. In fact, nothing at your disposal can kill it. In addition to its imperviousness to your weapons, it is also stronger than you, faster than you, has an impeccable sense of hearing, some kind of keen 'sight' (though it has no eyes, and no one has ever specified exactly how the Alien sees), and a geniune interest in finding you. This one enemy represents the single greatest leap forward in AI programming since the sandbox-compatible FPS AI for the NPCs in Crysis. It is wicked, WICKED smart. It has no set pathing. It has no set routes. Except for a few particular set pieces, the Alien is entirely run by dynamic AI. It is simply placed in the level, and its AI programming takes the hunting-you-down part from there. It methodically searches levels for the player, checking posisble blind spots (though not all - can't make lockers the only places to hide can we?), every so often deciding to turn around and head in a different direction. In this hide and seek game it very much acts like it is, well, 'It'. I could go on forever about how intricate and detailed the Alien's AI appears to be (I have no hard facts for you since I obviously didn't program it), but suffice it to say it is GOING to outsmart you many times. It is unpredictable to a very large degree, and you will never feel safe. Did I mention it was fast? Yeah, it's reeeaally fast. As in, if it sees you, you'd better be able to break line of sight and hide IMMEDIATELY or it WILL kill you, and it DOES insta-kill you if it grabs you. Only molotovs, pipe bombs and the flamethrower can ward it off (and still can't kill it), and even then it only retreats to the nearest vent, only to pop back out of it a few seconds later. This thing REQUIRES stealth to circumvent, and since you basically have no HUD (your health bar and equipped item are all you can see) you have to use your senses, your smarts and that motion tracker (which IT CAN HEAR, by the way) to sneak around rather than relying on some kind of gimmicky stealth mechanic that tells you when you're visible or ♥♥♥♥ like that. When this thing shows up the game becomes hardcore old-school-stealth difficult (the game even says it was meant to be played on hard), and will die a LOT. Get used to it, especially with the manual save stations being spaced out. People ♥♥♥♥♥ about it, but somehow think it's fine in Dark Souls cuz it's Castlevania 3D? Grow a pair and learn-2-sneak.  I'd go on about the 100% perfection that is the art direction and sound design but I've reached the work limit for these Steam reviews, so: If you're a survival horror fan who's been lacking a decent game of that type for the past decade, or want to experience again the terror of Alien instead of the adrenaline pump of the sequels, GET THIS GAME.",

I haven't enjoyed a horror game this much since the original F.E.A.R.  Edit:  I want to make it very clear that I still love this game and had a great time playing it. However, I have finally finished the game, and find it necessary to bring up some issues, especially in regards to the final hour or so. Everything goes wrong for Ripley and in the spirit of a broken down space station, she must go turn on this generator, find this key to open a door, hack this terminal, cut this door, backtrack to turn on ANOTHER generator to open yet another door that allows her to hack into a terminal which turns on power for the original door, etc etc, and that is all fine and good, but they keep this up in the final moments of the game when all ♥♥♥♥ has gone to hell and it just kind of makes it a slog when they are very clearly trying to make the final hour a thrill ride (which by the way, an hour is far too long for a roller coaster style ending. At one point I was dodging transit cars and was just like give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break and end this thing already!) Also, the alien gets viciously relentless to the point where it almost feels as if they programmed it to be cheap and always remain within 10 feet of you, rather than the relentless hunter of the rest of the game. And finally--SPOILERS--after everything Amanda has been through, I don't see why she couldn't have just gotten away. It seems like the developers just can't bring themselves to let the player win at any capacity, and that is slightly annoying to me. We just played this harrowing, horrific game for upwards of 20 hours... you can't just let the Torrens be fine and we escape? How did an alien even get on it? That's stupid. I realize they are going for sequel material here, but holy ♥♥♥♥ CA... let Ripley--and by extension us--breathe a bit at the end of the game if anywhere. END SPOILERS.  Despite all of this, the game is still awesome and probably the best Alien related thing since the film Aliens. I highly highly recommend playing it, and it's basically required if you're a fan of the franchise. If you want to experience a genuine sense of dread, then play this game. However, I do have so things I'd like to see improved upon in the sequel:  -An alien that isn't always just hunting you or walking around. One thing I noticed when watching the first film is that the alien rarely showed up. In fact, it barely even touches 5 minutes of total screen time. Half of the horror was wondering where it was at all times. After a while, we do start to feel overexposed to the alien; never knowing quite when it could show up would definitely notch up the fear. -Controls that are more fluid. While I never particularly had a problem with the controls, nor did I ever feel like they contributed to my demise, I still feel as if they need to be more fluid. For instance, entering a vent shouldn't take as long as it does, nor do I want to sit there for like a second after something is hacked, which speaking of... -Make hacking harder. I know this sounds weird, but instead of having stupid mini games, actually make us hack ♥♥♥♥ with, er... more advanced mini games lol, games that actually feel like real hacking, not pressing E when a line moves into a different line... If hacking took a solid 10-20 seconds, we'd genuinely feel terrified doing it.  -Make the world even more open. While the level design technically is an open one, I still felt at all times as if the game wanted me to go down a specific path--it still felt like a corridor game by all means and the objectives only exacerbated this. -Make the alien move slower and perhaps not kill you the instant it sees you. Again, in the original film, one thing that made it so creepy is that it would just show up suddenly, and then just stand there as the people would scream. Crouching behind a desk would be much more tense if the alien didn't just run/speed walk by, but skulked by at the pace of molasses, the player sitting helplessly for a prolonged period just hoping that the alien didn't happen to look behind itself.   Anyways, great game, 9/10 (7/10 for the final hour), I highly recommend and hope they sequel that ♥♥♥♥.  p.s., Steam, please stop censoring profanity. We are adults. Stop treating us like children, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.",

Is it difficult? Maybe a little, but who doesn't love a challenge? Is it terrifying? Absolutely. Presumably one of the reasons you bought this. You don't just play Alien: Isolation, you fall under its spell of darkness, made perfect by its considerable attention to detail of every environment I've seen, and I'm not even finished with Mission Two. Mainly, you can feel the love the designers, programmers and artists have put into this project. Its true I did stop after about an hour cuz I wanted to see the 'Crew Expendable' dlc. Just an incredible game, complete with thudding heart and sweaty palms. I might try it with the controller but I'm afraid it'll slip out of my hands.

The game itself is a love letter to the first Alien movie, and there are many references back to the movie so I'd suggest watching it before playing this game.   Unfortunately, the game often walks the line between scary and intense and frustrating and obnoxious. The Alien's AI is great, but at times the Alien can seem almost clairvoyant. You will spend a lot of your play time sneaking through the same areas after reloading a save. Until about half way through the game, you have no way of preventing the Alien from killing you if it spots you. Human AI is pretty bad. Human enemies on the ship will often see you, start shouting and shooting their guns, attract the Alien and all get killed while you sit behind some boxes twiddling your thumbs. It leads to some real head-scratching moments. The game is LONG, and while I didn't think that was an issue at first the game really starts to drag on towards the end and is unnecessarily padded with long sections where you aren't really doing much and aren't in any real danger (Such as the space walk to adjust the recon satellite to contact the Torrens).  If you are a fan of Alien and love survival horror, you owe it to yourself to try this game. Those who are not either may find it a chore to get through and not really enjoy it.",

You probably expected me to not have high hopes for a new game in the series, but that wasn't the case. My hopes were very high, and the game didn't disappoint in any way I can think of.  First of all, it's a survival horror game, and it's based mostly on the first movie in the franchise, seen as a sort of continuation of it, and the action takes place between Alien and Aliens.  That being said, don't ever expect to be able to kill the alien. It's one of those games where you are forced to constantly use stealth and immediately hide when the monster is in the area (which you will probably do about 90% of the time), except that you can defend yourself, but from anything but the alien. After all, they couldn't kill it in the Alien movie either, could they?  The graphics and atmosphere are quite beautiful, and the game really does make you feel like you're in the movie - and if you get the DLC, on the actual Nostromo.  So... if you're a true fan of the Alien series and you enjoy survival horror games with a bit of a twist, this is definitely the game for you! 10/10",

            "review_text": "Ignore the IGN and Game Spot reviews. Read the PC Gamer review -- it's on the money.  Alien: Isolation is an amazing game, and currently my personal choice for Game Of The Year, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.  The game looks great, and the game design holds up very well for the duration of the game, never once becoming stale or losing its edge. You will be on edge for the entire 20+ hours of the campaign, so if you're an anxiety sufferer you should probably avoid Alien: Isolation like the plague.  I don't want to give anything plot-wise away, so suffice it to say the story is fantastic. Its themes of fear of the unknown and corporate greed are both consistent with and resonate strongly with both Alien and Aliens. I've already played through the campaign TWICE and I'm now starting a third play-through on the hardest difficulty. Given it's rare for me to finish a game even once, let alone several times, that should speak volumes as to the quality of this game.  As I mentioned, though, not every type of gamer will get everything out of this game that I did. Those who dislike or don't have the patience for a slow, methodical pace should probably skip this -- as they should skip the original Alien movie. There is combat in the game, but it's not the game's primary focus and that shows. It makes perfect sense in the context of the game, but for anyone looking for a Halo or CoD level of shooter gameplay, they should look elsewhere -- this is not the game they're looking for.  If you can give yourself to the tension and live in the moment in which Alien: Isolation wants you to live, you will have an amazing experience. If you can't or if this much tension, fear and anxiety it's too much for you, I suspect you'll hate it.",

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation is a superb survival horror game that gets just about everything right. Creative Assembly approaches the genre with great confidence, trusting in its vision for setting a mood and sustaining it over the course of the game; the pacing has a natural ebb and flow, which will make you grateful for the moments you can catch your breath. The game builds slowly, and knows when to let off the pressure, so this is not the kind of game you will want to play if you want high-octane thrills every moment you're playing. When the thrills do come (and they WILL come), they will more than make up for the slow introduction.  In all technical respects, the game is excellent. Visuals are sharp and distinctive, and the art direction is perfect: the orbital space station Sevastopol, the setting for most of the game, has an early-80s retro-futuristic vibe that comes straight from the original films. People still use boomboxes and cassette tapes, and computer monitors are delightfully blocky and pixelated. Even the posters that are scattered about Sevastopol sell the theme with their visuals and writing. Sound design is also great, which is especially key for the player, as you will use your ears as often as--or more than--your eyes when sneaking and hiding throughout the vast space station.  And it is vast: the game took me 31 hours to complete on the hardest setting, taking a little bit of time (but not too much) to collect all of the audio logs and ID tags scattered across the station. Make no mistake, this isn't some six-hour movie in a video game's clothing. A:I has a lot of meat on its bones. Without spoiling things, running and hiding from the Alien is not the only thing that you will be doing in this game, and the story mixes it up with respect to the different threats that you will face throughout the story.  The game threads a fine line between helplessness and strength. Like any good survival horror game, you will be severely outgunned and outmatched, especially at the beginning of the game. But gradually, over time, you collect weapons and devices that will aid you in traversing the station and engaging (or avoiding) its inhabitants. But you will not be playing this game like a twitch shooter. When you have to use your weapons, you'll be using them carefully, and keeping in mind your very limited ammunition and supplies. More often than not, a bit of caution and cleverness in deploying a noisemaker or flare to distract your foes will serve you far better than trying to go in guns blazing. Creative Assembly manages to make you feel empowered to deal with the situations that you find yourself in, without ever making you feel invincible or that the threats you face are not threats.  Finally, I did not experience any major bugs in the game, and it ran at a very smooth 60+ FPS with all settings maximized on an nVidia GTX 770. I did encounter a couple of minor bugs: one or two very minor graphical glitches that did not impact gameplay at all, and one bug dealing with a mission trigger that didn't trigger, that simply required me to reload an earlier save. (I only lost about ten minutes of progress, which I barely even cared about.) The game never crashed, and ran smoothly in borderless windowed mode, making alt-tabbing utterly painless. The only real annoyance: the unskippable videos when loading the game. Yes, we know, you have corporate sponsors. We don't have to watch their logos every time we start the game.  Ultimately, I fully recommend this game to any fan of survival horror, whether or not they are familiar with the Alien franchise. The few negative impulses I had during the game were so minor and so transient that I can barely even remember what they were about. Worth a buy even at full price.",

I never felt it was cheap or unfair and when I got caught, it was always my own fault. If you don't understand how the AI works, you might get frustrated.

And it manages to stay scary throughout the whole story (while in other games you get used to predictable monsters and scripted jump scares, this Alien is almost unpredictable).   It also is one of the best games based on a movie, capturing all what made the original Alien movie great: a likable, struggling but strong, human protagonist (Ripley); the atmospheric, disturbing yet beautiful music and sound design; this 80s worn-down industrial Sci-Fi look and the dark claustrophobic environment that on its own is already setting a chilling tone and just looks so beautiful and just feels realistic and plausible; and of course the Xenomorph, maybe the most iconic monsters the horror genre ever created.  Here is how a (not so) typical day on Sevastopol might play out for Ripley: 'Where is everyone? You need to find the rest of your crew and warn them. Warn them about what you discovered. You look around vigilantly. It seems like the coast is clear. Slowly you walk through the narrow, dark corridor. Steam is blowing in your face from a damaged pipe to your right and a weak orange light from the gas giant below the space station is glowing through a window at the far end of the hallway. You can hear the monotonous sounds of the station. Somtimes it almost feels like a living organism of its own. Suddenly a muffled rumble sounds from somewhere above.. Did you imagine it? You freeze where you stand pulling out the motion tracker you found earlier and pointing it in every direction. There, on 3 o'clock, a weak peep. The peep is getting more frequent. You have to get out of here, but you know better than to run.  Slowly you continue, the motion sensor cluttched in your hands, peeping. Then you see something at the ceiling. Slowly a snakelike tail coils down out of a vent in front of you followed by the black, skeletal, insectoid body you glimsed before and that you have hoped to be just your imagination. 'Oh ♥♥♥♥!'. Quickly you manage to crouch behind some boxes near the wall. With a cracking sound the creature lands on the metallic ground. It raises its long head like a predator taking in a scent. Can it smell you? Its just standing there, only meters away, looking around and then right in your direction. It seems to know exactly where you are, only savoring, proloning the moment before it catches its prey: you. You have nothing to defend youself and from what you saw earlier this thing seems to bee invincible anyway. But then it turns and starts walking away. You can't believe your luck. A careful breath flushes some fresh air in your lungs again. You wait a little longer until its steps sound far enough, then you slowly start to walk again. You make your way to one of the metro stations that connect all parts of Sevastopol and call the train.  A loud alert sound annouces the approching metro. Too loud. And naturally you hear quick steps closing in on you fast. In panic you look around. Is there nowhere to hide? There, a big locker. You run over to it and quickly squeeze yourself inside. The motion sensor is going haywire, your breath as well and your heart is on the brink of explosion. Carefully you peek through the slits of the locker, only to draw back immediatly. It's here, directly in front of you, sniffing and hissing. You hold your breath until you almost feint, pressing against the metallic back of your small hiding spot.That's it. There's no way you gonna get away this time. But time goes by and your still alive. You open the eyes you must have closed unwittingly and peek. It's gone. And the train is still waiting just over there. You take a deep breath and slowly open the door. Only silence from the motion tracker. You run towards the door of the train. Now you've made it, let's get out of this place. You press the button and the door slides open. That is when you hear a hiss right next to your left ear...'  So this is how you will feel most of the time in the game. Always uncertain, always doubting. You shouldn't run, but have to keep moving. You can hide, but not forever, because the creature will learn and know if you keep making the same moves or hiding in similar places. Oh and there are crazy creepy androids and dangerous humans that are after you, too. It can be frustating at times, but that way it is also much more rewarding if you manage to outsmart the alien (or at least think you did). So if you like a good scare and enjoyed the first movie this is it, this is the game you've been waiting for! Best enjoyed alone at night with all lights out and headset on. Goosebumps guaranteed ;)",

My only real complaint is that, while playing on Normal difficulty, I wasn't always sure what the advantages of some items were when compared to others. I didn't use the grenade item once because I never really made it my mission to outright assault anything, and if I wanted to attract attention I would just use a noisemaker or even a smoke bomb. Again, there probably aren't as many options in higher difficulties, but I don't think that's much of an excuse.",

Unfortunately due to the save points being pretty far apart at times this is starting to make the game rather repetitive and frustrating.  I guess the good points are:  The game has a great atmosphere. The corridors of the Sevastopol look great and it really does feel like you are stuck on a space station. The lighting effects and smoke combined with the creaking and groaning of the metal of the ship add to this greatly. There is definitely a sense of tension, panic and urgency when playing. You don't really ever feel like you can relax after the first encounter with the Alien. I spend the whole game crouched! Nice use of logs to build the story but also the other NPCs add to the story - I wasn’t really expecting there to be other people in the game. (Just Ripley and the Alien)  The Bad: Seemingly random Alien attacks. For realisms sake this makes sense but in the game it is just far too frustrating - at one point I was running to escape from someone and the alien grabbed me from an air vent above with no real warning. Another time I was trying to make my way to a save point when it appeared behind me and tore me in two. Whilst the deaths are mildly amusing the lack of frequent AutoSaves mean you have to go and play through large sections again. The Stealth... sometimes it works well but other times it becomes almost too hard to stay hidden. The motion tracker is more of a hidrence to this. It would have been good to have some sort of indicator similar to the one used in Metro Last Light to let you know when you are visible. The music - in the end I have turned this off. It drowned out a lot of the noises you needed to hear and although it added to the tension it just became annoying. As I have already mentioned the lack of save points. There really needs to be save points when going between sections of the game. I don’t always have that much time to spend playing a game so always appreciate the ability to save when you need to. If the player wants to save every five minutes - let them....it doesn’t change the gameplay just removes some frustration.   I really do want to like this game and It has exceeded my expectations but they we set pretty low.... I think I could recommend it but I found that I enjoyed the much-slated Thief remake much more than this so far.  So if you haven’t bought thief.... maybe get that cheap until the price of this drops!   For now this is a not recommended - if an update changes something with the save points this may change.  **edited out typos**",

The Ugly: Saying the DLC leaves a lot to be desired is being very kind. Especially when you're promised the chance to walk the hallowed halls of the Nostromo. It's as if the people who designed the DLC were shown a trailer for the original film and thats it. I'm pretty sure I could have designed better DLC after a night of heavy drinking. The other DLCs were pretty lame too. If you take Isolation, gut out all the interesting stuff (other humans, androids, and environment), take away the map, and then give the player limited time, you have all the DLCs.

This was my favourite horror game of 2014 and it's taken me this long to complete it in it's hardest mode, doing it in hard or Nightmare difficulty is the only way you can get the full horror experience.   The Alien has been designed to have heightened senses, which means if you hide near by it may hear, or see you. Things like the light of your Flashlight or even the beeping of your Motion Tracker can be spotted by the Alien and before you can react, it's over.  The graphics of this game fit the aesthetic of the original movie and builds on it with out ruining that original idea, padded walls, lo-fi monitors and small flashing lights. In the film, you only see a few rooms of the ship and the rest is for you to imagine; Well in this game it's free roam around the whole station.  &gt;&gt;Spoilers Ahead&lt;&lt;    The story is the usual Alien plot: receive distress call&gt; go down to planet&gt; get's infected&gt; takes infection back to ship&gt; infection get's loose. Alien: Isolation introduced a good set of characters but it seemed that none of them survive. Again it stays true to the source material of the original film.   The length of the plot is where people stop listening; to say the least it's a long game, no matter what mode you play in. The plot tries to end numerous times in the game but something with stop you from finishing. As you try to get to an airlock to put a suit on, your dragged into a vent: taken all the way back to the nest.  Personally I like long games because I feel that I want them to never end; but when playing Alien: Isolation every time I hit an obstruction I would fin myself saying 'rrrrrrrr! does this nightmare never end?!?!?' but I think that's what the game aimed for, an never ending nightmare to the character....... like the film.  An Alien: Isolation sequel would be cool, but the question is 'how could they build upon that ending?'  ",

It all feels like Alien, and it all feels right. It doesn't feel like a random fan service, it feels like, well, an Alien game that belongs to be canon, among the movies. Well, atleast the first and second one.   The gameplay is great. The horror survival aspect works great, and the items and mechanics help it stand out as a unique game, not just ripping of other horror games, like Amnesia. And, crap, is it scary. Many horror games will scare me, until I figure out how to survive, then the scares slow and I feel more relaxed playing them. Not here, the scares never stop. (I won't spoil it, but the Alien isn't the only scary entity!)   The visuals are fantastic. Probably the prettiest space game I've played. I loved just stopping and looking at the game. The fire looks awesome, the dark hallways are terrifying, the smoke looks fantastic, it all just looks good. And it's optimized as crap, too! It runs fantastically! (Note: Some people have problems with it crashing. I've only had it crash once, but it should be noted regardless.) Outside the station looks great, I loved looking out the windows and seeing other parts of the station, or a nearby planet, all with shiny effects that look nice. Inside the station looks awesome, too! I love how instead of trying to look futuristic, it tried to look how the Alien movies look. It works fantastically, it feels like you're in an Alien movie.   The sound design is right up there with the visuals. All the original Alien things sound just like they did in the movie. And it's atmospheric as crap, I love walking down a hallway and hearing all the beeps and boops from the station, then in the distance hearing the Alien come out of a vent. Terrifying.   (No story spoilers ahead, don't worry) The story is top-notch! (Although I'm not as picky when it comes to stories.) It kept me wanting to play each night, just to see what would happen to the characters and how I would escape! The characters are great, all have their own personalities. You always know a game/movie has good characters when you constantly hate someone one, then seconds later can relate to them. It makes them feel real, and not as black and white. The 'twist' at the end was fantastic, really loved it.   But that's not to say the game doesn't have problems. As I mentioned above, some have had a lot of problems with it crashing. There are a lot of weird graphic bugs. Remember how I would look out the windows? Sometimes the station will be there, sometimes it won't. Sometimes the planet would be there, sometimes it wouldn't. It's really weird. The sound, as amazing as it is, also has problems. When I move with a weapon, sometimes the weapon will make sound. I'm not sure if it's supposed to make that sound or not, it's so inconsistant it's hard to tell. Somes sounds just won't end up playing. (Like a fire will be completely silent sometimes, but sound fine other times.)   Overall, it's an amazing game, one of the best I've played all year. It has it's quirks, but it was nothing game-breaking. (For me.) If Colonial Marines funded this game, than it's disaster was worth it.",

I was skeptical about the fact that the gameplay consists of hiding from and out witting the alien rather than fighting and killing it but this mechanic turned out to add to the experience. The sneaking and peaking actions made it more immersive by making you feel scared and helpless. There were countless times where I was genuinely jump scared while creeping through a tunnel or room thinking I was safe only to have the alien run up and kill me.

If you're a horror fan, an Alien, and a fan of survival horror, you need this game.   Alien: Isolation  does everything right a survival horror game should. You've got the feeling of helplessness when faced with enemies. You've got the tense atmosphere, and never knowing what to expect. You have the fear that comes when confronted with the Alien.  And unlike other survival horror games, it's not a copycat of  Resident Evil . In fact the only similarity between these two games is plot points being revealed through files. The game instead borrows the mechanics of  Outlast  and  Amnesia , with its own added twist. You can actually distract enemies with craftable items.  The game's biggest downside is the repetitiveness of gameplay. Your tasks are mostly walking to point A to B without dying. But the atmosphere and the intensity of being hunted by the Alien makes this not so much of a downside. Fans of the Alien movies and thrill seekers won't mind this, but for others it will get old fast. The other downside is there can only be one savefile. So if you start a new game, whether it's on a new difficutly or a friend or sibling starting a new game, it will overwrite the ONE save file, causing you to lose any progress in a previous save.

            "review_text": "Introduction Generally speaking I have been disappointed with Alien franchise games - The odd notable exception aside (AvP 2) they have all been basically Doom with different guns and monsters - fun but not exactly stress inducing. Although I love the film Aliens, Alien is one of my all time favourite movies and I had not considered it a possible subject for a good game. Thankfully A:I has changed all that.  Gameplay Like the movie it is not about going in all guns blazing, you don't get much in the way of guns and shooting them is typically the equivalent of ringing the dinner bell anyway (I've played through several times now and not killed anything with a gun). No - this game is all about stealth. You have to spend pretty much the entire game on your knees crawling about in the dark because running = noise = alien hears you = alien eats you shooting = noise = alien hears you = alien eats you walking = high visibility = alien sees you = alien eats you torch = high visibility = aliens sees you = alien eats you.  You spend a lot of time hiding in cupboards because you can hear the alien walking about (or worse see it through the slits in the cupboard) and you are too scared to come out. There was many a time I had to leave the game on pause while i went downstairs to watch something funny just to get my nerves back.  Artificial Intelligence The alien is random in it's movements - you can save a game - hide in the corner of a room, the alien will come in and 4 out of 5 times it will not look in your direction - but on that 5th time - just when you thought it was following a set pattern it happens to glance to the right and see you. The later in the game the better the AI appears to be so the alien starts to be hovering around you - investigating the doors you recently opened and having a stroll right next to the cupboard you are too scared to get out of.  Graphics Although the facial animations and models are good they are not exactly awe inspiring and are starting to look a bit old. The alien itself is well realised and the way it walks about is very good. The shop design is excellent - very nostalgic - lots of nice touches from the movie like that all monitor screens appear to be VHS tapes with bad tracking  Audio Truly awesome - memories of the movie flood back at regular intervals when you hear certain sound effects and musical cues.  Plot Not bad - but not that original - feels a bit like System Shock 2 in parts, lots of reading of dead peoples emails to reveal the reason behind the 'accident' on the station  Duration The game itself is very long (20 - 30 hrs) - and while this is refreshing in the modern day where a long game is deemed 5 hours i did feel it stretched some sections out a fraction too long.  Recommend trying to play it on hard difficulty as this gives you the proper sense of fear  Summary Graphics 8/10 Audio 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 ",

Alien: Isolation is certainly the best game in any Alien related franchise and it was really great to play, the aesthetics are true to Ridley Scott's Alien film and this really helped the atmosphere of the game follow suit in a way particularly remniscent of the first (which is often overlooked in Alien games for Aliens) the pace of the game felt right the entire way through and the suspense and dread were met in all the right places.  One of the things I am particularly fond of with the game is that you partake in a similar journey to Ellen Ripley in the films, when you begin the game you are helpless and completely out of your depth, but you see Amanda transform through the game in much the same way Ellen did in the films, she battles through and gains new strength and determination as the game progresses and this is something I think can really be felt as you play through the game.  The areas you are able to explore can also be revisited to find extra treats at later stages in the game which gives both nostalgic feelings to areas were you were perhaps a little more helpless with a new approach. There were also notable homages to the first film which made everything fit really nice with the overall experience for fans of the original film.  I played through the game on the hard difficulty to get the most accurate experience possible in terms of survival and scarcity of equipment to survive, although at times I do think I had more resources than I think I should have I was also met with points of dread where I had little to keep myself alive which was really great.  In terms of how the game performed I was pretty impressed and I spent almost the whole time feeling immersed in the setting, this was halted only at three points where I encountered some bugs. The first of these bugs was after I was set on fire and subsequently extinguished this fire - I remained visually still set on fire and this prevented me from progressing and I had to load from an earlier save to fix this. The second bug occured during the point in the game where Marlow explained the findings on LV-426, at this point I was able to see an artifact shadow through the ship that should not have been visible. The final bug I encountered was while I was outside in the space suit where although I should have had nothing in my hands the Molotov kept appearing in my hand at random as it was the last item I had equipped before entering the suit.  Overall I really enjoyed the game and I think this is the only must have Alien game that has ever been on the market. Alien: Isolation really is a fun game to play (or cower while playing).",

The sights and sounds of the world that Creative Assembly has created are delightful, echoing a time of CRT-monitors and magnetic tape. So many visual and audio cues are brought straight from the film that it is sure to bring a smile to any  Alien  fan's face. This smile will then be swiftly replaced by a creeping sense of dread once the player enters the game's main backdrop: the decommissioned space station  Sevastapol . Like the film it draws from,  Alien: Isolation  takes its time setting the mood, building up suspense and unease as the player works their way deeper into the game. If you are looking for something fast-paced, perhaps akin to James Cameron's action-packed  Aliens , you might want to look elsewhere (or wait for a sale), as this game is very much about slow pacing and building suspense. For those who  do  enjoy their horror on the suspense/thriller-side (as most fans of  Alien  typically do) then they are in for a delight.  As for the titular creature itself, mostly anyone who is remotely interested in science fiction has a fairly good idea what the alien looks like. Overexposure can be the kiss of death for a monster that crept in the shadows, terrifying audiences because all they ever received was a fleeting glimpse of it. Rest assured, though, Giger's child manages to become a horror icon once again thanks to Creative Assembly's obvious love for the source material. To be fair, there are several points where the player might get a little  too  used to having the alien around. Thankfully, these moments are decently spaced out and I can personally vouch that there were many moments throughout my 30-hour playthrough where I was startled to the point of gasping or made anxious about proceeding, fearful of the beast lying in wait in the darkness. There were also several fairly intense moments, the likes of which I haven't experienced in a game for quite some time, which were more than a welcome addition to the experience.  As for the technical aspects of the  Alien: Isolation , the game ran smoothly on my machine (for specs, check my profile) and looked fantastic. And as good as looked, it sounded even better. The audio has definitely been as carefully crafted as the visuals and every sound only served to envelope me deeper into  Sevastapol  (and several uses of Jerry Goldsmith's original score from  Alien  didn't hurt either). I  did  hit some bugs here and there but none that were game-breaking or couldn't be solved with some quick tweaking. I suppose it should also be noted that I never experienced a crash or fatal error during my playthrough.   So if you're looking for an excellent horror/thriller/suspense game or if you're a fan of  Alien  looking to go toe-to-toe with the creature from LV-426 then I highly recommend  Alien: Isolation . Just remember that in space no one can hear you scream.",

            "review_text": "Amazing game, easily one of the best horrors games I've ever played. If you enjoy the Alien films and looking for a new experience and take on the franchise, I can't reccomend this enough.  Pros:  • Game's optimization is fantastic, and the system requirments are super low even though the graphics look phenomenal. I played the game on my rig containing a HD 7750 and a Quad Core i5-6400, and it ran at a solid 60FPS the entire time with no drops in framerate.  • The atmosphere is very well established, and super reminiscint of the classic Alien films. Every corner of the Sevastopol Space Station holds both secrets and horror to behold no matter where you go.   • The story, featuring Amanda Ripley, daughter of Alien series protagonist Ellen Ripley, is chilling, badass, and works perfectly as a piece of Alien series lore.   Follow Amanda as she explores the Sevastopol Space Station, searching for clues on the disappearance of her mother's spaceship and her whereabouts, while evading the danger caused by a Xenomorph terrorizing the station's remaining inhabitants.   • The gameplay is solid, causing the player to rely on stealth and avoiding combat regularly instead of fighting every battle, which I feel is an awesome change in the style that Alien games are played. Enemy A.I. is completely unscripted, allowing enemies to take unique routes and ensure no two playthroughs are exactly the same. Be warned though, certain tricks only work on the Xenomorph before it learns to wise up...  • A wide variety of tools are available for use to avoid situations of any kind, be it the unkillable Xeno, deranged engineers, or killer robots. Add this onto the awesome map design and overall, the experience created by Alien: Isolation is unique and definitely proves itself as an awesome game.  Cons:  • The game doesn't explain some of it's features very well in the tutorials, especially regardinhg the rewire system and terminal use, but with a little know-how and initiative, maybe some internet help, you'll figure it out.   • The crafting system was practical and easy to use, but I couldn't help but feel it felt a little bleak.  • I felt it went on for a little too long and maybe if it was a little shorter, I could've appreciated it more.",

            "review_text": "Here we go, played it quite a bit, time to share my thoughts...   Pros  -Great refrences to source material, atmosphere matches the original Alien films, it becomes a truely immersive game. -Gets genuinely scary, does not rely entirely on jump scares like all these modern games seem to need. -Great Alien, the way he moves, attacks, stalks you... -Graphics are nice, gameplay is smooth, no noticable technical faults so far. (However I have heard others have had issues, I suggest checking the forums before and after purchase if you experience any) -Some amazing jaw dropping scenery and moments in this game, that leave you going 'Oh shi-'   Cons  -Game can be frustrating, enemies might block a door and decide to just not leave, Alien might find you despite you not really doing anything to really put yourself in that situation, just because of bad luck. Another example is sometimes the Alien is magic and literally in two different spots at once, like you see him drooling and look at another vent and he is drooling from that one too, and if you go under either he spawns there and kills you. -AI sometimes will be a derp. Usually it's really good, and if it hears you or such it will come running, it cuts you off, etc, but every once in a while it will just like look directly at you 3 feet away and just miss you. This is rare, but it really breaks immersion when the AI does things like this. -Lack of features to take advantage of next gen hardware/PCs, while it looks great as is, it pretty much looks the exact same across everything. -Tedious space walks, lever and button pushing, it will seem great at first but it will wear on you much later in the game, when it's a lot of filler to draw out the game unecessarily. -Alien can take an unrealistic amount of damage even a dedicated Alien fan might go 'That is a bit much'. At one point it took a burst from a flame thrower, 4 shot gun blasts to the chest/head, a pipebomb, and a revolver to the head and chest 3 times, and all that did is stun it for 3 seconds before killing me. (I won't spoil anything, but the arguement people may have for this, becomes obselete later in the game, is all I will say.) -Garbage Ending! I mean terrible, terrible ending. -Sometimes the sound seems out of sync, in dialogue cutscenes and a few actions, buts its a rare and small bug    7.8/10 Understanding the Alien universe is a big help in enjoying this game, but it achieves what it aims to do fairly well. I am happy with my purchase. The ending leaves a lot to be desired and it is not perfect, but what makes this game good is almost always present and undeniable. This is a great game ",

            "review_text": " Introduction: a hodge-podge of critique and thoughts regarding gameplay and presentation   Heedful traversing of, much like system shock 2's corridors with gray-white walls, sci-fi degradation of a rundown ship, with red and blue wires strewn ubiquitously about the levels, levels that with sterility and dim, fluorescent, lighting in accordance with a keen sense of loneliness and helplessness, makes up the initial presentation and subsequent response to the constellation that is Alien: Isolation.   Immediately a sort of discrepancy appears, story-wise, which appears in the form of the following elucidation of these player/game, cliché/creativity dualities: We all know it's an alien that is this “monster”, so the story feigning ignorance makes for a weird discrepancy between the player and game-world. And why would a futuristic crew of people – along with the illiterate attempts at wall-messages scribbled in blood – attribute “random” deaths to a monster, but when we come across a corpse, there is seemingly no reason to assume this event to be the work of an otherworldly being, a monster, apart from what the title suggests. It's like the people in the game knows that this is  the  alien, but instead alludes to it for the sake of horror-mystery in a context where everybody, in part, already knows what is really going on. This could have been done a different way, where things weren't so clichéd as to try to obfuscate a truth which the player already knows, a truth that is the basis of this whole game. It seems like an unnecessary veil to put on something so conspicuous.   Being strongly reminiscent of Metro: Last Light, the Axel sections early on in the game, serves as an introduction into the games' world, a world where you're alone; you feel despair and fear, but you find – as close to as you could on this ship – a friend that guides you through the basic functions of stealth mechanics. It's a clever way of supplementing a laborious tutorial system with engaging story-progression. It also corresponds to Ripley being in the dark of what is going on on the ship, since she hasn't been on it and experienced the social conditions being torn apart in the Alien's ravaging ways, thus giving Ripley a sort of passable reason for trusting this random person pointing a gun at her. When Axel is promptly stripped away from us, in a shattering of the little sense of confidence and security we have, the game gets back to the deep sense of fright and even more so the deep sense of loneliness pertaining to both the claustrophobic hallways and the vacuous space that surrounds it – the fear is poignantly all-encompassing, enveloping and leaving you stranded in open space, like a three-dimensional desert.   Deep bassy whale sounds echoing throughout endless space, even though that space would have no reverberation that would otherwise a priori prove this depth – in the endless space metaphor – of sound as it pertains to location, in a weird interaction between diagetic and non-diagetic sound, that otherwise would be clear-cut. Musically, it interacts with gameplay and what is going on in front of the player, when in a tense situation, the music reflects that, when in a chase-scene or dangerous situation, the music reflects that as well. So musically, Alien: Isolation, organically fits the different pieces of music to the overall presentation of visuals, kinaesthetics and game-mechanics.   The visuals of this game are truly stunning, awe-inspiring and simply wonderful. Every window of opportunity to look out through a window into space, and the nearby gas giant, is one you should take. The lighting is deeply integrated into the environments, with red lights blasting from the alarms being set off, or creepily neon-blues from electric sparks or other dimmed lights of vibrant color. There is also a particular scene, a sort of like a flashback playing-the-story-being-told type moment in the game, where we follow a crew first discovering this alien ship. At this point you don't really feel like the gameplay is necessary, and it gives you a weird signal detector that at first has no real use, but the scenery is just brilliant. It was like walking through the inside of a metallic spinal chord, with spines integrated into the flooded floor and walls, with the same dampness and slickness you see in the alien's saliva when it's dripping from the ventilation ducts in the ceiling of the hallways in certain sections of the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥l openings at the basis of this spine are mirrored in a naturalistic paradigm on the inner and outer walls of this alien ship, something like the hexagonal cells of bees, the patterns of flowers or general adumbration of different tree species and so on. . . these futuristic organically calcified egg/cystic-fossils buried in the hardened, seemingly former flesh-walls, are another example of wonderful imagery in this particular set of scenes.    Storytelling and environmental interplay with game-mechanics   The transition from cutscene to gameplay was an interesting one. Alien: Isolation didn't suffer from what a lot of games do, whereby the whereabouts of your character in a cutscene differentiates itself from where your actual position is. This made for an interesting seamlessness, where the end of the cutscene put you directly in the frightened, panicked, shoes of Ripley, just as disoriented, just as struck by what was just witnessed. Although, the beginning of the cutscene sometimes teleported you where you needed to be once in the cutscene, which was rather silly, but I suppose an understandable compromise to make for the latter half of the cutscene.   Ripley also trembles when she points her gun, signifying the pungent fear-nervousness constantly running through her, which is also reflected in her aim taking a long time to stabilize gameplay-wise, even though with this constant tremble that would never happen – the stabilization, that is – it is still an interesting touch of creativity to gameplay as it displays an emotional reaction and connection between game and character, mechanics and player emotion.   The terminals, conveniently enough, doll out the information – and acts like an agent of environmental exposition, and exploration! – we need to progress, in that generic System Shock/Bioshock type way, where you just happen to find just the text with the code written on it, even though the place – not only the place, but the network and computers are often out of order – is a wreck and most other things are readily destroyed, burned or sabotaged in different manners, increasing the silliness and unlikelihood of these expository beacons being readily available.   Slight environmental touches add some charm to the game, like the lockers that are littered with artifacts of presumably dead crew-members. The imagery of these, pictures of families, personalized lockers with pictures of vacation spots, pornographic images and other things to make these lockers not only a game mechanic, but a storyteller and an attempt to connect the player to the otherwise blank faces we see die throughout the game. We see hints of the lives of these people as family members, and subsequently the empathetically saddening that comes with realizing their supposed fate. It's a cute addition to an otherwise gray wall; it gives you something to reflect on during these long periods of fearful hiding from an overly aggressive foe.*  *Upon further research it turns out these personalized messages were just generic copies of the same post-it note. It's almost like this is a game, made by people who wanted to save time on certain things. It's always an unfortunate event, when the realization of the game being, in truth, a game – instead of this beautiful immersion into a world omitted by our own. This is seemingly thematic to Alien: Isolations.   Continuation in the comments due to character restrictions. . .",

The main con of using these weapons or tools is the noise they make typically causes the Alien to start hunting for you.  The visuals are simply amazing, the controls are spot on and possibly the best part of the game is the sound. You cannot move 6 inches without hearing creaking floors, hissing ventilation, doors opening and closing, thumps, thuds and this strange hissing / screetching sound from within the vents and halls... not sure what is causing those.

The game has great story, great graphics and a awesome art-style. The AI feels intelligent, and it feels like the alien learns more and more as you progress. The game focuses a lot on the stealth, which is excellent. The music also adapts to almost every situation; if you hide under a table, the music is gonna change into slower, creepier music as the alien walks past.   The game is also very unforgiving. You have to be really lucky to get away from the alien once it sees you. I started out playing it on hard, but quickly found out that it was just too difficult. I also played some of the last levels on easy, just to see how easy it was, and it still proved to be challenging at some points. I recommend playing the game on easy or medium, unless you're really hardcore~  The only true downfall this game has is it's length. The first 8 hours game are truely amazing, but the game kinda loses it's creepiness the further you get into it. The story is good, but it's just not good enough to make whatever you're doing later on feel like it has any meaning. But other then that, a great game. I recommmend this game to anyone who likes the Alien series or anyone who's a fan of horror. 8,5/10~",

Some may say the alien doesn´t behave exactly like in the first movies, and i have to say they are right, but its behavior is needed as it is to make it a viable stealth/scary/survival game.  One time in pursue of my objective i found the alien right in the middle of my path, it wasn´t looking at me so i took my chances and tried to pass by, suddenly (maybe it smelled me) it turned back and started charging at me while emiting that iconic sound.  I managed to manually close a door standing between him and me. I knew the door would open eventually or it would end up using the vents so i squeezed into a locker, i heard the door unlocking and that meant it would be close in any second. I saw a dark figure on the left corner of my eye looking for me, apparetly it got bored of looking for its dinner. Thats what i thought until it tore apart the locker doors. And there it was screaming at me with its mouth wide open, then a bite followed and split second after just darkness.  The game may have its problems, but you cant tell me this ain´t awesome.",

            "review_text": "It had a moment or two, so far (Not that far into the game to tell the truth), where the AI for humans were a tad iffy. For instance, they tried to shoot me through bulletproof glass, but didn't think to go around for a clear shot. That was the major thing but otherwise this game is like an interactive movie set in the Alien universe. And we all know how excellent the movies are in effects and atmosphere, don't we? This game has the exact same sense of horror, suspence and creepy, dark environments we are familiar with from the films.  The Alien is superbly made in both looks and behavior, though I understand that the higher the difficulty level, the more accurate to the films the Alien becomes in terms of intelligence and, thus, lethality.  The other hostile elements in the game, such as the Working Joes, are also very nicely integrated and believable. The peril they put you in through their superior physical stength and endurance are frightening in themselves. The humans are, of course, the most predicatble and familiar sort of foe, when they are hostile, that the game provides, but they are, quite frankly, an integral part of a horror game of this caliber.  Graphics are superb and the enviroment and atmosphere, as mentioned before, are awesomely accurate and beautiful (or as beautiful as such places can be, you know?) and contribute massively towards feeling like you are in constant, grave danger. The sound effects and music, not to mention the voice acting, are all spot on and makes this game completely immersive, and that is what makes it so damn effective in scaring the snot out of you.  If you're faint of heart and have a fear of the dark, this isn't the game for you, unless you get your kicks from it.",

This is truely a survival horror and captures the essence of the first film so well, Amanda herself.. actually looks like she really could be Ellen's daughter. another recommendation... play this ONLY on Hard and Nightmare.. Lower diffculty really henders the amazing AI And this game is difficult.. there is no quick saves(as it would actually ruin the game) and the AI can be punishing, this is no shootem up, and most of all the negitive reviews tend to be because this game is very difficult,punishingly so! one tiny mistake.. dead(you will die alot..in a very cinimatic fashion)and has a unqiue style.",

Creative QTEs that both keep the gameplay 'fresh' while keeping you on the edge of your seat ('I don't have time for this right now!'). Most importantly: Intense. Period.  To be objective, there are a few flaws -  The beginning (first two hours?) is a bit drawn out. As is the middle section (no spoiler here, but those of you who've played know what portion I'm referring to). Some occasional glitchiness (clipping, AI getting stuck on edges or corners, poor 'visibility' on the side of the AI).  Overall? Can't recommend any higher. Skip 'The Evil Within,' and get the true evil - the xenomorph that cast a shadow upon all xenomorphs to follow. H.R. Giger's true alien, and the best heroine(s) ever - Ripley.",

It's beautiful graphics, hostile atmosphere and economical gameplay adds just enough to the story and lore of the world of Alien to be considered an addition to it. Something many games have tried and failed (sometimes miserably) to do.   Now the bad: It can be quite fatiguing to play. The continuous tension and high chance of dying before reaching a save station serve to ramp up the tension but it can be quite frustrating at times. It's overly long in my opinion; At 28 hours it felt like it began to throw some quite repetitive challenges at me towards the end. The voice acting was excellent as was the characterisation but some of the animations of the NPC characters felt a litle unpolished. There was one bug that meant playing through the mission a second time. It's otherwise stable, even though I played through the entire thing on a DK2.  These things aside, I still highly recommend it to anyone who wants to revisit the Alien series. I'm pretty convinced that it will be GOTY.",

Alien: Isolation is a MUST have whether you nab while it's on sale or for full price. The DLC is worth a playthrough or two as well and you can get all of it in a bundle with Alien: Isolation for a very reasonable price.

If you've ever wondered what'd be like to live the horrors of the 1979 film Alien, then look no further, Alien Isolation is the game for you. That being said, it has one of the most frustrating last couple of hours that I can recall in any modern videogame. There are, at least, 6 fake endings. Those last few hours are filled with lazy level design, jump scares, loud noises and lots of repetitive filler that could've been cut out from the game entirely. The same goes for the ending... Although not terrible, it certainly didn't live up to my own, personal hype. All in all, Isolation is a brilliant game. The Alien is like nothing I've ever seen.

As a young kid terrified of the original movie, I always wondered what it would be like to play out a scenario similar to the movie Alien and now I know how scary it really is. The authentic look and feel of the game makes this one of the best games based on a movie that I’ve ever played since Star Wars: Tie Fighter and Goldeneye 007. It’s so good it would be a great sequel to Alien/Aliens if it were made into a movie. I had a few nightmares after playing this and that never happens to me with other games.   The level of detail with the ambience, sounds and music are exactly spot on and faithful to immerse you in the world of Alien. No modern era game hand holding and arrows pointing out exactly where to go or regenerating health. The unpredictable Alien AI is refreshing and there are other enemies you encounter that are also more powerful, hostile and can kill you. Compared to other survival horror games, Alien Isolation easily makes it up to my top three rivaled only by Silent Hill 2 or Fatal Frame. As a stealth game, it is also one of the best right up there with the classic Thief games and in fact, my stealth skills in Thief helped me here.   My main issue is that there are too many hostile humans who shoot first. If you could actually choose to join, leave or kill them with more quests based on who you join, that would add to the game. Also, it seems the Alien is always targeting you and follows you wherever you go, which is unfair but I understand why.  In a generation that has been extremely disappointing so far, this survival horror/stealth gem really outshines them all. I’ll be watching Creative Assembly closely from now on for their next release hopefully another Alien game.  ",

From the moment I started playing I was feeling a perpetual sense of dread without let up. I've screamed out in shock at points. But I have loved every minute of it.   There are some faults in the game, the humans are often an annoyance but not a real threat, some of the graphics are a bit iffy at times (but the Alien does look amazing), and the Alien AI can be a bit weird. Once I had it freak out once and just stand wobbling from side outside a locker I was hidden in, when I left the locker I thought I'd instantly die, but it wandered of nonchalantly!

On the one hand, we have the technical aspects, which are positive: - the game is very (I mean VERY) well optimized, runs butter smooth in ultra on my 4 year rig (i5-2320, GTX 750, 8GB RAM etc.) - the design is very nice, a clear continuation of the original Alien movie (everything looks like designed in the 80s)  Gameplay-wise, there are some strong points too: - atmosphere is top notch, the space station is scary enough without feeling cheap - the crafting system and the tools are a nice touch - the sounds are good, everything creaks, beeps, things go bump in the night etc. - I was scared sh|tless playing hide and seek with the alien (for a while that is)  But then there were some aspects of the game which totally broke immersion for me, and were annoying as hell. - People having no problem 'accidentally' running into you in a very large hall, no matter what; yet not noticing you when you literally are an arms length away. This is no joke: in Mission 3 I was crouching in the corner just beside the door and a guy entering the same door walked by me twice like a blind bat. - The Alien wandering 'accidentally' always in your vicinity in the missions you have to evade it. It has the whole hospital floor for itself, yet you always have to hide in lockers and hold your breath. It's like the alien can't see you, can't hear you, can't smell you from a distance, yet is drawn to you somehow. This made the hide and seek a trial and error for me, and poof, the suspence and terror was gone after a while.   I had the feeling that a lot of encounters were scripted to a point where the question was not 'How can I solve this?' but 'How do the developers want me to solve this?'.  I gave the game thumbs down, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this is a bad game. If you're not bothered by the negative aspects I mentioned, then you should definitely try it.

            "review_text": " Alien: Isolation  is an example of a game well made. With its scrupulous attention to tiniest details and internal integrity, it's an asset that could have honoured any franchise. For the  Alien  franchise, which has relatively recently suffered from the pile of crap commonly known as 'Aliens: Colonial Marines', it is yet more valuable.  The game creators' attitude to the legacy of original 1979 movie is incredibly careful. I can hardly imagine anything that could be more canonical than this one. Everything looks purely authentic: old-fashioned computer terminals, ladders, doorways, lighting, switches, even buttons and keyboards are reproduced in a most meticulous manner. All that combined contributes for some true experience of entering this world and living in it.  The Alien itself is also what is should be: fearsome, basically immortal, formidable man-hunting enemy that can barely be escaped and that punishes a careless one swiftly and mercilessly. It's not something you can throw grenades at or kill in dozens, like you do in some other people's attempts to make an  Alien  game. Its evil persistence keeps the tension up and constantly reminds you of your vulnerability.  The gameplay is best described with two words: Stealth, and Survival. It's about exploring, staying alive in hostile environments, sneaking around with little to no chance to fight back in case of trouble, solving problems with alternative routes and device manipulations, and using limited resources for your benefit. Overall, it's a lot like playing  Deus Ex Human Revolution , but without any kind of those fancy hi-tech implants.  As for the negative sides, I'll just quote a phrase from a review I read before buying:  'The game has some minor drawbacks, of course, but it's so good in general that I simply don't want to think and write about them.'  One of the best titles I've played. I recommend it most favourably.",

            "review_text": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers. X  Alien: Isolation is a High quality AAA horror game based off the 1979 movie, 'Alien'. In this game, you play as Ellen Ripley's daughter (Amanda Ripley) in a time zone set between the first and second 'Alien' movie. Ripley and the 'Torrens' must go on a mission to the 'Sevastapol Station' to unravel the truth behind her mother's disappearence. Only to find that the station has gone to chaos, citezins going crazy, synthetics have turned evil, and there is also the pressence of a Big, fast, lethal and unpredictable alien.  Alien: Isolation is quite possibly THE BEST horror game I have ever played. I couldn't keep myself from it until I finished the campaign. Most 'Alien' games in the past have been quite disappointing and put every one to a conclusion that there is never going to be a good Alien game. However ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Creative Assebly's 'Alien: Isolation'.  The game features a HUGE range of gameplay sources including items found in the station used for crafting, ammunition and flares. A crafting system for (hidden In game) blueprints such as medkits, smoke bombs, flashbangs and some other amazing utilities. A variety of weapons (hidden in game) such as a revolver, a shotgun, a stun baton and more. Terminal cmoputers (WITH CRT MONITORS?!), rewire systems and... Save Stations (which I have always hated). As well as a motion tracker, an access tuner and a headset flashlight to help in your quest for survival.  As well as the Alien there are many enemies to avoid in Alien: Isolation. After a disruptance in the stations core, Sevastapols's environmentally friendly andriods have turned AWOL and are executing all located humans in the station. They are indestructable to most of your utilities. They can be stopped by using the Stun Baton, EMP mines, or the Bolt Gun. There are other Human's on the station, alive and terrified. They will kill anyone they see for survival. There are also Facehuggers on the station as well (keep them away from you).  The main antagonist of the game is the alien Xenomorph that proclaimed to wander out of the 'Nest' and is roaming 'Sevastapol' killing everyone in sight. The Xenomorph features incredible Artificial Inteligence that can be alerted by even the slightest bit of noise (hint: don't run). He can go anywhere in the station via the ceiling vents. The Xenomorph is more unpredictable than probably any other horror game enemy I have seen. He can fall out of the ceiling, he can crawl through access vents and he is much faster than you. If he spots you he will chase after you at a terrifying speed and once he catches you, you are introduced to a death screen. There are many methods of occupying the alien, such as hiding in lockers, cabinets and under tables, using noisemakers, using rewires, and fire... - 'Animals are terrified of fire'.  Although this game may seem like a perfect horror game, it is not. The full game is $50 and has a size of 32 GBs. The game is 15 hours long, which is way over the average horror game time length. The first half of the game is great fun and quite interesting, while the rest of the game is just adding, less cutscenes, more frustrating tasks and more 'I just wanna beat the game'. The game uses manual 'save stations' as its main source of saving (again, I hate save stations). And the game is known to be really frustrating at times, and sometimes 'unbeatable'.  Over all though, this is a fantastic action - survival - horror. I'd rate it a 9/10. This is not the best horror game of all time, but if you don't mind spending $50 on an 'Alien' based horror that takes 32 GBs space, spending over 15 hours on confusing and frustrating tasks and scares and relying on locating save stations throughout the campaign every time you have to leave the game, then I recommend Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation 100%.  If you are still reading this, I hope you enjoyed my review. Now go and enjoy the game.",

            "review_text": "I am a huge horror fan. I am a huge survival horror fan. I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. With that said, I would be hesitant when buying this game if I were you. Know what you're getting yourself into.  I'll start with the cons:  The biggest glaring problem with this game is that it's unfairly difficult. Now before you rip me to parts for saying that I don't like the game because it's difficult, there's a difference between being difficult and being just downright unfair. I'm all for hard games; I absolutely hate the hand holding trend in games right now. With that said, Alien: Isolation makes some absolutely bizarre choices in the Alien's AI. 50% of the time when you use the flamethrower to send the alien away, it doesn't do jack ♥♥♥♥. Then, even if it does, you better not be standing right under an air duct, because in less than a second after the alien runs away, it instantaneously drops down on you and kills you. I also encountered a bug early on in the game where the Aliens would duplicate. Granted, it was kind of hilarious, but was completely annoying after the first 3 or 4 times. Now all of this would be fine and dandy if it felt rewarding after you successfully escaped the clutches of the Alien. But it's not. It's not rewarding at all. It just leads to lots of aggravation and frustration. The game penalizes you for going fast, which is totally fine. The only problem is the fact that when you die, sometimes you're 10-20 minutes from your last save (saving is a huge problem early on in the game, but thankfully they become more frequent in the second half). Ultimately, this game is just a big frustrating mess.   Now, for some positive things:  With all that said, there are some things this game did right. The whole 80s futuristic atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. A good deal of the game, especially the parts where you're outside of the space station in the space suit, are extremely satisfyingly atmospheric. The character models are really well done, and with the exceptions of certain cut scenes, I found the game to run smoothly for me. While the characters aren't anything memorable, they're terrifically voiced and well acted. There were some legitimately good scares here as well.   Overall, most of the positives are aesthetically warranted. But as the old saying for motorcycles goes: 'Paint and chrome don't get you home.'",

The game can often be rather buggy, with hitboxes that tend to 'snag' on you, less than acceptable AI, and drags on for far too long. While I definitely enjoyed the first half of the game, after that the alien encounters became more frequent, and the game became something more artificial, more scripted, more obvious and predictable. It kept dragging itself longer and longer, forcing you to do rather annoying tasks while you have to evade the AI, which I'd describe as a mix of very abusable, but very unforgiving. The second half of the game became such a grind, such a chore to do, that it killed my enjoyment for it completely. The worst part is I don't see *why* the developer studio felt the need to drag the game on for around 3 to 4 hours, constantly use cutscenes to set your finish line another ten miles away every time you get to it. The game didn't suceed in scarying me, it suceeded in frustrating me. I took full advantage of the crafting system to build items to avoid as many encounters as possible, and so will you when you play this, because this is not a game that will make you feel like you've enjoyed playing it once you see the credits roll. My personal suggestion is watch its story online if you're that curious, and pass this title.",

            "review_text": "I'm aware I'm late to the party when it comes to playing this game. Whoever wanted to buy this game probably already has it by now anyway seeing how frequently this has seen a good discount. But to be honest I don't really get why people were/are raving on about this game. Yes, it's fairly intense at times, has an amazing level of franchise-loyal detail which makes it feel like you're in the first Alien movie, but frankly that's not good enough when you look at gameplay. You only really get to hide in extremely specific places instead of inside anything that looks like it would realistically open. This means you can kind of forget about a truly stealthy approach with a decent challenge; think games like Thief or Hitman (at their highest difficulty of course).  The game also relies upon choke points in it's level design where you'd inevitably run into people / androids that shoot or otherwise try to kill you, without much abilities of luring them away. It seems the game does a poor job streamlining what should be a challenging yet a 'fair fight' compared to fighting or hiding from the much more challenging alien.   Speaking of which, the game really should give a few more hints about when to expect the arrival of the alien. It seems a full 100% random, instead of based upon the player making noises or even crossing it's previous path. Comparing this game to the great horror game that is Outlast it's very easy to see how this Aliens game is not very fair in it's fundamental design. Outlast gives the players more options, whilst also being more haunting in my opinion. This has a lot to do with the fact that especially early on merely meeting with the alien results in a near-instant death. Needless to say, not a lot of fun and after a few times meeting the alien that way isn't scary anymore.  +lighting, visuals and various other FX are great, makes you feel like in an Alien movie +enviroments seem plausible in terms of 'franchise-loyal detail' +voice acting generally is great +game seems to have a decent enough story, although it'll not have much surprises for fans of the franchise +concept of survival, including a separate survival challenge mode (although sadly not flawless, this style of game definitely makes sense for an alien game) +story missions are alright. mostly. +DLC ; there's more if you want more  -lip synch is a gigantic immersion breaker, really poor stuff here. in fact, most animations are rather bad; including the Alien moving around like some kind of robot. Only the scripted animations look fluid. -as great as the visuals are, most people in this game do look like plastic dolls. still better than in most games, but to me it's obvious they tried to aim for photorealism and kind of failed. It certainly doesn't look bad though. -interaction with the alien and the alien AI is very disappointing, some of which seems too random. Other things are time based, with the player hiding in plain sight and the Alien never spotting you. The more I play the game, the less frightening the Alien becomes because of this. Kind of a shame.  -controls are horrible and clearly suffer from the 'console port' disease with awkwards keybindings, a lot of context-sensitive interaction also only works from very specific spots which breaks the game at times. Imagine being close to a closet ready to hide, yet the context-sensitive button won't appear because you're not in the correct spot. I've already been killed way too many times because of the poor controls. -levels really need a much greater level of interaction for it to really 'work' as a stealth game. Especially early on when you lack basic defense against people / androids. -one can unfortunately make a decent case for this game not having great level design -crafting seems like an after thought and just like the levels, lack a greater depth for it to really make sense. The crafting system depth of say a Fallout 4, where almost everything and anything counts as a resource is lacking here -FOV is incredibly small, so playing this game often feels like looking through binoculars backwards -DLC ; there's more if you want more, but perhaps most of it should simply be part of the main game. I'm not saying the base game lacks value in terms of content, but the DLC is totally overpriced -Android enemies are pretty much invincible it seems, now don't get me wrong the serious danger of getting killed is quite great in terms of tension, but I would have liked to see the player actually be more capable of defeating the Androids. I know a certain DLC enables that, but I think the base game needs it.  I'm going to not recommend this game, but I do have to add that fans of the franchise might be able to ignore the bigger problems this game has and still enjoy this quite a bit. In that case it's mandatory to get it at a discount, as it's not worth full price by any means in terms of polish, smooth gameplay and appearance and AI of the alien and other enemies.  For anyone who thinks the review is overly negative, I've enjoyed this game so far and would ALMOST recommend this game. At a 50% discount most people wouldn't regret getting this I'd say. But I simply think it has a lot of flaws plenty of reviews seem to ignore. I'll be playing more of this regardless, but I wouldn't get this game expecting it to be flawless. Especially the poor AI of the Alien is quite a disappointment, along with how few hiding spots the game offers, despite the game environment looking like you could hide anywhere.",

The space station Sevastopol makes for a perfect setting; everything in it looks like the Nostromo from the first film, a 'haunted house in space'.

On my powerful rig its breathtaking (once you remove film grain) at maximum settings and i still need V Sync to keep it from tearing as its running so fast. 10/10 for optimisation.  Gameplay so far has been great, i'm 2 hours in and have just seen the alien in full for the first time, the atmosphere is amazing, it feels like i'm playing an interactive version of a movie. Jump scares a plenty and the double jepordy of never knowing whether the person/people you're meeting are friend or foe really make this an intense game. 10/10 for gameplay  My only tiny gripe is the nadroids, they're dull as hell and almost always seem to be hostile but then they take 6 headshots with a revolver to kill. Doesn't matter that much though and i won't penalise the game for it.  Now i'm reserving 2 points until i finish the game as i've heard it gets kinda boring in the middle and theirs huge parts of the game where the alien is absent so until such time as i finish it (then i will come back and update this review) im giving it an overall score of 8/10.

Just be warned, you just run around scared and confused most of the time. I'll track a few more hours and maybe change my opinion, but only time will really tell.",

At that point I realized that I was not having fun anymore. I just could not wait the game to end. I didn't care about the ending anymore, because I was so annoyed with so much waiting, backtracking, hiding... The game in this form has material for 10-12 hours of gameplay. Don't get me wrong, Alien: Isolation is not a bad game. I can not recommend it because there's so much wasted potential. The bottom line is: it's too long for what it delivers.",

For those wondering, shooting the alien with bullets causes it to bleed slightly and the bullets to ricochet of its carapace and into the deck plates. Very cool.

Beautiful to look at, atmospheric. Unbelievable sound design. Well optimised. I really love the control scheme - leaning around corners or cover is encouraged, and necessary.  The first four or five hours on Sevastopol station are credible and tense; once introduced, the xenomorph is frightening and ominous. Never have I felt so  inferior  as a player character. The level design during these hours is complicated, and there are many places to hide, although not all are safe. Playng cat and mouse with the alien is dynamic and arresting. Unfortunately as the game progresses and the need to conceal one's self lessens, the level design becomes less intricate, populated with human and android obstacles that never match the unpredictability and cunning of the xenomorph AI.  The plot is simplistic, and can be surmised as 'You're stuck on a deteriorating space station, stalked by psychotic androids and a terrifying pradator. Do find a way out, much. And any traces of your mum's lost vessel, those are good too.' Viewed from this distance I was able to pleasantly engage in the simulation of being imprisoned and looking for a way out, piecing together and gathering what tools I could. Ripley's search for her mother takes a back seat, regrettably, and I do wish more was made of this - the imperative which beckoned her to Sevastopol in the first place. Going out of her way to discover recordings from the Nostromo's crew seems completely at odds with the primal instinct to find the nearest exit.  I enjoyed embodying Ripley as a scared but resilient engineer with a good dose of humanity, and whilst the late game's devolution into sparser designs and less exciting enemy encounters hamper the game, I strongly recommend it.",

And so...yeah I think I'm ready to leave a review about it :))  Let's just get this out of the way.  This game is GOTY 2014 for me.   actually best game in years!!    The brilliant recomposition of the atmosphere, the overwhelming pressure that hits you when you feel that death is around the corner - and oh boy what a terrific monster is hunting you, the Alien, aka Xeno. 'A survivor', 'perfect' as the words of Ash.  The graphics are literally some of the most beautiful I've ever got to see in a game, and with some mods on PC, the game looks even greater! But visuals are even better because the devs used all of the art in the Alien movie to deliver us an environment as the one in the movie.   Details....details everywhere. From the sound of the 'futuristic' computer as thought in the late 70s to the keycards, this game could be a sequel of the first movie.  Aside from the visual immersion, every single dialogue, every mission, every time you press a button, run, crouch, there's an insolent - yet magistrally created and kept - fatal faith suspended on your head.  Amanda Ripley is alone, and the adventure keeps on drawing you to a pessimistic looking end. Ridley Scott soul was all around in this mov...I mean game.  Now onto the gameplay.  You said survival? Well guess what, you won't have a single second where you'll feel safe...Amanda saves her progress on some kind of composting machine, and it takes 3 seconds or so for the machine to process and actually save. But within those 3 seconds, the game is still alive, anything can happen, death also. How genius is that? Same goes for the crafting system, no pause, menu and here goes my magic potion. Na-a.   The Xeno AI is the best thing to happen to video games. You pretty much can't predict it. Beside a few scripted entrances to scare the player in the best way, the alien will stalk you, hunt you wherever you possibly are.  And for me this is where the game succeeds and truely means the horror-survival words.  I can't remember all the good stuff I thought about this game, so I'd rather just play it :)  PS: sorry if my english hurt your head, it isn't my first language",

Stealth is key, there are occasions where you want to run, but doing so will alert the alien to where you are. You are given some items later in the game that can make the Alien retreat temporarily, but you are not given too many supplies so the feeling of dread remains as it drops back down 20 seconds later to look for you.  The only downsides to the game are the type of objectives you have to complete. You will find yourself backtracking alot, mostly just to restart a generator or enter a code to open a door. For example, to open this door you need to open it using a computer, to do that you have to turn on the power etc. This keeps you on your toes, just as you think you are getting somewhere you find your exit is blocked and an alternate route back the way you came has been highlighted on the map. This is not a game breaker, I just feel it is used a bit too much.  In conclusion, the use of lighting (or lack there of), great use of sound and the unpredictable A.I of the Alien makes this a incredibly tense, but overall a worthwhile experience.  8/10",

The game is really beautiful, it will surprise you with good lightning effects and a good soundtrack. The story and the spaceship looks like the first alien so the fan will love it (its also really scary at start but when you are used to see the xenomorph, the horror seems to go and you will play the game more easier). There is also survival mode and some dlc but the campaign will take 15-20 hours of gameplay. The only bad thing about this game is the story which i think could have been better, but its not that bad, however it look like to much the aliens movies so nothing surprising. if your an alien fan, buy it, if you are just interested you will love it too but careful because a lot of players didnt finish the game because its really scary when you are not used to it...",

You are an engineer in this game, so you should expect to do some engineering mini-games around, which is one of the game's strong points in my opinion. Although they can be repeatitive and usually unchallenging, and there could have been twists in the mini-games events, like power failure in the middle of them, but that is my own opinion.  Another strong point is the sounds. Don't play this game without a sound card or an amplifier system attached onto your gaming pc. The terror is hearing the steps of a nearby enemy or a xenomorph approaching or walking away, or the thumbs of a close XX121 spider crawling a feet away near your head. I'd kiss the sound engineers who made the sounds of the game.  Graphics wise? A challenge for my 3-screen gaming rig, and beautiful to be hold. The design of the levels are breath taking, very beautiful and creepy at the same time, the shadows and dark corners play a great deal of the game's atmosphere. Don't play this game without having cranked the graphics to the maximum settings.  The only downfall of the game is that it's short, nearly 20 hours of game play only, although I know it's not easy making a game long and interesting, specially for the fact that the game designers ran out of tricks at the end part of the game, and you can get that sense. Another thing is that the game doesn't support multi-screen game play 100%. The HUD was missed up that I only found out that I could actually fabricate items in the middle of the game, and that the weapons actually had an aiming reticle, but it was on the right screen.",

This is THE game that should've came out years and years ago.  The sounds are ripped straight from Fox Studio's sound library, making the experience that much more authentic to people who have seen the movies. I like how there are so many intricate details that they put into the environments as well; props and set pieces are taken straight from the movie to give it greater plausibility in regards to the proper time and place in the lore. The crafting system is great. I love making tools to ward off any threats to help in my escape, and it's easy to use, especially with a Mouse &amp; Keyboard. As a PC game, the function is perfect; there's plenty of options for you to tinker around with to make the game play the way you want it to. At first the controls seemed a little wonky, but once you get used to it, you know where everything is and how to play -- the controls aren't very 'console-like'. The Xenomorph itself is amazing, I was at awe with how the tail was an actual physics object that flowed with the way the alien moved, and for once I found the thing to be downright terrifying, rather than badass (thanks Aliens for ruining everything and making everyone think it's badass instead of scary).   tl;dr 10/10, 100/100, GOTY",

The alien roams around the map and will respond to user activity with deadly consequences and is a real and difficult foe. I havn't yet found a way to abuse the AI or game it.   The design is pretty solid and you can build a bunch of diffrent devices to make your life easier. Stuff like a pipe bomb can blow the Alien up and make it run away, but you can't kill it. You can use noise grenades to make the Alien attack other humans who are in your way or shoot them with your revolver. Doing so will get the Alien very agitated so I advise never firing more than a shot unless you know what your doing.  Its actually scary. Its unforgiving, with a disturbing setting thats also extremely isolated. Its everything thats scary about space, and its fantastic. Some have called this game Amnesia with Aliens, but its so much better than those games as you have some tactical choices thanks to the crafting system that you just don't have in most these other horror games. On top of this games are also scary. I don't usually scare easy but this game has me taking off my headset and looking away right before the Alien grabs me at points.   Its like a night mare, you your gun dousn't do damage, your fists don't hurt, and you cannot run. Its friggan horrifying.  Later in the game it takes on a more FPS style and shooting and killing stuff with guns takes on a bigger role and it dousn't work especially well. This is short lived later in the game, and the areas that are the major issues are fairly short and toward the very far end of the game. It dousn't work extremely well as a shooter due to the clunky nature of horror games like this, but it mostly works well enough to not get in the way and remain immersive. Most the time if you want to go in guns blazing or sneaking the decision is left to you, but I always had a surplus of ammo and weapons even as later in the game I decided to go through what enemies I could instead of going around.  The later parts of the game evolve into a more FPS style horror game which is somewhat in the style of horror movies. As the hero adapts and learns they begin to fight back, plus it keeps it interesting instead of the same gameplay throughout the entire game, for a 20 hour game that would be boring. The base gameplay of hiding and sneaking never change, but at times you given a real choice to where it may be a legit tactic to go shooting instead of shooting equating to a untimely death at the hands of better equiped humans, androids, or the Alien.  Its a great game. Got it free with the AMD R9 270X I bought. For aslong as it is, as much content that is in it, and gameplay thats diffrent and interesting enough to hold my attention, on top of a cool IP like Aliens, I would say this is a pretty great game. Really makes up for Colonial Marines (Gearbox was basically stealing money and committing fraud on that one) in the Alien videogame world.  For as good as it looks all around it makes video game stuff even more jarring, occasionally you will see into the void, Alien AI might start walking into a wall, animations might not smootly transition, scanner or weapon animations might go wonky or glitch in some way, enemys might rubber band to you if they are within range of a few feet, and on harder difficulties the Alien with follow your traversal through the areas to a degree. Its a video game, I beat it on the hardest difficulty and none of these things really got in the way ever and the game wouldn't be much fun if the Alien wasn't even near you for the majority of the game and you were just walking through areas for 16 hours while you occasionally heard an alien stumbling through vents.  Play this if you like Aliens. Play this if you like horror games. Play this if you want an immersive expereince.  You will probably enjoy it.",

The stress it causes you as you have to operate a mechanism, potentially being stabbed in the back. Brilliant idea, right? Not really, when the stress is about replaying a portion of game instead of being about death. It'd be stressful if this was applied to things that made contextual sense, and provided security. Security that meant living, not the security of not having to replay a segment of game. Imagine having to run for an exit, knowing that the Alien would come if you did, not knowing whether you'd make it -and have it slam into the door behind you- or whether you'd be torn to pieces. That's a thrill. Imagine sneaking through that exit after luring the alien into another room. That's a thrill. What's in the game? You run, trapping the alien behind the door, some peace. Oh look, a terminal! Let's look a what it has to say, how interesting, the Nostromo you say? *Clunk* huh? ♥♥♥♥. Quick, lets hide in the cabinet to my left after I get my head out of this console. Nope, head's still in the console. Oh wait I'm dead. Oh ♥♥♥♥ the checkpoint was 4 rooms back. Where's the security placed here? The security is a save point that isn't logically placed or spaced, or consistent with reality. Where's the agency in this situation? The player has none. The player is stuck in an illogical animation. Where's the agency in the first example? The player's own movement. The times this is utilised in Alien: Isolation are meaningless. You have agency to find the nearest hiding place and stay there until the Alien desides to ♥♥♥♥ off. That's is all. I don't even want to run for a door even if there was a chance of it working because there is no security when I get there. I can't even run for a save station, because there's no security there either. So really, I wouldn't even take the risk to even get to utilise the fantastic save mechanism. I'm just saddened by it. When you make it there some say there is a relief. I have none, because it's still rince and repeat.  Some may like it, but without an option I'm sorely burned.  Even simple ideas like charge-based saves would fix this problem. The same card slot experience but instead it just replenshes charges that I can use at my own expense. Oh look, agency! There are neat ways this could be implemented, and the same brilliant style can be replicated with it too.  I don't mind replaying a section again to pass it. What I do mind is replaying a whole swathe of nonsense where I just explored dark rooms (space station lighting needs to step it up) picking up junk and reading things in consoles, or other various mind numbing actions AND a section where I got caught by a vent-teleporting AI falling beside me with no hiding places in sight.  There are other problems, but this is the one that just made me alt-F4 the game into the dirt.  Other than that, there are so many unmentioned good things too. Mainly the  astounding  atmosphere and texture the game has.",

I can be as quiet as I possibly can be and the Alien just comes out of the vent right next to me, I have zero time to react. By the time I right click to use my devices to scare it off, it has already got me. It was fun at first seing all the different ways the Alien could kill me depending on what position I was in and what I was doing, but after a while this game became extremely frustrating and could only advance to my next objective from stupid luck towards the end. This is a great game but it doesn't really matter how loud or stealthy you are. There are a couple glitches where I get stuck here and there and they got me, some scripted gameplay synematics where the Alien was supposed to be present but was invisible. I just laughed.  Is this game worth it? Only on Steam Sale. You will pay a little more than a movie and get way more hours out of it. I got my worth out of it since it was basically a very interactive 3D movie experience for me. I felt the game didn't look all that great playing with 3D Vision off. It also has the classic fuzz quality the Alien/Aliens movies had the entire time but 3D Vision gets rid of it completely.   If you know nothing about 3D Vision the glasses are battery powered and gives you a completely digital more realistic looking, immersive experience. You can set how much depth you want in your games. In practice, 3D Vision is actually 2x 720p because we get two images from different angles, which doubles the resolution. Just looks incredible. FPSs I recommend 15% or less depth. In this game you can have maybe 25% or so comfortably on your eyes.   I played with a GTX 660 non-ti edition with i7-3820, 16GB RAM, Acer GD245HQ 23.6' 3D Vision ready monitor, if you're interested what specs I used for 3D Vision. 1920x1080, Deep Color &amp; V-Sync on, Level of detail: Ultra, Shadow Res 1024, Shadow mapping high. I always turn shadows down in most games. Shadows are usually what kill your FPS.  OMG, the Alien was soo much scarier for me in 3D. When it put its tail through me, I felt like I could actually feel it. I had the most fun finding humans and making noise so the Alien would kill them for me, make it easier to sneak through some parts. So much fun to watch them shoot helplessly at the Alien and it just wipes them all out.  It's a good game but I can't recommend it. I'm a huge Alien fan, and it is well worth playing as a fan.

Remember how you were being hunted by the Nemesis? And how scary it was whenever he'd show up? Well imagine if the Nemesis showed up in every room of the game, and you had to stop what you're doing two or three times per puzzle to hide from him or its instant game over. Sounds like a chore right? That's this game.   The most fun I had was at the start of the game before it shows up. You feel an actual dread and fear because you don't know how this creature operates. That changes shortly after the first encounter. All mystery is removed because this thing constantly follows you around and you're forced to take advantage of the various quirks in the Alien's a.i. So you can complete the various puzzles.   In short: The Alien makes gameplay an absolute chore and it's constant presence around the player removes all horror and mystery in regards to the creature itself.

The controls are often unresponsive, the interface is mediocre (and obtrusive), the save system -- okay, wait. I actually like the idea behind it, but I had to replay the entirety of four different missions multiple times due to a loading loop error. Each time, I was able to get things back on track aside from the final level (mission 19) where the game inexplicably stuck a dead body at Ripley's feet. I would have had to replay mission 18 again to hopefully solve this problem, and it would've taken a lot of money for me to ever play that one again. Or mission 17. Or mission 16. Or...  If you're wondering how I racked up the final achievements despite being unable to move, I had to download someone else's save just so I could complete my game. Utter nonsense.  Oh how I wish this was the only bug in the game. It isn't. Not by a longshot. It merely is the most crippling and, literally, game-breaking of them all.  The pacing and actual gameplay have too much of a negative effect to recommend Alien: Isolation. Maybe if it was much shorter, tighter, had less to collect and, rather, had a stronger emphasis on weaving a compelling narrative, and... oh, yeah, it didn't keep eating my damn saves, I'd probably have enjoyed my experience.  If it wasn't for the save issue, I *may* have marked this as a recommended title (to be purchased only during a 75% sale), but honestly, watching Alien 10 times in a row would've been less tedious and monotonous than playing Alien: Isolation.  I guess there's a reason why this developer typically makes RTS games rather than these types. Stick to what you're good at, Creative Assembly. From what I've briefly experienced, you are quite good at strategy titles. Please leave Alien: Isolation II (Aliens: Isolation?) to another team.  I really wanted to love this game. I really did. Why else would I have spent 5-6 hours fiddling with saves, verifying files, replaying the same missions over again, and even resorting to other people's saves if I didn't?

For some reason I give birth every time there's a small drop that I need to make in the vents (woman screams loudly). Save system seemed cool untill I passed a huge a$$ hallway AAAAND went down in a lift (logical autosave point?) and then went across a huge room just to be kissed by Mr. Alien and start from scratch. SEGA were always lazy with graphics so I didn't expect much. Human faces and Sevastopol textures are rushed  and I find it difficult to immerse myself in the game.  I will install it again in hopes of getting more of what others have experienced and less of what I have, but this wasn't the first and probably won't be the last sad experience with this game...",

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation is the Alien game that fans have been waiting decades for. Not only does it faithfully recreate the atmosphere of the original Ridley Scott film, but it finally makes the Xenomorph something to be afraid of again. The graphics are absolutely phenomenal and some of the best in the gaming industry to date along with incredible sound design and an unexpectedly lengthy story. The gameplay may have a few quirks, and the storyline may be hard to follow when your constantly running from hiding spot to hiding spot, too afraid to peek over the counter to grab that extra flare; but this game is the best Alien experience oyu will ever get.   Let's start by talking about the gameplay. Unlike past Alien games, this one focuses entirely on the original film 'Alien' by Ridley Scott. Gone are the large assault rifles and grenades that used to make short work of Xenomorphs in past games. In their place is a 26 hour game of hide-and-seek. Alien: Isolation focuses more so on stealth tactics and the methods of deception in order to accomplish your goals. There's absolutely no way to kill the Alien with any items you find, so the game forces you to move carefully from room to room, using any cover or hiding spots you can find. While it may seem easy to just be patient, the more you wait, the more the Alien learns and the easier it is for it to find you. Sometimes hiding in a locker and holding your breath will allow you to slip by undetected, but if you use this tactic too often, the Alien figures it out and rips the door off and.. well.. you know the rest. Though I did feel the gameplay could use a few improvements. For one, the Androids on the ship didn't really feel necessary as they only felt like a place-filler whenever the Alien wasn't present and they certainly weren't nearly as interesting. Another issue I had was with the movement of the character herself. The crouching speed is incredibly slow compared to usual stealth game standards, which makes sneaking up on enemy humans/androids without them turning around close to impossible. I also feel the hint that the game gives you about sitting back inside lockers and holding your breath is not nearly clear enough. It took me several attempts just to read what the hint was saying before the Alien ripped the door off and chewed on my face. Other than these small issues, the game itself is incredibly immersive and really does make you feel like you are in the classic 1979 horror masterpiece.   On a technical level; the graphics and sound design are beautiful in this game. It is incredibly clear that the developers of Alien: Isolation absolutely love their source material and have meticulously recreated the exact same atmosphere that individuals experienced back in the theatre. Lights slowly flicker as they turn on, old green CRT monitors buzz and shake, and the Alien can always be heard thumping around in the vents above you, ready to jump down at completely random intervals. The actual visuals are gorgeous with light being reflected and refracted off of steam that slowly flows out of vents in the wall, and the slow burning at the end of your flamethrower shedding only a minuscule comfort of light against the sides of the vents you hope are safe. The only real technical issue I can find with the game is it's lackluster human character animations. They feel very stiff and unrealistic. Thankfully, the star of the show looks phenomenal. The Alien will slowly coil itself as it rolls out of a cieling vent and slunks to the floor, only to quickly raise it's head and begin stomping down the hallway, now and again stopping to stair mysteriously down a hall. You can never tell what the Alien is going to do next and it makes your movement choices even more horrifying. The AI for the Alien is done perfectly and not once in my 26 hours of play time did I notice any AI glitches that killed the immersion. Creative Assembly made entirely sure that both the environment and the creature itself are as genuine as the movie, and it shows perfectly.   Now in terms of story, it's pretty straight forward horror/Alien style storyline. The only issue I had with it is that the characters aren't very memorable and it's incredibly hard to even piece together what the story is when you're constantly logging off of computers as you're in the middle of an email only because you heard the Alien thumping around outside of the room you were in. There's tons of hidden messages, ID tags, and email messages that piece together survivor stories of both the Nosostromo (from the movie) and the Sevastopol (the massive space station setting of the game itself), so those willingly to sit there and read the emails to get more out of the story are certainly welcome to try, but the game certainly doesn't appear to encourage it considering the gameplay doesn't freeze when you're reading computer screens or rewiring panels. So to summarize, the story's good from what I was able to make out from it. There's plenty of fan appeal with all kinds of recreated experiences straight from the movie to keep anyone with even a remote interest in the Alien series happy.   So to wrap this all up, Alien Isolation is a fantastic work of art that successfully recreates the exact tension (and maybe even more so) as the original Ridley Scott film. The graphics are fantastic and the Alien certainly steals the show with unpredictable AI and incredible attention to detail. The game can be quite difficult to most, but as long as you're careful and avoid making stupid movement choices and use your scarce resources wisely, you should be able to make it in one piece. I personally played it on the hardest difficulty and was only killed by the Alien throughout the 26 hours around 20 some times. The game even features plenty of bonus levels and challenges to keep you occupied if you haven't had enough after the lengthy campaign, which is great for replay value. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys stealth, horror, and obviously to ANYONE who has ever enjoyed 'Alien.'",

Oh wait, I forgot... whenever it auto saves it sends you back to the main menue where you can't access your saves so you need to restart on mission 10. WARNING: THIS GAME MAY CORRUPT, BUT IT MIGHT NOT IDK.  the first 10 missions are a 8 1/2 out of 10 really fun and scary.

Coming from a dedicated and avid Alien enthusiast take my word when I say this, this is a game you if:  *You enjoy sitting uneasily for several hours rarely being safe  *Appreciate a well rounded crafting system much similar to the one in Tomb Raider &amp; The Last of Us   *Enjoyed the first Alien movie or the franchise in its' entirety  *Get a thrill of being completely defenseless against a overwhelming and deadly foe but overcoming it with strategical positioning &amp; planning  *Love using fire, seriously. You feel like a caveman in this game.  If you disagree with the above mentioned, you might want to reconsider buying this game. For me this is the epitome of the survival thriller franschise and is a must buy to any person who consider them well versed in the gaming industry.  There are some minor plot holes but they are only visible if you immerse yourself deeply in the backstory of the game, something which is not needed to understand the main plot and premiss of the game.   Understanding game, 9/10",

            "review_text": "!!!DISCLAIMER!!!: I still think this game is not good. The only reason my review is positive is because it seems that little kids like to target people who dislike thier favorite games and spam them with garbage.    Also, people have mentioned 'Oh you've only played for an hour and a half? You arent allowed to have an opinion unless you played the whole game!' So i've forced to play for another hour and a half. Any longer and I would have fallen asleep.   First off, the art style. It perfectly compliments the 1979 film. It looks, sounds, and feels like you are plopped right smack in the middle of Alien. I myself am a huge fan of the films (even the bad ones had some enjoyment.), and I have got to say, I love the atmosphere. Its spot on. 9/10.   Second, gameplay. Sadly, the game just falls apart in this aspect. Nothing it does is original. Infact, remove the Alien and the art style, and you have literally any game on steam with the 'stealth' tag. You crouch around, crawl in vents, backtrack alot, look for things like passcodes and stuff, you need to lockpick doors (the hacking tool is just a different version of that lockpicking mechanic we have seen a million times.), you hide in lockers, and you nearly never use weapons. Its bland, repetitive, and boring. Sure, for the first 30 minutes or so its fun, but as soon as you realize you will be doing that for the rest of the game, you want out. 3/10  And then the story. From what I have seen so far, you play as Ripley's daughter, and you head to the Sevastapool station to find the flight recorder of the Nostromo. But, when you arrive, you find the station in chaos, and you become stranded. Oh yeah, and Xenomorphs happened. I couldn't force myself to continue to find the rest of the story, but it seems promising. 8/10  FINAL RATING: 5/10. A game with bad graphics can be saved by good gameplay, and a game with bad story can be saved by good gameplay. However, a game with bad gameplay cannot be saved by good story and graphics.",

Now the first few were interesting twists but when you are about to complete the game and /spoiler and alien drags you back about 15 min for no reason the game becomes completly comical. I thought the arrogance of the developers, for the user to get to the end and be dragged back about 5 steps to artificially prolong gameplay. Dont claim a 20+ hr game if 15+hrs is just the user being dragged back and back for no reason. Now I know dev's would claim the reason you got dragged back is to make you feel more clostrophobic, that the ship is falling apart and desperation to get out but I could have walked out of that door without that drag back and be completly the same. There was no character development or anything like that, If I were reading a book I could have skipped a god damn chapter.

On another map, while it was being shot by other humans, I was hiding in a locker (the acid blood hurting me through the locker as the alien was right in front of it), I accidently clicked my motion tracker - which makes noise. So the alien, who is still being shot at, instead of attacking the shooters, or fleeing, breaks open the locker to kill me.   My biggest complaint about the AI? The teleporting... I witnessed it multiple times on one map (oddly the same map where it ignored being shot at). First time and several other times I was again in that same wall locker, watching the saliva drip down from a vent... And suddenly, while the salvia is still dripping he walks past the vent and wall locker... (I know he is in the vent because besides the dripping salvia he's killed me from that very vent). Same map, same area, he goes from that vent to come out of another vent (the one I used to get into the area) which had no connecting tunnels... and went around a corner... then came up behind me. I was in a dead end all, with no vent behind, below or above me. I witnessed a few other times he jump around.  Good things for the game: visuals are beautiful. Stylistics are great. It has a good feel to it. Not as scary as I remember the original two AVP games when I played a Marine (you know where you feel under powered and out matched and expect to die).

This game sort of bridges that gap and at least makes the tension, if not the horror, at least for me, very real for me personally.  I mean, I played this game in the pitch dark in an empty house, something I don't usually do for horror games, and it didn't really scare me. I was however deeply unnerved, in that my fight or flight instinct was in full swing, and I was nervous at every new section where the creature might find me. It IS a bit overexposed; I think it would have been better if avoiding it required a bit more paying attention to sound (which there is a lot of via the famous motion detector) and your environment, and a little less watching it lumber around searching for you. But the stealth is mostly very well-managed, and I kept wanting to get back into the game after every death.  The love for the Alien movies and particular for Ridley Scott's original is palpable, and I wish more games were set in various versions of the future as imagined by the 70s and 80s, with all the CRTs and command line interfaces and big, low-resolution graphics. I also noticed with significant joy that if you watch an android for a while, they'll do the little dance that Ian Holm did in the original movie. I actually found the androids to be the scarier than the Alien. Not only their calm, British-voiced exhortations as they stride towards you to brutally murder you, but their resemblance to mannequins, something which I find honestly unnerving. A great game with a more than respectable length and a world you can get lost in. Nobody loses.  Oh yeah, and also it had a female protagonist. With a nice a##.  Nobody cares, feminists.",

This was especially bad near the vents of the Gemini area.  Another thing I found particularly ridiculous was how enemies with guns engaged in combat stance even though they had no idea I was crouching nearby, without making a sound.  It is quite obvious that when this game was made, too much focus was put into making the game look pretty and user-friendly gameplay was completely neglected. This game is supposed to be 'Horror', but what scared me the most was how the price for this game is 50 Euros.  Overall it's not a bad game, but it is far from deserving 50 Euros.",

            "review_text": "ALIEN ISOLATION  Most of the game isn't too hard, as it plays on my honed skills of social avoidance. Imagine that you are Ripley, a 20 yo college student who shares a house with some people. You are an introvert and like to avoid conversations every time you want food. So you start listening to the old house you share, learning the patterns of your roommates and where to hide to avoid contact. That is this game. Honestly, the alien is quite pleasant to live with in comparison. There's only one, and it'll stomp around and make itself known like an angry upstairs neighbor. This thought also makes the games more humorous than scary, as you play hide and seek, or use noisemakers to direct the alien to the human hunting parties. Fetch boy.  Weird spikes in difficulty annoyed me early on, as you lack most devices for distraction, offense, or even knowing where to go next. Even when you get the motion tracker that points you in the correct direction, the game drags on longer than it should. You keep having to do nested sidequests to move on. You want to leave the station, but your friend is hurt so you need a med pack, so you need to go to the hospital, but you need to find a keycard and password to open the door, so you must restore the power, but the facility catches fire and you need to escape. The game is about the journey more than the destination, and I enjoyed the details to the sound (7.1 headphones helped track), and the retrofuture design of the technology. It captures the thrill of the original Alien, the stalking and evasion.  Now some hate. Worthless ♥♥♥♥ing character development and npcs. Half attack on site, the other half fail the game if you do the same to them. Why would I want to read another person's emails while an alien is stalking me? Reading my own is tedious enough.  Most of the game time is searching for the one thing in the environment that advances the plot. Can't find the plasma torch on the dead guy in the corner after 5 rounds on the area? ♥♥♥♥ you. Trouble finding the 3 small green lights that lock the area down for an alien trap. Do it anyways, Marco or whoever mucks it up anyway. All this backtracking and walking mocks my precious free time.  I started sprinting around and then giving the Alien a flame bath whenever he wanted a hug. Then I'd go to use a terminal and helplessly mash B to abort the uninterruptible 10 second log on time, while Alien had the chances to drop from the vent, scan the area, kill me, have tea, file his taxes, and kill me again.  The enjoyable bits of terror you get from hiding in the cupboards is quickly diluted by repetition, since the game dynamics remain the same for the nearly 25 hour journey. The save system magnifies these issues when they can literally be 20 min apart in an area where death is common.   Kevin Vanord's review on Gamespot mirrors my sentiments.",

Example: Dead Space 3 and Resident evil 5/6 This game takes everything away from you and gives you limited supplies, tools, ammo, health, and no weapons. The formula for a true survival horror game. The AI for the alien is genius . Proceed through the ship with caution. Any sound you make the alien will come crashing down on you. Even as you pass through hallways and airlocks it even seems like the alien just keeps following you even if you left the corridor where it last was. It just drops down from an airshaft and just keeps on coming. The sound the alien makes is extrodianary and the futuristic background from the 70's is a nice touch with some impressing visuals and lighting effects.  BUT BEWARE this game has had its fair share of crashing on some peoples pc's. Mine happens almost everytime I die or try to reload a checkpoint. AND IT DOESN'T save CHECKPOINTS. So everytime you progress you have to save the game at a terminal. Which is stupid it doesn't add to the suspense just causes more frustration for the player. Constantly having to save over and over again when you enter a new area. I guess it's not too bad just really annoying especially if you get unlucky and your copy of the game crashes everytime you die. This game would easily have been a recommendation however with low feed back from the developers and ZERO patches to fix this I can't recommend. The crashing when you die is really bad for the DLC because there are no SAVE TERMINALS just checkpoints so if your game crashes then you lose that checkpoint. I tried contacting the developing on there forums and they fixed nothing so now I have DLC for this game that can't be used. Just rent this game if you have a console lieing around lol",

There was no imersion for the first 2 hours of the game. I dont have the best setup I know my sounds.  Pros-Great movie/cutscene graphics  -Original Alien-style design.  -Beautiful scenery  -Terrified when I (FINALLY) saw the alien  -Crafting sytem is nice but felt useless  -Voice Acting was amazing  -Stealth is good feature, but the elements were off Cons-The story doesnt revolve around alien it move the story around Seegson &amp; W-Y  -Animation in game is static(the Synthetics tacted more like humans than the humans did)  -The controls are all over the place  -Not good representation for orginal movie  -Scares/surprises were triggered poorly(timing was off for jump scares and buildups)  -Alien death makes the game tedious and ruins atmosphere(I love long single player games, but i hate insta-death)  -Quick-time events(not all quick-time events are bad it just didnt work here)  -Lighting phyics were off  -A.I. Human detection is delayed  -Felt like Dead Space(it should feel like Aliens not Dead Space)  -No help(no tutorial to eplain the controls correctly)  -Motion Sensor didnt detect Androids full time(buggy)  -Sounds phyics are off (at some points people right next to me sounded far away and vice versa)+No left or right specific sound(sound was just there not in specific ears) Weird things-Odd thing happen in-game how what I experienced not good nor bad  -No shadow for player   -Human enemy A.I. is more random than alien(random patrols)  -Floating materials  -Synthetics also had random patrol pattern that changed after I loaded the 'last current save'  -Game meant for console?(controls felt awkward)  -No jump?  -Motion Sensor detect Androids?

Enemy human AI, at least in the bit I was in, after you run into the tram elevator thingy, tends to be quite broken. It's super scripted at first, which isn't good already, but the game either forces you to crouch, or when you do crouch it keeps you from standing back up and running. which is a problem, because that chick is scripted to shoot at you. I tried to back up and run down the steps to create some elevation difference/cover, which it wouldn't let me, so I got damaged from a scripted event that wasn't my fault. Later when the AI come down to search, they didn't know I was back there again, so I spent half an hour looking for a way around, then went all the way back across the level to explore, and THEN it let me left click and melee. Somehow, one of these enemies that NEVER left the room before, heard me melee the air and ended up behind me in no less than 10 seconds. So I ran, as I was being shot. I went into a closet once I was out of LOS, little did I know that holding your breath was a mechanic, and the QTE thing only popped up for literally, half a second. I died. So I redid that bit, did a rewire panel and turned on air purification so that ended up making THICK SMOKE COME OUT OF THE VENTS. Somehow, the AI instantly found me and started shooting me through said smoke and killed me. SO I REDED THAT BIT, AGAIN. This time, without doing that, I went into this back room after another AI was about to fully spot me. turns out there was another guy in that room with a gun, he saw me and started shooting so I rushed and melee'd him. NOONE HEARD THAT. NOONE. They could hear me walking. See me across a room in the dark. Hear my melee attack in the air across the map(that general area) at least 100 feet away. See me and kill me through thick smoke. YET. A guy shoots a gun about 45 feet away and noone hears it. Plus there's a window in that brightly lit room where the person who almost saw me outside, should have seen me in that room.  Also it'd be nice if the Alien was either organic through the whole game, or it flat out tells you in a pop up when it starts being like that. There have been points where I thought I had to hunker down and hide, and it turns out the AI up to this point is scripted, and that can't happen yet. I get it's supposed to be scary, but it halts progress up until that point for some people.  Another thing is cutscene audio IS FULL VOLUME, even when my other audio settings are down. Make the cutscene volume follow the other settings.  I don't feel like fixing my typos right now so whatever. I may fix them and/or change my rating and whatnot later, if the game improves, but so far I'm not impressed. Note: I was never on this games hype train. Same for Destiny. I see it how it is, I don't think a game is good to try and justify my purchase. I see it how it is, and call it that way.

Also it annoying as hell that alien walk on floor like human most of time, instead of crawling under the roof, and i never saw it using walls. Also it has pre-rendered cut-scenes, which are unscalable, non future proof, has compression artifacts and waste too much space on HDD, when it could be done much better way in real time by game engine. Graphics dissapointing as well, at very first level they use all real time shadows to cheat you, and then in next locations they go pre-baked static shadow and lighting way.  Main reason i rage quit this game - absolutely broken and unplayable stealth mechanics and NPC AI (devs of this game needs to play Splinter Cell 1-3, Riddick and Thief 1-3 to see how working stealth mechanics and AI looks like) , cheating unpredictable movement of Alien, and sickness i feel playing with such narrow fov that jumps to even more narrow at every animation, and yeah invenotry UI annoyed me a lot.  I do not recomend anyone to play this game until broken AI and stealth is fixed and alien will start playing by rules and untill immersion breaking UI will be revamped..  Yes its a very good sequel to Alien in terms of art and atmosphere as Alien 1 fan i love what they did visually, but game design department ruined art department work. I would rather watch this game as montaged CGI movie, than would play again and deal with all of that annoying bullcrap, and especially broken stealth sequences.

Dear Creative Assembly and SEGA, please hire Clint Hocking (Nothing) - creative director of Far Cry 2 and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, let him redesign AI behavior, UI and other stuff, and make with him trully immersiv and well designed in terms of stealth remastered directors cut version of game, so that Alien Isolation would not be waste of your effort and our time.",

This is one long journey into an abyss which you cant wait to be over and at the same time you dont want it to end. The game left such a lasting impression on me that I brought the movie Alien on DVD the following day I completed it which got me back into the Aliens 'world' in general i.e. I purchased the lacklustre albeit fun Colonial Marines and AvP. From watching Ridley Scotts classic - this game is an INCREDIBLE homage to the movies, from the white corridor doors, the music and even the way the vents twist like circular blades when opening.   The atmosphere is so punishing I can rememeber running to the lift in Seegson Communications on my second playthrough and feeling an odd sensation in my mouth - it had gone dry from anxiety. Thats the physical effect it left on my body along with sweaty palms, face and an increased heartrate. Never in gaming history will you feel so ♥♥♥♥ING relieved to find a telephone booth to save your game - the sense of achievement is on par with completing your driving test or some other rotten exam.   Pros Chilling atmosphere via lighting, ambience and mood Super menacing opponents i.e. synthetic androids and paranoid humans. The android white eyes will haunt you.  Long playthrough Oh yes... the quite simply indescribable alien in all its feral magnificence. You will both admire and loath its purity.... Almost perfect homage to the source material  Cons AI let down at times  Some long moments between save points Indeed the game does go on a little towards the end including an odd moment at the denoument.

My only gripes are the overly aggressive unintelligent humans (which you have to practically kill to get by them) and a few bugs... delayed audio, no audio, graphical glitches, etc. If you love stealth and the Alien franchise, play this game!

            "review_text": "Scary as hell, ranks up there with Resident Evil 2 and Slender as one of the scariest games of all time. The game is well paced, for the most part, and it doesn't overuse placing the player in scare mode. The timing of the music has to be commended as well, along with the jump scares.  That being said, there are times when you might get killed for cheap reasons, especially on the harder levels of difficulty. Using the motion tracker to determine when you should move beneath an open vent, or move at all, does help. But there will come times when you have to take a chance and move when the enemy is nearby, because there are some rooms/levels where the enemy will always search near where you hide. You will spend a decent portion of the game moving, hiding when you detect a threat (either with motion scanner, by sight, or by sound), rinse and repeat, save for a few moments when you craft a weapon to use on some robot Joes. The cheap kills done on you are not that big of a deal on easy mode, maybe even on normal mode. But on Hard mode and Nightmare, it can get unfair and ridiculous at times.  Hiding doesn't always work, especially on higher difficulties. On those levels, when you are in a locker or other hiding spot, the alien won't just slowly walk past you. If it senses you hiding in their (and it almost always does on Nightmare mode), it will lean in close to see if you are there. You will then have to press a couple buttons to lean back and hold your breath. The longer you hold your breath, the more health you lose. Hold it too long, and you will gasp for air, and then the alien will hear you, open the door, and kill you. So you will be forced to quickly but stealthily maneuver around the hallways and rooms as best as you can, and only use hiding spots when absolutely necessary.  That being said, I played through the game twice, once on easy (14 hours), once on Nightmare (13 hours). Yes, I beat the game on Nightmare mode, and thought the game was worth playing twice.  One last note about Nightmare mode. You are going to need health kits and pipe bombs, and maybe one EMP. And try to save your ammunition for the Joes, except the flamethrower because that weapon is the only thing you'll have to save you against the alien, and flames don't do squat against Joes. I never had to use any other crafting item on that level of difficulty. Be bery careful with what you craft, because crafting materials are very hard to come by on Nightmare mode. And try not to use the flamethrower. While handy, it burns through ammunition very fast on Nightmare mode. But there is a neat trick with the flamethrower. As I ran for an elevator, with the alien charging after me, I pointed the weapon at the alien ready to blast it. But the alien stopped. It flinched, knowing that the flames burn and it doesn't want to get hit by them. It's a very useful bluff tactic to use if you are low on ammo to keep the alien away for just another couple seconds, just the amount of time needed to get that elevator going.   Brilliant emmersion. A true survival horror gem in an era where most AAA survival horror games get that aspect so wrong (ala Dead Space).",

The lighting, fog effects the sense of dread looming over you while creeping in and out of vents. There are multiple enemies such as androids and scavangers that try to kill you along the way. You almost never feel safe and that's exactly on point with the films.   The stealth gameplay is slow but unnerving, you cannot just lunge at enemies out of the blue. Each task must be handled with caution. However, the game isn't gratuitously unforgiving as some reviewers have complained. If you must, start off on the lowest diffuclty. The enemies are still relentless and tough to beat but you have a fighting chance if you get pinned. Just keep in mind if you use a gun, you may alert the alien. So for all intensive purposes sneak your way past as best as you can. If you are caught, run your ♥♥♥ off.  The true achievement in this game however, is the Alien. Creative Assembly unlike Gearbox are true fans of the franchise and by no means have they deviated from Ridley Scott's original vision of this horrific monster. It can grab you in vents, it can tear you out from under desks and inside footlockers. It's truly the star of the show.   If you've been waiting for THE alien game, the wait is over. BUY THIS.  ",

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation is an odd game. The team at The Creative Assembly built what is probably the most-immersive atmosphere I've seen in a game. It captures, perfectly, the retro 1970s futurism in the original film. CRTs, clunky mechanical keyboards, and plastic greeble abound. And in this world you've got posters, scrawlings, decals, terminals, audio logs, and all manner of things to catch your eye and draw your attention. The lighting, sound design, and level construction are masterfully done and, for about 98% of the game, they remain consistently good and interesting - the entire station rarely loses its sense of menacing claustrophobia and inescapability.  All of that, however, is ruined by the game's single weakest element: the Xenomorph. The alien is, functionally, a mobile Game Over trigger. You have no means of defeating it and, at your best, are only capable of warding it off; even then only for three to ten seconds. So what happens when the alien shows up? You hide. You hide and you wait. Then, once he gets bored and buggers off back into the vents, you can resume the game. This is novel for the first half-dozen times you encounter it, but the gimmick overstays its welcome in short order. This reaches its zenith of irritation and absurdity when you get to segments wherein the alien is set to patrol an area as if it was a security guard. It's ridiculous and slows the game to a crawl. But the alien isn't the only threat on the station, which leads me to the best part of the game:  The (horrifying) synthetics! Combined with the retro-futurism, the synthetics really make the game feel like you got an advance copy of Routine. They're scary from the moment you see them and the fear factor only ramps up as the game goes on. They make the game enjoyable. They're a threat you can usually ignore, but it's immensely satisfying to overwhelm them once you get some firepower. They also have wonderful dialog.  The story is generally ok, but the lengths to which they force Ripley to go get sillier as the game goes on. (Especially at the end.) The voice acting is also acceptable.  In short, if you download a mod to disable the alien, the game's quality will improve significantly. Otherwise, play it on easy just so you don't have to put up with its irritating nonsense.  Completion time will be north of 15 hours, which makes it a fair purchase at $40 or so.",

            "review_text": "It has a few issues but Alien: Isolation stands as one of the best survival horror games in recent years.  The reason Alien: Isolation works so well as a horror game is because it largely uses unscripted horror elements. Sure there are a few scripted jump scarry things but they are few and far between. The jumpscares in this case help elevate the tension rather than being the main horror conceit of the piece. The horror in this title is created near perfectly by the tension in the gameplay, the result of attempting to get from point A to point B while a giant human blender stomps around actively searching for a tasty human nuggets. There are also human and android enemies which aren't too scary in their own right but come with their own sense of dread because dealing with them may mean you will attract the attention of something far worse, plus those android guys are tough as nails to kill. The AI for all the enemies is really ingenous, just when I think I had figured out the the alien or the androids AI enough to trick the game sytems to getting past it they do something the completely surprises me. The humans were always pretty stupid but they more or less act as canon fodder. Dealing with the alien though is always so nerve wracking because you never quite know what you can get away with. I know this may be a sticking point for some but I like the approach that sometimes you can fire a gun and the alien will not be alerted and then sometimes he will be on top of you in like 2 seconds. It creates a great sense of risk and reward to gameplay that immersed me even further into the situations.   The game reminded me a bit of System Shock 2, except with more cowering in the corner, oh wait that's exactly like system shock 2. Also like in SS2, you spend a lot of the game just trying to figure out how to repair the broken down space station so you can get to your objective point, which means you often have to organically search about the environment for things like key codes or key cards to open doors, or use distractions on enemies so you have enough time to cut through a door with a blow torch. This means a lot of sections will probably feel very tedious to some because it will have you get a keycard to open a door, to get in a vent, to get to a room where you can turn on a generator, so that you can power up another door, and so on. But, the tedium never bothered me most of the time because I was completely immersed in nearly every situation.  While the active storytelling, like what you see in cutscenes and diologue, is pretty mediocre, what really shines is the storytelling through environment design. Sevasterpol has got to be one of my favorite sci-fi worlds explored in a video game because of how beautifully crafted it is. I am such a sucker for retrofuturism especially retrofuturism where all the computer systems run on a DOS-like operating system on old green and black crt monitors. The story of Sevasterpol is a more interesting story than Amanda Ripley's and I loved reading about its history through various audio logs and computer database entries like some kind of digital archeologist. The rich environment design is also paired with probably one of the best audio-designs ever put in a game. A great soundtrack paired with incredibly detailed sound effects really contribute to an extremely immersible environment.  Overall, I highly recomend this game. While I will say that it may be a tad over-long for some and the ending goes a little chaotic at the end at least it builds up to that rather than starting the game at chaos and at least it is a game that understands the fragile subtly of genuine horror. I'm just honestly glad this game exists. It may not have perfected everything but it stands as an exception to the samey AAA video game market and really stands out because of it. Lastly, I would definitely recomend that most players play the game on Hard.",

Weapons are great, items are what I would expect from a horror/survival game, and the attention to detail is amazing. I love finding item blueprints, map pieces, etc.   The ease or difficulty that I have while playing depends largly on my ability to scrounge up necessary items, and I find that enjoyable. If I miss something or can't find enough blueprints/items, I have only myself to blame for missing something in a moment of panic. This is a real-life scenario that many can relate to (missing something while panicked, I mean) making it feel that much more real.  Also, the music in this game makes the environment terrifying as ♥♥♥♥. I played with the music off for about 10 minutes and found that it ruined the game. 100/100 for the manner in which the music is woven into the gameplay.  I do feel like there is one part of the gameplay that I'm having a problem with. It seems if I don't take the EXACT path that the game wants, an alien shows up and slaughers me.   I realize that this game is very linear. VERY. VERY. LINEAR. But, at the same time, if I am given the option to go through a floor vent, wall vent, or walk through the room, I should be able to do any of the three (as long as there is not an alien in the middle of the room that I cannot avoid). But I keep finding that, when given the choice of which path to take, if I do not take the 'correct' path, I die.  I'm not sure if this is coincidence or maybe I'm just having bad luck, but that is really my only complaint. Well, I guess that and the fact that some save points are very far away from each other, while others are found on the floor above or below. Why would I need a save station upstairs when there is one downstairs around the corner in a room? And others (a couple in the beginning) require me to trek quite a ways before being allowed to save.   Either way, high five to SEGA for this. Let's see more titles like this one and less like Sonic Boom.   Overall, a wonderful title for the price I paid. 9/10   P. S. And, seriously, SEGA, please stop making horrible Sonic games.",

Once it started to realise the fire didn't do very much damage to it and that I didn't pursue it once it retreated, it decided to trick me into thinking it was scared, then circled around and took me down. The best way to describe the AI is it's a simulation. It will be turned on in most of the sections of the game, but not always. The trick is knowing when and where you should be careful - but you should really be careful all the time.  There are issues with some animations, and the gameplay may not be for everyone. As a fan of slow tension building horror and stealth gameplay, I very much enjoyed it.  There have been some complaints that the length of the game is an issue - personally I didn't think so. The last 30min of gameplay are a little bit ridiculous and feel like a broken section of the game that got tacked on in order to have the player end up in a certain area for a cutscene to play out. But this doesn't at all diminish the entire experience.  At the end of the day this won't be a game for everyone... but it is a great achievement non the less.",

The first time people really had the crap scared out of them in a movie that takes place in space. Like I said Iconic. If you remember seeing that movie for the first time, that is what this game is like. I'm glad they waited 30+ years to make a game that rivals the original movie. The technology in video games has progressed to a point that storytelling in video games is now an art.  This is remeniscent of the alien experience in the basement of the trocadero in London. This is where you run through basically a combination of this game and Aliens. Scariest thing is not being able to fully see the alien and having your mind come up with the details. There was one point in the game I died about 15 times and jumped every single time. The sound is phenomenal! hearing all the creeks and groans of the ship, or was it something else? The music builds, it crescendos, the footsteps and the cursed blip, where do you go, RUN!!  This game has been thouroughly enjoyable. I'll finish the game then looking forward to playing as the original Nostromo crew, and Ellen Ripley herself!  So completely emersive! 9/10",

Iv played around 8 hours even though steam says 3, it forgot my offline playtime.  They really nailed the atmosphere and look and feel of Alien.    TLDR: Play it on Hard, at night with the lights off and a headset. Embrace the anxiety! You aren't even safe while saving. If you like Alien you will love this game.  The sound design makes you feel like you are playing the movie! Environment sounds and music on top of Ripley saying things now and again and breathing heavily and audible distress when the alien is about to find you does wonders for immersion. The Alien footsteps and sound effecst fuel you anxiety.  9/10 for sound.   Graphics wise, the only thing I can complain about is recuring/limited decals/textures and simple shaders on ceiling details . General gamers wont notice so its no problem. The eye level props look great. Ripley herself looks great - best female single player character since HL2 Alex imo :) There are a few animation issues with jaw movement but again dont think it will be that noticable. Particle effecst look really good as well.  8/10 on visuals.  Gameplay is just awesome. Really love the ways they make you interact with the world - hacking, breaking locks, accessing terminals, punching in codes, rewiring station installations, accessing vents. It can all be a positive and a negetive to your survival. You can get killed while accessing things, even saving.   The Alien itself has good AI, i've had it lurk around areas where it knows i am still hiding. Got to a point where it eventually pulled me out of a wall cabinet and killed me. Saw me using lean while under a medical bed and charged and killed me. Seems like it is much more intelligent &amp; persistant on Hard than the other difficulties. 9/10 gameplay  I've been playing at night with lights off and surround headset on Hard - it's been an anixety and thrilling ride so far. First few deaths gave me goose flesh. Even now that i can see it coming and used to dying it still makes you curse out loud lol...",

I can't say the game will have much replay value, so do what I didn't in my pl;aythrough: use good directional headphones or surroundsound for the best experience. A caveat: you really need to like survival horror/stealh games to enjoy this. If you want to get through every section in only a few attempts you will probably not like the punishment this game can deal out.

Almost embarrassingly thrilling to discover voice-notes recorded by the original cast later in the game too. It completely immerses you in the Alien/Nostromo universe. Where it falls down for me is in mechanics - there seem to be very limited options for tackling the various adversaries you'll encounter, and while that fits in with the overall concept of the game and its vulnerable, human protagonist, it means that gameplay itself can become a faintly tedious creep-hide-creep-hide experience. Perhaps I approached it in the wrong way, expecting to be able to tackle an area with a combination of stealth and action - this game is not as flexible as say, Dishonored. Having said that, it does deliver in the tension department - hiding in a locker, drawing back and holding your breath (in game, and in real life!) when the Alien is right outside the door is just one example.  I've just finished the main story, have yet to try the other game modes and the DLC (a bit annoyed that the Season Pass doesn't include all of it, unlike Season Passes I've bought for other games), so will be going back to it, but I think I'm unlikely to replay the original game right through again. Even having said all this, the best Alien game I've ever played (and I go all the way back to 'Aliens' on the ZX Spectrum!). Should mention the game seemed rather crash-prone on my normally reliable system, seems to have settled down after a recent large update but for a time it was impossible to get it to even get past the loading video without crashing to the desktop, but the following day it would work again.",

It leans heavily, and successfully, on cues from the movie. It comes very close to breaching the barrier between video games and art   Cons  It does get Frustrating and repetitive, they were moments where I was pretty sure I didn't provoke the alien to appear by noise or by scripted event  Some animations can be cancelled and some can't, I wasn't able to cancel what I was doing(blowtorch) to run and hide  You're not able to lock doors or vents(the ones you crawl through), would of added more suspense where the Alien was trying to break into the room you're in or not bother and appear on the other aside from a ceiling vent  Some Doors open by proxy, this is bad when you're trying to hide inside said room, some hiding spots are by these doors or you have to pass by one, only to open it inadvently attract attention -_- ",

Cons: I find some gameplay flaws in this game and they are pretty annoying. The main problem is that you don't understand what to do to correctly hide from alien and what you did wrong when he catches you. For example, you are given a flash bomb. Will it scary or attract alien? There are rewire panels that can be used to trigger some sound in another corner of the room to attract alien, but sometimes when I activated it, alien crawled out of ventilation near me and killed me. Also in-game facial animations are bad, they are like Warcraft |||, of World of Warcraft – just randomly talking heads.  So, there are a lot of efforts put in the game and a lot of things are made very, very good. But the main aspect of the game – your hide-and-seek game with the alien is done not so good.  But! Previously I didn't reccomend this game, but now I changed my mind when played it in Oculus Rift. It's done super-amazing! The integration of Oculus isn't just simple viewing! You can lean over the corners with Oculus Rift by your actual head movement (standard controls of leaning are disabled). Also, when you are hiding in the locker, you can move your head to see more clearly through the slits. This is impossible to do with just oreintation when using mouse. And the first cinematic when you face alien scared ♥♥♥♥ out of me. I almost couldn't breath in reality. So, this game is a must-have for all Oculus owners. And who are not, should wait and play it again, when Oculus Rift finally gets to market.",

            "review_text": "The main thing you can say about this game is that what it set out to do, be a survival/stealth horror hybrid, it accomplishes magnificently. The tension in this game ranges from a constant feeling of oppression knowing that you are one encounter away from having your face impaled on the Aliens mini mouth to terror as you round a corner, only to come face to face with your xenomorphic nemesis.   The best aspect of the game is undoubtedly the Alien (alien?) as its intelligent and dynamic AI constantly searches for you, noticing the slightest bit of noise you make and unlike similar games where you can only evade an invincible enemy you can't just camp down in a locker till you feel safe, the longer you stay in one spot the more the Alien begins to home in on you. The Alien just doesn't act intelligently it also looks and sounds amazing; from the slimy texture of its skin to its reptilian movements and hisses it inspires a sense of revulsion in the player. Its sound effects aren't just for show either, they are a key part of gameplay as often you will be relying on audio ques to figure out what the Alien is doing.   Sevastopol doesn't look as good as the Alien however. By no means does Sevastopol look bad, I'd actually consider it a fair bit above average it terms of graphics, it is however a kind of repetitive environment. While the game did elect to base its art style on the original Alien movie which was filled with long white corridors and old timey computers some jazzing up of the environment would have improved the already good looking environment. As previously mentioned- sound plays an important role in this game so pay attention to what you can hear around you. The sound is very well meshed with the environment from the futuristic door opening sound to the mood music when you are being chased by enemies. Sound can also both save you from the Alien and you get you killed by it. Enemy humans who would otherwise be a serious threat to you can bring the Alien down on themselves with their gunshots just as hard as they bring it down on you. On the other hand, don't go sprinting around and shooting your weapon often. The Alien WILL hear it.  The gameplay mechanics are similar to many other survival/stealth horror games except that crafting and accessing computers, hacking, opening doors and pausing doors does not pause the events of the game (getting impaled on the Aliens tail for the first time while hacking a computer is a bit of a shock). The stealth, noise and detection mechanics are top notch. Different enemies detect you in different ways; the Alien seems to notice your movement more than anything so sometimes staying put and hoping the AI shows mercy on you is better than trying to run. Humans on the other hand will see you when you are in light but you can creep around the darkness and they won't see it. Your motion detector plays an important role in all the stealth mechanics as it allows you to see moving (NOT STATIONARY ;) ) NPCs but doesn't give you any indication of what is between you and them (having a wall between you is far better than been at opposite ends of an open corridor where the Alien is concerned) as well as generating noise when you are using it.   Saving can also only be done at various save points and the game autosaves a few times as well. The main issue is that you only have 1 save file, you can access your current save file, the one previous and the save file for the start of each mission. The game will warn you when the Alien or other enemies are around before you save but it is possible to save game at a point where death is unavoidable, in this scenario you can lose some progress (but thanks to mission saves you won't have your game destroyed). You can craft many useful items in the game which let you do cool things such as generate noise at a location to lure the Alien (good for clearing out areas of enemy humans), EMPS to stun androids and many other items. While crafted items are fun to use and useful, many of the components are scarce and since loot in containers is randomly generated in this game you are slightly at the mercy of RNGjesus when it comes to crafting.  The story is well developed and is obviously inspired by the plot of the original cult classic movie. It does however seem a little contrived occasionally when a Deus Ex Machina appears to progress the plot ('Dammit the door won't open for some reason... Your trapped!') other than those occasions the narrative is very enjoyable. You can also find out about the backstory behind Sevastopol and its inhabitants if you are willing to hunt around for computer files, audio logs and ID cards.   Overall the pros and cons are   Pros + Alien AI, looks and sound are amazing + Environment fits in very well with the movie + The player is under constant tension when the Alien is hunting + Stealth mechanics are very well developed and executed + The integration of sound effects into the game is very nice + A challenging experience that will appeal to fans of survival horror and stealth + A usually engaging story  Cons - Background environment can get a little repetitive - Save system can get you frustrated at times if you lose some progress to the Alien AI finding you - Random loot generation can be annoying if you are missing a key component to an item because the odds went against you and the item didn't spawn (PLS add more Injectors Sega) - Sometimes the storyline can feel a little forced  I'd give this game a solid 80/100. It’s very engaging and lots of fun if you like Survival Horror and Stealth or want to get into those genres. Even if you don't like those genres this game is definitely a buy if you see it on sale.",

The Alien is the main point of this game but it is not the only threat, Androids that will find you no matter where you hide, gas leaks and humans just trying to make about thier day.  I have only scratched the surface of Alien: Isolation and im already playing 10 hours at a time.  I want to touch on a cupple things that people have been saying about this Alien game to put you at ease.  -Too long Alien: Isolation is long but this is good, Alien: Isolation needs alot of time to explain the story in depth and to make you love charecters just to kill them off. But the people who say this dont pay for the game, they are given it to reveiw but not pay for it... when you pay for this game it does not seem like this as much.  -Too much hiding from the Alien THE GAME IS CALLED Alien: Isolation WHAT DO YOU EXPECT  -Repeditive Yes it is repeditive, BUT. but this is also good, you have to time to try ways of bypassing the Alien or finding new blueprints to build new devices to kill, stun or distract.  Alien: Isolation is by far the best horror game of this generation thats why im giving it a 9.5/10 marking it down for the shere dickiness of people not beeing able to do stuff for them selfs i will give you an example  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++SPOILER+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  In one of the levels you are going to get a trumar kit for your injured friend, you spend about 2 hours in real time to find it.. within these 2 hours you are dodgeing an alien, doing something for someone for him just to die and not return his part of the bargan and retracing you steps while a whole bunch of androids hit you over and over.. when you get back you find the air space marshals there (the space police) you have a chat and talk about needing to get somewhere but the trains are down so someone needs to go and fix it, since everyone else cant do crap they send you saying 'i guess your the only one who can do it' spend another hour fixing it to come back to them gone and haing to deal with some humans after wasting you bullets on one andriod (it takes about 7-8 bullets) ",

            "review_text": "I would highly recommend this game to others, especially if you've seen the original Alien movie when it came out. The level of nostalgia this game brings is through the roof, and the sheer horror of surviving versus an unpredictable AI foe is something that I've been missing in games. There are one or 2 points in the game where it does drag, but otherwise it's a nonstop thrill ride.   My first playthrough was on Normal, and despite watch some others stream this on Twitch, I was caught by surprise many times by the Alien. I'd recommend this difficulty for most players on their first time; then either Easy on a following playthrough to get more of the story experience, or Hard if you're an outright masochist.  I haven't played the Crew Expendable DLC yet as of this review, but as the base game by itself, it is more than worth the money.  Ratings: ------------ Graphics: 10/10  - Looks Beautiful, incredibly well-optimized for PC. The detail they put in to remake the 1970's version of future spaceships/stations in the Alien movie is phenomenal.  Sound: 9/10 - The mood of the game couldn't have been much more   Controls: 8/10  - Sometimes I ended up fighting with the inventory to get the right sub-weapon, which did get me killed a few times. The controls to activate some doors/items did seem awkward. Weapon combat was very straightforward thankfully  Story: 9/10 - Fit perfectly as a gap between Alien and Aliens, although the Working Joe androids became rather tedious the longer the game went on.  Overall: 9/10 - Very solid game, one of the most enjoyable games I've played after accounting for all the deaths I had.",

Included among them are the likes of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, The Last Of Us, Dead Space, Clocktower, etc. and I can honestly say no other game has actually caused as much fear and tension as this game. There is something about Alien: Isolation that makes you feel like you're constantly being stalked even in the bits where you aren't. That's where this game prevails, the tension that it builds is uncanny. I feel that's why it succeeds where so many other horror games fail, it understands that gore is not terrifying. It's the unknown that is terrifying, the ambience.  I can only say that if you play this game, which I highly recommend you do, that you take breaks after a few hours of play. This game stressed me out so much that I had bloodshot eyes after one gaming session and while I was laying down attempting to sleep I was hyper alert to all sounds around me. All things considered though this is more than a game, it's a visceral experience that any fan of the Alien series and survival horror games in general should experience.",

Each time you think you've got a chance for a breather, you're running for your like again. Took me nearly 40 hours total to complete the game on hard difficulty setting. I've seen some videos of other people playing Alien Isolation in normal mode, and when I compare it to hard, the two is very noticable. If you want to be running for your life the entire time in the game, play on the hard setting. If you play on anything less than that, the Alien/Droids/Humans don't give you that rush of being chased or hunted and you'll definitely get your monies worth on the hardest setting! Really loved this game and hope to see more 'Alien,' titles made this way. Any other Alien games were just horrible, this game will be my all time favorite survivor horror game for a long time. The game looks amazing, the grahpics look amazing, the fire and enviornmental effects are awesome. There are points where you're sneaking around and BAM! Something happens and startles you. There were a quite a few instances where the game scared the crap out of me and I'm here yelling for my life in-game! lol There are plenty of levels to keep you busy and you will die enough times due to your not being careful. There are numerous save points, thank goodness because there are some parts that just seem too unbearable to go through again, either the level is too creepy or you're freaked out by the chance of something coming after you in certain areas. I'd recommend this game to my friends for sure. Can't wait to see if there's more titles coming from this developer from this series, hopefully where the Colonial Marines are going to be a playable character.

Firstly, the graphics, sounds and atmosphere in the game are absolutely incredible. Secondly, the game is so reminiscent of the 1979 movie with the lore, the design, the voice acting and the eerie suspense about it.  While playing I was always looking over my shoulder, slowly peeking around corners, hoping that somehow I could escape without falling victim to a brutal alien attack. Despite being able to collect and craft a limited amount of useful items, you soon find that you can't rely on items or weapons to survive. Often it's better to hide and move around quietly. I found myself focusing more on what I could hear rather than what I could actually see in order to survive as well.   It has to be said, the sound in this game is creepy. There are so many bleeps, clicks, hisses and whirs that can be recognized from the movie. The music, the chilling sense of silence, the feint engine hum and creaking of the ship only helped to further the suspense through-out the game. None of the other ALIEN games are quite like this one. I'm so glad I bought this game because I actually can't think of any other game in the survival horror genre that does it for me quite like Alien: Isolation. Heck, even Ridley Scott would be impressed with this level of production.  With all that said, I'm not sure how much replay value you could get out of a game like this. I understand there is DLC content, but once you have completed it on the hardest difficulty, what else is there to do? I really hope to see a sequel, maybe based around the 2nd ALIENS movie. I would love to see some pulse rifle action, especially the pulse rifle sound, I love the sound from the movies especially when it is incorporated into the game. Remember when Vasquez decided to go against direct orders and screams 'LETS ROCK...', followed by a hailstorm of bullets. Epic.  If they were to make a sequel I just hope it's done in a similar manner to Alien: Isolation. We don't need infinite ammo, grenades and flamethrowers to have an epic and immersive experience. We don't always need to feel like superheroes to make us feel like we are enjoying a great game, we can still greatly enjoy the survival horror experience by being made to feel as human as possible in such a hostile alien environment. This concept, Alien: Isolation does perfectly.  If you enjoyed the movies, you will love this game.  10/10, good job on making a great game.  Money well spent.",

            "review_text": "Alien: Isolation’s authentic presentation, solid gameplay mechanics, and interesting story all work together to create a truly terrifying and stressful experience that lives up to the tension and atmosphere of the original Ridley Scott film, Alien (1979).  The game grips the player in the beginning with its accurate representation of the film’s environment and technology. Everything from the industrial quality of the Sevastopol station that looks like its bursting at the seams, to the “futuristic” envision of its computers from the perspective of the 1970’s. It’s a game where nothing is out of place. Everything that was needed was utilized properly in order to make the station feel real. It keeps the player immersed and helps tell the story. The sound design and music help with this as well and it makes the station come alive with a lot of clanks, thumping from inside the walls, the beeping from computers and lab dashboards, and an incredibly annoying drinking bird toy that sounds like the Xenomorph(Alien) hissing. All of this is done to provide a strong framework for the actual gameplay.  The gameplay is pretty simple: If enemies appear, hide and try to find the shortest and safest path to the objective without being seen. Saving in the game is based around a checkpoint system in the form of old telephones attached to the walls. Their placement is fairly sporadic so it adds to the tension because I wasn’t sure of where the next save point would be. Unfortunately the flip side of this is reaching areas where 20-30 minutes can go by without encountering the next save point, and dying during these moments can set the player back quite a bit. Craft able explosives and noisemakers can be thrown across the room (or dropped as a proximity trap) to distract any potential threats. However, beyond the noisemaker I never really found a use for the other explosives. Weapons are gathered over the course of the game, but it’s made pretty clear that they are a last resort, because combat attracts unwanted attention of the worst kind.   The game really hits its stride when the Xenomorph comes into play, and the reason for this is its “unpredictable AI”, because I was forced to approach each situation differently. Sometimes I found myself just hiding in a locker and waiting for the Alien to lose interest, other times I was forced to move inch by inch in plain view hoping the Alien didn’t get the urge to turn towards me and charge from the other side of the table. That’s what makes the Alien so terrifying, not because it relies on jump scares and just randomly appears out of nowhere to go “boo!” No, it’s because the Alien is a constant presence looming over Amanda Ripley’s head. I spent the majority of the game just listening to it crawling through the airshafts in the wall next to me, while my eyes were glued to the motion tracker and only glancing up every 10 seconds to check for the nearest hiding spot in case I attracted the Xenomorph’s attention.   Unfortunately, there’s a 3-4 hour no-Alien period in the mid-late game and the plot hands itself over to the Androids. This is the weakest part of the game because it ventures more into action territory and the Androids are more of a nuisance than anything. From a story perspective it makes sense why this part needs to happen, as it allows the player to take a breather before the final stretch which is easily the most terrifying and challenging part of the game. However, the length of this plot detour could of easily have been cut in ½ while still keeping the story aspect of it intact.    The last leg of the game, while exciting, does suffer from a feeling of dragging the player through the mud. There’s even a point in the last 5 minutes where it pulls Amanda Ripley back from the finish line, just to make the player run that similar path again for no reason whatsoever. As to the ending itself, without spoiling anything all I can say is “could be better, could be worse” and does feel more like sequel-baiting than anything else. In that regard I’m fine with it, but sequels to horror games run into the risk of trying to mimic the first and falling flat, or abandoning the horror aspect and the franchise just becomes another generic action game with horror elements (ex: every Alien game prior to this one).   So while the final 5-6 hours has its share of highs and lows, Alien: Isolation is in my mind not only the best Alien game today that finally does justice to the original film, but I would say it set the same bar for survival horror that Arkham Asylum had set for the superhero genre in video games.",

            "review_text": "Alien Isolation is a stealth game. I wasn't into sci-fi shooters and I'd read a few bad things about other 'alien' games so this purchase was a leap of faith. I'm glad I bought it. The graphics are great, nice retro for all us over 40, with a look of the original movie. The mission starts with ominous overtones and quickly descends into a survival game, using stealth to get one from A to B..and back to A when you've got lost using that mini-map. Frustrating and hard on 'hard' but why have it easy? I've spent 30 minutes in a darkened corridor with a synthetic looking right at me, only to move off 4 to 5 minutes later. Very intense; not because any game is actually scary, but because of the whole look of the game and the sound-effects are very well done. The creature itself will appear at certain times and definitely when you run or make too much noise. It's quick and you're dead. The only thing one can do is hide and sometimes (when in a locker) not even breathe. Speaking of which, can she bang those locker doors any louder?! :)  I'm only into the third mission but I'm thoroughly looking forward to working out how I can get around the ship with the least deaths. I'm glad it's going to be a long game - that's what we pay for. Don't expect to shoot, stab or blast your way out of trouble in this game, as the synthetics are hard to kill and trying will make a lot of noise. You can get through the game not killing anyone, which is good. It makes 'Dishonoured' look like child's play. I hope for a sequel, even longer, even harder. Well done to the makers, 'Alien' finally got the game it deserved.",

            "review_text": "Alright, i think i need to make some disclaimers befor i go on. 1-Im a huge fan of the Alien films (yes, all of them) 2-I have never been a fan of games like Slenderman (Although i am interested in checking out Outlast and the first Amnesia) 3 And this is my first review.  Now as a fan of the Alien films i ♥♥♥♥ing loved this game. Also i think i should warn people before playing this game that it is not for everyone. I have seen some reviews (on some gaming sites) that have slammed this game and i'm seeing a trend for why some dislike it. Now like the original film its all about the atmosfera, musical score and the building of tension. If you need instant gratification then this game is not for you. This game will require patience and time like the original film. Also even though there are guns and you can shoot stuff this is NOT a action 'shoot'em up' game. Actually unless you're surrounded by upgraded Working Joes and you have the shotgun or the built gun and you haven't saved in like an hour just... Dont even bother. DAMN IT! The revolver looks so cool but it's a trap, A TRAP I TELL YOU! Oh, and did i already say there will be spoilers in this? Well... TOO LATE!  As i said before as a fan of the films i think this game is fantastic. The atmosphere, the lighting, the overall retro 70's future look are all just perfect. Plus i can run this baby on max setting without much of a problem and my computer is not worth 2000$ so crank them graphics up. And overall i enjoyed the story and the acting (even though outside of cutscenes the lip syncing is not so good) very much. What this game add to the mythos of the Alien universe is quite allot and i thank them for it. And all of the little touches here and there for fans such as myself was a huge plus. Such as later on in the game the Working Joes don't just go berserk they start actively hunting and killing people. So in that level you find a man that was killed by one of the androids with a rolled up magazine shoved down his throat which anyone the remembers the first Alien film will knows what that is directly referencing.  Overall the gameplay is good but like i said BEWARE OF TRAPS! and what i mean by that is you are given a revolver(which looks awesome by the way) but using it almost always gets you killed. I only found about a handful of times where i was forced to us stuff like the revolver, shotgun and the built gun So you can most of the time either try to avoid conflict with the humans that are scared shitles and willing to let off some bullets your way if it will make sure they live a second longer (which most of the time it won't). Or the psychopathic Working Joes that want to 'help you' by either choking you to death or smashing your skull in. Or you can do what i did many times was let the Alien deal with some of the problems such as them pesky humans. Although it never so well with the andrians but hey, a man can dream. Wait... Have i written this much and never even talked about the Alien yet?   I'll say this. From the first moment i saw the damn thing come out of a vent my palms get right sweaty and my ♥♥♥♥ closed like a cigar cutter. Playing this game can be ♥♥♥♥ing stressful so i personally played this game in two to three hour spurts. But hey, maybe i'm just a ♥♥♥♥♥ but thats how i did it. But to the Alien, it is truly phenomenal. Not just how it looks but how it acts. I had the damn thing more than once outright trick me or flank me but later on you can get into a rhythm where you can sometimes get an idea of what it will do next (sometimes anyways). It sometimes can truly feel alive and like its messing with you. Now one thing about it is that you CAN NOT KILL IT! At all. Only fire will make it run and hide for a short time. So when you first get the Flamethrower you feel some damn empowered but ill tell you that feeling do last for long. Also one of the few problems i had with the game is that latter on you do come across MORE THAN ONE ALINE! YA! I know. So it bothered me that even though it's way later on in the game and you have some ballin' weapons you still can't kill any of them. Now i can understand that you would need an high powered rifle to kill one of those thing and how lower caliber weapons would just ♥♥♥♥ it off. But i'm damn sure the shotgun or the built gun should do SOME damage or at least make the damn beat run off for a bit but it never worked for me. If it is possible to make one of them run with something besides fire then im sorry i inserted this part then. Although i was a little disappointed that the alien does not climb on the walls after you like something's out of the second film Aliens but thats just a silly little thing i realised. But when you do see that thing scandal after you're in a vent im damn sure you will ♥♥♥♥ your pants. OH! And do you like to watch yourself die? Do you enjoy being skull♥♥♥♥ed by a xenomorphing 8 foot tall alien with either its tale or tung? Oh glob! I hope those are its tale and tung... Anyways, ya... Get used to dying cuz it's gonna happen and happen often.   How reading some other stuff people have done about this game is you hear the same to things. Save all the time and do not run ever. Now for the first part i for sure agree. Save and do it often. But remember you are not save when saving. Hell, you have to wait some time for the save console to even be usable again so that can make some tension. For the second part i have to pertest. There has been about three or four situation where running saved my ♥♥♥. Now i do not recommend it for everyone but if you want to be a rebel like me then i say go for it.  Now going back to the gameplay and the character you play as, i actually like how you're not some awesome ninja or some badass space marine but just some mechanic. Ripply is no hero and i like how some of the mechanics reflect who she is. Like how you can just build random but useful stuff on the fly since she is an engineer. I like it how she can't run that fast or parcore over stuff or even use guns that will. I think the mechanics directly demonstrate her character. Not a warrior, not a ninja but just some woman in a really bad situation. So to me even though i found some of the stealth mechanic to be lacking compared to other fps/stealth games i can see how it was done for a reason. And the stealth mechanics that are there seem to be there just to build even more tension and suspense. Such as poking your head around the corner or trying to get a better view when you're hiding in a locker. And the beeping of your tracker as the thing gets closer and closer. All of it is done for a reason and i see why. Now i'm not say the game mechanically or otherwise is perfect, nothing is. I found that sometimes it would just randomly crash or just after loading a game i was unable to interact with any object (which only happened once but still). Or like i said before about the lipsyncing being kind of off almost all of the time when someone talked. And also as i already said, this game is not for everyone and i think some of the 'personal' review should be taken with a grain of salt since they say the acting thing i have said and even point out the same problems yet give it a lower score.  Also i think i should talk about how i really disliked the ending. To me it was very unsatisfying and almost anticlimactic. And it just felt like sequel bait to me. But everything leading up to it was really ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. So if you cant tell i really did like this game and i am glad i grabbed it. If you are a fan of Aliens and don't want to play a 'shootem up' game and i think this will be for you.",

Never do you get the feeling that you need to quit the game before going insane, infact it'll make you want to sacrfice work / study and sleep time just so you can play it more. Although Alien: Isolation is supposed to be a horror game, I find much of it more stressful and nerve wrecking then scary. (In a good way) Quite often you'll be given an objective to trigger some sort of mechanism to continue with the story, but you'll have to travel halfway accross the map with an Alien constantly pursuing you, few save points included. The Alien is almost movie like, its ability to go smoothly into vents, walk, and run without looking like some sort of robot is amazing. Although it looks like an Alien, I was hoping for a more clever behavoir, such as; the ability to learn from its mistakes. For example, I would be limited to the amount of times I can hide in a locker before the Alien learns of what I'm doing and goes around tearing all the lockers down to find me, or, if used enough, the Alien wouldn't fall for the old 'noise maker' routine.  The graphics look amazing, you could almost compare them to the series themselves. But, like all games it has its faults, I've noticed an absence of shadows, especially the one that supposed to be cast by the character herself. I installed a custom mod for better reflections, because before most reflections just looked like sanded glass. The amount of intiqruite detail in the spaceship is a large contributing factor of the immersiveness of the game, you might even think that you're in real life. I would definently recommend this game to anyone. :)",

The meagre story (much of which you are responsible for ferretting out from old e-mails and tape recordings bizarrely left laying about) can't sustain the game's ambition to scare the hell out of you, and neither can the wonky gameplay mechanics.  The game is brutally, punishingly difficult, but it's not a  Dark Souls  kind of challenge; in that game series, you slowly learn to stop sucking, and your reward for playing better is dying less. In AI, the deck is by design so heavily stacked against you that it often doesn't matter what you do. With its old-school save-point system, this often means a wasted 30 minutes of playtime, sending you far enough back that rage-quitting seems a more pleasant option.  The Alien's programming is an impressive piece of work, and it often succeeds in making you feel hunted and vulnerable. Unfortunately, Creative Assembly have hoisted themselves on their own petard with the Alien, endowing it with magic powers of teleportation and the ability to see through walls. Giving the Alien free reign of the Sevastopol to hunt and kill you with impunity mostly works, but after your first few physics-defying deaths, the absurdity of what the Alien can do takes away a lot of the tension.  Case in point: while hiding in a locker from the Alien, I am prompted to press a key to lean back, and press another key to hold my breath. After a few seconds of breath-holding, the screen pulses red around the edges, as if Ripley is suffocating. The Alien sniffs around the locker, apparently decides I'm not there, then turns around and  walks out of the room and down the corridor . I can hear its footsteps getting fainter. Relieved, I resume breathing...only to have the Alien materialize out of nowhere, rip the locker door off, and tear me to shreds. It's absurd. It's frustrating. It appears to be totally random, and 'playing better' won't help me avoid it.   Perhaps some will argue that is part of the appeal: instant, violent death out of nowhere, when you least expect it. I'm not going to call anyone who feels that way wrong. I will say it's not for everybody.  Creative Assembly is to be commended for their superb art and sound direction, and obvious respect for the Alien universe. They took a bold step casting their protagonist as essentially helpless, and AI is, despite its flaws, a unique gameplay experience. However, wonky mechanics and obtuse AI combined with brutal difficulty and far too thin a story make  Isolation  a massive missed opportunity.",

The elements of fight vs flight are very well balanced and never leave you bored, or at least not me. All of the elements of the game, be they the sparse moments where you have to shoot, or the simply hiding for you life as you try to devise a plan to get through this terrifying station, come together so well its mind blowing. Finnaly an alien game that makes up for every botched attempt to make a game with the aliens in it.",

AAA title in my opinion but limited replayability. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it. Unless of course like many you are too scared to play it(I myself have been like NOPE screw this alt+F4) at times while breathing heavily cowering in a cubby hole or under a desk hopeing the alien doesn't see me...  Also it is a stealth and survival horror game first and foremost, you cannot kill the alien only hide run or blow flames in its face to get it off your back for a few.  You will die, many many many times, but it's worth it.   ",

More content than I had any reason to expect, and the game very effectively simulates what it would be like to be first-person in an Alien movie. Crafting is fast and simple and the pacing of the game is such that you'll still be worried if you have enough time to craft without being caught. It is a TRUE stealth game -- large portions of the game you are doing your best to sneak through the environment trying not to raise the awareness of something that is far more perceptive and relentless than you are. The environment is highly reminiscent of the movies, as is the music and atmosphere -- It's overall a work of art in the gaming sense. Some things it does right: air of fear, raises moral quandries of killing people just because they are scared/desperate, issues of whether it is monster, or android, or man that is the scariest of all -- creative objectives, and the story is meaningful and illuminating with regards to the movies and canon material. Overall, very very good game. Only caveat - Tacked-on 'Survivor Mode' and all DLC is extraneous crap... FORGET THE DLC and wait for a sequel! Recommended!",

Honestly except the few times the alien just 'decides' to find your hiding spot this game is excellent! True to the original movie and oozing with fraugh peril this game delivers on its achievements. The NPC decision making ensures that no playthrough is ever the same, sometimes you hide and live while other times you fight back and still gain nothing.

Graphics i thought were really good (played it on 1080p on pc with max settings so don't know how it compares to console versions). Also found few to no rendering or texture problems.

Only real issue i had with the game was the lord of the rings syndrome it seem to suffer from (the ending seemed to drag on and on), if they had streamlined that a little as well as some other areas of the game (ie made it around 10-12 long instead) it would of been the perfect alien game.  Yet to try survivor mode or any of dlc's so plenty more Alien action to keep me entertained  Overall a fantasic Alien game and one of the better horror games I have played in recent years, only really let down by how long it was and how frustratingly hard it was (although i was on hardest difficulty).  Final Score 9/10.",

Beautiful level/set design, 100% faithful to the Shepperton Studios original. The Alien looks brilliant too, H.R.Giger would be proud. I wonder if Ridley Scott has had a look at this game and what his views would be? I completed this game on medium difficulty in 32 hours. Those 32 hours were some of the scariest in my life, creeping, tunneling, crafting in he darkness. The best game I have played in many years since, say Portal 2. Reminds me of the Alien Quake Mod on PC from the mid-nineties (showing my age). All in all, highly recommended. Well done to the software developers for some original and truly unpredictable, stealthy AI from the Star Beast.",

            "review_text": "Let me qualify my recommendation to start: if you're a fan of the Alien franchise who finds the horror genre enjoyable, this game should scratch that itch unlike anything before. If not, maybe you want to read a little more, maybe from me, maybe from some one else.   TL;DR: It has the same kind of atmosphere and building dread that the original film had (which is not for the impatient fans of the horror genre - you're going to have to give it time to break you down). The story is a safe Alien film from what I know, which is a mixed blessing. Minigames are hit or miss in mingling with the survival. Get a controller with vibration and surround capable audio and the immersion factor increases drastically!  ***Of minor note, I had to upgrade my GPU drivers in order to smooth out some issues with the game. If you're having trouble, this is a good first step!  Speaking from a point of view 6 hours into the storyline, I find myself compelled at this time to write a review based on my experience. Let me say, that this game gets my adrenaline going and my heart pounding. I'm the kind of gamer who tends to lose themself in the game, taking on the role of the protagonist - in this case, it means that I am extremely cautious and methodical in my approach to the game.  The atmosphere of this game is an absolutely brutal, slow burning, and nervewracking playthrough. Tension is almost constantly being plucked, and every time I feel comfortable with a decision to move or hide, walking through the next doorway or vent I am immediately confronted by some part of the game (my motion tracker, a sight, a sound, even Ripley coughing or making a remark) that tightens that tension right back up and makes me immediately uncomfortable again. This is exactly what I expect from not just horror games, but the Alien franchise - yes there is the occaisional jump scare, but the majority of the tension arises from a constant build of dread. Each save point feels like a milestone to me, and a brief wave of relief washes over me each time I use one. I absolutely recommend a controller with a vibration function for this game, and surround sound - this is the kind of sensory assault these features were built for!!!  The story is one that I have expected so far, consistent and safe as far as the franchise is concerned. Amanda is generally likable to me, and while her attitude is very reminiscent of Ellen Ripley's characterization, she isn't quite as confident or focused as her mother. It adds to her vulnerability I think, which is exactly what the developers were aiming for in this game. Bravo for making her her own character, but reminding me of what I loved in the movies! The rest of the supporting cast have been kind of 'meh' so far, but the company seems to be acting unusual in many ways, though many of those elements have yet to play out for me.  The minigames and interactivity outside general survival seem a little jagged. I don't think it detracts from the overall experience, and sometimes they're a nice break from constantly being on the defensive. Other times, however, I've found them actually adding to the urgency of situations, so I think they belong overall.",

Once that's done, start steam again and reverify your game cache as shown here: 1. Load Steam 2. From the Library section, right-click on the game and select Properties from the menu. 3. Select the Local files tab and click the ‘VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAMECACHE…’ button. 4. Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes. 5.

It gets a bit drawn out and repetitive on some task towards the end but I still feel as thought It was a great experience and the most scariest game I have come across and best effort in creating an Alien game. If this game was played with a 3D headset then it would be exhaustingly terrifying! The Alien AI is very smart as it never seems repetitive, and because of this you can find yourself expecting the worst to happen almost every moment thought the game. Level design is great, as they suck to the original Alien content, even if some of the retro technology seems implausible it certainly gave that atmosphere of Isolation and sense of timelessness. Music, Epic, gave the game an avalanche of terror knowing you are being pursued by a monstrous forbidding beast. Also you could not go toe to toe with this animal which inevitably meant you are very very venerable and have to adapt by stealth and scavenging elements in order to make a half reasonable weapon which would only mean you have a second chance. For most people these days this can be a problem as they want a game with instant gratification of shooting every living thing in sight and being some supreme hero at the end of it all, sounds great. However I found this approach to a game very refreshing and most of all realistic. Would highly recommend this game if you love Horror and intense atmospheric game play. If you like your games with Rambo’s and Unicorns and all things fluffy, maybe you should of stop reading this a long time ago! Happy Gaming People :-0",

Cons ----- - The human enemies are dire. Their AI is awful and really breaks the immersion of the game. It would have been infinitely better if they had been removed and the only other humans you heard/saw were through glass or on the radio. Honestly I've had moments where I'd sprint right up to 'bad guys' and it takes them 15-20 seconds to react when I'm 3 inches from their face. Randomly some of them don't even acknowledge you at all. - There is basically nothing in the way of tutorials. Even after trying to Google the purpose of the Rewire functions most people online seem unsure or conflicted about what they actually do. A lot of the items and more nuanced mechanics are only explained if you happen to glimpse the right Tool Tip on the loading screen...  Summary ---------- There's nothing out there really like this game and although CA tripped up with a few things you can't argue it's a fantastic bit of stealth gaming, a good story and abrilliant homage to Ridley Scott's movie.  Recommendations ----------------------- - Play it on HARD! The difficulty below that is just dull. - If you get frustrated that you've done the same bit too many times, QUIT! Honestly, come back to it another time and you'll probably breeze through it, this game rewards patience.",

I have been a fan since the very first Resident Evil when the dogs jumped through the hallway windows and scared the living BA-JEEESus! outta me! In fact, I also love me some good horror movies to boot; Alien being one of my favorites. So I had to try this game when it came out. It promised scares like the first Alien movie and was a different kind of 'Alien' game. And what it promised, it delivered like a parasite bursting out of a morbidly obese paunch. This is by-far and bar-none the best horror-survival game I have ever played to date. It really is that good.   New AI was developed for the Alien, that makes it a formidable foe. You can't fight it to start, because it is just too powerful, so you must avoid it. So how do you avoid it? You must be patient and you must listen. This game is visually stunning and is complimented by its sound track . You'll live to hear the franchise musical queues that are scaterred through-out the game. And when you hear the Alien drop down in the room next to you, your blood will run cold. The atmosphere pulls you into this world and the interesting puzzles, and game play keep you interested.   This is the first review I've ever taken the time to write, so think about that.   If you see this game on sale, definitely buy it.   If you were thinking about getting it, DOEET NAO.   Gaming Tips /w Possible spoilers:  - Start out by just crawling to move around. This method of travel is slow, but it'll afford you a lot less aggro-problems. If the Alien doesn't hear you, he won't come looking for you. - Be careful of what your walking on, as some surfaces make more noise than others. - Keep your head up kid; look to the vents you may see drool dripping down O.o - The robots (Working Joes) are really tuff and it makes more sense just to avoid them in the beginning. - The most efficient way to kill a robot; stun it with either a flash-bang and then wack it in the head (5+ times) with your wrench. The gun is only meant for humans. - Don't give up, because eventually you do get a weapon that affects the Alien (scares it away for a bit)",

But unfortunately after around the five-six hour mark for me it became more and more tedious and frustrating. Put simply I ended up either being stressed about being hunted or bored with hiding in lockers and doing the same sort of quests in the same looking corridors. That's a little harsh perhaps and maybe I should have played it at a lower difficulty to have more fun and require less patience (I played on hard).   The first opening hour I was blown away, I really felt I was taking part in my own Alien movie (which by the way, is one of my favourite movies). I also enjoyed learning about the Seegson Corporation, I thought that part of the story was really interesting and their cheap androids quite terrifying. The sound is excellent, the graphics crisp and when the alien makes its first appearance it really is extremely tense indeed (I had to pause the game and actually considered just shutting my PC down! :-).   But alas after that, I just lost interest. I wasn't enjoying myself. I got tired of creeping from one bunch of locked doors to another, hiding in lockers and staring at a motion tracker as the most interesting aspects of the story dwindled away.   I am aware the majority of people don't feel the same way as I and overall the excellent opening hours made it an experience worth my time and money.  7.5/10",

            "review_text": "An exceptional survival horror game, perhaps the best title in its genre to be released so far. A truly harrowing, nerve-breaking and extremely tense experience, which manages to keep your fear alive all throughout and constantly feeds it with new catalysts. Perhaps its strongest point is that you are never actually safe in the game. Whether you are under a desk or hiding in locker, you're still very vulnerable. Its impressive gameplay and extremely realistic (note the paradox) environment make up for its rather shallow storyline and characters.  Since I thoroughly enjoyed this game, you will notice I will try to explain the cons more than I do the pros, since the latter are more obvious.  Pros: +excellent and extremely realistic atmosphere. Having all those buttons around with fancy names really makes you feel like a brainless monkey, as you would expect a good Sci-fi game to do. But, in the same time, it also manages to be pretty intuitive most of the time. +very serious scares and tension +intelligent and perceptive AI  +smart crafting system, which is often the key to survival +intelligent and intuitive gameplay overall: motion tracker, lots of places to hide, terminals to check, systems to reboot, vent system etc +a very well-made sound system, which makes up a lot of the game's atmosphere +lovely graphics, especially in the moments you're looking out into space  Cons: -the story isn't very original or complex. Even though it is tense and interesting most of the time, it's mostly just for the action. -character models are very similar. For a game with such excellent graphics, it's really disappointing to see the lack of detail the characters are condemned to. -a lot of technical objectives, which sometimes require you to go from one place to another without revealing anything significant for the story. At some point, I even forgot what I was there to do. But, as I mentioned previously, the story isn't exactly the game's focus. -some repetitive level design. You may or may not see this as a problem, since, as I said before, Sevastopol station does manage to be very realistic. But most places are pretty hard to tell apart from others and, without the map and the indicators, you'd probably be lost completely.  Overall, I'd say it deserves a 9/10. It is actually one of the best survival horror games I ever got to play.",

            "review_text": "This is the game that true fans of the franchise owe to themselves to play. As has been said over and over, the visuals and atmosphere absolutely nail the look and feel of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic horror/sci-fi film. Taking place on board a run down space station orbiting a gas giant you play as Amanda Ripley, Ellen Ripley's grown up daughter. She has been drawn here because of her ongoing search for the whereabouts of her mother. It seems that the doomed Nostromo's flight recorder has be found and is at Sevastapol station, an outer rim base owned by Seegson Corporation (a low rent competitor to Weyland Yutani).    From the moment you arrive, the immediate sense of dread is like a smothering wet blanket. Throughout the game you will be relentlessly hunted by the malevolent alien as you try to survive and stay one step ahead by any and all means available to you. Making matters worse, the remaining human survivors are generally hostile and tend to shoot first and ask questions later. Add to this the malfunctioning androids, called Working Joes and you have a trifecta of foes to contend with. Then there is the station itself which is old and on the verge of being decommissioned. Sevastapol constantly thwarts you with areas that are unsurmountable and doors that don't work, requiring you to often take alternate routes and find other ways to accomplish goals.   Much has been made of the alien and it's AI. This thing actively hunts you and it's terrifying as you cower in the dark listening to it stomping around and growling. It has finely tuned hearing and will come looking for you if you make noise. If it sees a door opening or closing it will likely come and investigate. As well, the alien can and does use the ventilation ducts to move around so you are never sure as you sneak along darkened corridors whether it will drop out of a ceiling duct ahead or behind you. Fortunately you are given a motion tracker early on that helps you to determine where your enemies are relative to you. You must learn to move quietly and decisively, while remaining malleable with the fluid nature of the situation. You can hide under furniture and inside lockers but sometimes the alien finds you anyway. Save stations will let you save your progress, but they are spread out and death often means having to play areas over again, increasing the tension even more. This is not a run and gun game, and early on you will find that trying to play it that way rewards you with death and death after death.   You have a number of tools at your disposal, like noisemakers and flares to distract the alien, but these will only draw it's attention away from you briefly and if you use them too often it will learn to ignore them. As well, you will be able to make molotovs that will scare the alien off briefly (it hates fire). You can also craft bombs and EMP devices and will find several firearms like a shotgun and a pistol. Those work well against humans and robots, but the noise of gun fire draws the aliens like a moth to a flame. The only weapon that is truly effective against the alien is a flamethrower which you find several chapters into the game. Unfortunately it's fuel burns up quickly and, depending on the difficulty setting, resources can be few and far between. Basically, you never truly feel safe at any time.   The audio design ensures that every creak and rattle of the station keeps you on edge and you will never get used to the sound of the alien crawling around in the ventilation system. Eventually you learn to interpret the different sounds that the alien makes and use it to your advantage but you can never be absolutely sure that your next move is going to be the right one. Many of the sound effects and musical cues are straight out of the 1979 movie making for a thoroughly absorbing soundscape.   The look of the game is just spectacular. Level design is well thought out and the environments are insanely detailed with lighting that is astonishingly realisitic. Over and over again I marvelled at the art direction and how well it matched up to the 1979 film. You can tell that the game designers are huge fans of Alien and it shows. There are numerous nods towards the original movie as you play through that will put a smile on your face. Little things like the drinking birds you find on tables here and there or the authentic looking space suits you see hanging in lockers create a wonderful sense of nostalgia.    Minor gripes: It has been said that the game is too long and I would agree with that statement somewhat. The last few missions contain too many twists and the goal posts keep getting moved further and further back. As well, these latter sections begin to chafe on you as you are required to return to previously cleared areas to activate a generator or throw a switch to open a door or power up machinery somewhere else. It's doesn't spoil the game, but it does begin to feel a bit same-old, same-old towards the end. Add to that a anti-climactic ending that screams for a sequel that we are never likely to get.    Still, this is a marvellous game, obviously make with love. Any fan of the original film or the alien franchise in general should buy it. The designers suggest that the game be played on hard setting, which I did. Resources are much more scarce, you must be more quiet to avoid drawing the aliens attention and the Alien is more omnipresent. If you can endure the entire game on this difficulty setting, you'll be rewarded with the Survivor achievement, something only 5% of players can boast about according to the global statistics. Good luck, youi'll need it...",

Holy ♥♥♥♥.  **SPOLIER ALERT**  You are Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley - the sole survivor of the horror aboard the Nostromo. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation has just found some evidence explaning your mother's disappearance and you are keen to get your hands on it. So you head onto the Sevastopol station, with its previous generation androids, sprawling space visuals, atmospheric retro future tech and a hulking, stalking Xenomorph.  Sevastopol is vast, sparsely populated and entirely eerie. You can feel the titular isolation on board Sevastopol. The survivors have banded together and formed factions in order to, well, survive. You have to maneuver, dodge, kill and run away from the survivors and the androids. Let me be frank, the scariest part of Sevastopol is not the Xenomorph. It's those damn androids. They are silent, entirely without expression and very god damn scary. Did I mention that they are also very hard to kill? Well, until you get the right gear for the job.   Then there's the alien itself. It is an efficient stalker. It learns your weapons, your hiding patterns and the more you use distracting tools, the more desensitized it becomes. That is scary. Until you get your hands on the flamethrower and even after, you continue to realise how under matched you are against this enemy, the perfect hunter.  The graphics are superb. The atmosphere manages to capture and convey the retro-future feel of the Alien movie. There is a film grain filter which may annoy some people, but you can obviously turn it off. Dead bodies feel real, the Alien is gloriously modelled and rendered with high detail textures. It's a visual experience.  The gameplay circles between active stealth and action. Both these elements mix into creating an odd 'survival' gameplay format, which is immensely rewarding. The stalking and sudden appearances of the Alien help in making the somewhat repetitive portions of the game immensely interesting. Hearing the painful death throes of other survivors as the Alien mows into them can be very scary.  The narrative is insanely compelling. Reading emails you find around Sevastopol draws you further into the murky side of the space station. The lack of ethics of mega corporations is a theme that gradually establishes itself into the narrative.  All in all, this is the first horror-survival game that I have truly enjoyed, which is a visual treat and has a compelling, attention holding narrative.  9/10 - would recommend. ",

There is a very interesting storyline, and great characters too. The Alien itself is well animated. It fears fire, and can be momentary stuned shotgun. Graphics are ok.  I can imagine that we can find some cons. Doors do not lock to stop as in Aliens. Vents open, and make noise when you are close to them. Other vents are difficult, and clumsy to open. Highest level difficulty will not record the rooms one has gone thru, (as well as 'updates'). I would also recommend an 'Abort Key', as Alien will stalk you as one performs activities.",

            "review_text": "This is the Alien game you have been waiting for!  For once the Xenomorph is given proper respects as the unstoppable killing machine it is designed to be. You really feel powerless and hopeless in this game, and when that Alien pops out at you and there isn’t a damned thing you can do about it, it will make you panic and feel defeated. I really enjoyed going after mission objectives while playing cat and mouse with the Xeno, and trying to out think it. There are more dangers you will face during your time on Sevastopol Station like malfunctioning androids, and stranded colonists that have lost their minds to fear. The station itself is almost a villain in this game as it dark corridors and dim lighted areas will play tricks on your mind. I can’t tell you how many times I thought the Xeno was after me just to be relieved it was some pipes and boxes. Another thing I like in this game is the crafting system and making use of what small of tools you can use to get yourself out of situations, and of course we cannot forget our dumbed down motion tracker that does not work as well as the ones the Marines have in Aliens but next to using your ears, it’s about the only way to know if you are being hunted.  I don’t normally like survival horror games, and I might be biased as I am an Alien fanboy, but this game is a must play, and I would recommend it to anybody. That does not mean it is a perfect game by any stretch. The one fatal flaw of this game is that it is absolutely frustrating at times. I actually have yet to finish it as I am stuck about 60% through the game, and my desire to go on any longer has faded. For one this is 2015… Why the hell do we have such an ancient save system? I understand the save system was to ramp up the difficulty but that should be a choice of players not a developers. They could have implemented a “hardcore” mode that disabled auto saving and what not. It is absolutely just painful to lose so much progress because of a death, for myself that is almost a deal breaker as it just sucks the fun out of the game. Auto saves please! Hopefully somebody will mod it, until then I am not sure if I will go back, it is just too frustrating.  Flaws aside though, this game was a massive leap forward for Alien franchise games. The atmosphere of the game is the real winner here, the lighting is perfect, fire effects are perfect. It really just looks amazing. Also don’t forget to look out the windows of the space station, the view is amazing! I applaud the Creative Assembly team for a job well done. Hopefully this leads to something greater!",

            "review_text": "In my humble opinion this was last years 'Game of the Year'! It is a stealth/horror game ala Amnesia and Outlast with a few major differences... You are constantly being hunted by the Xenomorph, almost nothing is scripted and your in space (where no one can hear you scream!!!). Now there are small scripted segments to move the story along but for about 85% of the game you are runing/hiding from, and outsmarting an incredibly well crafted monster. The audio (with the exception of the voice acting) is incredible and the lighting is hands down the best I have ever seen in a game period. The Alien 'ai' is really impressive and unpredictable to a point where I stopped getting frustrated about dying and gradually got more and more impressed. Hard to get mad at an enemy when it outsmarts you without feeling cheap. While you can take the offensive strategy with other humans and Working Joes (robots), your only chance with the Alien is to waste resources temporarily causing it to leave or staying invisible. And when it runs away because of your attack you better think of something fast cause it's coming back with an attitude. As an Alien fan this game is also a massive fan service. If you like horror or stealth or the original Alien then this is for you.  9.75/10  Pros:  Lighting Lighting Lighting Unpredictable Xenomorph ai that doesn't feel 'cheap'. Audio Attention to detail staying faithful to the source material. Very few bugs (I experienced none) Game length Story  Cons:  Certain areas (A very small number of them) can feel 'bottlenecked' making progression very difficult due to being forced into a room (Usually to activate a cutscene or something).  Human npc ai can go from impressive to pretty dumb. Voice acting is average at best...  Just as an FYI I did not play this game on my account but another. Hence why I have no hours invested.",

The game is at its best when it's integrating entirely new challenges with its more familiar threats, but that experience is ocassionally undermined when those allegedly 'new' problems can be easily handled with the tactics you've already used many times. It's more interesting when you're forced to tune your strategy to come up with new solutions, and the game doesn't do that nearly enough.  Also, the cutscenes are kind of a drag. I love when the exposition is handled during first-person gameplay, as it really maintains the game's amazing sense of tension. There's a moment in the game where you experience a flashback by playing through a past event, and it's FANTASTIC. It's really telling that this dramatic change in setting and time feels more organic than the blunt transition into a pre-rendered cutscene.  Overall, though, this game is great. I felt the same sense of fear and urgency in the game's final moments as I did during the initial encounter with the alien. The sound design is unparalleled, the art feels innovative and nostalgic at the same time, and playing at the hardest difficulty actually mitigates many of the problems of repetitive gameplay. And if you love Alien as much as I do, you're kind of required to play this game.",

It is also one of the few legitimately suspenseful games I've played. With no weapons powerful enough to destroy the Alien, the player instead has to relay on the use of cover, hiding places, and improvised weapons that can drive the creature off... for a time. I've never before played a game that made me actually sweat in chair with nervous energy as I crept through a level hoping not to get caught, and while there are a few 'jumpscares' in the game, they are effectively used and fit the atmosphere of the game rather that feeling like a cheap contrivance.

I have played enough of these survival horror games to know what im doing. Just for some reason i cannot get past this part. no matter what i do, the alien is always either right behind me. or right in front of me. its really starting to ruin all the fun for me like i had previously",

I’m a fan of the Alien franchise FPS and used to play Aliens vs Predators a lot. This is nothing like that game. Alien Isolation is an atmospheric first person survival, think along the lines of Thief but with more suspense and scare factor. I\\'ve played Amnesia and SOMA, and neither of those titles have anything on Alien Isolation. The blips on your motion sensor, coupled with the freaky narrations from androids as they search for you, gives you shivers. There were a number of times I was physically cringing as I tried to sneak into an air vent to escape. The storyline is solid and there is a community mod available which makes the graphics top notch. I\\'d suggest you play it through on a hard setting as I don\\'t think it’s a title you\\'d play through over and over.  There are a couple of extra levels and challenges you can play after completing the main story, but these are all very short. Overall I was very impressed and thought Alien Isolation was well worth its money. I just hope they do a sequel. ",

Just as in the movie the alien should have been used sparingly. Instead, it got tedious, annoying and lost its scare-factor. I was more intimidated by working Joes and environmental hazard than the alien itself after a while, but even these behaved really weirdly and seemed to be able to look through walls and approach me the moment I got too close to them ignoring how quiet I moved and stayed out of sight.  A few tweaks to the enemy AI and a little less alien presence would have made me recommend this game. The setting is otherwise flawless.",

Never do you get the feeling that you need to quit the game before going insane, infact it'll make you want to sacrfice work / study and sleep time just so you can play it more. Although Alien: Isolation is supposed to be a horror game, I find much of it more stressful and nerve wrecking then scary. (In a good way) Quite often you'll be given an objective to trigger some sort of mechanism to continue with the story, but you'll have to travel halfway accross the map with an Alien constantly pursuing you, few save points included. The Alien is almost movie like, its ability to go smoothly into vents, walk, and run without looking like some sort of robot is amazing. Although it looks like an Alien, I was hoping for a more clever behavoir, such as; the ability to learn from its mistakes. For example, I would be limited to the amount of times I can hide in a locker before the Alien learns of what I'm doing and goes around tearing all the lockers down to find me, or, if used enough, the Alien wouldn't fall for the old 'noise maker' routine.  The graphics look amazing, you could almost compare them to the series themselves. But, like all games it has its faults, I've noticed an absence of shadows, especially the one that supposed to be cast by the character herself. I installed a custom mod for better reflections, because before most reflections just looked like sanded glass. The amount of intiqruite detail in the spaceship is a large contributing factor of the immersiveness of the game, you might even think that you're in real life. I would definently recommend this game to anyone. :)",

It takes me an hour to go through a tiny village in DayZ because I am always careful, slow and quiet. So it was about 10 hours into this game before I was killed by the Alien. Twice. In the same room.   I'd made it to a telephone after scrambling out of my hiding space. The Alien was down the hallway quite a bit, and after sneaking around it in close quarters for an hour and a half I felt comfortable.  I was horribly naive.  I watched Amanda insert her keycard into the phone. The lights went off signifying the game was saving, blinking off one by one. On the last one, I heard a growl and a shadow cast over me, and my stomach dropped. It had found me.  I was ripped away from the phone and thrown onto the ground, where the Alien met me face to face. In a moment, it was over.  It sounds strange, but the death was oddly satisfying. Stealth games aren't much of a challenge to me anymore because of my aforementioned careful playing style. But this game has ripped the comfort and confidence of my skills from me, throwing me into an environment that is fresh, challenging and genuinely terrifying.  I'm not terrified by zombies anymore, in DayZ or any other game. Nor am I terrified by dinosaurs, monsters or other aliens.  But the developers of this game have made me terrified of the Xenomorph. 11/10, would play again.",

Now, that being said, i say this game brings the very essence of what it is the Alien universe: claustrophobic, terrifying, underpower and hopelessness which all you have to survive it's your wits against a creature that represents the antithesis of life. Sure, other horror titles have it's own merits such as Outlast, the indy game Slenderman, the true classic SystemShock 2 and the DeadSpace series, and i'm not speaking just as a fan, but Alien: Isolation truly is a masterpiece, intriguing storyline, well developed passionate characters and the best of what a game engine can deliver, both sound and level design waltz you through the game delivering a awe inducing terrifying experience. As for my final words, i let a few tips here: Play with a good headphones, lower the room light and be prepared for at least half a dozen jump-scares you'll get throughout the game, doesn't matter if you're faint of heart or a hardcore badass, YOU-WILL-BE-SCARED.",

The lighting and environments are some of the finest computer generated game graphics I've seen to date. All the visuals serve to keep immersion sky-high. The alien is also gorgeous, and in this game you will see and hear plenty of it.  The immersion is great enough that after a gaming session, all stomping noises in the neighborhood are going to cause you to immediately evaluate your neighborhood for hiding places and figure out where the vents are so you know which places are especially dangerous to be in.  Playstyle is almost completely stealth based. It mostly runs with a few tropes, like being locked in a mazelike environment with the alien with the goal to push various buttons and pull various switches while evading it. There are also stealth sections where the Alien hunts the player but usually doesn't make an appearance unless the player first makes some msitake. Overall, the game is ideal for the patient people who like exclusively stealth-based gamestyle, and have cold, calculating nerves to gauge the risks in a dynamically changing situation, and know how to react. The game is forced into stealth mode because the alien can not be harmed by weapons provided. Nevertheless, there are some fire-based weapons that cause the alien to run away and hide if the player chooses to attack it with them.  I in particular enjoy the hiding-in-the-cabinet mechanic, where it's not enough to just go inside a cabinet to be undetectable. The alien will still hear your breathing unless you choose to hold it (but you can't do it for very long) and may see you if it chooses to peer inside, unless you immediately move further away from the door. These simple devices enhance the stealth experience enormously and keep you at your toes, where other games have erred in making cabinet hiding 100% safe.  The game, unfortunately, suffers from its second half that feel grafted on, on top of almost impeccable beginning. At halfway point, the game starts to get FPS-like elements such as plenty of ammo and enemies you need to shoot with standard gallery of weapons such as pistols and shotguns. Even more worryingly, there is a severe problem with the Alien eggs in this game, which any Aliens fan is sure to notice. There is also no satisfying conclusion, so the narrative just breaks in an obvious DLC/sequel bait. These mistakes significantly degrade the experience. In this reviewer's head-cannon, the game simply ends at its peak on the first half. The rest was simply unnecessary crap piled on top of well thought out and executed sequel/reinvigoration of the alien of the first movie.",

            "review_text": "An overlong but satisfying survival horror game, Alien: Isolation is the closest a video game has come to capturing the tension of the Alien films since the marine campaign in AvP2.   Playing as Ellen Ripley's daughter, your training as an engineer does little to protect you from the threats you'll face aboard Sevastopol station, so you'll find yourself spending the majority of your time hiding in a closet or sneaking around. I know this may read like a negative but it's a positive; this is the first time in a very long time that a survival horror game has actually felt like it required the use of brains over brawn, the way it should do,  The one and only problem with this title starts to set in about halfway through, when it becomes abundantly clear that the developers ran out of ideas and are artificially padding things out to stall for time. This wouldn't have been too much of a issue if they hadn't overdone it to the degree that they did. No joke, some of the second act and most of the third could have been cut and you'd still have a congruent narrative and well-paced gameplay at the end of it.  As stated, the game's excessive length is the only real issue here and much of the rest of it is flawless. The retro-futuristic stylings mirror those of the original films down to the smallest detail, completely immersing you in their world from the start. The AI has the odd hiccup every now and then but overall it's believable, and hilarious after you learn how to lure the xenomorph into a group of enemies.   One of the most surprisingly great things about A: I, however, is just how well optimised it is. The devs must have a wizard in their team or something, because even on my fairly average PC this runs with max settings across the board without so much as a stutter. Even with its dodgy anti-aliasing, A: I looks eye-poppingly gorgeous in its own dark, dingy sort of way.  If you're a fan of the film Alien or survival horror, this is the best representation of either in years.",

It's a faithful recreation of the style of this first movie, including all 'old style' technologies of the time (displays, tapes, keycards, etc). The sound design is also excellent, from the originals effects to the atmosphere, an essential aspect for stealth games. If you are a fan, there's little more one could ask for.  Now for the gameplay. The alien can't be killed, so you have to always hide from it. Later on (slight spoiler)   you can drive it away with fire, but are still limited by items and ammo  . Direct encounters with it will almost always result in death, so it takes a while for you to learn all the 'tricks' to avoid detection (hint: don't keep using the loud motion tracker while on a closet...). The other category of enemy you will encounter is less fatal and can be dealt with stealth or weapons, so there is a little more variety.  However, It's on the first type of encounter (Alien) that this game will be worth or not. On the harder difficulties in can be somewhat ruthless and the save system - sparse checkpoints or saves at manual stations at specific rooms - can make it very frustrating. There are some cheats on the AI that can be irritating as well, such as the fact that the Alien is always around your location no matter how silent you have been and how far you have traveled. It should be noted that the game does allow you to change difficulty at anytime.  If you can deal with these somewhat frustrating aspects, there is a memorable experience here. There is a lot of tension in moments like hiding from a near Alien, just listening to his steps, or being scared to use the motion tracker because it will give your position away. As with any stealth game, with time you learn the rules and it become less effective, but when it clicks... it's amazing and scaring experience.  --- If you can deal with the buggy and somewhat cheap AI and some frustrating mechanics, this is a gorgeous game, with amazing environments, that can provide some really terrifying moments.",

Each and every movement you make in this game feels like a trial - there's no getting arrogant and strutting (because you will die) - and it's a fantastic feeling. The only downsides have been a couple of animation glitches, but by no means anything critical. Highly recommended.",

Iv played around 8 hours even though steam says 3, it forgot my offline playtime.  They really nailed the atmosphere and look and feel of Alien.    TLDR: Play it on Hard, at night with the lights off and a headset. Embrace the anxiety! You aren't even safe while saving. If you like Alien you will love this game.  The sound design makes you feel like you are playing the movie! Environment sounds and music on top of Ripley saying things now and again and breathing heavily and audible distress when the alien is about to find you does wonders for immersion. The Alien footsteps and sound effecst fuel you anxiety.  9/10 for sound.   Graphics wise, the only thing I can complain about is recuring/limited decals/textures and simple shaders on ceiling details . General gamers wont notice so its no problem. The eye level props look great. Ripley herself looks great - best female single player character since HL2 Alex imo :) There are a few animation issues with jaw movement but again dont think it will be that noticable. Particle effecst look really good as well.  8/10 on visuals.  Gameplay is just awesome. Really love the ways they make you interact with the world - hacking, breaking locks, accessing terminals, punching in codes, rewiring station installations, accessing vents. It can all be a positive and a negetive to your survival. You can get killed while accessing things, even saving.   The Alien itself has good AI, i've had it lurk around areas where it knows i am still hiding. Got to a point where it eventually pulled me out of a wall cabinet and killed me. Saw me using lean while under a medical bed and charged and killed me. Seems like it is much more intelligent &amp; persistant on Hard than the other difficulties. 9/10 gameplay  I've been playing at night with lights off and surround headset on Hard - it's been an anixety and thrilling ride so far. First few deaths gave me goose flesh. Even now that i can see it coming and used to dying it still makes you curse out loud lol...",

Jump scares are also the cheap way to 'scare' somebody.  Huge fan of the franchise and will pretty much play any alien/s game you throw at me no matter how bad it is.  Alien: Isolation is amazing for 2 major reasons:  -The development team did an incredible job designing the levels of the game; it feels like you are in the first film, just set on a larger ship.  -The terror in the game comes from the feeling that the Alien could show up at almost any time. It is so stressful that its almost a relief when you can see the Alien just so you know where it is. There are only a couple of jumpscares throughout the game, but the best scares came from hearng the Alien aproaching. I love this type of horror (I would assume that all survival horror games ought to scare in a simmilar manner). It's like a big game of hide and seek, with objectives.  There are some cons however  -The ship you are on is ♥♥♥♥ing huge and you move around at the pace of a snail...Do the math. -It's easy to get lost on the ship and spend a great deal of time trying to find your objective. Especially during the second half of the game.  -some people may find the second half of the game boring. -The game wil try your pateince; it's very difficult (even on easy), you move slowly, and hide a lot. -The save system makes the game even more dificult (although I consider this a pro).  9/10   ",

            "review_text": "How I Spent My Summer Vacation Aboard Sevastopol Station: Hiding in a locker, under a table, and shooting androids.  This is a completely new kind of game for me, and for all of us. It's similar to Dishonored (which the devs have admitted to gleaning inspiration from) in that it has a lot of the same gameplay mechanics and stealth-emphasis, but unlike Dishonored and Aliens: Colonial Marines (the less said about that game, the better), you're put up against a considerable threat that you can NOT defeat, which I guess is where a lot of the fear comes from.  It's like 'The Ant Bully': 'What'cha gonna do about it, Xeno? Nothing! Because I'm strong, and you're small!'*  Except now the tables have turned. A:CM got us so used to blazing through Aliens, but with this beautiful, horrifying, high-definition monster casually prancing around the station (his walk reminds me of Steve Urkel's; every time he walks past me I want to crank up the tunes and dance with him), it makes you realize how helpless you are, which I suppose is what they keep telling people. It isn't Call of Duty, so if you fancy spitting out as much lead as possible then go play Aliens: Colonial Marines; but if you want to try something different or try and ease into the horror genre - the TRUE horror genre, then this is a good choice. I know a lot of these reviewers always complain about how you 'die all the time', but in all honesty you don't. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty, and although it isn't by any means easy, it's not like the Alien has heat vision or something and can see you hiding in a locker from across the station. Play this game cautiously, don't sprint around, don't act like the lone gunslinger, don't hide in lockers (only use them if you're in an area with absolutely nowhere to hide), and don't get the impression that, 'Oh, I get a gun in this game so that must mean I can pwn the Alien.'  Fellow Aliens fans or people who might get hooked into the fascinating backstory of this franchise also have additional things to be gained, for this game has some really, really interesting elements that it adds to the story. The Arious motion tracker, for example, can actually be seen on advertisements, where its intended usage is in pest control, which makes some sense. So it's just things like that, those little things that make it more fun, and less of a game where, 'Oh, I'm on a random space station and all I have to do is hide from an unkillable Alien, and then I'll win somehow.'  So overall, for fans of this genre and/or series; buy it and you won't have a whiff of regret. For Call of Duty fanboys and people on low-end computers, you almost certainly won't enjoy this. If you decide to disregard a mixture of common sense, your own instinct, and a friendly warning, and you're unhappy with the purchase, then you're idiots.  (*Not an exact quote.)",

Finished the game in about 20 hours because I would seldom pause to look around and admire the finely crafted enviroments.  PROS: - Very detailed world with good ambience, it really feels like you are inside a rundown space station. - The Alien AI got some bashing, but I can say that it always kept me on my toes and posed a good challenged and instilled a sense of dread. The first 20 or so times will really freak you out. - VR implementation was good enough, far from perfect but it shows that the did indeed gave it some love.   CONS: - A bit too long for its own good. By the middle/end of the game it drags a lot, reusing areas, forcing a lot of arbitrary backtracking (There's a scene where you have to run around through the same area back and forth 3 times). It's a bit like Dead Space: you go somewhere to do something, once you get there it doesn't work/it is useless/it's destroyed, so you are rerouted somewhere to do something else which will also not accomplish anything at all. - Gameplay gets a bit repetitive and later you learn how to game the Alien AI and that knowledge combined with the flamethrower makes it become more like a nuisance than a fearless unkillable stalker (granted, it happens after several hours of tense gameplay, so this actually felt like a relief).  Conclusion: If you have a DK2, don't think twice, get this game. Unless you don't like to experience dread and fear in a videogame or you have some serious heart condition.",

Be forewarned, it's a tense and emotionally draining game if you're playing it on hard or nightmare --- and if you don't feel the tension, check your pulse because you may already be dead.

This is a beautiful game with amazing modeling, animation, visual effects, sound effects, and to a certain extent story and level design; they are all state of the art, and the people who made them should be proud of the work they did. In the end, however, the game suffers from massive gameplay issues. Weapon selection is a mess, compounded by the decision to have real time pass when you're on the weapon/build menu. Look-at-and-select objects trigger inconsistently, and are often grouped too close together. Quick time events are constantly pulling the player out of immersion, and frequently lock the player into lengthy animations that get them wounded or killed despite no rationale to justify the player being stuck (especially welding and using computers or rewire boxes). The player has no jump button, yet gets stuck on foot-tall ledges or bodies because they are not marked as climbable. There are also several general bugs; characters that wouldn't acknowledge my presence, doors that got stuck in their open position when closed and could not be passed or interacted with, etc. Then there is the ending: you can't win, you can only proceed until the gameplay stops and the credits roll. It was an odd choice, and I'm assuming there is going to be some sort of DLC to resolve this. The biggest problem is that, aside from how amazing this game looks, actually playing it is a stressful chore. I found myself saving obsessively just so I wouldn't have to play a minute longer than I had to to get it done, which pretty much invalidates the reason for buying most of the existing DLC. I give this game 7 out of 10, and I do recommend buying it, but wait until it drops below $30. It took me about 29 hours to finish the game, although I like to explore; this is a pretty good length for a game of this type.",

This game has taken that spirit to heart in nearly every way, reproducing the smallest details of the original film, but also changing them in the best and most subtle ways to accomodate the change in medium. There is little to explain about the mechanics of the game, other than the simple fact that you are trapped aboard a star freighter similar in design to the Nostromo with the Alien, a motion tracker, and a set of gadgets that ultimately become useless against your biggest threat as it actively learns how you play. This game has all the suspense and atmosphere of Amnesia, fast paced action and thrill of Outlast, and the amazing sci-fi soul that only the alien universe can provide. I promise that if you are a fan of the original film, this game will not disappoint you, and that you will likely die more than once while admiring the detail and atmosphere. But make no mistake, this is a horror game in the spirit of the original film... if you have no desire to feel like a member of the crew of the Nostromo as they are hunted down one by one by an invincible and deadly predator, you had better go with another game.",

An indie developer would take care of this, the big developers just don't care. - Gameplay is quite repetitive. Best described as hide and seek for 12+. - AI is predictable: This causes the game to be less immersive/scary than it could be. Because you just know what will happen. - Not a shooter game. You get to shoot something once every few hours. - Motion detector: One of the big letdowns is the radar sound, it's not the trademark sound from the movies. They took their time to replicate everything else from the movies, why not the radar sound ? :( - No replayability: Story based games are never replayable, I never go back to them after finishing them anyway. - There's a sheriff and rovolvers in space. WHY? - In the alien ship there are corridors which can barely fit a marine, how does a 12 foot alien fit in these corridors ? :( ? - Immersion breaker: Sometimes the alien just walks past as if you're invisible.

It enters the same hallways and rooms when you do, it leaves when you do, even when it has no reason to believe you're there. It is perfectly content to waste all its time and attention lingering around you because the devs wanted the alien to be FOCUSED on you. And this is what kills the game for me, because it no longer feels like it's a scary, believable scenario and in the back of my mind, I know the only reason the alien is still here in this area with me and camping the hallway I need to go through is because the invisible hand of the devs said so.   No matter how deceptive or sneaky I am, no matter how much I try to blockade the path behind me, the alien will be magically moved to the next area with me. If you trick the alien into a sealed room, he teleports. If you get on a tram and move to the other side of the station, he'll be back sooner than you know it. If you hide in a locker, the alien that was previous patroling back and forth will now deliberately pass in front of you a few times, excessively posturing as dictated by the devs, even though it has no reason to believe you're there. It's not dramatic, it just reminds you you're playing a video game.  That said, the rest of the game is fantastic. And after a while, you're given enough access to the tools you need to displace that annoying, camping alien (flamethrower, molotov, pipebombs), and the alien actually GOES AWAY. What a difference it makes, when you can actually explore the rooms (as long as you're walking) and immerse yourself. The game really picks up after the first third or so, I guess when the devs realised they could stop flaunting the alien garishly.  Edit: It'd be nice if the game actually told you how some things worked. Hacking minigames arent explained, but once you figure it out, they're braindead easy. The motion tracker has a bar that doesn't point you towards your objective, but rather towards the path of your objective. It also displays a number in the corner from 0-1.0 that represents range to closest target, so you know if targets are approaching or retreating from you, even if you are not facing them. And don't try to be too cautious otherwise you'll miss your window of escape. Taking risks is a lot easier than being too slow and safe and if you get into trouble, crouching behind any corner or boxes or a low desk is enough, and there are plenty of supplies for crafting so don't try to save your molotovs/noisemakers.",

This game is scary as hell, as the Alien(s) hunt you down throughout the game. You begin to feel like you are stalked at every turn, and no corner is safe as you attempt to carry out your missions throughout the ship. Not only are you facing the alien, but against other humans, and androids, making every turn a suprise. Not sure when the alien is going to jump out and get you, or when you are about to walk into a room full of androids and poison gas. Time and time again, you must complete challenges that get harder by the level, keeping the levels fresh. Only at one point was I bored in this game, and that was simply because the Alien was camping a room forever, attempting to find me since I set off a camera. But that just helps with the realism, as the Alien felt as though it was learning my behavior, as much as I was its. The Xenomorph was not underdone, and is a testiment to the movies I watched years ago.  If I have one more hope for this game, it's that they add a pvp mode. So people can see what it's like from the Xenomorphs point of view, and hunt another player, as they try to avoid the other player.  I would honestly give this game a 9.5/10, only because I faced some vents with glitches in them, not easily allowing me to climb into them, and because I faced trouble with camera's seeing me behind desks, or in lockers. But that is also easily played through.",

The Right story,the right atmosphere, the right music, the right character, even the light illumination, everything is brilliant. You're hunted by a xenomorph almost all the game, can't do much about it except hiding (and sometimes won't even be enough). You cannot fight him, even if you burn it he will come back after a while. There are also androids (quite annoying) and humans (try not to kill them to add difficulty and get an achievement). It's not a game for everyone, so I suggest to see some walktrough first, many could not appreciate this but if you call yourself a pc gamer you should play this. A must.  Pros:  Atmosphere   Atmosphere  Alien Scary/Enervating/Devastating  Atmosphere  Ending Can be played on a normal/low end pc thanks to one of its cons (see cons)  Cons: Claustrophobic  Could get a bit repititive  Oh, MAKE SURE YOU PLAY IT ON HARD MODE YOU BLOODY COWARD  89/100",

(Lets forget about 3 and 4.... and AVPR) and liked the games that weren't Aliens Colonial Marines, anyway after one certain abysmal game (A:CM) and one not so bad game (AVP) I am happy to say that this has revived my faith in the series.  I have played a few horror games recently, Dead Space, and Metro 2033 / Last Light to name a few but none of them in my books creates so much tension and suspense as this game, it has that music and sounds which you instantly recognise as underwear changing time, the spooky lighting, and the Alien... everything required to keep me on my toes.   Like many have said, there is only one alien in this game, but if your after a horror and not a gun blazing adventure (Which I would defo be on if I was actually on the station / ship thingy) dont let it put you off, trust me when I say it, you will hear and see enough of the alien to keep you satisfied.   For People who like to beat a game by learning patterns of the enemy, all I will say to you is good luck, there is very few scenes where I have died, respawned and then seen the alien repeat exactly what it did previously, oh and to add to that, the alien learns, certain tricks you can use to throw it off your scent only works a few times before it gets wise.   The graphics looks pretty on the game, not the best I've seen, but still good and worthy of a mention, the retro stuff is pretty sweet aswell, instead of the usual super advanced space age tech you see in similar games, its nice to see some computers that make you wonder how the hell the people in the game even got off earth to start with.   A quick bit about performance. I run a 4670K, 8GB 1600MHz Ram and dual Radeon HD 7950 Crossfire on a 1080P Display, I probably average around 110FPS (Frame rate lock off, used MSI Afterburner for visual stats) with my primary card running on all pistons (880MHz) and my second card at 300MHz. Haven't really come across any FPS problems or stuttering yet, my only concern is occasionaly I think the audio for speach looks like it isn't properly synced.

It very much nailed the feeling of the lethal, emptiness of space mixed with something that is not only pursuing you but the constant engineering catastrophies that impede you every escape. I jokingly call it engineer simulator as Riply has to fix... pretty much everything thats not a regular door. But its ok as it adds to the suspense.

If you like both those things...how have you not already played this game!?  Alien: Isolation perfectly captures the atmosphere of the original Alien movie with its claustrophobic design, gorgeous style and very well done audio design. The gameplay only reinforces this by making you constantly feel helpless even when it throws a multitude of craftable items and weapons your way to assist. The encounters with humans can turn into frantic shootouts, the 'Working Joe' androids who patrol the station will bash you to pieces and, oh, then there's the xenomorph!  Having the actions of the lone alien persuing you through the station comletely dictated by an A.I, instead of relying on scripted segments, adds a constant tension to every second of the game. You never know when the xenomorph will show up, what actions will attract it, or where it will go once it begins the hunt. Moments where humans enemies and the xenomorph both converge on you are also a thing of horrifying beauty ;D  Only downsides to Alien: Isolation are a disgustingly long run time (my first playthrough clocked almost 50 hours of me faffing about and dying repeatedly), some wonky bugs in the physics engine and a hard save system without checkpoints. None of these really get in the way of the enjoyment, though and I would say the weak, self conscious plot is the only downside. It doesn't add a whole lot to the canon or building its cardboard characters up.",

Sure you want that blueprint, but the alien is right down the hallway and your green blooper is blooping really hard. +Combat is always a last resort. The game tries to force you to play terribly cautiously, and while combat can save your life short-term it can also be a death sentence.  +Difficult, like any horror game should be. This game is best experienced on the highest difficulty, even though sometimes you might be forced to turn it down a notch. +Insightful collectables to find +Survival mode is pretty fun and stressful considering you are not only scared to death, but only have moments to complete your objective.  +Graphics are alright, could have been better +this game would be ♥♥♥♥ing perfect for VR  -Weird occasional performance issues/crashes -Lip syncing is way off. Easy to notice towards the start, but becomes a forgetable issue.  -Character movements are kind of stiff and awkward -The middle part of the game is undoubtably the worst part, simply because the threat of the alien vanishes temporarily. I won't lie; the androids are fun to fight, but it starts to feel like a dumbed down action game rather than a classy survival-horror game.  -You are forced to backtrack a lot of the ship rather than explore the whole thing which is dissapointing, but the game keeps you fixed on your objective area well despite you having free roam. -The ending to the game's story is a huge sequel baiter, and doesn't make any real sense. Kind of disappointing   In conclusion Alien Isolation is an amazing game, IGN is full of ♥♥♥♥ giving this game a 5/10, that wasn't even a review it was more like an informal grievance to sega and creative assembly asking them to pay for a review next time.

At times I felt like I was playing out a movie but in a much more immersive way. It was amusing.  I really have a hard time thinking of anything negative to say about Alien Isolation. You should plan to have the crap scared out of you and how that might affect you. I couldn’t help but laugh at myself after jumping in my seat. Especially when little things would startle me because of the suspense in the atmosphere getting to me.  Some people say the midgame is slow and drawn out. I personally thought the midgame pace was a nice break right after having just played a couple of very challenging levels trying to evade the Xenomorph. Also I personally did not find the fixing/opening/booting things around the station overly repetitive as some people say. Rather I found those mechanics created anxiety and tension which I enjoyed.

Update: I finally finished the game, getting all the achievements. This included having to play through the game three times more and I have to say, hell was it still as scary as the first time. Novice mode -don't slap me, I needed the no death achievement- is actually REALLY novice and is only recommended for people completely new to this genre, as there was enough flamethrower fuel to hop around and dance with the Xeno a bit. Despite this it was still a little difficult since I couldn't kill the humans. The hard difficulty is also actually really difficult, making it a choice for those with nerves of iron and balls of steel.  This leaves a lot of choices for your preferences.  After 50+ hours, I can say it has plenty of replay value and is still a lot of fun.   The DLCs feel a bit lacking though.

In the 35 odd years i have been gaming this has gave the best Frights yet.   This must be the most intense game i have ever played, It is in the same Catagory as Outlook but hell more Nerve Racking.   The Graphics are amazing and the interactions between the charaters is really life like, to the point, One character raise's his eyes when thinking about something. They have done very well with the Facial animation.  now the pain in the ♥♥♥ that is the Alien is something else. I played this on the Recommended Hard Difficult and so far have got to Mission 6 and it has killed me a good few times. It can move so fast that just when u think you have left it behind going in another direction it will walk out a door in front of you, Which gives for so Many Oh S**T moments.   My best F**king Hell moment has to be the alien going out a door and going left, then me walking out a door and moving backwards looking down the path the alien went (using the Tracker) to turn around to be staring the alien right in the face.   If ur a Alien fan like myself this game is a must, Infact i would have too say 'YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME'.  After Thought:   How can they Make a game like this where the AI is amazing, For someone else to screw up so badly with Alien: colonial marines, A game i was looking so forward too, that i never even bothered playing it again after seeing a AI get stuck when he was suppose to be helping me.",

This is especially a great game for any Alien/(s) fan, as it absolutely nails that look and feel.  As much as I liked this game, though, I did have a few complaints. The main one is that, while the alien AI is fantastic, the human AI was lackluster. Humans in general were implemented poorly into this game. They talk to each other as if they are complex, thoughtful human characters, but if you walk anywhere near them they turn into typical dumb FPS NPC characters that shoot on sight for no reason. It was almost jarring. But not *every* human is like that - some of them just run and hide, and killing them gives you a game over. So be sure to figure out which type of human character they are before killing any of them.  That aside, the gameplay in this game was great, especially when dealing with the alien. I don't feel there will be much replay value for me, but for the just over 20 hours it took me to complete this game, I got my money's worth. There are also some incredible visuals in this game. Especially towards the end, there was some stuff that I personally consider unparalleled in terms of sheer look and atmpsphere. This game looks insanely great and it runs really well even on medium gaming rigs.  I highly recommend this game to stealth fans, or people who liked Alien a lot.",

It looks like Alien, it feels like Alien. The attention to detail is stunning, that strange 70/80's take on scifi and what the future will look like. Computer run like they are on dos, monitors are big and chunky. The developers of this game clearly had a lot of love for the alien film, nothing this atmospheric could have come from anyone else.  2) The alien. I don't think there's a more contentious point about this game than the Alien, and the A.I of the Alien. I won't go into what I think on that, but I will state the one thing I think that makes it a success, it's randomness. With most other horror games, like Amnesia and Outlast, you can look up where the enemies are and get strategies on how to get past them. That's not the case with AI, you can never be sure where the Alien is, you can never be sure when it's going to come down. You can certainly learn coping mechanisms and get experienced in using your gadgets, but ultimately it is all about skill. No guide can help you with this, and that makes for a hell of an experience.",

This is especially impressive given that these devs normally make Total War strategy games! The alien AI is also quite nice. He does 'stick' to you throughout the game, but he still quite convincible in the way he moves.  The only thing I can definately see as valid criticism is that about halfway through the game the story starts to drag. This is a missed narrative opportunity on one hand, but it does mean a longer campaign on the other. I found this game the be the most entertaining when I played it in bursts because of this, since atmosphere never ceases to be instantaniously enjoyable the second you boot up the game.  I would definately recommend this game, but personally I never buy linear triple A games at full price, even with longer (15-20h?) campaigns. But in a sale? --&gt; Grab it!",

As a big fan of the Alien films, this game sticks quite well to the canon and the atmosphere is incredible. It really does play just like the movie. Even if you haven't seen the movies I think the game would still be great on its own. I ended up getting all of the DLC on the steam sale but haven't played most of it yet.

I had a smile on my face exploring the initial 70's futuristic settings of the first couple of chapters. The thing that ruined it for me is when the actual alien shows up it was just no fun anymore. I just did not want to play the game anymore after it turned into a stealth game with instant kill and having to reload at the last checkpoint losing all my progress. I can take a little trial and error gameplay, but not as much as this game wants you to do. After the alien shows up there is no more time to stop and look around and soak in the atmosphere, instead it turned into a COD campaign where you have to keep constantly moving forward and I hate that. So after 8 hours I give up. I'm going to poke around and see if there is a way to mod out the alien or something, but as it plays out of the box I can't recommend it.",

Rather liking the film I then bought this game in the same drunken haze though never played it.   Coming back to it more recently I decided to give it a go. Being a fan of games like Thief 2 I felt that I at least I could enjoy the stealth element to it. Oddly enough despite my disliking horror I have found myself rather engrossed in this game, perhaps it’s the sci-fi setting as playing other games akin to this just doesn’t have the same effect.   Regardless this game holds a solid mix of stealth and horror with their being nothing more gripping them sitting under a desk as those big black legs stomp by and nothing more satisfying as finding a way to outwit the beast and sneak past it. In all it’s got a great stealth element, splendid AI and beautiful atmosphere. My only gripe would be the slow pace of the overall game, as sprinting is practically a death sentence meaning that walking or crouch walking are your only real options.   In short if you like tense, fear inducing, slow paced, stealth with a wonderful setting and genuinely hard to predict AI or if you’re a fan of the original movie then this is a game that will leave you with an elevated heart rate and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clenched so tight you could crack walnuts.",

            "review_text": "The game that finally does the Alien franchise justice and delivers a gripping, innovative gameplay experience the likes of which I have never seen before. This is a rare example of a movie licensed game that gets it right.   Just as James Cameron took the Alien franchise to another level, Creative Assembly have taken this franchise to another level on a different medium. I have never played a game like this where the creature hunts you down and it's A.I. is superb. You never know when it will arrive and when it does, you have to be truly stealthy and watch your every move. Other stealth games have the npc's walking predictable routes but the alien is truly life like with its movements and spontaneity.  The sound design is second to none. I played this on a pc with a good stereo system but I can only imagine in surround sound what it would be like. I'm thinking of playing again on the PS4 just to use the surround system. The sounds are true to the movies but also have new ones that fit in seamlessly. Stealth games live and die on the sound design and this game got it just right. The movie quality music is dynamic and changes with the action in the game which brings the tension to even stronger heights.  The level design is varied and spectacular. Even though its mainly on a space station, they gave each mission different objectives and variation to always feel fresh. I never got bored. It constantly threw new things at me and changed up the scenario.   The graphics are gorgeous. This game looks so good. I took over a 100 screenshots through my playthrough as I marvelled at the detail and design of the space station. Props from the movie are placed throughout and add a nostalgaic value to an already fantastic game. The engine is also very well optimized as not once during my entire playthrough did I see a frame drop.  The constant threat of the alien is what makes this game so great. The design and animation of the alien brings it to life and I cannot say enough good things. This is the game that Alien fans have been waiting for and I'm so glad that Creative Assembly knocked it out of the park with this one. The love of the franchise permeates every aspect of this game. This great work cannot have been done without an avid passion for this universe.   Bravo.",

            "review_text": "In Alien: Isolation, you are in the shoes of Amanda Ripley, a young engineer on a quest to learn more about her mother in a decommissionned space station... which rapidly turns into a game of cat and mouse between you (the mouse) and various lethal dangers. This is probably one of the best survival horror games released in the last few years.  First of all, the setting is incredible, Creative Assembly went the extra mile in recreating the retrofuturistic look of the first two Alien movies when they meticulously crafted Sevastopol station. Every little maintenance panel covered with blinking buttons and every piece of dated yet advanced technology will remind you of the original films. The soundtrack is very much inspired by the film scores, and all the noises, from the creaking bulkheads of the station to the hiss of the alien, will quickly immerse you in an uneasy atmosphere. If you're a fan, you will be absolutely delighted by this fact alone. The director of the soon-to-be-released Alien 5 movie (Neil Blomkamp) actually referenced this game in an interview, saying the artists blew his mind and made him reconsider what he wants his movie to look like.  The gameplay is also a work of art. Where some survival horror games remove weapons from you to make you feel powerless and heighten stress (SOMA, Amnesia, etc.), this one actually gives you a small arsenal of more or less effective guns and melee weapons to use. You might think this trivializes content, and sometimes it does, but there are some threats you will definitely not be able to eliminate through force. Namely, a ruthless alien which will constantly hunt you throughout the game. Where it can end your life swiftly, you are very much limited in what you can do to fight back. Fire will keep it at bay for a short time, flashbangs will stun it, smoke grenades will disorient it, noise will distract it... but you will never be able to kill it.  Another place where Alien: Isolation innovates is the actual AI of the Alien. On higher difficulties, it is hard to predict, and really knows how to keep you on your toes. You will have to adapt your strategies throughout the game as it becomes more aggressive.  The technical aspect is really good as well; textures are high resolution and lighting effects are top notch. The modeling of the enemies is great and the performance is outstanding.   Some drawbacks that professionnal reviewers might point out include the amount of backtracking and the pacing of the game. To me, these were really minor issues, if at all. The backtracking is always justified, and helped make me feel like I was really stuck on this nightmarish station, making my way through the maze of corridors to survive. Besides, the game does a good job of letting you discover new areas in old zones thanks to a set of tools that allow you to progressively open more doors as you upgrade them. As for the pacing, I welcomed sections where the Alien took a backseat. Typically, it was in these parts of the game that I took more time to take in my surroundings, listen to audio tapes, read the information on the public terminals... and there are other dangers than just the Alien in this game.  Overall, Alien: Isolation deserves its place among the greats of the survival horror genre. Creative Assembly did an outstanding job and I can only hope for a sequel to this game.",

CONs: - some plot points can be seen coming (does not reduce the feeling from the event) - the alein appearences are in rare insatnces not random - Sometimes the music is way overpowering in tense monments  Notes My only real complaint is that the alien never attacks the adroids even though it has no reason not too.",

I must confess I had to get myself a little tipsy to endure the utterly creepy first few missions. I stress the first missions because after a while you do become accustomed to being grusomely mauled by the Xenomorph or strangled to death by a malfunctioning android. That being said I am still enjoying it very much; I find myself intentionally putting it down for days at a time so that it's still at least somewhat scary when I come back to it.  The story is interesting enough. The graphics are beautiful and the audio is horrifyingly on point. The game as a whole is a little unforgiving; it doesn't hold your hand and you may occasionally find yourself wondering what you're supposed to do, and that does add the whole survival/horror feel.

However, there were many disappointments along the way. The game is no were near as frightening as I had hoped. There are jump scares yes, but they are more annoying than anything because this means you are dead and have to restart from your previous checkpoint (which may involve longer backtracking than you would have wished). The game has very limited combat and in most scenarios engaging in combat will get you instantly killed. That being said, Alien Isolation is a stealth driven game that involves constant sneaking and hiding to avoid enemies. The game is hard...and I mean hard. I started out on the hard difficulty setting, changed to normal about a quarter of the way through, and had to finish on easy because I was fed up with dying so often. On the plus side, however, the game is absolutely beautiful. Space looks spectacular when it is actually shown. I found searching for items, reading datalogs, and crafting items to be fun. Every tool/item has a particular use and you have to apply that to your current situation or you will not survive! Overall, it was a beautiful and explorative atmosphere experience that was okay for me, but not for everyone.",

I found this to be incredibly annoying and immersionp ruining, so I stopped playing it only after an hour or so.   I recently bought the game again on PC during the Steam Winter Sale in the hopes of better performance. Obviously, due to the massively better specs of my PC and laptop over my PS4 (i7 3770k and i76700HQ respectively, both with GTX 1070s and &gt;16GB RAM running on Windows 10) the game looks gorgeous and runs at a stable 60FPS at 1080p.   The reason I cannot recommend this game is that even after two full years of massive performance issues on the PC related to crashes, the developer has not yet been able to fix the issue. Many of the fixes for this game involve editing Steam files, fiddling with languages, or turning off odd combinations of graphical settings - none of these options have worked for me. I'm currently at 60 minutes played, but I'm barely past the 15 minute mark due to how many times my game has crashed and I have had to restart while trouble shooting the problems.  So far the crashes I have experience have been:  1) Crashing before loading a save; 2) Crashing after leaving a specific room early in the game; and 3) Crashing after climbing down a ladder in the above mentioned room.  I understand that different hardware and software configurations can throw a wrench in a games performance, but after two solid years of opportunity to fix the multiple issues that are game breaking and seemingly nigh impossible to solve, I can't in good faith recommend this title.  This game has received excellent reviews from multiple sites and users, but those were the lucky ones who magically had the game work for them without issue; suffered through frame rate and graphical issues on consoles; or spent the ridiculous amount of time and effort trouble shooting it on their PC. Unless you're willing to put in the hours of trouble shooting, or are just feeling lucky, I recommend you steer clear of this game, or at the very least ensure you don't exceed the 2 hour mark so you can refund after the inevitable game breaking bugs.",
