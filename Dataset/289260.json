            "review_text": "Good HOG game, everything is rather well done: story, graphics, search scenes, mini games, music, etc. You can ask for a hint on a particular object and you get a mini game with jumbled drawn hint that you have to unscramble! There’s a lot of ‘bonus stuff’ to collect, mainly eyes creatures hiding in all the screens. There’s some achievements to do, they’re not doable thru Steam but in the game’s main menu. The gameplay consist of small zones that you need to complete to advance, each with a different theme. Be warned that the game is creepy, with a fully fledged horror theme: creepy eyes to collect? Check. Creepy clowns? Check. Creepy cemetery? Check. You catch the drift. However it’s fun and very different from the usual HOG games, so I do recommend it.",

Strangely, there aren't traditional HO scenes but there are still lots of puzzles so is good nevertheless, there's even a bonus chapter and other extras. The cutscenes aren't very good and it's moderately short (I played on hardest difficulty and I finished it in 3 hours) but I stll recommend it, even if not at full price (I got it with a bundle).",
