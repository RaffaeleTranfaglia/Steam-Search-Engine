    "description": "Directionless is an experimental Virtual Reality horror game. It tries out a variety of ways of using Virtual Reality to unnerve and disorient the player, with carefully crafted audio working with an interactive environment to pull you into a nightmarish world where you can't trust anything.",

            "review_text": "Uh...  Not sure what just happened, but based on my research (Google), I'm 90% sure I was just inducted into The Illuminati.  Maybe not the best experience for the VR noobs, or those with weak guts, due to some perspective shifts, and artificial motion.   While extremely short, this does explore some very interesting perspectives. Can't honestly say whether or not it's worth the buck, but I do love weird things. This fits the bill. And for less than the price of those beaks and feet that the fast food industry calls 'chicken nuggets'. So, take that as you will.  7/10  Would consider giving my soul to The Dark Lord again.",

        {
            "review_text": "Nice experience, comes in at little under 10 minutes and is really intriguing. Costs much less than a rollercoaster ride and provides more entertainment, I'll probably go back a few times since I really liked the atmosphere. Might lead to paranoia if experienced under the influence of drugs, I assume (not that I'd know).",

For a while, I could never get through the first section of the game because the idea of being alone in a small cabin with big windows in the woods at night was creepy enough. (Especially after watching the movie Hush...) But once I forced my way through that opening part of this minigame (or mostly non-interactive VR short), it really lost its horror edge and became just a bunch of weird colors and shapes and unnecessary changes in perspective. A pointless gimmick and waste of time.",
