            "review_text": "Okay. Let's do this.  The Amber Throne is gorgeous. You definitely acknowledged that by now, but since it's the most important and successful part of the game I can't really write a review without mentioning it. The story is good, and even if I personally didn't find the soundtrack to be as remarkable as some reviews said it would be, It's still satisfying.  The issue I have about The Amber Throne is that it's not that good at being a game.  That's not going to be one of those review that says 'Not worth your time - don't buy'. Like I said, there ARE some good things about this game, but I also have a lot of complaints, and the Negative Reviews section is the place to talk about those.  Let's start with the main issue, wich is also the reason why I can't play the game anymore : because I'm fed up with it. The skill system was so much fun to tinker with when I started playing. Like with any RPG, the first thing I did was to open the menu and check the evolution system. I was pleased to see that as soon as a character joins the party, all their locked skills are already visible, wich means you can immediately have a look at what kind of roles each character might be good at. That way you can plan your progression in advance even if you don't have the levels to buy the skills. So, kudos to that. But.   Like I said, I ended up being fed up with, it mainly for a reason : there simply isn't enough skills.   It's actually a problem I encountered quite often with games made with RPG Maker (the reason behind the obsolete resolution, btw), as well as RPGs in general. If the battles become a chore, if each of the four characters end up using the same three skills 90% of the time, then the player might not want to finish the story at all. Add to this the fact that you can end up wandering through the map with no idea where to go, or that the battle sound effects come from RPG Maker's sound bank and WILL get to your nerves if you've already heard them in several other games.  The last problem I have with the skill system is that the last character (Sirra, unless there's another one) joins the party way too late, and with only one skill, when Arra and Popette each have a good ten or even more. It wouldn't be a problem if you could level him up to catch up with the girls, but at this point the leveling had already become much slower, making it difficult to unlock new skills. And that's a shame since Sirra is so cool, on top of having a name that reminds me of my favorite character from Bluebyte's Albion. (But that might not be the point)  Speaking of characters, I also find it extremely stupid that even with only four playable characters, you can only fight with three at a time. I know I'm a fan of FFVI, and some people prefer to have three characters in combat, but in this case it's literally 'the three fighters and that guy you only remember in the cutscenes'. (Sorry, Nuo) I know the point of such system is to make the player switch between characters to adapt their strategy to the current enemy, but you need way more playable characters to be able to do that&nbsp;! You can't expect someone to make a three-cards deck from a selection of four cards, especially if those cards need to be leveled up before their gameplay gets interesting.  The last thing I have to say is about the design of those characters. Graphically, they're great (but everything is graphically great in this game). However I completely failed to grow attached to them, and that's probably because of a lack of character development. Retroactively, that's probably a huge part of the reason why the story wasn't enough to make me keep playing after I started to get bored. The plot is heavily world-driven, and the characters barely interact with each other. Heck, the main protagonist is actually mute. Sure, the story supports it, but it's really hard to get emotionally attached to a character that doesn't say a word outside of dreams and journal entries.   And that's all I have to say. At least for now. I might add something if I end up finishing the game (and I probably will, but right now I don't feel like it). As for what I meant by 'The Amber Throne is not that good at being a game', it's simply that, at the end of the day, I might have suceeded to really like it if it had been a novel. Or one of those japanese Light Novels. You can't simply give up on drawings like these.  Now don't get me wrong, like I said earlier I don't think the game is unplayable because of this. Even if I ended up disappointed, I still had fun playing it. There are some really good ideas, varied enemies, a beautiful story, and I found the gameplay very entertaining in the beginning and middle of the game. Also, did you know that the graphics were gorgeous ?",

            "review_text": " The Amber Throne : I haven't finished it but I am  done.   What a disappointment. I'm going to tell you right now not to be impressed by those screenshots and that fancy soundtrack, suspend your welling notions of 'Oh this is RPG Maker but it's different! It's not low effort trash!' You're only right on the front of it not being low-effort, as this is probably the best example of RPG Maker games' failings you might ever play.  Positives first. It's obviously gorgeous in both BG and character design, and the soundtack is amazing. That remains true for pretty much all of the game that I've seen, so props, but unfortunately those two are probably the only real redeeming factors. I'll concede that the gameplay is fun in the beginning, but as it goes on it transforms from 'Standard Turn-Based with a Rock Paper Scissors twist' to 'Standard Turn-Based with the tedium of guessing what your enemies are weak to and where every fight seems to take too damn long except for the bosses which feel too damn easy.'  The main problem I have is the story. It's gibberish. If it were not for the beautiful art, you would probably be convinced that the person who made this just whacked this out after reading a load of Squaresoft-era fanfiction. It's a case of someone having an idea of what makes a story dramatic or meaningful, but not being able to organize any of it into a coherent set of motivations, causes, and effects. Pretty much all of the major moments of the game befuddle rather than increase your understanding of the world. The characters are all pretty shallow with the main character's motivation changing to something new and equally incomprehensible every time you have to fight a major boss, even the villain's reasoning for trying to end the world just flies over your head. Don't get me wrong. It's not that they don't talk about their motivations. It's not that you don't understand what's happening. It is literally that they will say their motivations outright, that they are attacking you for example and why they are attacking you, and the sentences are worded so badly you have no idea how anything got from Point A to Point B. They blend together metaphors and purple prose and repetitions of pseudo-ominous phrases into a soupy mess of senselessness. This isn't  Space Funeral . There is no excuse.  Don't even get me started on just out and out plot holes. THERE ARE SO MANY:    HOW DID AXIS PUT THE PRINCESSES IN THE COFFINS IF ARRA KILLED HIM. WHY DID HE DO THAT. DID IT HAPPEN IN THE SKY CASTLE OR AXIS'S KINGDOM. ARRA'S COFFIN FELL OUT OF THE SKY CASTLE BUT THE REST OF THE COFFINS WERE BACK AT THE KINGDOM. WHY WAS THE SKY CASTLE ALREADY IN THE SKY WHEN THE BIRDS HELD THE THRONE. HOW HAS EVELYN NOT AGED IN 20 YEARS IF SHE'S A NORMAL HUMAN BEING. WHY DID THE RED KING ADOPT HER. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE MINNIKS KILLED THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE SEA WAS POISONED. THAT LITERALLY HAPPENS IN THE FIRST MAJOR DUNGEON AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.     Whoever wrote this needed an editor or a creative writing class. As a kicker, somehow all of the typos are limited to the big dramatic cutscenes. Three times, they spelled 'delinquent' wrong. Maybe stop using that word.  The second major issue is the mechanical aspect of the game. It's very buggy. The bugs aren't gamebreaking, at least the ones I've experienced, but they do serve to further ruin your immersion. Plot NPCs being teleported into the walls when you return to areas, sometimes walking into an area and having your character just not appear but being able to move the screen, weird lag on the larger maps, waking up from sleeping and having half of Arra's animation missing so she phases in and out of existence. Your character sometimes clips over the foreground. The combat, as I've said, gets boring. The most tactical the game is is at the very start and then as it goes on it just runs out of tricks. This the RPG Maker that everyone expects, the RPG Maker that is locked to 640p. This game is very much waving the flag of that RPG Maker.  If one of these, story or gameplay, had been clean I would have forgiven it but both of them being  really  messy means that even though the game is very good at evoking a sense of nostalgia in me, it would be really dishonest for me to recommend it. I'm right near the very end I think and I'm just fatigued, and more importantly to this review, I don't care. I don't care how it ends because I'm nearly there and I still don't feel motivated to save the frankly poorly thought out world of the game.  Just play  Final Fantasy . Any of the first ten will do. Play  Chrono Trigger  and  Chrono Cross . Play  Suikoden 2 . Play  Legend of Mana . If you want so badly to play a Steam RPG Maker game that breaks all expectations of what that program can do, play  Lisa: the Painful  and its DLC. I thought of all of those games while playing this one. They hold up, and  The Amber Throne  doesn't.",

            "review_text": "The Amber Throne is an absolutely lovely game with roots in a bygone era of RPG gaming. At times slightly obtuse, it rewards patience and exploration thoroughly. Something like a simple background object can be an interactable bit of lore with a minor experience reward attached. Rich, seemingly hand-painted art and a dynamic, ambient soundtrack completely destroy expectations of what RPGMaker is capable of.   On the mechanical side, while stats are assigned automatically at level up, the player has a nice variety of choices in regards to which skills to buy with JP, a currency earned upon gaining a level. Nearly all of these skills have an effect on enemies; one might break an armored enemy's defenses and turn him into an 'Unarmored Enemy' or a particularly fast enemy into a 'Wounded Enemy'. This gives battles a more involved feel which is refreshing for a turn based RPG.   While I normally ignore RPGMaker games as a whole, I can say this is worth full price. The game's creator has been highly active in addressing the very few issues the game has and patching them. If you are a fan of the JRPG genre at all, the overall experience of The Amber Throne is for you.",

If you have played Chrono Trigger, any of the Final Fantasy Saga (especially 7), Secret of Mana, and even Dragon Age then you have already played The Amber Throne.
