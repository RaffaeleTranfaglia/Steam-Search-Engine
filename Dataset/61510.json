I recommend this game only if you are okay with playing in windowed mode as there is no option for fullscreen. I have not played a match on steam yet, mostly because I hate playing in windowed mode so I have no information on actual game play. Warning for those wanted to play multiplay: when I played this game years ago it had terrible issues with desynchronizing and crashing. Just a heads up. To be perfectly honest I will probably never launch this game again since AoW3 is out. I own this game out of nostalgia, so I cannot recommend this to nonAoW / TBS fans.",
