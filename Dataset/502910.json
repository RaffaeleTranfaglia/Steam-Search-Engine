            "review_text": "I bought the game last week, game wasn't properly published (thus unplayable) until I had a chat with Steam Support. That said, here's the review after the game became playable.  The Return Home is a game about a rabbit thrown out of its home by lizards for an inexplicable reason and now the rabbit's after revenge.  From the time I've spent playing the game, I'd say you can beat this game in about 20 minutes or less. The first half of the game is you just running around on a fetch quest, the second half is a sketchy FPS against the shoddy AI lizards you spent the first half running away from, after which the game just ends out of the blue.  The graphics are okay and it's always neat to see some cel-shading. However, several problems arise with broken lighting and other visual effects, causing significant performance lag, especially on the second half of the game.  The in-game music is mostly just a semi-repetitive beat akin to certain tracks from the Serious Sam games. The cutscene music is excessively loud in comparison. You can't skip the cutscenes and the options only become available after entering the game itself.  In short, despite its low price tag, the game is not currently in a state you'd get much bang for your buck. It'd probably last you longer than a candy bar, but the aftertaste isn't as pleasant. Don't get it.  Also, what's up with that completely empty 'About' button in the main menu?",
