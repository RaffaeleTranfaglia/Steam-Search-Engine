            "review_text": "This game starts off strong, but halfway it begins to fall apart with a somewhat generic storyline. The CGI cutscenes are terrible. They are blurry and the animation is a bit stiff. If looks like something out of the 1990s. Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on them but this game was released in 2013. Why it has very poor animated cut scenes is beyond me. The nto confuse me even further are these completely separate cutscenes that are done with flash animation rather than CGI. It looks like as if this game was done by 2 completely different developers. It just throws you off. The voice acting is dull and emotionless like they weren't even trying. The gameplay was your standard hidden object play through. Nothing fancy. The puzzles were great as least but some puzzles were either a little too easy and some were totally cryptic. Do I recommend this game, no. Not unless you are a die hard fan of hidden object games or if it's on sale. It's a 5/10 for me.",

            "review_text": "Bought this during the summer sale, figuring that it could be a fun point-and-click adventure. The music and scenery are very nice, and at some points it's enjoyable to just sit there and kind of take it in. The puzzles are challenging enough (the map tells you which areas are 'Active', i.e. 'it's possible to use an object here', however) and if you're a fan of 'I Spy' type of puzzles (sit there and find all the hidden items), then you're in luck - because this game has plenty (to the point that I almost got a little tired of them). I will say this game is pretty well put together, but does have its problems. The voice acting was a little awkward in the beginning, but during the black and white animated 'cutscenes' it was pretty good. The story itself is pretty standard - ghosts trapped by their compliance in a curse, etc, etc. The characters were fairly typical (and one of the ghosts was about every stereotype of a Japanese and/or Asian woman? Was that really necessary?), though most of them were likeable enough. The story relies on a lot of outdated horror tropes - being cursed by 'black magic' messing up a 'Pagan Ritual' and using supposed 'Voodoo Dolls'. And sometimes the search and find puzzle sections were a little ridiculous? There was just so much stuff thrown into them, sometimes it took away from the puzzle. At any rate, it's not a bad game, and was actually really fun at some points (The puzzles, art, scenery, and music made it likeable), but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.",

            "review_text": "This is a point &amp; click puzzle game with an interesting storyline.  There are 2 difficulty modes you can choose from:  Casual Mode - Hint button refills every 30 seconds and all active areas are highlighted. Expert Mode - Hint button refills every 1 minute and all active areas are NOT highlighted.  This game has some Hidden Object parts but there are also plenty of other mini-game puzzles to be solved. Overall, the puzzles are not that difficult.  It is very easy to get around in the game with a quick-travel map. The map also highlights the area where you need to go next, mostly involve using an item from your inventory at that area. This really saves player's time.  I found the story to be quite interesting as you are trying to find out just what each character had done to cause this tragedy.  The animation part of the game needs lots of polishing. But overall the 2D environment is absolutely beautiful.",
