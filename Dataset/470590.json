In my opinion the Dev nailed it and then some. Just enough of a challenge/frustration factor to keep me interested and a few surprises along the way; I was not expecting so much for so little.  Also I love the sound track =D",

            "review_text": "Moto RKD dash is a tribute to the good'ol arcade games from the 80's, it also seems to be a remake from an old forgotten game &amp; watch (which is unlockable and playable ingame), and it's also a short trip under LSD that you can get for cheap.  The purists who enjoyed playing on arcade cabinets back in time will appreciate Moto RKD Dash at it's true value, although the game is short (it has only 9 levels and can be finished within 20mn), and that the gameplay doesn't vary especially during the trip, the really enjoyable aspect is that all levels have their own totally different scenery and soundtrack, which makes the game never boring. A very positive point for the trippy trance soundtracks which are of a great quality.  And one very good other point is the graphic design with the choice to put the road in a perspecive vision that is very trippy and impressive at 60fps, especially on a large screen.  Even if on some aspects the game looks unpolished, I would recommand it. It has a lot of replayability, especially if you are a achievement hunter or a high-score ranker. The game includes a leader board and trading cards, and one more cool thing is that the dev is very active on the community, which is a particulary good point.  7/10",
