            "review_text": "What they say: Slow-paced Laggy Terrible controls.  What I say: While the game is mostly fast paced by movement, it does get a bit slow-paced due to the monsters coming at you and animating slowly. I honestly never experienced any lag and I have it on high settings. Terrible controls? The controls were simple enough for me. Maybe because I'm used to Half-Life.  Anyways, Monument is a game that brings you back to the old-school shooter age such as DOOM and Quake.  Graphics: The graphics do not meet the expectations of today's high end gaming, but looking from going from the old-school shooter to going to these 3d graphics, it gives a good nostalgia feel.  Gameplay: The movement is fast-paced. However, when it comes to monsters, things become a bit slow. Unlike DOOM, you can't just crash in and nuke the monster with bullets. It requires thinking and moving around the monster in this game.  The puzzles presented here reminds me of the usual puzzles I see in the DOOM games. Also, what is great is it comes with a save feature, so before you screw up your moment, at least you don't have to worry to run through the whole level again.  Level design is a combination of 'straight-forward' and 'hidden path' type.  Music: If I was listening track by track, I would enjoy the music. Depending on how long you spend on the levels, it can get annoying. It's mostly a metal/hard rock type of music here. Really suits the atmosphere.  Conclusion: Monument may not catch up to today's look-a-likes of DOOM and Quake. However, it reaches just enough to give an enjoyable and nostalgic experience for old-school shooter players.  Pros: Level design is basic. Easy moments and hard moments. Save feature. Simple controls. Atmosphere that brings back DOOM and Quake memories.  Cons: Coming across monsters slow things down Music can be annoying after staying too long on a level. Graphics and animations of monsters could be improved.",

            "review_text": "To keep it short; it's Quake except not good.  If you want a longer explanation, allow me to explain:  Monument is an FPS that is trying really hard to be Quake. It has a hard-rock/metal soundtrack, it's got a really browny-grey colour palette, and it's got GUNS AND BLOOD. But it sure as hell ain't Quake.  The speed of the game is incredibly slow, like, REALLY SLOW. You move like molasses on molasses. Enemies are sluggish and floaty as well, probably to compensate for your own lack of speed. Now I wouldn't call this slow for the sake of strategy, stealth, or tension; because if that was the case the enemies wouldn't be so easy to avoid, or hell, to kill.  The difficulty of this game is non-existant. I never died from an enemy once. From falling into an instant-death pit, yes; but never from the enemies. The enemy AI is nearly brain-dead, they'll get lost trying to turn a corner and get stuck on it. This coupled with their aforementioned slowness makes them a piece of cake to deal with. Even if they do land an attack, it rarely does that much damage, and when you do get hurt you can heal up that sliver of missing health with the plethora of health items the game tosses around.  I haven't even mentioned the weapons. The weapons feel bad. The game fails the shotgun test, and that's not a test you want to fail.  I also gotta mention that there are two guns you get later-ish in the game; the rifle and the plasma gun. These two weapons hold so much ammo, and do so much damage, that they make every enemy feel like a mosquito. So if the game wasn't easy enough; there you go.  The game of course has other problems, like:  -The really awkward controls begging you to do platforming segments. -Walls that like to grab onto you and never let go for no reason other than that you happened to invade their personal space. -The game is in love with the number 5, as in that there are only 5 guns, 5 enemy types, and 5 levels. -Everything looks like a potato of some sort.  Despite all of this the game at least feels like some heart was put into it. It isn't a shameless asset-flip or a meme-clutching, youtuber-bait game. I could definitely notice the flickering of some fun, imaginative ideas that were sadly muddled by a lackluster execution. I hope that the developer isn't discouraged by the negative reviews, but instead uses the critique to motive themselves to really make something fun and revisitable. There is potential, but at its current state Monument isn't living up to it.  Over-all; I don't recommend that you pick up Monument unless it's on sale or something. I got the game for around a dollar, which is fair for what I played.",

            "review_text": "First off, deactivate DOF and 'Ambient Obscurance'. Leaving those options on will make the game run slow as hell.  Now, the game itself is like someone who really loved Quake decided to make a tribute to it, including the violence and arena-based gameplay, but forgot the fun. Even with the fixes above, you still move like you're in a wheelchair. Not only that, your guns feel more like dart guns and don't feel that fun to shoot. The level design ranges from okay to not that fun to explore. It tries a lot of branching paths for the sake of variety, but they don't seem to work for the reasons noted.  In short, Quake, this is not. If you want a Quake game, just play the original.",
