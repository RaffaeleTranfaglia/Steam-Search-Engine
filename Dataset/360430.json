            "review_text": "There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their youtube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none on that in the game. Also you cannot customize cars thought you could in a previous game. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people that have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photo shoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of 'loading last save' you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -&gt; Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break 'follow that car' missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.

The 'Mafia' part is just a sideshow AI is absolutely the single worst AI i've seen in a game... ever. Driving is meh Every mission is the same. Shooting gallery, destroy this stuff, wire a few boxes if you want an 'advantage.'  Hangar 13 gave a good shot at it, but it turned out half-finished and a lot of features were cut that were in Mafia 2. Could've been 2K's fault, since they published the game, as in they forced Hangar 13 to release it early for budget or... whatever reason. But you never really know.

            "review_text": "So yeah, it took me 39 hours to play through this game. That's not bad for a modern game, though of course I did take my sweet time and did all the side missions as well, and gathered all collectibles (still can't find that last album cover, it does not appear on the map).  Anyway, I honestly don't know whether I can recommend this title or not. I'll list the pros and cons, first things first.  Pros:  -Vito! -Great cutscenes! -No fast travel! -Music! -Gunfights (stealthmode is also very intuitive!) -The city is huge! -Well designed cars (they don't use any real life cars, but rather make some up by mixing existing ones - they really did a great job on that) - the driving is alright as well, although I feel that it should've been a greater challenge, especially since I was in simulation mode! -Upgrades for cars, your character, and item slots. Gives a nice sense of development as you progress through the story!  Cons:  -Handholding. Arrows pointing to your current objectives at all times, for example - it's just not necessary. You're also just a quick phonecall away to have a car delivered, weapons to purchase, and money to store. You can also disable phones with this 'feature', and eventually be able to call off the cops, even... I mean.... eh. It's just way too easy to succeed in this game. Handholding is bad. -Poor graphics, badly optimized. They look very blurry compared to other games, and there's no visual difference between high and low? Ok then. The framerate also suffered at times, though not too bad, at least for me. -Rackets. These are incredibly boring and repetitive - and you get to do them about 500 billion times. -Forced to unlock story missions. This is the worst move by far. -Very little depth to the majority of the characters. Example: You are forced to take over rackets and districts and whatnot to unlock more dialogue with some characters, and eventually you unlock this super dramatic dialogue and find yourself not giving two ♥♥♥♥s because... well why would you? There's little to no story behind the characters, and you just can't sympathize. Basically the majority of the characters are just shallow. Not that great for a supposedly 'story rich' game.  I think that's everything, so now you see why I do not know whether to recommend this game or not. Hmm... signs point to no. The way the game is now... I just can't recommend it. Maybe if they release a patch to optimize it better - that way the pros will outbalance the cons.  This is just my personal opinion - if you like doing repetitive stuff for hours on end to see how the main story unfolds, then by all means go for it. I don't think it's worth the price that Steam is listing it for though.",

It appears the good people at 2K decided to go political, but not in any kind smart meaningful way. Basically, think of every negative 60s southern white stereotype then magnify it by 100. In the Mafia III world, all whites use N every other word and if you weren't a crooked cop involved in a conspiracy to keep the Black man down, you were an overalls wearing, black woman ♥♥♥♥♥♥, moonshine swilling hillbilly. I found myself actually laughing during the Dixie gang missions because it reminded me so much of Redneck Rampage(not a good thing). And again having black people on street corners with their very in depth two line conversations about LBJ and Nixon is equally as laughable. 2K's attempt to tie Mafia III to any kind of serious vietnam/civil rights commentary is akin to a 'Jack the Ripper' game trying to make the Women's Suffrage movement a large part of the storyline. Let's not forget who we are here Mafia series, let's cut to the chase. This game glorifies and celebrates the Mafia. An organization which has infected arguably the highest levels of American government, corrupting and killing untold numbers over many decades. Like GTA, Saint's Row, and others, gamers check their brains and morality at the door while pretending to be thieving mass murderers. To even attempt such political commentary in a game like this brings 2K's taste and judgement into question. When it comes to history, stick to what you know, clothes, cars, guns, and nudie magazines. The shallow end of the pool is where you should be swimming 2K, don't stray from it.",

I think if they would of added a Shadow of Mordor general type of system with mob bosses and luitenants it would of been much better.

Cons:  ~Very repetitive, for example: Missions, animations, and music that makes the game feel more like a grind than enjoyable.  ~Weird lighting that makes lakes/rivers glow like the sun when the sky is dark and cloudy.  ~Arcade feel all around. ~Classic mafia gameplay that has less features than Mafia II.

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying, that I couldn't wait to play Mafia 3. The game has a really strong start plotwise, but then the side quests kick in... And after that all you do is:  1. Pick up a mission. 2. Go to a few places, where you kill a bunch of goons and interrogate their leader to get information. Now you are being offered a choice to either spare him and add some money to your racket, or kill him and earn some cash straight away. 3. Go to a another place, that is, again filled with goons - Kill them all. 4. When you have done enough damage to lure out the racket boss, you will have to kill him and his goons.  After you've done all of this, the main story continues a bit and you get to see a cutscene. Then repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat.   The controls for the keyboard + mouse takes a little time to get used to. AI is also pretty dumb. For example, when I was interrogating a guy, another goon just stood there pointing a gun at my head, and waited for me to finish the conversation before he would react.. And when I entered a vehicle with hostile goons in it, the guys at the backseat started shooting at the driver, who I'd just thrown out of the car. There's bugs here and there, but to some of those I just can't help but to laugh at.  Some positives though. The soundtrack is really kickass. When you fire up the game, you get to hear Jimi Hendrix + the game offers many hit songs from that era. Don't want to stop driving when I hear songs by Steppenwolf, Roy Orbison, Otis Redding etc.   I will continue to play this game, but I wouldn't recommend this to players who:  1. Don't like repetitive, grindy side missions. 2. Don't want to be forced to complete side missions in order to continue the main story.  That's my 2 cents folks!",

The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay.

Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game?

As much as i want my 60fps, i can't deny that this game isnt fully playable. i've had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch.

I'm very much looking forward playing this when it gets fixed but right now there is no way I can play it when the graphics are so muddy. My vision is bad enough I'm not going to slog through this mess. They even muddied up the Steam overlay. HOW? Perhaps I'll change my review when it is fixed and can 'see' what an awesome game it is, perhaps not because really junk like this needs to be punished.  Edit 10/29/2016: After 3 weeks and 50+ hours of play I do like the gameplay but the poor performance and graphics persist. The promised patch was released quickly but didn't seem to improve a single thing. I can max out graphics or set them to low and get exactly the same poor performance and muddy graphics. Even the audio quality is poor with popping and to make it even half way reasonable sounding you have to lower the quality of your entire PC's audio to minimal. To add to the problems is a very confusing mission progression system where you have missions available but they're not really available because you haven't done something in the game yet which would actually allow that mission to be played. For example, you might have a mission to steal a truck or boat or whatever and you spend lots of time getting to that objective only to find out it isn't there because there is something else you need to do first and the game does little to nothing in explaining how this works. So you spend lots of time driving around to play missions that can't be played. I'll keep powering through the game but had I been in a refund situation to begin with I never would have kept it.

It's two years past (god, it turned out to be 3 already) we got GTA V and it's main competitors didn't capture what makes such games awesome.  It's a combination of interesting characters, fresh story and well though mechanics.  Unfortunately, Mafia 3 gets not more than 6 out of 10 on all of this points.  Characters are pretty stereotypical, considering ongoing political agenda. U got rough but means good black guy, you got sneaky and cocky CIA operative, you get couple italian, irish and black allies. And all of the enemies are sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in one or the other way. Plus exactly one main character in each side is woman. 4/10  Story is also quite boring. Seen multiple times 'I'll revenge death of my close ones, while deciding weather i'm good or bad person'. Side quests are written pretty good. You get the feel of the era, but that's about it. Final twists are actually great, but they do not overcome all the boredome of 30+ hours (2 first hours and last one are good). 6/10  Mechanics is the worst here. It seems developers got lazy or cocky or put into position of rushing the game, so you basically have couple very boring things to do. Drive around, kill or kinda-kill-interrogate (shoot, until he knees, then hold one button, then actually kill him), do it 5-10 times, kill mini-boss (same as interrogation), do all of this twice, get district, assign it to one of your allies, get some quire irrelevant perk, do it all over again 8 more times.   And yeah, to maximize your profits you actually have to drive at least 18 times all across other end of the map, make routin kill of everyone around, get into the truck and slowly ride all the way back. Oops, 20 minutes just went out of the window 17 of which are dull driving. And there is no fast travel at all.  Finishers are dull, it feels like it's 15-20 of them. Stealth gets really boring fast. Takes too much time without getting things easier. You can just stay in distance and shoot everyone with best gun you have unlocked so far.   Ocassionally you get some interesting cutscene or minigame like boxing or untying yourself, but that's it. 3/10  And I get it. It's hard to develop a lot of new and fresh mechanics on every corner of the game. Learn from GTA then. Script some great missions over and over again. Put a bomb under car. Poision drugs. Wreck a train. Steal some fuel from airport. Swap cash for guns deal. Smoke out some people on a factory. Put some fun dialogues while you driving.   But you get nothing.  Game tries to be engaging, educational, eye-opening, atmospheric, dynamic, a bit of strategic and economical, a bit of RPG and raising some moral questions. Instead it turned out to be dull and cliched.  Don't waste your money or what's most important - time. Go play GTA or FarCry 3 if you still haven't.",

It has everything required to make a good game, a interesting backstory and time, originallity and a good dev team but it falls short on every aspect but originality. The concept and story is great in theory but it does not live up to expectations in any sense of the word. The driving is too powerful, the combat is sloppy, the sneaking is just awful in general but the worst is the AI. The AI is so bad and this ruins the game.

Graphics-wise, it feels completely unfinished.  - Lots of blurriness or flat out ugly textures (even at 4600x1600 res). - Recurring visual glitches, such as a massive shadow on the ground approaching you when switching from overcast to clear day (and it swung back and forth between the two 4-5 times). - Car parked in garage before a cutscene got fused into the ground, turning it into scrap metal. - Sunlight bloom (or, well, not proper bloom, just a huge bright spot) clips through all objects, literally couldn't see the road in front of me because of it despite that it cut through a wall and a tree. - Graphics options are lacking, cant even turn off AA.  Gameplay-wise, your painfully average console game mechanics all the way.  - AI is typical, either stands and just shoots or runs to cover and peeks out to easily be killed, nothing worth mentioning. - Difficulty level doesn't mean much, since you're never pushed up on by the AI it's just a matter of hiding and waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ health regen. - One-button takedowns all the way, because apparently it's all about showing off animations rather than trying. - Melee is pretty much just running up and spamming one button. - Stealth is about as unimaginative as usual. Sneak up, takedown. Sneak up, whistle, takedown. Yawn. - Good point is that the enemies at least don't take 30 bullets each to kill. So at hard difficulty you can at least pretend that it's somewhat realistic. - Driving physics are fairly good at simulation mode. Crashing still seems to have no effect, with the other car often being pushed aside while you keep on driving like nothing happened. - Cops are surprisingly effective, they managed to pop two tyres and ram me into a river, nice stuff. Stopped chasing the moment I started swimming though, so meh.  None of this touches on the storyline, which I reckon is the game's strong point, because with max 2 hours I wanted to test as much as possible before 'playing for real' the next time around. However, there seems to be extremely few moral choices, so it appears that we're just along for the ride.",

Good graphics and tweaking abilities are a prerequisite for a AAA Gaming experience imho.  --------  So, does NO ONE care that the resolution is upscaled?  That is not glitchy graphics, that is less resolution than advertised and less as seen in the 2015 gameplay vid. Again, like in Witcher 3.  That results in blurry graphics so that even a bit further away nothing appears really sharp, rather broken down in lines, blurs and undistinguishable shapes. (no fps issues for me i7-4770K, 16GB R, 970) This bluriness becomes most obvious with moving objects, like cars.  My native resolution would be 1920x1080.   Again, the RESOLUTION IS ONLY UPSCALED FROM 720p.  And that is why I cannot recommend to buy the game, because for me that is so off, so insulting as a PC Gamer that I cannot and cannot go past the first few turns in the first mission.  So, in all honesty, this isn't only an offer you cannot refuse, this is an offer you should definately refuse until they fix the resolution, graphics, fps and principal ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porting.

Recommendation: Watch the cutscenes on Youtube, you're not missing anything in the gameplay.  Better Recommendation: Save yourself the time of watching all of that. Play the first hour of the game and then return it. When the main charcter goes 'I'm going to kill the bad guy' you've reached the end of the story. It doesn't get any more, or less, complex.

The Bad - severe fps drops (down to 4-5) all the time - the minimum hardware demands do not make sense since my hardware is right in between min and max demands and I can't run it properly (running everything on low) - the game looks far 'worse' than GTA 5 (it is not ugly, though), but it runs like a rusty bike - highly repetetive missions you need to accomplish to unlock story missions - the underboss system is a hit and miss. Miss: You unlock certain perks/favours from underbosses but have to pay for those anyways. I wouldn't call those a favour then. Also, there is talk of loyalty while there is no indication on how loyal your underbosses are.  [EDIT]- your decision to whom to give a district to is based on an arbitrary skill tree linked to each underboss, so you don't decide on characteristics but on what you want to get out of them. This obviously kills the whole vibe of a possible brawl between underbosses - if an enemy becomes aware of you he is simply a bullet sponge - every main boss is a bullet sponge - alternative open world missions are highly repetetive - story-supporting missions which do not contribute to the main story are all the same: interrogate that thugh to get to the other thug to kill the third thug. All. The. Time. - hard difficulty is a joke - you can just run from so many situations whithout a scratch - the AI (in the open world) is terrible: 'Oh, there is a body... well, probably old age!' Or: 'I heard shots and found three dead guys. Better search for ten seconds, then let it go,... just because'. Yet they know exactly where you are when throwing explosives or shooting through thickest smoke or bushes. What a joke. - enemies have deadly precision over yours - witness system: Doesn't seem to work properly during open world missions. [EDIT]- you can't, like in Mafia 2, replay your missions by choosing them from a menue. Big disappointment right there. [EDIT]- damage model of cars is not as elaborate as in games comparable to this  The Good + story missions (non-open-worlded) work great and are fun (they are linear but they function as they should!) + video clips and actors play together very well + characters are believable + music is great + the problems of racism are adressed and you as the protagonist are to do something about it + the underboss system is a hit and miss. Hit: You can call in certain favours (hit squad, operator phone shut-off, call off police) so you need to decide wisely whom to give a district to. + witness system: when people see a crime they are likely to report you. Adds tension. + different enemy types: sentry, grunt, gunner, sniper + weapons have remarkably different attributes from accuracy over mag capacity to fire rate which actually have an impact on gun fights + gun fights feel amazin due to great sounds and impactful guns, especially shotguns [EDIT]+ elaborate city with a variety of locations and territorially distinguishable landscapes [EDIT]+ I stuck to the main story and it took me about 25-27 hours. Decent.  The Verdict Shame on the developer for dishing out such an unfinished, unpolished PC version of the game. Customers pay good, hard-earned money on your product, that has been out for 21 days now. No  efficient  fix has been issued. You took a franchise which started with a masterpiece, continued with a story-strong and combat-weak Mafia II and ended in this mess. It could've been fun if you did not count so much on open-worlded story supporting mission design, which is bound to be repetetive and if you actually postponed the release for the PC version to dish out an optimized game. You decided to go against your valued customers, take their money and only get around 50% approval rates. Deserved, in my opinion.  I can't recommend this game, especially not for Mafia lovers like me. It is like with the movies - sloppy seconds are bad. Third parts following there are almost always utter garbage.",

The problem is that this game is plagued with so many issues that it makes it hard to enjoy the creative story and environment.  Let's start off with pros and then proceed to talk about the cons:  Pros:   -As previously stated, this game has a lot of potential to be game of the year. The main character, story, and setting are all top notch, but the execution is awful.  -Even though game runs with 30FPS cap, the 30 FPS was smooth for me. It's definitely playable and wasn't as distracting as I thought it would be since I'm used to playing games in 144 Hertz.  - Story is interesting, I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far. The characters are nicely designed and voice acted, and most importantly are believable.  -Gameplay is solid. Not necessarily addicting or perfect, but solid. Most guns feel good to shoot, and Melee works well most of the time.  -Sadly the positive aspects of this game are few and far between, but one last thing I want to mention I enjoy is animations and cutscenes. The cutscenes are well acted and look graphically superb to the game. The animations are very brutal and feel good to execute.  Cons:  -Awful 21:9 support. I'm playign this game on an Acer Predator X34, and the image is definitely sub par to other 21:9 games I've played this year.  -Graphics make the game look like an HD PS2 game. It was obviously not properly supported on PC to allow player with powerful hardware to take advantage of it. It feels like a lazy console port, with absolutely no benefit of playing on PC other than the promise of a future patch for 60 FPS and unlimited frame rates. Character model faces are muddy and unclear, textures are muddy, field of view is awful, anti-aliasing has no advanced options like SSAO, MSAA, or even FXAA, just low, medium, high, textures don't even have a settign to control, meaning you're stuck with what look like console textures on a game by a huge Publisher in 2016. Overall graphic options and presentation are absolutely abysmal.  -No keyboard key remapping, meaning I had to use controller since KB&amp;M controls were wonky.  -Visual glitches such as green waves covering Lincoln's face in scenes with dark shadows.  -Game crashing to desktop issue that occured for me twice in one hour, unacceptable.  Conclusion:   Had the potential to be a stellar release, but dropped the ball big time. Rushed PC port with awful visuals, unnacceptable CTD issues, and no 60FPS support at launch.  4/10 - Absolutely below average, and sadly not one of the better games of this year.",

The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it's go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I've read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already.

I have had a NPC in a car in a cut scene totally change cars after the scene stoped. Seriously day time and sunny getting into a red soft top coupe and then outside of scene night, raining, and blue sedan) Simply this is not finished. Arkam Knight ran about the same at launch and that looked a lot better...   Personally I loved Mafia 1, like Mafia 2, but this is unfinished and I find myself trying to like it. Sure the story has an end and is pretty good(NOT great), but this is a game not a book. I run a 4790k/980ti/16gigs ddr3 ram @2400, this is the only game that currently crashes for me and to retain 60fps 90% of the time I have play @1080p on med/high with AA low or low @ 1440p and sweet Fx to enable SMAA because the AA seems to be FXAA x1(low) x2(med) and blurry(High). Theres promise here, but just to many issues right now. You incandecent pc gamers do not defend this bad port or we will get even more bad ports.   Enough ranting, lets get to the graphics. I will attempt not to rant. You play as a not very at all charismatic ex Nam vet Lincoln Clay, a guy out for revenge. Boring. A black guy out for revenge. Still Boring Hanger 13. Oh the cut scenes look great. The animations are all good, but once in game it feels like not that. The animations are stiff, the people look 2010ie and the trees all look the same. The variety here is bad. From Cars/Trucks/boats(no bikes again), to the people you see. You will see them alot. The same guy infront of you maybe the same guy four people away. I feel like naming them I see them so often. Hi Dave, Hi next Dave. You will see them that much at times. Then theres the animals. Ah, the animals. I saw a gator the size of a boat grab a man in the water and he's screaming 'NO! AHHH!!!'; while it does the death roll and has him under water. Good times. Well thats it. No, really that is the only animal and each gator is a copy and paste. I can't remember seeing birds. You can correct me but I think I saw a rat in a mission but have not seen one since. You will hear dogs at times, but there are no dogs to find,(they are in the first game) no cats, no deer, no frogs. Just gators and they all look the same and will just appear when an NPC is in the water or at random and each has the same animations. (The gators are ment to be a mechanic of gameplay to hide bodies, but cops/NPC are so dumb this is useless) The enviroments are empty and are barren of a living enviroment. Textures can look ok at times and other times I stop and just look in displeasure. They don't look finished. Textures can be low res and flat. Even the best ones are equal to Just Cause 3, not anything amazing but would be fine. The reflections look broken with a series of bugs. The cars can reflect fine at times and they attempt to show their period lacquer lead sled paint reflections, but it is the chrome that is the biggest offender. It looks wrong. Just wrong. It does not follow shadows or lighting logic and it is on every car since this is the 60s. The lighting can look good. Night is the most visually pleasing time of day as you don't notice the lack in detail and the lighting is good. Lights all give off a realistic illumination. The sun does not do this. It is overly bright and foggy haze plagues the daytime. It seems to be foggy because the view distances is very low. There are like four types of trees. The trees all look the same, and a cluster of trees is imposible to walk through. Still at times I forget about these issues because it can look good at times, but glitches and poor design are just as glaring as the blinding sun reflecting off the damp street.   Gameplay is another mix up. Seriously the control feels like Saints Row. Infact the whole game is like a serious saints row or Just Cause 3 with more issues, a serious story, and less stupid fun. Car handling is ok on simulation and I just don't flat out care about the arcade setting. It doesn't fit Mafia. In Mafia 1 the not realistic car setting was the automatic trans, what is this nonsense. I want my gears and clutch back! The handling is nothing like reality. Infact the driving is just missing character that big 60s cars have. Drive a 60s Polaris wagon with a 413 Wedgehemi and you will know what I mean.(Handling over 40mph-no, 60-0 breaking-maybe until the drums get heated then nope, speed-YES!) This is like the one thing each Mafia game did well. Sorry, see I'm trying not to rant, but they forgot the manual transmission for Fords sake! G.M. Chrysler would it have been so hard! Anyway. Gameplay is like the Godfather games, so uninspired but it works. The game does have a good selection on guns, but you will only want to use a few of them. The cars that are yours since there is no garage don't add much outside of your first car and two of the preorder cars. The cars were a huge part of the other two in the series. The game is a go here kill him, go there kill them. Pick a gang faction who are really annoying and sloppily done. Dont get me wrong it is fun at times, and is ok. But just ok. NPC are so bad Saints Row/ Just Cause level. All NPC that talk are in threes, and most are either walking or waiting. Where are they walking? To wait of course. Now go shoot 'enemy number xxx' and drive fast take chances. Shooting is compentent, yet feels unfinished. The lever action shotgun has no lever action animation... So you will wait after shooting thinking you are reloaded try to shoot. Don't hit anything with a car because the damage model is horrible as well as the damage taken just seems broken.   The world of Mafia 3 is empty and deviod of things to do, but the sound is good, voice acting is great and the music is alot of my favorites. From CCR, Hendrix to Roger Miller. Very good sound track and the highlight of the game.  The story is good albiet a bit heavy at times, but now that Im done I am starting to forget a bit of it. The problem is the game is so padded that its good place to take a nap.The story is hours between capturing zones so I stopped caring who I was trying to take down. Most of the times I forgot who I was killing because there is no investment in most of the mini bosses. I had no idea who I was killing half the time in Mafia 3, nor did I give a hoot. The story eneded the way I thought, even down to the choices. It is just such a forgetable game. Mafia 1 I have not beaten that game in over ten years but I remember most of the story/missions, Mafia 2 I remember a decent bit as well. I just finished this game I remember more from Mafia 2.(that world atleast had a lot of atmosphere and felt more living) Outside of the racism there is nothing different in Mafia 3. Though I am glad they didn't shy away from racism in the 60s, it does feel over done at times; only that is what they were banking on that as the hook'different.' I have no reason to return to the game outside of dlc. There is nothing to do, and since it runs like a fat kid in the woods with no shoes and look like a 360 port; the visuals don't make me want to return. The cut scenes are done well but the expierence is plagued with averageness inbetween.   I know what your thinking you charming pc users. Hey hot pants, do you recommend it. There is one glarring issue above all others and the reason I say DO NOT RECOMMEND;. It's not the chrome, the same missions all the time, or even the lifeless world. When you finish the game there is nothing to do and I mean nothing, but look at everything wrong with the game sadly.",

(I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I'm now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don't buy it now, it's a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.",

The 30fps is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, sure, but I would be able to look passed that if it was polished elsewhere. However, the texures are abysmal, and the pop-in is horrendous. Even If I dismissed those glaring problems as well, I would still be left disappointed. Due to the 30fps, I'm playing with a controller, as I find the framerate more managable that way. But, I have to put up with the missing button prompts. Not even the 'controller layout' page shows the button mapping.

So heres my good thoughts - The characters and story are fantastic - The combat is brutal and fun - I admit there are a few graphical issues but all in all it looks good - The missions and I will elaborate later - THE SETTING AND SOUNDTRACK OH MY GOD - Weapons and cars are pretty neat - Playboy magazines - Vito Scalleta  Those are just a few of my good thoughts theres more like you can feed people to aligators. Now for some of the bad things - There are performance issues and no there is no more 30 fps lock so those salty nerds who probably couldnt get to 60 anyway should shut up - Depth of field issues that takes the games beauty away - The missons and again I will elaborate - The cars don't feel like the 60's  - Cassandra (I did not give any districts to her) rekt  There are more that I can't think of for both good and bad.   DO NOT COME INTO THIS GAME WITH MAFIA 2 EXPECTATIONS I FEEL THEY ARE 2 COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT GAMES AND AGAIN I WILL ELABORATE  To start the elaboration, the missons. MY honest opinion is its just ok. I do feel like im taking over a racket in a mob and it feels good. The objectives is probably what you would actually have to do to take down a major crime boss. Again it depends on the person, I loved the missions and doing all the different things to take down a racket and yes at times I did think it was getting repetitve but I still really enjoyed how you take these districts one by one and assign them to your sub bosses. Heres a roadmap of what you'll be doing in Mafia III - Talk to Donovan about the rackets - Talk to shmucks who know how to take down the rackets  - Kill enforcers, steal money, and basically tear apart the rackets and kill the leaders of them - The boss of the district comes to party - Stab him many times All in all, I think the missions are fine because they also all interwine with the story and the main goal.   Now time to elaborate on the other thing. DO NOT come into this game hoping its mafia 2 cause even I knew it wasnt going to be just because of what they had lincoln clay doing. You do not actually run a mafia or a mob your taking down one with former gang and mob bosses (Vito Scalleta).   So those are my thoughts. I could have deeply explained the story like a regular review but I was just tired of people crap on this pretty good game.  I would wait til a small price drop maybe to $40 dollars I would give the game about a 7.5/10 ish maybe 7 or 8 if these performance issues are fixed  Thanks for reading and I really hope this helped!

Then once the district boss is dead you fully assign the district to one of the three.  I knew I said I wouldn't make it long but I thought I had to describe that down so people would see how boring it is.  The other bad to the game is - Side missions are like taking over districts they're extremely repetitive as well No real customisation to vehicles No clothe stores instead wear the same thing for the whole playthrough Shops out in the open have no real use they're just there for nothing instead of holding playboy mags etc No complexity to owning districts Graphics are far from impressive Draw distance in the game isn't good Bugs galore all over the place you'll find weird happenings whilst playing Driving is debatable but I dislike it I feel like the car physics is awful and often found myself dreading having to drive which brings me to the next issue No fast travelling instead you have to travel from A to Z all by yourself very time consuming which would explain why the game lasted as long as it did for me Story was quite bland the one priest blabbing away about Lincoln in the present about Lincoln in the past but nobody really cares it jumps from present to past so often and I feel like they hurt their story by not keeping it in the past telling the story the way they did didn't improve anything it just made things confusing and jumped all over the place they could have easily jumped to a final clip of the priest in his present days at the end of the game that would have been the right touch to finish the story off instead of jumping from cutscenes willy nilly.

That's on a GTX1080 and i7 4790k 16GB RAM. The game is visually pretty bland, the textures aren't very detailed and there's a blurry quality to the whole game. For my playtime the lighting was broken and outside scenes would slightly lighten and darken at random. GTAV looked a lot better and ran better too, this game needs some patchwork before it's recommended.",

            "review_text": "Not sure what to say, bit frustrated as it's crashed 3 times and lost my saves so have to go back to last mission - ok when it happens once, but 3 times is not fun.  Other than that the game seems good, nice graphics and sounds, the AI is a bit crap at times and when you have many enemies, thery showe up then they dont (when you do the scan mode)   I cannot recommend this game at the moment which is a shame as Mafia II was excellent :/   If they fix the crashes and AI then I will change my rating!  This feels like it was rushed out (like so many games these days)  A few days later and it's still crashing guys, and there is so many little bugs - see my screenshots - I have done many missions but the final objective is missing, its happened 3 times now  I have now asjed for help from 2K as the game shows things like objectives that are not yet ready to do, but the wording is still in the game, so you spend time looking for the object.  2K have responded and their reply is its my computers fault, and it maybe down to DirectX etc - laughable and useless reply!   I am still enjoying playing and the game is good, its just frustrating with the amount of bugs.  The music makes the game worth playing tbh, its got a great soundtrack on a few radio sdtations :)",

            "review_text": "I don't reccomend this game at all and here's why:    The first two hours of the game is basically a tutorial teaching you how it works and the first full mission, so by the time you realize you don't want the game anymore it's too late to get a refund    If you like the first full mission then your gonna like this game just as much because the whole thing is a copy and paste of that mission    There's nothing extra like changing clothes, haircut, etc. so you can't do anything other than copy paste missions    I couldn't continue playing because I had to see what else there is to the game so after doing some research I found that it's the same thing 36 times (thanks to angry joe doing the math)    Even if there weren't the uncountable amount of bugs in this game it still doesn't feel finished     Even bigger of a disappointment than watch dogs because at least watch dogs had some variety in the things you can do and at the least different colored outfits    There is absolutely nothing other than guns and ammo to spend your money on, making money almost worthless since there isn't anything actually cool to buy    But you don't actually even have to buy weapons as every mission I have played has been beat using weapons I find on the ground  I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I'm unable to get a refund because by the time I realized that this game was ♥♥♥♥ and actually hurts to play through because of how repetetive it gets, it was already 9 hours because like I said earlier the first two hours isn't an accurate representation of how the game really is. I had more fun in the tutorial than in the real game, but even looking past the dullness of this game you still get a buggy, unfinished, early access game. The positives of this game are that:    It looks pretty good    The first mission is strong    The story was good (until you start getting tired of the game and feel no motivation to continue)  I honestly can't think of any other positives that I would include in this game.

What a farce the first thing I noticed was that as the game launches the backlighting on my keyboard &amp; mouse turns off. I plugged in my orbweaver after 20 minutes fapping round rebooting and that time the keyboard lights went off but the orby and the backlights on my mouse stayed on. I never had this hassle with any other game before. Anyway after I got into the game for a bit the keyboard lit up in some weird color but better than notheing so I disconnected orby. Keyboard lights work intermittently altho mouse lights now seem OK. Then got into a loop in the tutorial whereby map opened then when that closed went bak to tutorial screen again no way out back &amp; forward btween the screens but no game. Eventually fixed that by connecting up 360 controller - again after much fapping around. Then I got about 15 minutes of gaming (most of which was watching cutscenes - yuk) before big crash to desktop during firefight. What? restart n go thru it all again. This game should never have been shipped in this alpha state there are just too many bugs in it. I played all mafia games (1&amp;2) with KB &amp; M plus all GTA plus the great 'sleeping dogs', none of them required musical controllers which breaks immersion and makes the game a drag.",

Voice acting and soundtrack are on point as usual for the Mafia series.  Despite the weapon combat mechanic being a lil clunky, the sound design and animations have been impressive so far, along with the realistic facial structures of the characters, you'd beleive they were genuine citesens.  Anyway, when you take into account the recent flood of borderline scam releases, theres no way this game deserves so many negative ratings over a temporary frame lock.   ",
