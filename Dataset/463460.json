            "review_text": "Report on Resette’s Prescription Advantages:  Resette’s Prescription(RP) have his universe and the story is really easy to understand even for me who haven’t a really good level at English.  The combine system is a really good idea! The gameplay is really simple and you enter in the story directly (no long introduce like some games).  The graphics is special but good, the protagonist is endearing and cute, what allow the players to have more pleasure.  The puzzle is not too hard, not too easy, a perfect difficulty! And the “battle time” is really good!(maybe make a life bar for the enemies and more battle phase!). Disadvantages:   Really short game, you can rush it in less than 2 hours.  Many bugs :  -Clic can pass 2 sentences, not only one.  -at the chapter 6, the game has RAM.  -at the end of chapter 5, after the cut scène, the chapter 6 cannot load. -at the first puzzle, when you at on the generator before put the things in, you can’t leave the place after. When you save, you save only the place where you are, for example for the chapter 5, if you have the bug, if you reload it, you reload at the beginning of this chapter (thanks to the “skip” button) Conclusion:  RP is good but can be much better! He has a good potential what ask to be use! Great work but work in progress.",
