            "review_text": "Breaking the review into two parts, SP and MP; I'll be trying more multiplayer and might update part of the review:  SP:  The story is ♥♥♥♥. Nothing about it is redeeming, not even Kevin Spacey. There are lines of dialog that don't make sense (to name one, the two 'best friends' have a conversation in the first cutscene that only non-friends would have), there are actions that simply don't make sense (One hilarious example: The female chick has a fight with a guy who doesn't have an EXO suit. Even though she punches a dent into a car's hood, she can't overpower the guy), and the set pieces are too... restrictive.   It seems like whenever a COD game wants to introduce something it can only do it for 5 minutes. Assassin's Creed does this and it is getting really, really annoying when something that is generally fun is only used for 5 minutes.  Now, why do modern shooters feel the need to tell me to 'Follow' a character? For 90% of the game, I was able to run ahead of characters, only hitting an invisible wall, while they yapped about stuff that was unimportant.  And the last thing I wanna ♥♥♥♥♥ about is this EXO suit. Do not compare it to the suit from Crysis or the jump pack from Titanfall because it certainly is not. Just like other COD games, the EXO suit feels like a knock off idea that never goes anywhere. I never used the suit's powers once during the story mode unless it told me. Unlike Titanfall or Crysis, the suit used really does feel tacted on at the last minute.  MP:  Let's talk about this EXO suit a little more because the faults become a lot more glaring in multiplayer. Pro tip for the devs: Don't say 'parkour' then add ledges to a map which you CANNOT grab. Every single map in this game was designed WITHOUT the EXO suit in mind. I can't tell you how many times my EXO suit jump couldn't reach a ledge or tried to grab a ledge that was just decoration.  The maps are too small. Titanfall had larger levels with the same amount of people, 6 on 6. THe chances of getting shot in the back were lower to almost non-existent due to the distance between respawn locations. This just isn't the case with this COD. I think 70% of my deaths were respawn, wait 2 seconds, get shot in the back.  Nothing about the weapons or EXO suit 'abilities' are unique. Again, let's look at Titanfall! There are three abilities: Cloak, Sprint, and Wallhack. Cloak isn't too great on players, but makes you invisible to Titans; Sprint lets you run faster for a bit and regen faster; and wallhack lets you... wallhack for a bit. There are nearly triple abilities in COD:AW, yet none of them are special while some are outright useless. Do you want extra health that doesn't help, or what about an ability that makes you hover slowly for an enemy to kill you? No, of course not.  There are a lot of weapons and, just like the previous CODs, a lot of them could have been cut from the game. Some are better than others right out of the box, which makes me wonder why bother putting them in.  Oh, and I hope you like Team Deathmatch, because that's all people play and there are 0 unique modes which are worth it.  Final thoughts: This is a $20 game. If the asking price is higher, don't bother. If you want a real parkour game with innovation to the COD formula, go get Titanfall.  edit: grammar error that was bothering me.",

Horrible hit detection: For me I experienced dying in 1 or 2 shots. Before I got to react at all. 2. Horrible gun balance  3. Scorestreaks: The score steaks in this game are pathetic and useless... Non of which became helpful except for UAV. 4. Spawns: The spawns are absuletely ridiculous... To the point where enemies spawn behind me. 5. No dedicated servers: The lag is absolutely horrible! I experience it in nearly every game! And still! No dedicated servers! What's the point on buying the next call of duty if they never have dedicated servers?   I give up on CoD... I KNOW they'll do the same thing again and just rip up the same problems that have happened for years.  CoD Sucks.",

            "review_text": "I haven't picked up a Call of Duty game since the original Black Ops. I figured I would give this one a try, so here is my quick little review.  Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is nothing new, nothing special, and won't blow your mind. Though, I guess this is what we have come to expect from a Call of Duty game. It's the same formula that has been used since the 4th installment, so if that's what you like, then this may be the game for you.  [STORY] I'd like to talk a little about the campaign, then I'll get into multiplayer. The single player lasts about 5 to 6 hours. 30 minutes of this consists of loading. The game forces you to watch the whole cutscene, while only loading the game halfway, then loading the rest after. If you decide to change your graphics settings in game, you have to rewatch the cutscene and wait for it to load again. Once you find your optimal settings, this isn't much of an issue, but still irrtating. (Edit: There is an option in settings that allows the game to fully load during cutscenes, but apparently makes them choppy)  The story itself is bland and predictable, there aren't any memorable characters, and it feels like the game is just trying to rush you through the story so you can hurry up and get to the multiplayer. There isn't any switching between players in this one. You play as the same guy throughout the whole story. The aspect of early Call of Duty games where the story follows multiple characters is one I miss tremendously.  Once again the missions are very short, play out as turkey shoots, and anti-climactic. Don't expect any massive battles or epic sequences in this installment. Just save your money and watch a let's-play on YouTube.  But we know you aren't in it just for the single-player..  [MULTIPLAYER] Same stuff, different maps and weapons. Oh, and boost jumping.  If you love running in circles, getting shot in the back, and smashing the 'F' key repeatedly, then get this game. As I mentioned before, it's the same game. Go grab Titanfall for $10 and play the mode without mechs.   The new feature for Advanced Warfare is the Exo-suit abilities. Some are kind of neat, some are gimmicky. It does give a bit more variety to how you'd like to play, but I typically find them quite useless. There are also tons of player customization option. Does anyone actually look at that stuff in game?   Guns.. The guns are awful. The sounds of the guns are awful. All the weapons seem impractical and weak. The shotguns are neat, but that's about it. Oh, and again with the sounds. They just don't sound like there is any power to them. I feel like I'm shooting a little bb gun.  The maps are your typical Call of Duty maps, but some change slightly. Though it might as well just be another map, because the change is pointless. One of the maps is a volcano, and it makes it seem like you need to hurry and get through the blast doors or it's game over. But you just die and spawn on the other half of the map anyway. It's another gimmick. That's what Call of Duty is good at. Gimmicks.  I can't recommend Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, at least not for the price they are asking. There are plenty of other games to play, so please save your money. If I missed anything, or if you have questions, please feel free to ask me.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR It's all rush and no tactics. Gets boring fast. Lag is horrible. Seems intentional. Big disappointment.   First, my credentials: I'm a Call of Duty veteran who has played FPS since before the first Call of Duty with over 2 thousand hours in MW2 and over 2.5 thousand hours MW3 and countless unrecorded hours of previous installments since before joining Steam.  I was absolutely consumed with the series because it was the best mix of game and realism when it comes to simulating REAL GUN FIGHTING. So many elements of gun fighting were implemented inside a video game format that even when the fun dried up because the game got old, you could still get that competitive high when going against other human beings in what felt like a fair, calibrated and superbly fleshed out system which rewarded the player that can best balance offensive AND defensive tactics. When a player is all run-n'-gun and you are carefully creeping around corners to counter his arrogance and negligence, you will get the kill most of the time. When all you do is camp in a corner, the offensive player will always get the drop on you (if he knows how to check corners and slice the pie.) There was balance, it was beautiful.   Increasingly, however, with every new installment, the formula for the system kept changing the balance further and further to reward only offensive and irrational gun fighting gameplay. If you can squeeze every last drop of adrenaline your brain can processes every single game, great, you're going to do well with the new exo movements. But those that want to move cautiously and methodically, carefully, tactfully, masterfully, you're out of luck because the game, coupled with what I personally believe is INTENTIONALLY implemented systematic delay, (lag), you will lose. You will lose constantly. Even when you have your sights perfectly aligned with where the enemy will appear. Even if you see him on one end of the wall, running around the back side to pop out of the other end where you know exactly where he's going to be, as you're already sending the message from your brain to your finger to click right when he's about to pop out of the event horizon (disregard the astronimic reference) he will still take you down.   Why?  Because, take it from someone with an unhealthy amount of time devoted to this series, these games are now designed for children to who get a rush out of taking another player down no matter the reason. Activision doesn't see why it's so important to have narrative, rhyme and reason, behind every take down. All they care about is to get as many kids to buy their game and weed out experienced methodical players. Why? Because crazy, ADHD, dopamine junkies do not want to try and commit to strategy and tactics and skill development which takes time and dedication. Activion wants to make these kids feel like gods with the first round they play so they keep buying the games and buy the expansion packs. (which, by the way, further divide the player base, leading to no one being able to play together, diluting the amount of games people can play together, leading to poor connections and lack of games at all. Nice job shooting yourself in the foot Activision.) Experienced, seasoned, methodical, tactful players will win in a fair gun fight, every, single, time.  This isn't good for business, so it makes sense from a business point of view. You don't want newcomers to be turned away because they suck. WHICH THEY SHOULD. THEY JUST STARTED. So this leads me away from my rant and back to informing you with what's going on.  Do you want to play a game where you're just jumping around, rushing and spraying everything that moves? Get this game, you'll have fun. Do you want to be systematic and outsmart your opponents by punishing them every time for rushing irrationally and risking their lives so non chalantly? Nope. Not for you. You can't. You will get 4 hitmarkers in before hitting the ground the majority of the time.  This is only slightly better than Ghosts.  Oh, which reminds me. Ghosts was a beta for this. You'll see it when you look at the gun models. ESPECIALLY with how the AK reloads. It's identical. Ghosts was an extract to get one more game out to fill the gap while AW was still developing for those 3 long years I, like other serious CoD players, have been waiting for another substantial, quality installment.   TL;DR It's all rush and no tactics. Gets boring fast. Lag is horrible. Seems intentional. Big disappointment.  ---APPENDAGE---  By reading some of these replies, it seems I have to remind some readers, about my point of simulating real gun fighting, that it was THE MIX of both the game and gun fighting simulation that was excellent. Of course this game's not as realistic as Battlefield, but Battlefield isn't as much of an arcade. However, I should still point out that I do believe Call of Duty, namely, Modern Warfare 1, 2 and 3, does have decent adaptation in simulation gun fighting.   Here's one big example:  In the real world, if you're ADSing down a path and I pop out of a corner running, you get a huge advantage since all you need to do is adjust your aim and pull the trigger whereas I have to stop and then pull up my weapon to aim. By then I'm dead.   Modern Warfare and even Black Ops, was able to handle that just fine. Lag made it a bit harder but you could still overcome it if you're experienced enough with the mechanics of the game.  Ghosts and Advanced Warfare are disgracefully poor in replicating this scenario. The rusher has way more advantage. Most of which is to blame on the lag. The encounters in both of these games feel very flimsy by comparison. Previous titles had much more control. More in Black Ops, and even more in Modern Warfare. I think people have previously spoken to this topic with the idea of the 'speed' of the game.  In Ghosts and Advanced Warfare, ♥♥♥♥'s happening all over the place, you can't hear anything, there's no situational awareness except UAV and gunfire. At least in Modern Warfare 3, you could hear the enemy.  Another good way to describe what I'm trying to say is, the older the title, the more capability there was when it came to counter attacks. When an enemy is rushing and attacking, but you're able to know it before having to actually see them, you can counter their action by placing your coming action (like aiming your rifle or running another direction to dodge) before their expected action.  Counter attacks are just far too difficult to be made practical in Ghosts and Advanced Warfare. Again, these games feel very flimsy and cheap. Modern Warfare feels more full, substantial and fleshed out.",

            "review_text": "In my honest opinion, this is probably the best CoD in years, probably since MW1 as it was refreshing to play a CoD that tries to be different. There are some interesting weapons, such as EM-1 laser beam cannon that is inspired from Unreal Tournament's Link Gun which is a lot of fun to use while they also introduced double jumps, dodge moves, mid air dodge that does make this CoD a lot faster than its predecessors. The maps are generally well designed with some has gimmicks, like there is a map that is set under the Golden Gate Bridge where there will be a tsunami flooding the map half way which does make the pacing to be a bit different. Also, the maps also offers plenty opportunities to jump and vault around as they do offer more vertical than previous games which is a very welcome change.  However, I still would not recommend this game because of the peer to peer multiplayer systems it uses. The netcode seemed to be poorly implemented with a lot of inconsistency in ping and stability. At this time and age, I do think that games should be shipping with dedicated servers, not laggy inconsistent peer to peer. Due to the poor netcode, most multiplayer matches has been quite a frustrating experience. I could get a smooth game in one match, then, the next match becomes a laggy fest with a lot of minor teleporting and shots that isnt registered by the game.   The campaign is alright, as it is the same run of the mill CoD campaign you expected: Linear, explosive and occasionally surprises you with some smart gadgets. Dont expect much innovations or interesting changes in this one. Kevin Spacey's performance in the game is pretty good though.  At the bottom line, I do not recommend this game. As a game that is predominantly a multiplayer experience, one should not pay a fortune for a laggy and subpar experience.",
