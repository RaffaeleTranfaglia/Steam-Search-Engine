For every tactically thrilling fight or interesting side quest, there’s a dull slog-fest and excruciating piece of dialogue to put up with first. The developer has the technical aspects down fine, but could have improved the experience greatly by hiring a professional writer and spending a bit more time varying and balancing the card effects. 4,99€ while sales = 7/10.",

Especially towards the end, some sentences are simply inconsistent or have basic grammatical mistakes. This is actually surprising since the game held up so well until the last third of it.  Anyway, I'll be keeping an eye out for the dev's future games.",

I didn't mind the errors, which were trivial in the grand scope of things. Overall, I was disappointed with the errors, and some of the grammar, and some spelling was a little off. However, like I said, this game is addicting. The only true disappointment in this game is that it took a mere 10-11 hours to finish. I found myself wanting more, and hope they release a small patch for the erros, grammar, and spelling. In summary, while certain small issues were evident, the game as a whole is good. Hopefully, they'll patch the game when they release the expansion, which I hope they do.",
