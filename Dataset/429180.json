For the control, i don't blame people for using a gamepad, but you will get the worst experience ever, ZONDA is really special, it's like doing rodeo with a rhinoceros, don't expect too much..You can't press a simple button....I recommend you a wheel... For the graphics, azur coast is one of my favorite track, i expected something better but that's ok for me, it's not really important, you don't have time for watching everything with all these bends. 3GB, free and PAGANI edition, what else ?

Very hard to keep straight and avoid spinning but once I learned to not go full throttle all the time and especially to slow down a lot for bends it started to become enjoyable and made me want to learn. For a freebie to have a quick race it's great. Excellent graphics. I would love to have a go VR stylee but simply cannot afford it and will not be able to for a good while, living in hope that the prices will come down a lot in the not too distant future. Beautiful Cars Good Graphics Realistic Great Price (Free) VR (for those with vive or rift) Recommended ",

            "review_text": "I'm very happy that there was an opportunity to play 'Project Cars' for free, after deliberation on whether to add this to my collection or not, I finally have my answer.  It's not going to be a purchase for me.  Racing games are held in a market at the moment where the big titles cover pretty much all corners of the racing genre. from Dirt, NFS, Forza, GT. Project Cars offers nor brings anything new to the table, nothing stands out and it does very little to try. Simulation is done better elsewhere as is arcade racing.  The graphics on the cars are nice, however it's painfully obvious that's where the team have spent most of their time. The cockpit modes are beautifully detailed with the ability to actually take a view inside the drivers helmet and a rare mid-seat (between driver and passenger) view. However car detail is already something Forza nailed 3 editions ago, shiny cars is not a big selling point anymore, NFS have been doing it for years.  This means the enviroments of the tracks are not as well established as the cars, there is something eerily arcadey about the graphics I can't quite describe. It could possibly be the over saturation of the colours that gives the vibes of Ridge Racer rather than Gran Turismo.  The car mechanics are serviceable, the power cars rip from your grip if your not gentle on the gas. It's nice to lose control if your not paying attention. However this seems to be a little bit on the sensitive side, a steady pace on a straight will not send a car suddenly veering off into a 360 spin if the controls are not handled.   Something with the reverse of some of the cars is also off, they seem to have the turning circle of a cruise ship. Trying to reverse in a 180 can find your car taking a long time to actually move in any angle of note and ram from one side of the track to another. It's like controlling a 1 wheeled shopping cart.  The many configurations for major racing wheels and other lower market ones are great, if you use a wheel it's likely to have an option for you.  In summary it suffers from the lack of any real purpose. It adds nothing other titles haven't already covered, instead ticking all the tropes the genre has done time and time again including an overused cliche talking menu. Very Dirt 3.  5/10    ",

In the trash it goes.  It's cool but Dirt does it better minus flashbacks. In a simulation we expect full damage models, not just the calculations.  Unless they cut something from this demo i didn't see... My car souldn't be perfect after smashing into a barrier at 120 mph with full damage on.  If it's what you're into, go for it. Depth yes. Precision yes. Cool factor... meh. Worth it? Hard to say. Unless you are an entusiast with all the best hardware for driving.",

It started well and promising, but then, and quite often during the race, the game would suddenly slow down/lag for a few seconds, I mean graphics would freeze, after which the game engine seemingly would want to catch up with the lost frames and would speed up. Not sure I could correctly describe the phenomenon, but maybe you get the idea. That lag totally screws up the game experience.

The game is a bit too real with the driving physics when you actually control it, except for when you randomly drive up and over cars. The default controls are the weirdest I've seen from any game. The graphics can be stunning, but I'm not able to use it. The developers should try to make the coding more efficient so the game lags less, that should be their focus. Should add coarses, add currency, and add street racing. Again AMAZING GRAHPICS. Needs work.",
