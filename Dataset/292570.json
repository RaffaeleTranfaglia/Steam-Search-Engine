            "review_text": "The first things I noticed before playing were how bright and vivid the graphics were, and how the characters were crisp and animated nicely. The neon-colored characters on a white menu took me aback at first but I quickly adjusted. While short, the action was fast and busy. The targets changed every so often which kept everyone on their toes. My few complaints would have to deal with the level design. Each screen has a different look and feel to them, but some just don’t seem a good fit. The multiplayer is really competitive and a lot of fun.All in all, Chompy Chomp Chomp was a fun and amusing game. The pace and action kept everything fun but it’s best to bring 3 others friends along if you wish to experience the full potential of this title. A nice buy if you want to have a fun and fast session with friends or family.",

I've tried it for just a bit but it was enought to capture the essence of the game, it's really good, funny, relaxing: you try to eat the others and run to not be eaten xD also the fact that the color change it a great idea, so time to time with a random rotation you will have a different objective and viceversa, this make it really interesting to play, and don't foget the thing you find along the way and to avoi the poison!!! With different maps and the funny design of these tiny monsters you can't be wrong, you will have fun.",

            "review_text": "This game sucks hard. Clearly console ripoff. The controls are given in console commands and are not configurable. It forces you to only use 1 hand but to use WASD and then V often, which isn't super easy to use as often as they want you to and saying that you have another free hand and almost any other button is easier to use it was a design error. Other giant problem is the game is boring and repetitive. You run around chasing things that you eat if you touch them and try not to get eaten by someone else. That is the entire game. Not a fun party/multiplayer game in the least bit. 2/10.",

Basically for multiplayer, it's a game running around the playground eating enemies while avoiding been eated. Simply as that. There's the arcade mode for a single player but it's hardly any interesting.  For what it's given, I can't really recommend this game. Maybe it's fun as a multiplayer game, for some quick matches, otherwise I don't see much more value on this game.",
