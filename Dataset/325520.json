            "review_text": "For a Daedelic game I was quite dissapointed.   The artwork is really fun, and the soundtrack is good, but some of the puzzles are quite abstract, I would often look at an object and not know what it is, leading to random clicking to find out where to go or what to do. It felt as if they tried to save time developing multiple language packs so they just invented stuff. The videos make it look better than it is.  As others have mentioned the game is also really short (I would recommend getting it on sale).",

The puzzles are a bit out there but some trial and error will make you solve them eventually. I would say easier/less frustrating puzzles than the old point and click adventure games.  It's a short game but it's just enough to not become stale/tedious.   Got it rather cheap during a sale, but the price they are asking is more than fair for what you get.  ",

I suggest getting it on sale, but it's worth the price. I love the humor and the story. Yes, some of the puzzles are abstract, but the the walkthrough helps, and they are solvable still. I had a lot of fun with this game. Recommended!",

While I enjoyed playing it, it was not as good as some of the other adventure games. Get this one on sale or as part of a bundle.",
