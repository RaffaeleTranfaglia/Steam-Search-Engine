    "description": "&quot;SUPER DISTRO&quot; is a hard-as-nails 2D platformer in the style of retro games such as Megaman, Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels and other such rage-inducing classics. Taking &quot;Difficult gameplay&quot; to a whole new level - SUPER DISTRO is not for the faint-of-heart. The weak need not apply.",

First of all the graphics are quite ugly and I don't mean in a cool retro way, the game is just ugly. The enemies and locations lack originality and don't make any sense at all.  'Super Distro' is a challenging game but that does not make it a good game. The reason why it's so difficult is mainly because of the horrible controls, enemies are often on spots where you can't even shoot them without getting hit.   If that doesn't get you frustrated there's still the terrible music playing on the background which plays in a loop of 6 seconds or something.  The best thing about this game is probably the price (currently 9 cents!) so you can still sell the steam trading cards.",

Difficult games are not fun by themselves. They need to rely on other factors such as good music, graphics, and unique gameplay mechanics to keep the gamer hooked on their game. Super Distro *ahem* sorry, SUPER DISTRO does not have any of these factors.   The first level music is one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard. The graphics are bland. The gameplay is just jumping and shooting enemies hoping you don’t get hit by their bullets. The main character is faceless with one mundane death animation. The game flat out refuses to teach you the controls. And no, this isn’t some kind of learning curve. Some gamers are going to use a keyboard to play their game and they have dozens of keys to try before figuring out the E key is the correct key to fire bullets.   Overall, this game tries way too hard to prove that it is difficult rather than proving than it is a good game. For something that advertises itself as “rage inducing” the only emotion I feel is pity for the developer. They don’t care that their game is good, they care that their game is hard. ",

And kudos for the guides for free HP refills (press asterisk key on numpad)  The only remotely good thing about this game is it has trading cards and at least has a borderless windowed mode. Honestly they should have changed the character to an image of the 'cover art' so i can watch it repeatedly drop into the black abyss and die.",

But the one thing that all GOOD hard games have in common is precise, responsive controls.   If a game does not have pinpoint control then it becomes hard for all the wrong reasons and that is the problem with this game. The control in this game is among the worst I have ever seen, your character moves like he is walking through molasses and the jump button is incredibly unresponsive. The first section of the game has some pretty basic platforming, by all standards jumping from platform to platform here should be easy, the platforms are nice and big so there is no real way to over or under shoot your jumps, but due to the horrific controls this section is borderline impossible.  I have no idea if this game has potential or not, what I do know is in its current state it is completely unplayable, avoid this game no matter how cheap it gets(I think I spent 50 cents on it and I feel robbed).",
