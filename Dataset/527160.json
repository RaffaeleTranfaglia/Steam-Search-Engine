            "review_text": "Wow finally.... A good and complete VR CInema program!  One of the biggest reasons I bought my Oculus Rift CV1 was because I loved to watch movies in VRcinema 3d back at the DK1 days, but when I bought the CV1, I saw VR Cinema 3d was no longer able to download and not optimzed for new VR headsets like the Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. For that my quest to a new VR cinema started, and I haved used Bigscreen, VorpX Movie mode, (which is actually quite good, but its not a cinema experience), Oculus Video, and even Cineveo, but neither of them gives me the quality and immersive feeling of a real cinema as this!   Finally some fine controls, decent file browsing, native Rift and Vive support, inapp view reset, easy navigation, and some cinema interaction which ALL other cinema apps are missing. And more things I am missing from other apps like Youtube integration which is awesome, and... seat change ability! Its not the walking around in the cinema feeling like VR CInema3D had, but finally this feature is back.   More features are coming to make this the best, most immersive, and complete VR CInema app at the moment, really loving it at the moment. (funny thing is that they showed the new Star Wars movie and Game of Thrones, and I actually was planning to watch them on VR cinema.. :P )",

            "review_text": "**(Update)** Something I for got to mention in the review, the screenshots on the store page for this are just a lie. The actual app dosent even come close to looking as good as those screenshots. Also thers no suport for anything other than youtube or video files on your PC. That means no netflix, no amazon, no hulu, and not even dvd or blu ray playback.   This App has 3 MAJOR problems  1)The enviornment settings are a joke. You have very little options when it comes to where your sitting. On top of that you have no control over lighing or anything else in this app  2)The sound. If your going to create a cinema sim then you should simulate the sound of one. The sound is the same as iff you where watching it on your monitor.   3)The picture quality is horrid. The vive and oculus just wernt mad for this sort of thing. I tried everything from youtube to a 4k UHD movie i have saved on my hard drive and it looks like dookie. It looks like a game from the 90s with no anti-aliasing.   The fact that ther are apps that do what this dose for free says something about the devs. If this was a free app or maybe a few bucks then id say its worth it but even at half off this is a mony grab rip off.   I cant say this loud enough, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.",
