            "review_text": "This doesn't feel anything like The Walking Dead. After the tutorial you very quickly realize that, fun game as 'the Escapists' was, it's mechanics have nothing to do with survival and don't translate well. You are constantly trapped in the daily routine cycle, doing tedious work that isn't improving your situation in any way - a core mechanic that prevents you from playing the actual game!  Crafting is working as in its predecessor, though again it doesn't feel like surviving when you have to craft a pickaxe to break through a wall to find a key to open another door... I've found a few interesting items though no idea and hints how to craft them so far.  The game daily respawns loot inside containers (so literally next to your bed - survival, yay), so the only motivations you have to go out is to find the damn key that prevents you from progressing.  And the level design is horrible. Long roads that make the short amount of time between routines even shorter, rooms you can get trapped in and have to reload a save, and those damn locked rooms that can only be entered with the right key that is hidden somewhere. I constantly get the feeling that everything has been designed for length instead of fun.   TL;DR - Prison break mechanics don't make for a fun survival game. If you haven't played 'The Escapists' get it instead.",

            "review_text": "Let me start off with saying, that I love 'The Escapists'. Personally, I think this game could do with  some  many improvements and bug fixes. To make things clear, I'll use the Pros and Cons List.  PROS -Unique Concept  CONS -Buggy Tutorial -Strange Controls -Graphics (I'll talk about this later) -Tutorial Lacking Vital Information -Wonky Combat System  That's it for the pros and cons, now to explain why I chose the cons.   Buggy Tutorial:  Your clicking on stuff the game tells you to click on is pretty much random if you actually perform the action. As an example, I kept clicking with the shovel in the underground section to dig straight up, on the 100th or so click, it finally worked.   Strange Controls:  In the original 'The Escapists', you had to open a menu to equip clothes and weapons, and I liked that. In this game, you have to select the weapon in your hotbar, and press 'E' to equip it. Another strange control change, to stand on desks in the original game, you just had to walk into it. Here, you must press 'F' to stand on the desks. You also use 'F' to give NPCs items. What happened to the give mechanic?   Graphics:  I'm so going to get screamed at for this... The graphics look like someone took them straight from the Xbox One version of the original game. Oh wait... What I'm trying to say here, is that I want the graphics to look more like 'The Escapists' on PC. Save these ones for the Xbox One release.   Tutorial Lacking Vital Information:  The tutorial lacks information on the Threat Meter, the Health Meter, and the Energy Meter. These are important. I kept wondering why people won't follow me when I clicked on them. (Because that's how you make them follow you. What happened to the 'Q' key? Oh wait, they used that to dismiss people. Wow.)   Wonky combat System:  In this game, the combat system is like if Team Fortress 2 was 2D. There's no Lock-On like in the original game, and there's barely any feedback that you actually hit an enemy. (Besides a quiet noise, and a tiny health bar below.)   That's it for my review, I'll list the score below, but before that, I want to say that If Team17 updates this game in any way that will make me change my review, then I will.  MY SCORE FOR THE ESCAPISTS: THE WALKING DEAD IS... 39%",

            "review_text": "I think this game is AWSOME!! But there is one thing I think they should add MULTIPLAYER! The reason is, first of all the new escapist has the multiplayer mode which is great so why could this game have multiplayer too? Imagine the survival mode, fighting walker with your best friend, It would be awsome, The AI character to help you out, sure, but they run out of bullets quickly, and you always have to save them And story mode would have a Coop mode which would make the story more enjoyable! Anyways, this game is awsome and I hope you update it more! You guys rock ,team17",

Controls are terrible for some reason in this one, and the tutorial doesn't do a good enough job explaining exactly what you should be doing. A lot of grammar errors in the game, I dunno if this was localization or what, but it's pretty unprofessional.  It SHOULD be good, but it feels like it was rushed out the door to coincide with the new season of Walking Dead starting up, and it really could have used another couple of months of polish.",

It doesn't have that twist it needed from the original.   PROS  + Xbox One Graphics (Based off original game, it uses Xbox One style graphics) + New Weapon System + Controller Support + Story (Kind of)  CONS  Well really all I can say is  - No twist. Not unique enough from the original game.  As it shows there are more Pros than Cons, but I honestly think that con is enough to make me not play the game. It's just not for me I guess. Hope this helped. 3/10",

You will be disappointed if you have played 'The Escapists' and have enjoyed its playability, as I have. They have changed key assignments and combat system from 'The Escapists' without rational reasons, and now this game is much wrose than the original one.  I have enjoyed the original story, and I have been disappointed to find that this game is just following the original story, not like the ones by Telltale Games.",
