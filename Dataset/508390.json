BTW for parents looking for games for your children, this doesnt have any mature content and is kid friendly. assuming you are a good parent that cares about that stuff and dont just let your young kids play those violent games.",

The graphic has a nice feel to it. A bit old school, but in a good way.   Something that is a bit annoying is that, in the beginning, you can collect these gears. I ended up somewhere between 250-300 gears BUT once I fixed the first machine (part of the story) that cost 150 (I believe ?) .. it reset to 0. I completely wasted my time collecting as many gears as possible only to find out they would disappear for no reason.   Next up is that arcade game in the beginning.. Don't play it. I spend several minutes playing it, trying to see if I would gain something after reaching a certain amount of points &gt; I didn't. I believe to have reached 3500 points. It wasn't even difficult enough to be fun. It was pretty much the same thing over and over.. Shooting a rock, then the spaceship behind it..   In the end, it could be a great game for younger kids (perhaps that is it's purpose), but I find it to be so-so.",

            "review_text": "I didn't really enjoy this short demo. It's not well optimized, and the puzzle aspect was more annoying than it was fun. It also suffers from the same issues as most 3D platformers that I've played... lack of shadows. While your avatar has a shadow, which helps judging jumps, the environment itself is very flat, in appearance, making it difficult to jump across gaps, at times. The story itself didn't really catch my attention, nor did it really end in a way that makes me want to play more. The graphics are decent, though the lack of shadows makes it look aged, and the controls were easy enough. The voice acting was good.  I just feel like it's an average platformer, that didn't really catch my interest.",

            "review_text": "It's a 3D platformer but the game does not feel polished. You can finish the game in less than an hour. You are the robot, Canny, tasked with helping the city to save the city's water supply by finding the missing reservoir engineer robot. You go around the city collecting breaking crates to get Cogs. There is no need to do any quests/objectives to get the cogs. You can just break crates to complete the level.   You use 150/50 Cogs to open the doors to the next level instead of completing an objective. If you meet a monster, just jump on its head or throw an object at it. At the end of the demo, you will fight a boss. I will not spoil the surprise for you, so try the demo for yourself. The boss fight is simple but very boring. You fight a g**** n**** m*** r**  What's my conclusion? It's not worth the money. You can play the demo but the game is not worth the $16.50 discounted price tag.   PROS  1. Contact Point for ladders Very smooth at the beginning  2. Simple movement controls WASD, UDLR, Left Mouse, Right Mouse, Spacebar. Standard issue. Pick up objects by pressing the Left Mouse. Jump and double jump with the Right Mouse.  3. End Cut Scene The first 3 seconds of the end cut scene are okay.   CONS  1. Does not feel polished The graphics, the objectives, the overall gameplay.  2. It's short Really short. 25 minutes for me.  3. Linear gameplay It's so linear and boring. Point A to Point B to Point C. Tada. Finish. There's hardly anything to interact with.  4. Graphics Honestly, it's quite bland.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I have no idea how i beat it in 23 minutes. Check my achievements if you don't believe me. I ran around hoarding scrap like i do in every game, and i jumped over a fence to find a 150 scrap cost sign. i went up to it and fixed it, then jumped down into the sewers. Apparently it was chapter three. So, i completely skipped chapters 1 and 2. Another thing to add is a bug list of the bugs that i found in my short time playing:  - collecting scrap causes a few frames to skip A.K.A. freezes for a short moment - sometimes the boss doesn't appear to be underground, but you cant hit it and it doesn't move - the things that require scrap take all your scrap unless you move away and let it open - don't know how the jumping works, but sometimes if you hug a wall you can get more jumps in a row Recommendations:  - camera is zoomed in a bit and turn to the direction you move; or, camera is controlled with the mouse - the sewer puzzle has more parts, but they have to be inserted in a certain order, since most people can't solve those aggravating switch puzzles.  - the sewer water doesn't instantly kill you, but takes a percentage of health   I could probably think of some more things to add, but overall this game has a great story, atleast what i played, and deserves to be noticed. I think this game would be very popular if expanded upon. The creators did a fantastic job designing the surrounding. The building you spawn in alone is given lots of detail, kudos to the designers. P.S. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",

            "review_text": "I've been meaning to get the full game for a while, so was quite pleased to see that they've made a free demo available. I downloaded it, and was hoping that it would convince me that the full version was worthy of a purchase. That is, after all, the idea of demos, isn't it?  Well, I'm not so sure now. Sure, it looks pretty, the main character is charming, and it has a lot of potential. But there are some serious flaws which are making me wonder if the full game is going to be fun, or just an exercise in frustration.  Firstly, the jumping mechanics are awful. Your character 'feels' really heavy. Yes, I know that he's a robot, but that's no excuse. And despite having a health bar, touching liquids is instant death. You'd think that a city populated by robots would be a little more careful, wouldn't you? Coupled with a lack of save points this means you're going to be seeing the same bits over and over again.  Secondly, the game can't decide what it is. Once I was out of the apartment I was in a free-roaming 3rd-person adventure game, with hidden items, optional sidequests and a sense of freedom. Then that is snatched away and you spend the rest of the game in a very linear side-scrolling platformer with a fixed camera, before finally returning to a free-roaming camera for a boss-fight that comes out of nowhere and doesn't seem to have ANYTHING to do with what else is going on in the game. You start off being asked to go and fix the water supply and end up fighting a giant bear by throwing barrels at it. It's death somehow fixes the cities water supply. None of this makes any sense, and you finish with the feeling that you didn't really have a lot to do with the success.  Thirdly, the enemies. Why exactly can rats hurt robots? I wouldn't have thought that teeth could do much damage to a lump of steel. There are also scorpions that literally appear out of nowhere. If you stop and carefully inspect the landscape you can faintly see an outline of where it's going to appear, but if you're moving, forget it. Just get used to walking into them by accident and losing a good chunk of your health. This is Rick Dangerous style gaming.  Fourthly, the collectables. You accumulate nuts and bolts as you play. These are found in corners, in boxes, and as rewards for optional side quests. These are then spent to pass through story-gates and onto the next part of the game. But...the story-gates always take everything you have. If you have 283 items and the gate asks for 150, it takes all 283. Now...since the collectables have no purpose other than to allow passage through the gates...where is the incentive to bother trying to collect as many as possible? They're only going to be taken off you when you finish the chapter...  There are also spelling mistakes in both the in-game subtitles and the achievement text, which suggests a lack of care and quality control.  I really don't know if I want to buy the full game now, because the demo makes me think it's going to be very slapdash and just a random assortment of ideas, rather than a cohesive ongoing story with developing mechanics and a well-designed learning curve.",
