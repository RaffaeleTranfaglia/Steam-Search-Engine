            "review_text": "  Don't let the play time fool you, I've finished the game in offline mode.  Demetrios is a game that looks like a bunch of fart jokes at first but actualy proves to be more than that. Sure, there's a lot of toilet humor and if you hate it, you probably won't enjoy yourself. And there is a LOT of jokes everywhere. You literaly can't go 5 minutes as Bjorn without doing something stupid, but this gives the game a certain sort of charm. I found Bjorn to be extremely charismatic and you can't help but feel bad for him when he says or does an act of utter stupidity that can even get him arrested or killed.   The gameplay itself is quite simple. You click around and try to find useful items and solve all kinds of puzzles in a wide array of enviroments. There are also mini-games, which are quite fun to play, despite being quite simple - but hey, there's a reason they call them MINI games. Other that that, you also try to find cookies, scattered all over the place. They act like clues. If you're stuck, eat a cookie and all will be better (sounds like a motto for a cookie brand... anyone knows the number of the Oreos headquarters?). Khm... back to the topic. The hints can help quite a lot, because you will get stuck. Despite the fact puzzles are usualy not that hard to solve, a few of them can prove to be a hard nut to crack. But hey, at least you can get fat for a reason.  So... what about the graphics? Well, the game looks REALLY nice. Everything is hand drawn, suits the game perfectly and I can only praise the game in this apect. It runs great too - even integrated graphic cards can handle the game without breaking a sweat... which is actualy not that big a deal... I mean... we ARE talking about a 2D point and click adventure. But hey, it's still worth a mention.  As for the sounds, there is a lot of farting. I mean, even some of the sound effects are replaced by farts. While this is humorous at first, it does get annoying after some time. The soundtrack itself is not the most memorable one I've ever heard, but it does fit the game and it's not bad at all. There are even aditional ones you can unlock in the main menu, which is nice.   Conclusion: Demetrios is a great adventure for people who like toilet humor and constant jokes. However don't expect the jokes to be sophisticated, because most of them are far from it. As for the gameplay, it is varried and the puzzles are fun to solve. Did I mention the development studio consists of a single person? The lenght is quite nice too, you'll spend around 9 hours to finish the entire game, which is not bad for a point and click adventure. Do I recommend it? Try the demo and if you find yourself laughing in the first 10 minutes, go for it.   Final score: 7.4/10",
