A great game to pass the time, this compilation that is for sale on STEAM not own the original songs from DREAMCAST version, but the game is all there! Run like crazy to get their passengers to their destination on time and do some crazy moves in traffic to get an extra tip. The game itself is not very long, are actually only a few missions, but the game is fun to play in ARCADE mode or against the clock, pick up your passengers and 'RUN FORREST, RUN'",

            "review_text": "Crazy Taxi, the game that has been released and ported over to more platform than I can count, is on Steam. Is it worth your money? Well.... Maybe, maybe not.   Crazy Taxi was originally released in the arcades and later on the SEGA Dreamcast. The Dreamcast entry saw a new city added, as well as new challenge modes. This version gets all of that. But something is missing. I can't quite put my finger on it yet. Maybe I'll remember later.   In Crazy Taxi you play as 1 of 4 different cab drivers, who drive around the city picking up people and dropping them off at their destination as quickily as possible. You can drive against traffic, off road, over ramps for huge air...and even underwater. It's all a little, i don't know. Crazy! The maps are unnamed but seem to resemble the types of communities you may see in places like California. Sunny, and full of hills. A lot like San Francisco.   So the game has really 2 modes of play. The arcade mode, which is split into the original arcade setting of beating the clock and adding time with each successful fare, or an overall timed session where you just pick up as many passengers as possible in a set amount of time. The other mode being the crazy box, which is just a challenge mode with different challenges, like a long jump, combo scoring, timed courses, and more. It's a apretty simple package, but it works. It's not a weekend game, but its a good game to kill an hour or so of boredom.   But what went wrong? Why would I possibly not recommend this title? It's simple. Something is missing. Something that made the game a blast even more so to play back in the day. The soundtrack! Yeah. Licensing ran out I guess. And the once great soundtrack was replaced. But hey, this is not a big deal right? Well, when they replace some adrenaline pumping music with.....garbage (and, no, not the band Garbage), it kind of kills the overall mood of the game for some. It did for me at least. I don't mind replacing music, but at least replace it with something more fitting! This is like watching your favorite action sequence in a movie, with music on the scene replaced and performed by.....Avril Lavigne? Yeah. It just does not work.  Lastly, I know there is a huge hatred for product placement in games. But for Crazy Taxi, the product placement just seemed to fit. And it gave the world a bit of charm. But that too like the great soundtrack, is gone.   Crazy Taxi is a great game guys, don't get me wrong. But when it's done in perfection on other systems like the Dreamcast, I can not possibly give this an honest recommendation.  ",

Since the controls are digital only (no analog, even with a 360 pad), steering is horrible. The smallest change of direction becomes a challenging slalom to even stay on the road. One word: UNPLAYABLE ... I'm sure I remember that this wasn't the case on Dreamcast. I'm sure it was analog back then. In anycase, it was fun in the days and now isn't anymore.  Also note that the soundtrack isn't the same. It's not so bad, but far from as good as the old one.  If you liked the old Crazy Taxi, don't ruin your sweet memories with this version. If you are curious to try it, go grab it on Dreamcast.",

If you hold the control stick in any direction while going from zero to fast then the car will essentially stall for two precious seconds or more causing you to fail the mode.   The textures are muggy and low res, and I hear the soundtrack had all the goodness amputated, surgically replaced with generic crap.

The game feels faster because of the faster processor The animations are as fantastic as ever Every time you play, it seems like there is a new challenge thrown your way  Cons: The controller feels stiff because they decided to not make it analog sensing. For what reason, I don't know. But this can be fixed with a mod. The soundtrack is wrong! This was the first big turnoff I noticed. Luckily, there are mods available to fix this.  Overall, this is a great port, and it serves the Crazy Taxi Franchise well. Without mods, I can see how it would be a disappointment. But once these are in place, the game is fantastic. 9/10",

This version of Crazy Taxi does not represent the original Dreamcast version, and I would definitely encourage you to try that as opposed to this.  Actually, scratch that. This doesn't just misrepresent the Dreamcast version, it grabs the jewel case, rips out the manual and wipes it's ♥♥♥ with it.  Anyways, this is an excellent arcade racing game, with a whole lot of late 90's vibe. Speaking of late 90's, this is basically the racing game equivalent of Counter-Strike.  Being good at this game requires lots of practice, game sense, and reactions. If you're not willing to spend time learning the game, you're going to have a bad time. Seriously. You need to spend time learning this game.  But, if you choose to, Crazy Taxi has a lot to offer if you bother learning all of it's tricks and quirks. Arcade and Original modes involve you picking up and dropping off passengers at breakneck speeds until you run out of time.  Crazy Box serves up a whole host of various mini-games and challenges for you to flex your Crazy Taxi knowledge and technique.  It is also important to note the other fine touches that really make this game special. Similar to many of SEGA's arcade games, Crazy Taxi features a bumpin' soundtrack by Bad Religion and The Offspring. In addition, the hilarious inclusion of dated product placement (remember Tower Records?) really seals the comical atmosphere of this game.  As a closing statement, if you absolutely must play this game on PC, then make sure to install the Analog Control Patch, and if you wish, Music and V/O Patches as well.",

Still as fun as it was back on the dreamcast and PS2. The port is solid, as there is not that much you could possibly upscale with the very cartoony look of Crazy Taxi and the controls work just fine once you get used to it. Nothing you play for hours on end but a surprisingly influential title you will come back to again and again.  The major negative is the exclusion of the original soundtrack which has rightfully gained somewhat of a cult following of its own. It's not that the new songs are awful, they do their job somewhat alright-ish, but they are so staggeringly bland and generic it's almost fascinating. A baffling achievement that had me scratching my head with all four limbs. The older PC port had the advantage of custom soundtracks which alleviates this problem, the steam version however uses a strange audio format that even as a sound designer I have never encountered before. Truely a shame.  Another distraction from this fun little title is the price at this point. Even as part of the dreamcast collection it is totally overpriced. Wait for a sale if you can get past the new soundtrack or just turn it off completely and put in some Offspring and Bad Religion.",
