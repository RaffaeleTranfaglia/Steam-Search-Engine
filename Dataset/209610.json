This is really not the sort of game I would normally play, while it is a pretty terrible game, I strangly found my self laughing and actually having a good time. I will probably never open this game ever again but still.   The aim is to build a roller coaster in real time as you are riding it. This can lead to some pretty hilarious sitations. The amount of times my cart went flying across the map using some weird rag doll effect and cracked me up was too many to count.   Need cheering up? You'll find a barrel of laughs right here...",

Powerd by blood, the rollercoaster builds itself as it rides whilst feeding on its RAMPAGING destruction. Though beware! A lone monk has randomly blessed some nondestinct objects making them indestrucble, but which ones? Thats for you to find out!  All in all, one big thrill ride of non consquential faffing about featuring both reflection and refraction.  3/10",

This game would be good if it's bought on a sale (at least half price) and it's a cheap concept of No Limits and Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Most of the times if you were going to ride the workshop coasters and then the game crashes. You'll have to use a controller in order to play this game, you build coasters with it. For I now I wouldn't recommend this but whatever I say in this review will change.",
