After a couple of levels, obviously you've kind of seen everything gameplay-wise, but I don't hold that against casual games like this. It had enough variety in it to keep me interested to the end, and I'd recommend it to fans of hidden object games and/or Diner Dash.   P.S.: I had no technical issues whatsoever, and tried it on my desktop PC, my own laptop and someone else's laptop.",
