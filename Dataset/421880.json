The art is truly plastic and I would say remarkable and exceptoinal.  If you're 4-7 years old you should like the game.",

If my friend didn't get this for me while it was 80 cents, it would've been a ♥♥♥♥ing rip off. I wasted 7 hours of my life to beat this game for my boii m-a-x. ALso, getting 120 stars made me wanna ♥♥♥♥ing kill myself. Thanks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.",
