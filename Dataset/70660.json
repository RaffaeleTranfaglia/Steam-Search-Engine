            "review_text": "Disappointed really.  I liked this pinball table back when it first showed up on the gaming scene. It was first packaged under the title Addiction Pinball and was bundled with at least one other table, a car theme I believe. Back in 1998 most pinball on a computer was 2D and ran from DOS. Team 17s 2 tables were welcomed by me. The thing now is that they, or whoever controls these titles, just dumped them back onto the consumer without any of the simplest of revisions that never came way back when. How about controller support? And I see the weird color glitch comes back after you have played some and the only way to clear it is ito esc back to menu and then continue the game; and no I am not using the same PC from back in 1998.   I Liked it more back then Disappointed someone feels the need to charge without offering something more. Bought this one back in 1998",

            "review_text": "A lot of people don't really like this because they would prefer The Pinball Arcade. You gotta remember that this was made in 1998. And I know that while the PS1 game had a second table on it, they could have included that here too, but didn't for some reason.  That being said, this is still an awesome game. The sophisticated table design, sounds, graphics, and physics put this game well ahead of its time.",

If you're looking for a more authentic pinball feeling, look elsewhere...if you don't mind late 90's cheezy pinball fun though, this is a decent game. It didn't really need 'Worms' on it though.",

            "review_text": "Its a Worms-themed Pinball game on PC. Thats about all you need to know about the game. The single Worms-themed pinball machine looks good and the flippers work, although without instructions or any means to map the controls I was left guessing on how they did work. Personally I found it annoying that I could never hit anything that I was aiming for - the shots were always slightly left or right of the ramps I expected to hit. Overall, this game is a surprisingly good time sink for people who appreciate pinball. But I'd reccommend that you get it when there's a special for it as there isn't much in the game to support the relatively high standard price.",

It's just too old and boring to bother.",

This doesn't change much but some minigames and events that you can play while bashing your shift keys.  Also, the keyboard buttons are not shown anywhere, if you never played any pinball game you need to check every single button of your keyboard.  This game was made for people that wanted to play a new pinball game other than the free pinball from Windows XP.",

This for a 1999 game i believe its pretty good for back then and getting ready for armageddon! but i guess this is some sorta hype for armaegddon i dont know but as a pinball game THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER OPTIONS I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY 2 BOARDS AND THE SOUND WHILE IS A BEST ALRIGHT AND THE MUSIC IS MEH THIS GAME IS QUITE A WASTE OF 6 BUCKS! SERIOUSLY SOOO MUCH BETTER PINBALL GAMES AND U COULD EVEN JUST GO OUT OF UR WAY TO FIND A REAL PINBALL TABLE! sigh but really this game is not worth the 6 bucks at all and now its on sale til jan 2nd which the price is a bit more bareable and can be a bit more worth that price if this was free? then i would get it! but no that normal price is a waste. and this game is a waste now i suggest just leaving it alone now cause its 15 years old and there is so much more better options. I give it a 3.5/10 its a bit ok but seriously for the price and amount of stuff u can do in it, its bad and i need to play another worms game now lol so yeah i dont recomened this game. Merry christmas guys",
