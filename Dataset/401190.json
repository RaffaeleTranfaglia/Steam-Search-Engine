            "review_text": "Please note that my recommendation of this game is based of $1 price . It is not a good game but for $1 I found enough amusement here to justify the purchase .   Dinosaur Hunt:AC is a sandbox hunting game with very bad enemy AI . There is little to no fluidity in enemy animations so it feel like dinosaurs are floating toward you . In other words game is more like a shooting gallery where most of the fun comes from laughter . Killing dinosaurs feels very silly and even enjoyable in a way.  It goes without saying that game has many issues across the board and if you expect any depth in gameplay do not buy it . It is literally shooting helpless objects running toward you in streight lines , get new gun and repeat . Enemies can't even handle areas that have no direct pathing so you will be untouchable on any elevation that needs a jump . Game presents no challange of any kind .  If anything this game looks decent and weapons are fun to use . It has a lot of unlockable content and upgrades so at least there is some sort of progression by grinding new weapons .Maps look nice although many of them seem to be out of place.   Also developer makes constant updates so game is improving . Much better since I bought it but the game is far from being polished .   Don't get angry at me if this review convinced you to buy a bad game. I bought it for ****s and giggles and well it does that in my opinion . Don't take it too seriously and maybe you will have fun with it .",

            "review_text": "See, this game definitely isn't a good game. By any standards. If you only play games that you think are good, this isn't the game for you.  That said, it you like games that are so bad that they're good, buy this game. Immediately. If you like things that are so bad they're good, and you skip this game, shame on you. This is the type of game you play with your friends and just laugh. The game's graphics are hilariously bad, the gameplay feels like it was taken right out of a Unity sample game. It has terrible ragdoll physics. The guns all basically play the same. The way the katana kills is hilarious. It's all perfect.   So, like I said: if you don't like games that aren't good, don't play this. But, if you are someone (like me) who loves things that are so bad they're good, and you skip this, you should be ashamed of yourself. I got the game for about 45 or 46 cents on sale, and it's definitely worth at least that.",

I havent played the updated Multiplayer, still. but its great on its own for now.  the AI is greatly improved, and I am loving being called out when detected. I see missions in the future.  The X input software included works perfectly, and the graphics are GREAT. Everything on the list was touched in some way, not to say that its because of me, but the developer obviously likes his game enough to keep fixing and adding stuff!!! Buy the DLC. its fun!  Wishlist #2!!!  -Survival is great. Hunger and thirst is a must. the settings in the game Need it. it looks like you ware dropped into a zone, and I love that. but its so open, without the added stress of food and water, this is just running around killing.  -Kill dinosaurs, loot corpses, take to evac point (capture the flag style) I am so into this. -Food/water drops would be cool , if randomly dropped in. -reload while running (ok, we are killing dinosaurs.) -Stop Exploding the enemies unless its grenade related. Ragdoll them out.   I LOVE this game now.Havent uninstalled it yet!  8/10      ___________________________________________________________________________ PC Test Build:  I3 (speed 3400) gtx 780 5 gigs Ram ( my cheat, 1 for windows, 4 for gaming lol)  Bad matchup in card/cpu, but the 3 gb gddr5 +3400 mhz processor, runs all of my games at 60fps on high... (older games, ultra)  Funny, 1080p 40-55 fps, 1366x768 60-70fps  Smoothness over graphics anyday.  That said, ON TO THE REVIEW  My Rig chews this game up and spits it out graphically, but the game runs on the most meager of systems, judging the requirements. But I digress...  There is a unique opportunity here for the person making the game. An opportunity to make the game for all people, and their tastes.  Pros - Nice graphics (no Im not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but smoothness and playability count) - Playability (has an awesome SERIOUS SAM Vibe thing going on with it, and controls very well) - Tried Multiplayer (well, not exactly, just ran around the empty level and I was impressed, assuming everything stays this smooth) - Looks like the developer keeps updating the game.  Cons  - If the support stops, the game will suck. - maybe allow maps to be made for multiplayer, offered up via workshop. - enemies are great, but the bullets need to do more damage, assuming that the gist of the game is 'dino hunting' so the caliber bullet must be higher. it wont be too easy, if the numbers of wave spawns increased. and the money can be lowered. 5 coins per kill. a headshot needs to force an enemy down. I shouldnt be getting thousands for multiple headshots on the same creature. - as of the build I'm playing, the trees have no collision, so it hinders the view, and cramps general playability, so I end up enjoying the desert a lot more...  I like the game. it has all of the bones of a fantastic shooter, because the 1st half hour is extremely important in the success of the game.  Haters on a game like this, clearly dont see the potential.  Developer!!!  - multiplayer horde mode - asset driven map maker (cubes, walls, stairs, spawn points) Keep the maps. - enemy soldiers in place of zombies - money system is excellent, working for guns and ammo is perfect. - Counterstrike controls really helped the game. Player maps (which you can offer up) can give us a healthy alternative to counterstrike. - any way to add splitscreen? (man, I would pay extra for this add on. this way , naysayers on splitscreen dont have to purchase.)  I love shooters, and what the developer has built here is an opportunity.   one that should be capitalized on.  Like killing dinos? great! Zombies? Yes please. Soldiers? maybe in the future. Bots? maybe in the future.  Based on the Indie peers, this is a solid 7/10.  excellent minute to minute gameplay, even if you just want to kill something.  Needs more blood.  PS  I sort of cheated, as I set up the controls on the pinnacle game profiler, and played it like call of duty. so I think it needs Controller support, because it handles so well with it.  anyway,   God Bless.",

Game seems to run smooth tho I seem to have a issue scoping in at a dino from a little distance and even with a machine gun with the scope pointer right on it I cant hit it until it gets really close then the scope is meaningless, and I know how to shoot a real gun.  The mini map needs a little improvement and seems a little confusing, and seems like it take a little bit of time to kill a small dino. The achivements seem easy enough to get, and not sure about the trading cards since I yet ever recieved any. Overall it is not a bad game,developer seems to be working on it currently and is working on trying to address any issues one may have with the game. Game is very decently priced and with a ton of really cool DLC content that makes it even better.",

Yeah it looks like crap but the guy who made it was honest atleast 'If you are looking for AAA quality, ace &amp; crack, top-grade Dinosaur Survival MultiPlayer Open World Game, with millions of details, whatever, there are better positions out there, so please move on - DO NOT BUY IT.' That's why I like this game, for 99c (or 59 at the time of this review) it's not as bad as other games for the same price or even higher (Bad Rats or Temper Tantrum are 2 that come to mind) I say that even if it's not the best game I still have a little bit of fun with it and I'm sure if the Dev keeps updates going, it could possibly get better. Look at Orion: Prelude, was one of the worst games on Steam but the Dev(s) have fixed that, the game currently has 76% positive (at the time of this review) I never played it before when it was bad but still, I hope you get my point.  Dev, hope this review can inspire or atleast give you a smile and good luck on any updates or other games you make :)",

He averages updates two to three times a week, and I'm starting to see a really fun game come together, to the point that I've bought every one of his DLC's to keep him motivated.

            "review_text": "Edit: I've decided to change my negative recommendation to a positive. The game, although playable, is still far from complete. The reason for my change is the developer is still very active in making changes and striving towards making a quality product and I want to support with positive reinforcement. Please don't disappoint.   Many years ago there was a game called Carnivores that I tried playing but either my machine would lag too badly or by the time I finall got a computer that would run it well it was already dated. The game wasn't perfect but I did enjoy it for a bit.  So I'm looking through the Steam Store and I see Dinosaur Hunt. It has mixed reviews but it's only 49 cents and I just happened to have two quarters burning a hole in my pocket. So I figure how bad can it really be and I give it a shot.  I really want to like this game and I do like it,  but in its current condition I cannot give it a Yes recommendation . If there were a Neutral recommendation I would select that.  I think this could be a really great game with more work. I would even purchase the DLC's if this game shows some major improvement.  On the positive side,   One of the fastest loading games I've played in a while.   It was inexpensive.   The landscapes look very nice (although I've never seen palm trees growing out of solid rock before).   The biggest annoyances for me were;   Constantly getting hung up on the terrain and having to jump alot to move around.   The sounds need alot of work   The music is tolerable for about a minute and that's it (fortunately it can be turned off).   It always sounds like your stepping on wooden floors and it's too loud.   When you crouch and move the sound of the foot steps still sounds the same, just spread further apart.   The dinosaurs don't sound like they have any weight.   The only time the dinosaurs make any sounds is when they are attacking you. It feels like there should be ambient dinosaur sounds.    The game would not remember settings   I turn exploding kills off and for the current level it stays off, but when I die or go to the next level it's turned back on.   I set the detail to max and it returned to lowest.   However the music did stay turned off and the Shadows setting did stay turned on.    Is the scale of the dinosaurs correct? Some seem smaller than they should be.   AI: It looked like a deer chase down a dinosaur so that it could be eaten.   Some of the menus need explanations. There is one screen which I am assuming is difficulty select. There are two pictures, one with one dino and the other with two dinos. Minor, but the game mode selection screen could use short descriptions when you mouse over the different buttons.   Details on the weapons and ammo on the selection/purchase page when you select them would be nice.   Although I figured most things out (it's pretty standard FPS stuff, Use the mouse wheel to bring up your weapon) some instructions would also be nice.   Minor: my arm looks like it's made of plastic and so do some of the dinos.   Nuetral;   I think they could have worked the tracking system into the story. Possibly even making recovery of the trackers part of the missions.   The comments get repetitive after a while. Maybe an option to turn them off.   The campaign story, at least what I have heard so far, is meh, but plausible. I know this isn't a high budget production, but the narrator needs improvement on the voice work.   My biggest hope is that the devs are still working on this to make it a great game.",

It honestly has been the best 50 cents i've spent in my entire life and was well worth it.  Unfortunately since then its been updated, (I never knew it had) the game overall has improved to what ever its trying to be. But the horrendous effects (which you can still enable but aren't quite the same) and overall atmosphere which was intentionally designed to 'be' good which ended up being horrible. Is where i got my enjoyment and what gave it a so bad its good charm.  I feel kinda disappointed in a way that the game has improved somewhat :(  I loved the looped daggy ♥♥♥ rock music, bad polygon splitting at ridiculous speeds on Dino kills, and the fact i could screen shot the hilarity and show my friends how amazing this cheap game was.

The reloding wasn´t so funktional, you had to stay nearly compleatly still or it cansled and if you try to jump when running you automatiky stop runing. But the worst level was the 4:th, it was the level I gave up on, the mission is to find and kill an alosaurus in a forest. I cirkled the whoul map many times, but didn´t find any alosaurus, just a ankylosaurus who ate me (witch I didn´t expect it to), a petranodon flying sideways witch you couldn´t avoid because it was as I said flying sideways and a group of raptor you couldn´t kill because they was so many you would have to relode about 3 times to have enough shoots to kill all. As you get detected when shooting and need to run you can´t relode. Many times I spwaned not far from raptors and often I spawned in a big group of them. After a weil I figured out that the 'alosaurus' actualy is one of the raptors (it is the same size as the raptors and just reskined to be fater and look a litle diferent). This mission just feel porly made, and so does the game so far I got. You could argue that I just could have bought a new weapon. But I feel that you should be able to beat the campain with the weapon you are given.
