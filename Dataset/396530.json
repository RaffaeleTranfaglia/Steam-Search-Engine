Most of the flaws were regarding the design itself, it was a bit sloppy and I've noticed you were using free assets which did not make me feel that happy about the game. Also there were some logical mistakes some of which are probably left there intentionally for players to find... I think it would be great if you added the save option because I had some stuff to do and had to start the game all over. The story itself did its job by keeping me interested for the jumpscares to take place. I do in the other hand support your work and want you to stay motivated so we could expect even more and even better games in the future...",
