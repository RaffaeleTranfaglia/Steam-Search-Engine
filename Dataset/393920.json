Your CSR will never go up unless you play with the prices to drive yourself into so much debt it rediculous.   - If you run out of a type of car SUDDENLY all the AI wants to buy is that type of car - Going from one to the next brands on the lower end is futile and I found a easy way to beat the game on Hard setting look below - Unless you see an update of the AI being REALLY made better stay away from this game.  - CSR rankings make no sense, impossible to gain VERY easy to lose them (beat the game with a 0 CSR, WTH Dev.) - 90 percent of the time you will not sell a car, EVEN if your employees are level 12 or higher - Upgrades make no real difference just increase foot traffic - Repair shop cant even cover rental costs (IRL this accounts for a major part of sells for any dealership, again WTH Dev.) - Used Cars makes sense but the pricing is all over the place as far as aceptability (I add 30 percent mark up)     --------SPOILER ON BEATING GAME ON HARD (145 turns or so)-----------------  Take the option at the first for the 140 k, by the most expensive licensing this will give you the most expensive two cars of the game. Mark them up by 30%. Then put on FastForward and keep buying and selling them. Upgrade everthing all the way (increase foot traffic). Then start buying other dealerships. If you want to also buy all the other brands however this will take away from the sales from your high end cars. Which again makes  ",

Just a constant loop of music with no other sounds. You can barely sell cars, even though I set them at the dealer price, they still didn't sell!!! Your rating just slowly goes down also. The game tells you were to click, but it isn't very obvious. After, literally 30 minutes, I felt like I'd done all I needed to (and could really do) in the game.    I'd like to say 'You get what you pay for' but I've played FREE games on my iPhone better than this one and I've spent a lot longer time on.  GTA San Andreas is on the app store for the same price, so when you think about it, this really should be a free game..... or at least 69p or something. But £4.99..... though I guess I and others were stupid enough to go for it...   This game is also very amuterish and if someone told me it was made in 1995, I'd have believed them.",
