            "review_text": "What Key taught me again was that even though you're expecting the feels, it'll still hit you with enough impact to make you tear up on multiple occasions. Like  planetarian ,  Harmonia  is a somewhat short kinetic novel, but makes up for that with its enriched storytelling.  $10 is a great deal to experience such a wonderful story that will leave you with all colors of emotions. As it may be Itaru Hinoue's final Key work, this is more of a reason to read this perhaps last-of-its-kind Key series with this iconic art style.",

The story is very well written and sufficient contents made up for the price tag, it has brought me some entertain while clashing me with the embroiled emotion feels. y u do tis. Totally recommended 10/100",

If your like me, reading at average speed this title will last you about 4 hours, and the novel was interesting from start to end.  It comes packed with all the emotions you expect from Key and it won't let down on any of them, so prepair yourself.",

I think the only fun I had with this game was when I was making fun of how unrealistic and the boring the story is.

            "review_text": "I'm quite a huge fan of Key as a studio. Rewrite and Little Busters! are some of my favorite games of all time (despite them just being Visual Novels). I have played most, if not all, of the Key Visual novels (aside from the extremely heavy adult ones because playing the 18+ version of Kanon almost ruined one of my favorite characters.).   When I heard about Harmonia, I was pretty excited to see that It would be getting an official English release on steam, not that it matters to me since I can competently read Japanese. With English being my native tough, however, there are certainly times when reading a Japanese text can leave me a little lost (mostly due to slang and wordplay). Unlike many of the Key library, Harmonia is a Kinetic Novel; you don't have any choices, you just read, look and listen. Also, like Planetarian before it, it is quite short clocking in at about 3-6 hours depending on how fast you read.   The music is quite amazing, as expected of Key; there are some extremely strong tracks here that are very memorable and really good at setting the mood. The story follows the usual Key formulae of being a 'crying game'. The first few acts are slow and mainly for character development. The final few acts are where the emotional '♥♥♥♥ hits the fan', as they say. The voice acting is superb as expected and the art is very impactful with some panels being extremely vivid and memorable. Character design follows the typical 'moe' style that Key is known for though don't be fooled; the characters are designed this way so that you will grow attached much easier. Then when the story decides to rip your heart out of your chest and stamp on it multiple times you will be even more devastated.   If you like Key and like visual novels then this is definitely worth it at 7 dollars. Bring a box of kleenex when you read Harmonia (not the happy kind) and enjoy the ride.",
