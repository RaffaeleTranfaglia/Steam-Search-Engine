Backdrops and cut scenes are well done.  Interesting plot.  Cons:  I found the voice acting poor.  Character animation is poor.   Would I buy episode 2? Yes but I would hope for an improvement.",

The story is nice, though it isn't that rich. The graphics and animation is bad, especially for HD but the gameplay is ok. Overall 6/10  Go ahead and play this game. Now I'm waiting for the next chapter...  Edit: Additional comment  What I dislike from the achievements is the 'Dialogue Skipper'. I really don't like it because you are encouraging people just to skim or even skip it at all and not get interested with the story. I earned this achievement on a 2nd run but I had a friend who just skipped it all on her 1st try.  What devs should encourage is for the gamers to have a lot of playing time on their game so they would recommend it to others and not just do it for the cards and uninstalling it afterwards.",

It feels very 'stiff' and awkward, the graphics less than stellar, and the voice acting somewhat scary.  I also ran into some bugs (Left the game open and came back to get stuck with my character standing in the cross position and unable to move). Not sure what's that about.",

The story is good, backgrounds look nice, but the characters are a bit 'boxy', and the animations are not that fluid all the time. But since this is an adventure game, the story and the interactions are what matters.  The interface is nice and clean, highlighting hotspots is a nice bonus for everyone that doesn't like to pixel hunt and the overall storytelling is great. Voice actors did an awesome job so the voiceovers are superb. Can't wait for Act II and see how it ends.",

The story is decent and interesting enough to keep me playing, the sound and music are good, and the gameplay is what you would expect from point and click game. But what I really hate with it is the 3D animation for the characters, it's so stiff and awkward like it was made in early 90's. They should have stick with their comic cutscenes, it looks better.  Act 2 just been released and I think I will wait for it to go on sale or get the key for free somewhere later. The game is not bad overall, but I just don't like it much.",

If you like investigating, you can buy, it's worth what it costs.  In the other hand, it doesn't give you much opportunity to move arounds, most of the times you have to find what's the next step of the scenario and follow it. But since game has a nice scenario, that's okay.",
