I found it goes underpar than previous titles Frankenstein and Alchemy Misteries. Is that all Jetdogs Vampire games being cursed?  Good: - Improved hidden object graphics details, description and object size - Since larger hidden objects are easier to find, developers added few more puzzled object to combine and increased the challenge. Myself appreciate the larger object style - Overall character, monster, background building and costume design are nicely done and become more artistic - Puzzle are easier to solve, item will auto combine when they should be  Bad: - Mini Puzzle recycled from previous titles - Most Mini Puzzle this time is not funny - Puzzle objective is not stated clearly unless you use Hint, which feels unfair and cheap - Story is completely unreasonable, uninteresting and un-finsihed ending. Cannot feel any tension through out the game - Main character don't even have a name until ending, totally forgettable - World Map is removed and need player to travel step by step only  Verdict: Little bit disappointed this time and hope their next title has more surprise and improvement. Get it on 90% is still good deal i think  Score: 6/10 ",

            "review_text": "The graphics are okay, but for a hidden objects game this has very little hidden objects scenarios. There are a couple of fun sliding puzzles etc, but in general the point&amp;click puzzle solving parts are so easy I have hard time believing I'm actually playing this on expert.  I know people don't play these kind of games because they're hard but because they're easy and relaxing - that's why I like them myself. But even so I get the feeling like this particular game was designed for someone recovering from a tragic brain injury. The game actually states you need a specific item, like a knife or a rake or a valve, for getting a specific task done. You just have to find the said objects ('PRO TIP': click on anything that sparkles).",

IT is a hidden object game - so u have to find and collect things and use them one way or the other.  the game has cutscenes/videos - some things has nice animation, graphics are very nicely done too. music is somewhat okay. It even has a voice over to some characters. The animation in the videos are sort of meh - some of the characters has their mouth closed when u hear them talking.  There are some minigames - u have to do - in order to collect more of those collectables.  You can play on easy or advanced mode. But the game is quite easy already. (im playing this on advanced mode)  If you are totally done in a certain area, then there is no way possible to go back. Since there is nothing to achieve. Which makes the game even more easier to find the collectables.  I think it is quite a short game which is disappointing.  Ill give this a 6/10",

I wouldn't drink it, even if I'm thirsty.'). It's a mixed bag all told, but even then I'd almost recommend it if not for the bugs. OH GOOD GRAVY, THE BUGS! Roughly 2 hours of my counted playing time was actually spent trying to solve a puzzle that, it turns out, is hopelessly bugged. For some players, such as my self, the game is ultimately unplayable and unbeatable after a certain point because of such bugs. And there are MANY of them. It's even acknowledged in the official forums, and the general response from the playerbase has been 'Yeah, it sucks. Oh well. You get what you pay for...' The publishers? They're silent on the matter -- but they can't respond fast enough when forum-users try to talk about a walkthrough (THAT little discussion needs to be silenced, apparently!). I'm told the game is unfortunately short, but I wouldn't know -- the bugs bar the way.  EDIT: After reinstalling a few times, I finally got past (most) of the bugs. The game IS absurdly short; the puzzles are generally terrible, largely unrelated to what's going on in the game; if Dracula has anything to do with it, it's not something that is ever mentioned in the game itself -- they seem to have just assumed 'Dracula' is the same as 'vampire'; and good gravy will you get sick of hearing that things are locked and require keys. After this, I feel like I could help summon Gozer the Gozerian because I am the KEYMASTER. Oh, and the bad translations only get worse as the game wends towards its fizzle of a conclusion. Definitely not recommended -- get their fairy tale games instead. They're richer, prettier, with better puzzles and better puzzle integration, as well as better writing, language localization, and better acting.",

It's not the most extravagant or difficult thing I've ever played, but it has its own charm.   Some of the puzzles were terribly repetitive and predictable, but overall it was amusing.   Set things up for a sequel, so I'd be curious about the continuation of the story.   If you're looking for something casual, and not too taxing, I'd say go for it. It's a decent experience =)",

Hints don't really cost you anything and there are no consequences for misplaced clicks.   Overall, it was quick and fun. :)",

I got the game during Halloween sale for almost nothing, and had no high hopes to get to far due to my previous experiences.  However, I had no problem at all finishing this one. It is a nice simple HOG for all audiences (OK, maybe no story wise due to the vampire stuff, but play wise). On the edge of being too simple (and this comes from a beginner). The game holds your hand all the way to the finish line (even in expert mode).  The story line is not the most interesting one, but it does the job. The graphics are OK. No glitches or crashes (Windows 7 x64).   After playing some AAA computer games, my wife insists this is the most interesting game I have ever played.  All and all, very nice experience. I have actually bought a coupe of HOGs more to see how they play.    ",

The couple gets split up and the girl (you) fall down and hole. When you wake form your fall, you realize that you are in some sort of underground catacombs/dungeons. You are visited by a ghost that tells you that your boyfriend is in great danger, but not as much of you. You must get out of these catacombs because the creature inside are scarier then the one that chased you in the woods, but your are lucky they only wake at night, so you have a little time on your side.  At some point in the story you get a glimpse of your past, witch is not much since all you remember is a fog and some images of a creepy town. But one night your sitting alone on a park bench and meet your now boyfriend and he is determined to help you find your memories. So he decides to make the trip to this creepy town of your dreams to find out more about your past. Since this is all your fault, so you take it upon yourself to save your boyfriend and get to the bottom of this.  The graphics are very good. The story is awesome and the puzzles fun, but the end ... I was like what is this, is there more ??? And still today the end leaves a place for a sequel. And I really hope they will make one. The game came out in October 2015, so I'll give them time for a second, but can't wait.  I really had fun and loved the story and game play! I recommend this game.",

There is a distinct lack of logic in this particular game, barring the fact that it is supernatural-themed, I'm talking common sense knowledge. Barging into a store and threatening the store owner with a shotgun kind of common sense. There are so many aspects that just seem rushed, like they didn't quite know how to move the player to the next area in any better way. And some of the puzzles are just impossible to figure out because the instructions are horrendous. Also, very few of the puzzles are, in fact, hidden object scenes, which is most unsatisfying.  That aside, it is a very pretty game and since I got this one on sale, I can't say it was really a waste of money. But no, don't buy it at full price.",
