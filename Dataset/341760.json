            "review_text": "This is a fun retro-with-love speed runner that might be frustrating for some but well worth playing! The difficulty is fair, like some of those great early games! You just want to keep on playing. The art is wonderful, with scrolling backgrounds like in Sonic. The first level gives us places to walk through that give a story through these nice pictures. The controls are very responsive! I also enjoyed the music. It was great seeing the leader board to encourage you to keep trying to discover ways to beat others times just like in the old ARCADE games! The only thing is that you may be frustrated. But why is that a bad thing? Just keep playing anyway, just like in the classics! We are too used to games holding our hand and not letting the player fail even a little bit that people forget the classics of how games used to be made. There are infinite lives, so that should cheer you up :) Go on, support indie games like this! They have more awesome in store!",

            "review_text": "Classic platformer with retro style graphics and an ''interesting'' protagonist. The game itself poses a nice challange with good music to go along. There are a few annoying moments where you die to see where you need to go or projectile spawning off the screen and falling on you. Overall it's a decent experience, however there are other games that are simply more memorable/better.",
