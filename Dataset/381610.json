Dandy is like that except cuter, and - somehow - even more inscrutable. The only thing I don't care for is the soundtrack, which is some ambient techno nonsense that belongs in a European racing game from the nineties,",

Overall gameplay is good and fluent. You have to think fast at some points in the later game! Could be very frustrating at times but people who play roguelikes are immune to frustrating. I'm not.   Fun to play but wears itself down very quickly. Big share of the items are almost just the same as others and the bullet graphics could be a bit different. There's a big variety of power ups but it seems I really can't tell which is which. It's a shame! It's very pricy for what it's worth. I tried multiplayer but there wasn't any players online. This game can't in any turn be compared to The Binding of Isaac. Do not do that!   This game has all the potential to be great. Maybe it will be. At this state you should avoid it. It's not worth 9,99â‚¬. My verdict at this state: 6/10",
