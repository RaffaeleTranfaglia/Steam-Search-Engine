The game greatly exceeds my expectations with this price, especially the short but subtle storyline, together with the awesome art work and soothing sound tracks. Play nice on linux. A definitely 10/10.  ============  致中文玩家：  买  ============  致开发者，关于系统的一些小的建议：   点击新游戏后没有再次返回主菜单的选项；   语言选择简体中文的时候很多菜单界面都是繁体中文的；   想看回想的时候习惯性地使用鼠标滚轮，发现鼠标滚轮无论向上滚还是向下滚都是回滚的效果；   建议能在新的章节出现的时候适度高亮新章节的飞机做为提醒，虽然大家应该都是一次性通关的？  祝好！",

As the story progresses you will start to notice the subtle details you may have disregarded in the beginning. If you decide to check it out make sure you read through the 'Decode' story after the main one to get a better grasp on what the story is actually about. Remember, the story isn't finished until you've unlocked all the achievements! I look forward to the next chapter!",

The art is lovely, the story is thoughtful and moving, and the music is good, though a bit repetitive. The voice-acting sounds good, though since it is in Chinese I really can't say much about it. The English translation is a bit spotty at times, but it's usually pretty easy to figure out what is going on.  The full experience should take about 2 hours; I'd definitely recommend doing it in one go.  Make sure to read everything ! ",
