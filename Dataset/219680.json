    "description": "Proteus is a game about exploration and immersion in a dream-like island world where the soundtrack to your play is created by your surroundings. Played in first-person, the primary means of interaction is simply your presence in the world and how you observe it.",

            "review_text": "Proteus is a brilliant idea that only excels in its visual execution. It perfectly captures the kind of world once portrayed using just a few, two-toned pixels displayed from an Atari 800. A world that you, the viewer were forced to imagine rather than witness in high definition glory. The problem is; there is literally nothing to do within that world expect to wander its hills and valleys scaring off groups of animals while listening to the whimsical but unimpressive, procedurally-generated music. It is best described as a tech demo and it would make a fantastic screen saver akin to the classic Windows 3D maze. The one thing it is not however, is a game. 24 hours inside of Proteus would offer no more enjoyment or depth than simply watching its 2 minute long trailer video. And that is possibly the saddest thing I've ever written in review. While most indie games leave you wanting more for their own good reasons, Proteus leaves you to starve on an empty island for want of anything at all.",

I turned off my lights, put on my headphones and I was absorbed into an experience, calming vibrations, pleasant visuals, a walking simulator, yes. Proteus calmed me, it allowed me to colapse into a false world where I wandered and watch the seasons change, the wildlife pass and my essence rise above this small wonderful world below.  During some of the dark in my life, I occasionally find lights that help me move on and give me small comfort.",

My mind boggles to think how much work must have gone into this game, to make the experience so subtle that it takes some time to even realise that you are playing a game. But trust me: you are. The more you explore the Proteus world the more you realise that there's more to this world than pretty graphics and nice music.   The world responds to you. Not just to your simple actions, but to the emotions you're feeling in a particular part of the world because of what's going on, what's already happened and even what you already know. It's amazing that no matter what path I choose, the game always has something for me; a new experience that surprises me, even when I think I know what's coming.   If you don't like games without tick-box goals then maybe this one isn't for you. But if you're willing to put aside your search for objectives for a few minutes and just explore instead, you may find that you come across them anyway.",

This game costs $10 regularly, and while a lot of people may argue it's worth that, (such as one reviewer with over 27 hours of gameplay) this is just not worth it to me. Honestly, you could enjoy Gone Home and Dear Esther and still find this game to be boring repetitive slog to get through. The soundtrack is honestly nothing special. Yes the music does change slightly based on where you are, what season it is, and what you are looking at, but it really never changes that much. This is not a game, it's a well-done art project.

If you prefer explosions and platforming, skip Proteus, but if you want to explore a procedurally-generated world and discover its secrets, this is well worth it.  It has a magic feeling to it. The graphics look very low-fi in the stills, but when the game is in action, the illusion is so complete, it all works. While people who don't give Proteus a chance and play it through at least once say otherwise, the game DOES have a beginning and end, and completing it once unlocks a few extra options (including allowing the terrain generator to get a bit crazier).  The save system is very clever. If you want to save a particular random seed because you like the island you're on, hit F9 to save a postcard. This postcard is a screenshot of basically your perspective at that moment, but it's more than that. The game visually encodes data into the image, and the image acts as a save state: Not only will you return to that island, you'll return to that moment.  If you can handle going 30 minutes in a game without blowing something up or killing a terrorist, you should take a long moment to consider Proteus.",

            "review_text": "It's pretty good. I'm writing this review about 2 weeks after I beat it, so don't expect a huge complex review because i'm for sure not playing it again.  It's one of those games where you play it to completion and then never touch it again, similar to Journey. If you're into a rich experience with a few things to discover along the way, this is the game for you. There isn't too much gameplay and the island is very small and hard to explore because you walk so slow, but the progression of the story runs on secrets so once you faff about enough you can eventually find the place to go to the next area. I'm not going to spoil anything but the game certainly isn't as pretentious as the trailer looks, it's just a simply relaxing experience with no hidden 'message' along the way. that in itself may seem like an odd thing to say in a review, but it's one of the main things that almost stopped me from buying the game. I didn't quite like the ending, and although it was powerful it lasted way too long. The main part- the music, wasn't too special. It was relaxing but after a while it all started to sound too samey. It's possible that was the point though, as the whole island seems dreamlike at points and really chills you out.  Overall, while this game is extremely relaxing with a great atmosphere, it probably isn't for everyone. While I did find a few secrets along the way I do not believe there is any replay value or incentive to even start up the game again after completing it. You also walk almost as slow as 'Dear Esther' so don't expect to be cruising around the island looking at things. The whole game takes time. I bought Journey for 15 dollars, beat it in an hour and didn't regret it at all due to the artistic quality and depth of the game. I bought this game for 10 and beat it in an hour as well, and feel the same way. Buying this game is like buying a ticket to an art gallery, just sit back and look at the paintings. If you're not into that, I would keep on walking as this game won't change your mind.",

If you go to a flower field, then you'll hear the music of the flowers. When you're walking through the landscape, it will all just blend together into a great, and truely unique musical score.

            "review_text": "Proteus is an exceptional and definitive 'notgame' that is easier to explain by what it isn't. It isn't about passive story telling. It isn't about objectives or achievements. It isn't about simulating realistic environments. It isn't about efficiency or mastery. Most importantly, it isn't about you, which itself is marvelous for a video game. Proteus doesn't want to thank you for saving it. Instead it wants to offer a glimpse of what was, is, and always will be, with or without your interaction.  So many games are psychological exercises in transitioning chaos into order, weakness into strength, beginner into expert, boring grass into busy city, and at the crux is you as the agent of transition. I am not immune to dopamine's effect when completing these types of games, and I definitely enjoy them. Yet when I think back at what these addictive games have taught me about myself it's that I need to justify my free time with feelings of accomplishment.  Proteus is the antithesis of typical addictive games; there is no feeling of loss and thus no reason to save. It deconstructs the spatial awareness of Doom and the floral and faunal mystery of Super Mario 64. It is about discovery and wonder. It is about recognizing aliens. It is about finding frequencies. It is about turning off sight to focus on sound, and vice versa. It's also a challenge to status-quo game designers to stop being lazy and comfortable. Have we really come that far from Doom and Super Mario 64? Is it benefiting anyone creatively by continuing those types of games ad-nauseum? And the much more interesting question that was raised by Paolo Pedercini: can the industrial rationalization of goal-oriented video game design be replaced by chaotic, paradoxical, and human design within the influence of our capitalist society?  Radiohead and Universal Everything recently published a free app with a very similar design to Proteus called PolyFauna. On their website, Dead Air Space, they clearly and concisely list the app's mechanics, not its plot or objectives - just as music, film, portraits, or sculptures would not have those things. So what if Proteus is considered art? It is beautiful, inspiring, or meaningless depending on your interpretation, not the designers'. You don't need it to have endless appeal like a FPS or RPG. But just like a piece of art, you might feel inclined to hang on to it, occasionally appreciating it by yourself or with others. Even if playing around in Proteus' pixelated ecosystem for only an hour causes you to feel differently about how you spend your free time, then it will have been worth a purchase.",

            "review_text": "Video games teach us to follow linear pathways to achieve a clear objective and reach a single, desirable end, a clear 'game over' where we know we've succeeded or failed. Proteus could not deviate from that system farther. The first time I opened the game (which was just now), I found myself tearing up over... well, it's beauty, it's adventure, it's hard to describe. It's Proteus. (now admittedly I'm a huge wimp, but the experience was really emotionally moving, and not at all something I expected from a video game :P) It felt like five minutes of gametime; my Steam says I've logged five times that much. If any game is truly magical, it's Proteus.  Most games are easily beatable with a lot of grinding and the help of a google search, a wiki, or a friend, but the thing about Proteus is you don't 'beat' it. You just play it. That's somewhat of a radical thing in video games, I think, and it makes playing Proteus a real stress-relieving experience. There's nothing to tell you what's going to happen, or even how you go about making it happen - that's what playing the game is for! You explore, you learn, you discover. It's a game that doesn't bend itself to the will of a dedicated, competitive player, it's a game that takes you along for an adventure. The music has the quality of pre-composed pieces but is formed naturally as you explore the environment, which changes with what seems to be a mind of its own. Swim to that island. Bump into that rock. Follow that blue hopping thing. Who knows where you'll end up? I don't. My mom don't. The wiki don't. At least I sure hope it don't... This game is whatever you want it to be, so I encourage any players not to start with asking what they can find or how to find it, but just to hop into the game and enter their own little dreamscape where anything and everything can happen. :3  On the practical side the game is very friendly with the options. You can play it fullscreen or in a window and you can adjust your field-of-view and mouse sensitivity very easily and even do it ingame if you please. The creators have pulled out all the stops to make sure this game is a convenient and comfortable experience as well as a beautiful one. I reckon I'd pay the full ten bucks for it, but if you can, get it on sale; whenever you can get your hands on it, Proteus will be waiting for you. :P  The game's not for everyone, but if you enjoy video games as an art form, if you're looking for a truly unique adventure that's both dynamic and peaceful at the same time, and heck, if you just flippin want to, give Proteus a try. This is a world I wouldn't mind going to when I die.",

Also, not sure if this was a problem just with my game, but I wasn't even able to access the 'options' and 'help' menu, and as such I hated how slow and clunky the movement felt.

That feeling may work for many games but most of the time you won’t find out one way or the other. Most designers and gamers alike understand that games are an amalgamation of many ideas rather than a thoroughly impressive one-trick pony. This understanding seems to have evaded the creators of Proteus, or maybe they thought their game was exempt. Proteus is a one-concept tech demo that might’ve been neat if it was part of something bigger but what’s there isn’t enough to keep your interest or justify the seemingly inoffensive price.  The concept of Proteus is relatively brief. You control a first-person character that starts off in the ocean with an island in sight on the horizon. Once you get to the island, your only source of interaction is what you walk next to. The game reacts to your presence by playing different music depending on your location and occasionally there is a sprite animal or insect that runs away from you. That is the entire game. There is “progression” and an “endpoint,” but not in the way you might hope for. Endings are usually synonymous with finales or closing thoughts. Proteus’ ends a lot like a High School final project. They probably could’ve kept prolonging it for a better grade but the class already lost interest and the teacher gave a glance that implied what they had was good enough.  That’s not to say that “good enough,” is actually any good. Proteus’ quality hinges on the music and visuals, neither of which is very impressive. The artwork may be appealing in screenshots, but the environment remains completely static during gameplay. There are occasional lighting effects which add a bit of variety but nothing to make up for the overall stiffness of the game. As a result, the world feels very lifeless and the lack of interaction from the player doesn’t help.   The music doesn’t add much personality either. Proteus’ concept of “different music plays depending where you are” certainly works but the sounds you’re hearing sound like placeholders rather than actual music. Most of the tracks sound like someone pressing buttons to see if the instrument is working rather than playing actual music. This blunder contributes to the feeling that Proteus is an undeveloped tech demo, not an actual game.  If you somehow “finish” Proteus, you won’t be getting much more from the experience than the person who loads it up for five minutes and closes it out of disinterest. This game may be the latest discussion in the “are games art” debate but I’d argue that Proteus offers absolutely nothing to the player. There is no interaction to speak of, the music is amateurish, the visuals are mediocre and the experience is pointless. There is no message or mood established in Proteus, it’s the definition of wasting time. Proteus may serve as inspiration for a mechanic that’s a part of a bigger game, but on its own there’s nothing worth playing.",

Not just because its primary appeal is its visuals, but also because of its pretty neat, procedurally generated, Phillip Glass-esque score. The primary mechanic is exploration and the combination of the audio and visuals make it play more like a sort of extended tone poem than a 'game,' but there are interactive elements and new things to see and discover on different playthroughs.   Not sure if there's enough there to warrant many play throughs, but it is incredibly....relaxing. Its cumulative effect is a bit like popping a couple valium and listening to one of those self-hypnosis relaxation tapes (which wouldn't be a compliment if referring to most games, but in Proteus' case it is). In fact, it's so relaxing that I kind of find the demand to control it to be a bit of an impediment at times. Someone needs to make an 'auto-wander' mod for it so I could turn it on and veg out when I'm stressed or just fall asleep to it.",

I did not live to see the aurora this time...  It's a brief walk on a small island. Four different seasons to see and listen. Until the end. That's it. For some it's just that and bit boring. For me. It's like watching the Snowman cartoon as a child for the first time during christmas time. It's like stepping into the forest of Mononoke Hime for a brief moment or strolling in the woods of Mushishi. The visuals, music and sound in complete control of my mood. It's pretty hard to rate or explain stuff like that. Obviously things like this won't work always like charm, but it did twice for me.

The music in the beginning sounded like some weird alien sci-fi-esque tune, Later on it sounded okay. Either way, felt the music choice didn't really fit the walking around. The only slightly amusing thing I guess was the little bouncing characters(which when I followed seemed to lead me to the water?) but that's about it.

I reinstalled it a few days ago and, not really expecting anything, I just started going around my little randomly generated island. I made friends with the animals, found out that the rocks made cool noises and just explored. I had no idea what was going on, but because I kept trying new things out at different times of day, interesting and often beautiful and mysterious things kept happening. And I ultimately came upon the ending in a profoundly affecting way because I didn't see it coming at all, I was just in a relaxed trance, taking things as they came.

Proteus is digital antidepressant and well worth experiencing from time to time when you need to destress.

The second half of the game, however, is very dull and boring, and these negative aspects worsen until the game finishes. Also, after 1 or 2 playthroughs, you've pretty much seen everything, as Protues is a very short title that should take less than an hour to complete, and there's no incentive to play again.

I watched day turn to night and night turn to day. There were no goals, nor any rules of what I had to do. I walked around an island, listening to the world. I climbed a mountain and heard the sea wind blowing. I walked into the rain and heard a gentle drizzle land on the nearby trees. As I played-- no, not played. As I experienced Proteus, I felt my muscles relieve themselves, and even now do I feel utterly calm. I can't explain this game, because it's not a game. Walking through Proteus was a reminder that the world is beautiful, and all we have to do is take time to see it.",
