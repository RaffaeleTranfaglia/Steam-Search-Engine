This game was made for tablets, albeit the commands were adapted to mouse and keyboard, it is an extremely simple TD game which can become boring quite quickly. Any TD game you find on Kongregate is deeper than this one, so if you want some challenge, try more evolved TD games.",

Graphically it is not very impressive, though as a positive note the design has a consistent theme and meshes together well.  There are much better TD games to play, and a lot of them can be found online for free. You can afford to skip this one.",

Seems like any other tower defence game, but there's something about it which makes it special. I love how you have to set the path of the enemies with the guns to keep them under control, but then all your maze-planning gets thrown out of the window when the air units arrive. Love the cartoony style of the whole game as well, so overall a great game :D",

            "review_text": "I grabbed this game on sale for a dollar. After playing it for a while, I say it's worth it.  It's a simple tower defense game. Build your towers, upgrade your defenses and make sure the enemys don't get through.   Simple right? In a way, no. The game gets very difficult (at least for me) up to a certain point. Your game might start with some really strong guys running towards your base when you only have a couple of towers that don't do that much damage. Yet this usually depends on the difficulty you decide to play it on. The levels also look pretty nice too. Sometimes you might have to defend only one side and sometimes you have to defend 4 corners of the map. The game is mainly in 2D (Except the enemys) but looks quite nice. Each level feels different from the other one. One level you defend on a field, or you defend inside a large factory.  The design of the enemys are interesting. I like the design of the characters. They remind me of the Soldier and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. Sometimes I don't take the game seriously because I keep thinking a bunch of Heavys are trying to destroy my base.  Overall, I give the game a 7/10 Mainly because I am not a big fan of tower defense games, but if you like tower defense games, then you might like it better than I do.  They also have a mobile version of this game for the IOS and Android last time I checked.",
