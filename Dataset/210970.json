            "review_text": "Not worth the $45.   I very much enjoyed the puzzles and the way you had to work to discover their mechanics, and the world is very nice to look at and and explore at first, but by the time I reached the endgame and had discovered just about all there is to be found I was left feeling dissapointed that I spent so much money on what felt like it should be a typical $15 indie title. I was shocked to hear that this game took 7 years to make, because it feels so empty outside of the puzzles.  The game sells itself as hiding a deep and profound story, the hidden mystery of the island that waits to be discovered, but the truth is that there is nothing substantial behind the pretty visuals. When I first explored I was fascinated by the strange people turned statues and eager to explore what had happened to this strange island and why I was brought here. What little answers there are,   that the island is just an inception-style constructed dream that you have entered for an unexplained purpose,   are unsatisfying and completely disconnected from the world you explore and any clues you can find, only becoming apparent in the hidden ending.  You can pick up audio logs throughout the world, but they also explain nothing. The quotes about religion, science, and discovering the truth of the world feel utterly unrelated to the actual game content, other than that you are discovering 'the truth' about how to solve puzzles. Their only purpose as far as I can tell is to make the game seem artificially deep and profound. The secret hidden audiologs also contribute little to the absent plot,   they are only scenes of the voice over people debating which quotes to put into the dream.    The store page description is a complete lie.   'You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.  You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.'  Reading this after completing the game I'm shocked. Memories? Clues? Who I am and why am I here? The game does not even attempt to explore any of this.  Other than the core puzzles of the game that open doors or lead you to the main ending and the challenge area, the puzzles feel compeltely pointless. There are extra puzzles off the main path that seem to do nothing when they are completed. At first I thought I was discovering some secret that required investigation, but in the end it turns out they do absolutely nothing. The environmental puzzles, an interesting surprirse when first discovered, also seem to do nothing, and don't provide any further insight into the non-existant story.  If you really like puzzles and don't want anything more than that, you will probably enjoy that aspect of the game. but I would recommend waiting for a drop in price before spending so much money on this game.",

There is no reward but puzzles; and when the puzzles are over there is nothing. The world is amazingly detailed, it's perfected, it's layout is fantastic. The puzzles are good for the most part. But they lack grounding, their context is flimsy and unsatisfactory. There is no plot. Scattered disappointing meaning in vague texts (audio and visual.) I can scarcely believe myself that nothing happens. But it's true. You beat the game, barely anything happens. You beat the hidden challenge, absolutely nothing happens. You beat the entire game and collect everything and nothing happens.

            "review_text": "(When/If this issue is resolved, I will consider changing this review. Thank you. Being TOLD when I can or cannot play a $40 game is a dealbreaker.)  I wish I was playing “The Witness” at this moment. Very much. But I’m not, because I’m currently offline, and it won’t run. Just as reported previously. And the error message again reads, “no internet connection”.  WARNING to anyone considering purchase. It may load offline. It may not. Most likely it will do some of each, as BOTH copies I purchased have done (or not done) to varying dergee when I attempted offline play.  Because of my considerable interest in this game I succumbed to misinformation from DEVs and childish insults from the community to try it again after obtaining a refund on my original purchase; that it was guaranteed to run offline at the time of my second purchase (and if fact, as was my first copy. Clearly!) Little doubt that if I had little enough self-respect to follow this discussion after this post, I would be told, as I was told then, that I am wrong, and my claims make no sense, and even that I'm stupid. Even though I type this sentence while LOOKING at the “no internet connection” message on my other half of my screen, produced after clicking on the PLAY button for “The Witness.” Over and over and over, as also noted in my previous report.   It may well be true that “The Witness” does not test for internet access. But it DOES test for Steam, and STEAM apparently sometimes tests for internet access. (Gee!) And if that check is performed, “The Witness” WILL NOT load. Of 800 games I own on Steam, no other offline-playable game has acted in this manner. How is that NOT the cause of the game, and thus the responsibility of the DEVs? (But there aren’t many of us left playing offline, so it’s really no big deal.)  So next time one of you “braniacs” in the Steam community (including the DEV who offered zero support or consideration, and asked no questions) wants to tell someone how much you know….. …please remember, you don’t. Prove it instead by asking the right questions, rather than making assumptions based on ego. OK? Everyone will benefit in some way.  (I just want anyone following after me to not be deceived or manipulated as I was. Buy if you wish, play if and when you can (as, at best, I may continue to do.) I made a mistake of misplaced trust, and I’m prepared to live with it. You others should at least have more information than I did, if not more choice. And please, always trust the evidence of your own eyes and experience.)  You have my $40 and whatever bizarre personal satisfaction some of you may have derived from my gullibility. I consider this a permanent parting of the ways. Had I been treated more courteously or professionally by any party involved, this posting might very different. As well as any possible interest in any future projects.  At least endeavor to learn something from this regrettable and avoidable experience.",

It also is wonderful for playing with a group of friends, your kids, your partner, whoever.  You walk freely around an island and solve puzzles. The game is open world, so you can never be stuck - if you have a problem somewhere, just continue somewhere else. The island is probably the most precisely and skillfully crafted level in the history of video games - 8 years of development time and it shows. The puzzles and their places on the island are simply amazing. Whenever you start thinking you've got the hang of how things are working, the game will blow you away with a totally new and unexpected (and plain beautyful) insight. These moments of epiphany will leave you stunned, grinning and repeatedly saying 'Mr. Blow, you magnificent bast*rd!' (he's the head game developer).  *** DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER, EVER LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT COULD REMOTELY BE SPOILERS FOR THE WITNESS! NO FORUM THREADS, NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE SECOND; TOTAL RADIO SILENCE. THIS GAME CAN BE SPOILED INCREDIBLY EASILY WITH ONLY A FEW WORDS OR A SINGLE PICTURE. IF YOU GET STUCK SOMEWHERE, NEVER LOOK UP THE SOLUTION, JUST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND YOU WILL BE SURPRISED HOW A FRESH LOOK CHANGES THINGS AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID NOT 'CHEAT'.

            "review_text": "The Witness is a masterpiece, though it's not for everyone. If you enjoy games which reward exploration and experimentation, there's a lot to love here - but even then, the game asks a deal of patience of its audience. You will often come across puzzles which you are ill-equipped to solve. The brilliance in the design is that all of the puzzles are entirely solvable with the mechanics available to players from the start of the game; the only real limit on the player is their knowledge of the rules. There are no explicit tutorials, but the knowledge is available to be discovered across the game's beautiful island setting.   If that sounds a bit vague it's only because I want to respect readers in the same way that the game respects its players, allowing them to explore and discover for themselves the many secrets of the island.   As you might expect in a game from the designer who brought us Braid, the narrative is very much open to interpretation. This is a game wherein nothing is explicit, and if you require that external drive you may feel rather lost. It helps a great deal to to come into this game with a willingness to think, to be confused, and to keep exploring all the same.   It's worth noting that colourblind and/or hearing impaired players may have difficulty with some of the game's puzzles, as they rely on an array of sensory clues. I encourage those affected to do more research before diving in.  It took me about 25 hours to reach the end of the game, completing a fair deal of the optional puzzles along the way - though I suspect the remaining ones could easily take another 5-10 hours to get through, if not longer.   I abstained from turning to the internet for advice the entire way through, and I strongly recommend that other players do the same. The game tells you everything you need to know if only you persevere - and the sense of achievement that comes from overcoming these challenges alone is great. Trust the game; it is fair, and it does want you to succeed.   All in all this is one of the most impressively designed games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. There is sharp intent behind every aspect of its construction - to a level that often feels absurd - and the result is an incredibly unique and fulfilling experience.",

            "review_text": "The less you know about the Witness the better the experience will be, so as soon as you've decided to dive in I recommend you immediately stop reading any reviews and start playing.   I can personally say that this game is the greatest puzzle game I've ever played, but a quick look around online shows that it is a bit divisive. I don't think this game is for everybody. Players that expect some revelatory story moment or huge twist upon solving a puzzle will be disappointed. Instead, you gradually discover how the world of the Witness works in a series of subtle moments. I feel like the Witness is for people who are intrinsically curious, and want to understand the world around them for the sake of understanding the world around them.  To me, the world of the Witness feels like an much smaller version of our world and, by extension, the player's time with the game feels like a miniature liftetime. When you first start the game with (hopefully) no prior knowledge of the world, you are basically a newborn. You play with the immediate environment around you, poke stuff, click stuff, and try to make sense of the basics of the way the world works. After a few hours under your belt, you'll have an understanding of the world at face value, and may even get a little cocky, thinking you've got the game down. However, after spending 60+ hours with the game, I can look back at my 10 hour self and laugh at how little I actually understood about the world of the Witness, how naive I was, and how much more I had to discover.  Then you'll reach 'adulthood', where you don't know everything about the world but you've begun to see the deeper secrets of it, and you have enough experience to start to wrap your head around the scope of the actual game. You'll reach a point where you realize how much more there is to this place, and for me that was one of my best memories in gaming.   If you stick with it for hours after that, you'll eventually get the 'reward'. That reward was when I felt confident enough to say I had a good understanding of the Witness. Puzzles that used to take 30 minutes now took 30 seconds. The island that felt so huge and overwhelming at first I now knew like the back of my hand. I looked at things in a completely different perspective than I did at the start. The game makes you feel like a genius. Maybe not a genius in real life, but a genius in your Witness life.   I still have a lot to go before I solve everything the Witness has to offer, and to be honest I probably never will, but I've never had a game that respected it's players ability to discover and learn as much as this game. The Witness is in a class of its own.  10/10",

I just had one of those moments, bursting out in loud laughter from pure joy while playing this game, figuring out and finding something I could do that I previously had no idea was even possible, that I didn't even think should be possible, but yet it all still makes some kind of weird sense. It was freaking amazing. To tell you anything more about it would be to give too much away.  This game is beautiful, intriguing , and compelling, weird, abstract, and logical. It makes you think outside of the box, sometimes literally, but in a way which still makes sense once you change your perspective.  This game is NOT just about mazes on a panel, though there is a lot of that and it is a main game mechanic. It's about what you do with them and how you learn from them to interact with and better understand your environment, your world that has been masterfully and meticulously crafted for your enjoyment.  If you like challenging, involved, and sometimes frustrating puzzles that occasionally blow your mind (no pun intended), you have to get this game, and shame on you if you don't.  That being said, I have to somewhat begrudgingly acknowledge that this game isn't for everyone. Some may even hate it, perhaps even for some of the same reasons I love it. This seems destined to be one of those games that many either love or hate. I'd say that it's a safe bet that you'll at least be quite fond of it if you're into logical, challenging puzzle games.

The plot is however a really hard nut to crack since it is told by very subtle details seen around the island and through different tapes and videos scattered everywhere.  The way the game forces you to rethink the way you think about old solved puzzles in order to understand the rules for later puzzles is something I don't thing iv'e seen in any other game before, almost every detail you see or hear in the game is there for a reason.

            "review_text": "I was extremely excited for The Witness, having followed its development since it was announced in 2009. I wanted to love this game. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the game that make it pretty terrible in my opinion.   First, the island, while hauntingly beautiful, is not really the star of the game. When playing The Witness, you simply move from maze panel to maze panel, and you can pretty much see everything and easily get anywhere you want if you solve nearby maze panels. There's not much of a feeling of adventure or even ambiance. Everything's quiet and empty. After a few hours of playing the island lost its charm and I wished they had just put the puzzle areas right next to each other, or given you a much faster sprint in order to quickly get between puzzles.  Second, and more importantly, some of the puzzles are extremely frustrating to the point that they're unequivocally not  even the slightest bit  fun. I'm not sure whether Jonathan Blow wanted The Witness to have a reputation as an essentially unbeatable puzzle game, or whether he was just a poor judge of how hard the puzzles are.  Of course the island has a few essentially impenetrable secrets that nobody will be able to beat without looking at a walkthrough, but you don't need to beat everything to get the ending. What I take issue with is the main series of puzzles that you face frequently and that you need to beat. Some of these puzzles are really clever and require you to be observant of your environment and think. These puzzles have a 'Talos Principle' kind of vibe that I really like. But the game goes much, much too far in giving you problems to solve with incomplete information. The most egregious offenders are the maze panels which deal with symbols indicating increasingly complex unspoken rules about how you must solve the maze. These get  ludicrously  complicated and there's zero explanation in-game about what any of the symbols mean. Somehow people have through sheer brute force divined the meanings of each symbol and shared them with the Internet, and you'll need to cheat and read that info to make much progress. Until you do, you'll wander around the island shut out from most areas. When you do, you'll laugh, because it's so comically implausible that anyone would be expected to figure them out on their own. And it's not just the symbols; the game repeatedly fails to provide the player with enough information to reasonably beat the puzzle. There are dozens of puzzles that don't give you quite enough information to nail down the exact maze path; you'll spend literally hours dragging your mouse guessing different paths because there are many possible permutations or transformations which could all equally well be the solution. Sometimes the game is smart about this and lets you enter a variety of solutions, but that's not always the case. You're going to be clicking and dragging a lot. This is not fun gameplay by any stretch of the imagination.  There are some really fantastic puzzles buried in this game, but it's not worth it. I will not sit in front of my computer for hours blindly guessing and probing to make sense of the world. The Talos Principle and Portal/Portal 2 are perfect examples of games which introduce concepts fairly, and have puzzles which are solvable in your head by simply thinking through them. Even if the puzzles get very difficult, there's no dumb trial and error involved. That's the kind of puzzle game I want.",

New mechanics are introduced, old mechanics are combined or altered and it goes all the way until the ending.

The atmosphere is great and the setting really lends itself to very relaxing exploration and puzzling.  You should also know: these puzzles are hard. If you aren't very good at puzzles usually, you probably will be very frustrated by this game.

There's an incredible amount of depth in a very simple way of interacting with the world + just about everything ties together. Every single puzzle is taught, every single puzzle has a mechanical language easing you into exactly how to solve it- and there's just a ridiculous amount of them all to work through.  i've yearned for a really good elaboration on what the myst series did to videogames for ages and this is just the sort of thing i've been waiting for, really. Games that do what the Myst series tried to do so few and far between, despite that series being so groundbreaking. Puzzle games centering around world- and exploration-based puzzles are basically nonexistent - there's barely even games that try and fail at it, let alone games like this that succeed so hard. The game feels like one that came from a world where games like the Myst series were iterated on constantly and the concepts had time to be polished and perfected, not a world where Fez and Talos Principle are the two bulletpoints on the timeline since the Myst series died.  Anyway: it's a really good game and you should absolutely make time to play it if you are interested in puzzles + game design at all! do it!",

I bought this game completely blind and my immediate first impressions were how breathtakingly beautiful the world is. Stepping out into the open of the island for the first time was a chilling experience. It's easily understandable why Jon Blow took so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to create this game. The design behind the game works so well.  *  [en.wikipedia.org]  The actual puzzles wouldn't find themselves out of place in a free mobile puzzle game, but the island adds entire new dimensions to the solutions. The answers are integrated into the environment in a surprisingly varying number of ways. The deceivingly simple puzzles are kept fresh throughout. Sometimes, like a Metroidvania, a simple puzzle will be impossible to solve until you explore elsewhere and learn how to use the new mechanic, helping you further uncover the secrets of the world of The Witness. The game will never explicitly explain the mechanics of the puzzles to you. You are left to decipher the island on your own. I wish I could describe some of the ways you need to solve the puzzles in this game, but of course, that’d ruin the experience of finding it out for yourself and feeling like a genius. So just trust me. It’s an incredibly creative game. This is an easy choice my 2016 game of the year.  Of course, this kind of game isn't for everybody, but if you have the slightest interest in the concept of 'wandering around an island solving cryptic puzzles' sounds interesting to you, I  highly  recommend The Witness.",

What makes it really shine though is how well everything plays together. All aspects of the game - gameplay, narrative, visuals - work together to form a really unique experience.  The game purposefully doesn't hold your hand - rules must be figured out by observing what works and what doesn't, and deriving your theories from your observations. There's no roadsign showing you the next puzzle - it's one big open world full of mysteries to discover. And just when you think you know how it works, The Witness will throw another puzzle at you that quickly invalidates your established rules and lets you question everything you've learned so far. In other words - the game not only forces you to think outside the box, but whenever you do that it shows you that you're just in a bigger box now.  There's so much that could be said about the game, but it'd be a shame to not experience it yourself. The Witness features beautiful visuals, clever and surprising puzzles, implicit storytelling and will keep you busy for at least 15 hours, possibly quite more if you want to discover every secret this island has to offer.

After a few hesitant moments at the beginning of the game, right after you leave the 'tutorial' area and you begin explorning the island, the game absorbs you and never lets go.  Each part of the island is brimming with puzzles that will leave you amazed at what you can actually achieve if you put your mind to it. One of those few experiences where you can walk out of it feeling fully satisfied of every second you spent playing on that island. At no moment you feel trapped or stuck on a puzzle for too long, as you are always free to leisurely move on to the next thing that awaits you on the island. The brilliant part is that taking those breaks actually helps you gain more perspective and aids you in solving those puzzles that proved too difficult at the time. With the right angle and/or spin, everything clicks into place in one of those so satisfying 'Aha!' moments that occur quite often throughout the game.  If you are a puzzle fan of some sort, or you are someone who likes to give his/her brain an interesting challenge every once in a while, give this game a world. Just don't expect a lot of action, explosions or cinematic moments, as there aren't any on this game. Instead, you will get an inmersive experience in an island where you will rekindle that child-like sense of discovery that is very hard to come by in most movies and games.",

But the logic of the puzzles is so varied and challenging, and the environmental impact on the puzzles is very distinct and keeps a somewhat simple idea really fresh for hours on end. Most games have a primary way of interacting with the game (in shooters, you shoot, etc.), and The Witness is no different. But the way in which the game distorts these puzzles, uses them to challenge what you already understand, and incorporates a beautiful environment makes The Witness a memorable and very enjoyable experience. The world is vast, with lots of places to explore and secrets/easter eggs to find when you want to take a break from the basic puzzle. The Witness does follow the recent trend of not giving the player much (if any) story directly, instead relying upon the environment and some hidden pieces to build the story of the world. This approach may not resonate with everyone, but I feel that it fits the story being told. I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone who like puzzles or wants to think a bit when playing their next video game. 9.5/10",

You will not like this game if your idea of fun is blowing stuff up, shooting zombies or nazis, racing quickly, trash talking, achievement hoarding, a talky-story (although there is excellent spoken dialog), or instant rewards for solving the tiniest challenge. This is a thinking game, a game about enlightnment and what it means to understand, fully, pretty much anything.   Some complained that $40 was too expensive.

There's no real narrative here to be engrossed by - you can find obscure and famous quotes dictated by voice actors that generally amount to musings on intellegience and discovery, accompanied by these colorful puzzles. It's both slightly charming and terribly pretentious, given the rather grandiose nature of the quotes submitted.   It's also a game that really burns you out if you play for extended periods of time. This isn't something to be marathoned since solving the same types of puzzles with general increases in complexity gets rather monotonous despite the backdrop - the novelty wears off.

If that's what you want, then this may be the game for you. But if you want puzzles in service of something else - ANYTHING else - then move along. There's nothing to see here.

From what I experienced, it seems utterly indifferent to my enjoyment. It offered no hooks. It simply exists, and much like the island on which it's set, it seems completely unconcerned with me or my actions.

The reward for completing a puzzle is almost always access to another puzzle, so, to be perfectly clear, if you tend to get angry at inanimate objects or have a short attention span, or just don't see the appeal of 2d maze puzzles no matter their depth, you should avoid this game.  If you like puzzles, though, you've come to the right game. Blow &amp; co. are puzzle-making maniacs and have created a game that teaches you how to solve every puzzle on the island with a carefully balanced, well-paced difficulty curve. The game oozes with polish, has a well-put-together world, looks fantastic, feels sublime, and has plenty of depth and gameplay to offer.  The game has crackling sound in a few places on my machine (earliest in the game in the building with the pots that have Voronoi patterns painted on them.) I didn't feel that it took away from my experience much, but if you have a non-standard sound card you might also have extremely occasional problems with the sound. I have a Xonar DX PCI-E sound card that's never given me trouble with any other game, and it's disappointing that it doesn't work perfectly for this game when the rest of the game is so polished.  Another disappointment, for me at least, is the game's use of lightmaps. I feel that lightmapped games tend to limit the number of moving parts of the world at the expense of gameplay, whether it's Mass Effect, Remember Me, or The Order: 1886, and I think The Witness could have had some really excellent mechanical puzzles beyond what it has if the lighting were more dynamic. I remember between 2004-2008 or so starting with Doom 3 there was a lot of hubbub about making everything dynamically lit and destructible, and there's a lot of gameplay potential that the developers give up the moment they decide to use lightmaps for a game.  Overall, this is my Game of the Year So Far for 2016, and it was a real pleasure to play it. I hope someone at Thekla, Inc. will see fit to give this game a Linux port at some point. Even though there aren't as many gamers on Linux and OS X as there are on Windows, this seems like the type of game that most Linux users would really enjoy, and that many Windows users would not, as the other Steam reviews clearly show.

This story doesn't adress much of anything - even if you drill down far enough to grasp what's really going on, with the second ending and hidden audiologs. There's just nothing of weight to it, and it's wrapped up in so many layers of secrecy that even if you do manage to wade through the pseudo-intellectual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y, the dissapointment at the end is doubly disgusting.   Blow's made a wonderful game here.   It's too bad he can't tell a story worth a damn.   I'd give this game an 8/10, just for the graphics and exploration and puzzles. Play it for that, and ignore his literary pretensions.",

The reward in The Witness is epiphany.  Solving the puzzles is satisfying, of course. Completing a tricky mind-bender using the rules you've found so far is good - but what's better is the dawning realization of *what the rules are*. The Witness won't tell you, and that's the game. Staring at a puzzle wondering how on Earth you're going to solve it, and then recognizing a clue - maybe obvious, maybe tiny! - that unlocks it. This is where the moments of pure joy come from in The Witness.  This is the most personally fulfilling game I've ever played. Buy it.",

            "review_text": "Great Game - with qualifications  Background: I loved Braid, I loved the idea of an Indie dev making a 'full priced' game with a singular vision, I followed dev with interest for years, didn't flinch at the price and pre-ordered it.  First Impressions: OMG what's up with the fixed resolution First.one.Impression: Oh, I can adjust the res on the command line and can now hear my SLI groaning in pain - but it does look so so f'in pretty. Thank god somebody else out there has realized a Sega-blue sky makes gamers of a certain age happy and I have a negative gut reaction to 'brown games' (Yes, I Bloodbourne I mean you - I don't care how many awards you've won).  So into the game.  What I was expecting, I'd come in with no thoughts this was a story driven adventure - not what I expected, wanted or got (if you did, move on - might I suggest Life is Strange). I love the puzzle panels. No 'Oh, the monkey can be a wrench' - you solve the game with the panels... no, that's not true, you solve the game in a myriad of ways, but always punch the answer into the panels.  Intro is pretty easy as the (t)ropes are explained to you, you're trapped in an enclosed space and clearly need to get out of it. You do easily and pick up some 'rules' as you do so. Once you've escaped the start-area, you can follow the path or wander off-piste, and be rewarded with another perspective around the start area and pick up your first tape. Bravo. Somebody anticipated my completionist urges.  Go back to the path and you're lead to a nice easy zone to solve. Go onto the next one, and get stumped and stomp off to bed in the wee-hours in an 'it's impossible to solve, I hate it' huff. Load it up the next morning, instantly see where you went wrong, happily romp through the next bit. On your way, spot some stuff you can't solve. Doesn't block you, but get pissy that you can't complete *everything* before moving on. FFS?!?! Quit with some stuff unsolved, move on, learn new stuff, realize you can solve old stuff and run back and release endorphines.  This is the point I realized the game was great. Previously my mind-set was do level one (all of it), then level 2 (all of it) etc - this game more than any I've ever played forces you to give up and move on (and then go back when you realize how to solve something you'd given up on). Other free-world games might give you an unbeatable boss, until you've unlocked a BFG weapon. The Witness, doesn't have weapons, it has rules. You learn, you understand, you can go back and defeat the previously unasailable. Moreover you never feel 'stuck'. Or rather you initially do, until you learn just to go off and do something else (there's always a something else) - and you'll accidentally learn something.  It's not perfect though. A few hours in, I thought this might be the best game ever, and then I got to 'The Swamp' All of the praise above was predecated on 'Not knowing the rules', then passively learning them, and then having the scales lifted from your eyes. Maybe you then solve the first puzzle easily and have a few more of increasing difficulty, you can scratch your head over for 10 minutes or so, but felt fun. The swamp just has a ♥♥♥♥-load of puzzles where you know exactly what you need to do, but just have to slog through them. Literally. They're in a row of puzzles. You solve them, and then walk around a corner and there's another row of them. No new concepts. No fun. Just more of the same f'in puzzles.  I resorted to a walkthrough at this point - and that killed a bit of my love.   Not wanting to end on a negative, I love the strange incidental stuff (very Braid-like). That strangely shaped crack in the wall, that if I line it up with the random pattern outside, seems to form an image. That massive statue way over there, thar if I stand just here and juxtapose with this thing in my line of sight, seems to form a tableau giving a very different meaning. You end up with the impression that the seemingly zonal-world, has actually been hyper-designed and there's potentially ideas to unlock all over the place, that you're continually going to discover or (mainly) miss. Wander, explore, absorb.  Still - no idea wtf is up with the swamp. Afer playing continuously for the first few days, killed my fun dead. Intention is to clear it using youtube, pretend it never existed, hope to god that was a one-off, or I will cry.",

I'm a huge fan of puzzles and open world exploration, and the ideas in this game are masterfully clever - but I don't think it's a good game.  I never got tired of the core gameplay - the variety of puzzles available surprised me, actually, and it requires a lot of lateral thinking to get through them. However, I found myself on several occasions unable to progress because I hadn't noticed a very slight detail, even though nothing I was doing was wrong. You don't need to complete every puzzle to win, but it's still frustrating.  My main complaint is with the ending. After a final round of puzzles that test everything you know up to that point, the game ends with two timed puzzles that are randomly created. Everything else in the game you can look up a solution if you just want to experience the next part of the game, so gating the ending to only those able to figure out a solution - and it's timed - feels petty to me. It didn't make the puzzles harder, it didn't challenge me differently, it just keeps the ending away from anyone who can't solve it. That, to me, is hugely arrogant game design.  Then, after you watch the end cutscene, it puts you back at the beginning of the game. I now have the choice of playing from the beginning of the game with all progress cleared, or going back to one hour before I won. Not saving right before the end, in a game I assume partially made to comment on the player's obsession with completion, was just a little insulting.  I enjoyed playing but I won't play again. It's maybe a $7-$10 game. Not worth it unless there's a really good sale.",

It is those moments of clarity and accomplishment and excitement, over and over and over again.  I won't be explicit, but this bliss of discovery and understanding is absolutely not limited to the puzzle panels themselves. That is what makes The Witness so beautifully compelling. The game is so much more than the sum of its parts. It's endlessly surprising.  The Witness presents a universe and trusts you to understand it. It offers all the tools you need to test your hypotheses and never changes the rules on you. And once your theories are proven true, it breaks down the walls you never realized were surrounding you and trusts you to understand this new, larger universe, use what you learned to find where the walls are, and break them down yourself.  The Witness trusts you and you have to trust it back. If you get stuck or frustrated or feel like something is impossible, you need to be able to step back and trust that the game is being fair to you. Because it is. The new understanding you seek is around you on the island, and the game simply trusts you to seek it out. It's never arrogant, malicious, or esoteric in its design.  Again, The Witness is so much more than what it looks like. It isn't just puzzle panel after puzzle panel. But if you don't enjoy the puzzles, you will never enjoy The Witness.  If you enjoy learning for learning's sake, if you see being proven wrong as an opportunity, if you love searching, discovering, and understanding, then The Witness is for you.",

It is a puzzle-game, one in which you solve puzzles. If you do not enjoy the types of puzzles it provides, or solving puzzles in general, you will -not- enjoy this game.  I guess the issue I have with this game is that it tries to be more than what it is: a puzzle-game. the world you explore is so beautiful and there so many little things that make you think there's SOMETHING going on. Human statues placed about, mysterious locked doors and plenty of INCREDIBLY artsy narration and video clips that ultimately have nothing to do with the actual game itself. I feel like the world provided gives the player this expectation of some sort of reward, like finding out why we're on this island, how we got there, what are these statues, what is in this cave, what happens if I solve all the puzzles?  The answer is quite frankly, more puzzles. There is no inherent reward for completing any puzzle in the game, except for 2 things.  1. Access to more ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles. 2. Self satsfaction that you solved that ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle.  It's kind of hard to say... it's just weird. I feel like J Blow wanted to make this beautiful world as something just to enjoy while solving puzzles (as well as being a puzzle itself), but I feel like it actually works AGAINST the game, making the player think that this game isn't just about solving ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles, when it is.  Again I think this game IS good, the puzzles and mechanics of said puzzles are some of the most intuitive and clever i've ever seen, the visuals are so enjoyable to look at and experience, it's genuinely a good game.

In part because, as a puzzle game, most of the joy comes from discovery and the understanding of what the game is trying to teach you, and so it is dangerous to say too much... But also because I could write entire essays about why I'm so thrilled about it. I'll try to keep it concise.  This is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It is no doubt a worthy and logical successor to Braid, even if the games have nothing in common on a mechanical level. It's downright amazing how elegant the puzzle mechanics are, just how much mileage Mr. Blow and friends got out of them, and how simultaneously intuitive and challenging it can be to grasp them.  At this point, if you know that you really do like puzzles, you should probably just buy this game.  The biggest praise, coming from me, is that I've 'beaten' the game several days prior to writing this, but I still don't feel done with it. Whereas something like Antichamber kept my attention for about two hours before losing me, after which I didn't feel engaged to keep trying to find my way through it, and many other puzzle games keep me focused for half the length of the game before impatience and headaches get the better of me and I beeline it to the ending, never looking back, I keep returning to the eerily perfect island of The Witness. Just a few minutes a day, just to wander around and hopefully discover something new. I wish I could explain why I'm not sick of it yet, but I can't. I just know there's more to do, and though I feel frustrated one day for not making progress, I'll come back another time and feel as if it was obvious all along.  At this point, if it's the pricetag the worries you, or the concept of a silent world devoid of anything but puzzles and nothing to keep you going, then don't worry. There is plenty of substance to The Witness. Perhaps there won't be an exciting, driving narrative to push you onward, or interesting characters to meet and have demand things of you, but you will find reasons to engage yourself in the world, and plenty of things to discover. If you're anything like me, you won't want to leave until you've unwound every single loose thread you can find. And even the ones you can't. Because it's only a matter of time.  Bottom line, I don't think I've ever played a game that has managed to make the simple pleasures of discovery and understanding feel so thoroughly rewarding.

Overall, I'd say it's been pretty great.  People who don't enjoy pure puzzles will likely not like this game. It's not a game that rewards you for solving puzzles. It's a game that throws puzzles at you and the reward is having solved them. That said, puzzles do prevent you from progressing, so some might consider that a reward, but I'm betting more people don't get the feeling from solving the puzzles.   While I could see it taking another 80 hours to finish the rest of the game, it would be incredibly boring if that were the case. If the rest of the game, as far as I can see, takes another 20 hours, I'd say that's as far as it could stretch and not turn tedious. And it's quite possible that even that number is optimistic.  I consider myself a rather good puzzle solver, and most puzzles didn't take more than 30 seconds to a minute, and many were less than that, even. Last I checked, I was at like 400-500+ puzzles solved.",

You'd think after a while a game with 400 maze puzzles would get repetitive after a while, but each area has it's own unique genius method needed to solve those particular ones. The only thing I found slightly frustrating is that some mechanics are explained in a specific area, and it's possible that you'll find more way more complicated versions of that mechanic before being shown the 'tutorial' ones - so if something appears totally new then you may need to walk away and come back later.  Either way, my gripes with this game are minor - The puzzles are incredibly rewarding to complete and if you even remotely enjoy puzzle games (I'm a huge sucker for them), then you probably already know that you'll enjoy this title.

Neutral observations: - No music for the most part - This game is not for everyone. If you dont like puzzles very much you wont like this game.  Cons: - Around .5% of the puzzles I found to be too much of a challenge or not clearly explained - There are certain...philosophical elements scattered in the game which are supposed to add into the story, like Braid. Unfortunately Blow still has not grasped the distinction between crafting a narrative which is hidden but meaningful and one which is vague and borderline meaningless. Fortunately some of these are enjoyable enough in their own right but they distract from the rest of the game and make the story feel like its own separated fragment. - Solving so many puzzles can be tiring after a while  Overall: Essential if you are into puzzle games. Worthwhile even if you're not. Get this.",

            "review_text": "This game is not going to be for everyone. If you're looking for a game that has action, violence, and an engaging plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. If you're impatient, and if you don't want your brain to hurt, this isn't the game for you. With that being said, in the amount of time I've invested in The Witness so far, it's already one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. The game takes the basic concept of maze puzzles, and introduces new mechanics to them to make you think. It then takes those new mechanics, and gives them a little twist, to make you think even more. And then once you think you've mastered that mechanic, it mixes it with another mechanic that you've previously learned, or even a brand new one. This game is hard, and it doesn't make any attempt to hold your hand. This game is going to make you want to smash your head onto your desk, but in a good way, because you want to conquer this latest puzzle so badly.  The game has an incredible atmosphere, with gorgeous visuals and ambient sounds immersing you into this island world. There aren't any graphics settings, which is a huge bummer, but hopefully that is something that could be patched into the game. The vibrant colors of the island really pop off the screen, and the different locations throughout the game are really neat. You can also listen to some audio diaries located throughout the island, which have different quotes from all sorts of different people. This would be a great game to have a podcast on in the background. Not that the sounds are bad, they do a good enough job to keep you immersed in the game while you're playing, but it might be nice to have something else to listen to as well. The controls work great, on both a controller and a keyboard and mouse. Pick whichever one you're more comfortable with. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the $40 price tag, but from what I've played so far, it seems absolutely worth it. There are a ton of puzzles in here, and it's going to take you awhile to beat the game.  tl;dr I you want something different than a complex puzzle game that keeps you on your toes with a great atmosphere, you're going to want to look elsewhere. But if you've been craving a game like The Talos Principle or Portal, you should absolutely pick this up. This game is worth the price tag, and it's going to be a long time before you forget your time in The Witness.",

            "review_text": "My Short Review of 'The Witness'  What makes The Witness a sublime game is that the mechanics continue to build upon themselves in profound ways. However, going into more detail about the WAYS in which these continue to expand and evolve really would spoil the experience.   I am willing to say is the following:  1) Despite how it may first appear, it isn't all just simple line puzzles on series of monitors about 'connecting the dots.' This mechanic forms the heart of the game, but it develops beyond that in really cool ways. These include expanding out into the world surrounding the puzzles so that the game and the world work in symbiosis.  2) It's going to push you to constantly re-examine the assumptions you've made about how the game plays and maybe even larger assumptions about the way you think in general, about the limitations of human perception and the way we make meaning. I can say that of very few games.  Very few puzzle games are of the caliber of the Witness. I've put about 20 hours into it thus far and I would rank it with the likes of Portal. It's going for something very different tonally (The Witness is austere where Portal is satirical), but it is that caliber of puzzle game and similarly highly unique.  And that's not to mention the aesthetics of the world it establishes. It's a beautiful world with shades of Myst. Imagine the ambling about the lost city of Pompey with a proliferation of pastel coloring at every angle. And it has a polish goes goes all the way down to the satisfying 'thump' when you lock a puzzle in place or the ping when you query the cursor. This isn't a cheaply made thing. It is a thing made with the type of loving care to detail that is very rare. There's no jankiness or weird graphical glitches or animation hitches we've come to expect with modern game design's growing pains anywhere to be seen. Nothing but a high caliber sheen.   I would just like to end by discussing the supposedly controversial price point of the 'The Witness.' If you are someone who plays games but doesn't think this game is worth $40 then there are really only two possible explanations:  1) You have not played it yet and don't realize you are profoundly wrong. Profoundly.   2) You are a very stupid person.   In the first case, allow this review to inspire you to give it a shot. In the second case, you are likely too dumb to appreciate this game anyway and someone should probably come and take that $40 away from you before you accidentally shove it up your nostrils and suffocate in your idiot confusion over trying to use your mouth as a breathing apparatus.",

So I figured I'd ignore the bad reviews and give it a shot since it was on sale for 35% off. Oh man I wish I hadn't. I played a good amount on my first two play throughs and then I wandered into an area where the walkway I was standing on turned into a moving platform when I solved the puzzle. Cool. Only the next two puzzles were too confusing to figure out. No big deal, I'll just go back. Hmm... can't jump back there's no jump key... I know, I'll fail the puzzle and it should put the walkway back to it's original position. Nope? That's frustrating. Oh well, I'll start a new game because I finally made sense of some earlier nonsense.   An hour and a half later I'm feeling better cause I'm making a lot more progress than I did before. Hmmm what's this? A puzzle where it incorporates the rocks in the background into the solution. Oh that's neat! Next... ok these are interesting but... hmmm why can't I figure out this one with only a single rock in it? 20 minutes and a hundred attempts later 'Eff it, I don't care if I can't solve them all let's check a walkthrough. Ok WTF? You have to position your character 45 degrees to the left of the sign and then you'll see some rocks that line up properly so you can solve it. Urgh that was lame... next puzzle... oh, looks like they want me to do it again? Check the walkthrough. Nope, it's these trees in the background... but wait a minute that solution doesn't even make sense when they tell me the answer!  Ok Eff this game!  My hat is off to those that can actually solve these isoteric nonsensical puzzles and somehow enoy themselves at the same time, but holy crap I haven't had a game make me want to rage quit this much since... ever!

Half the puzzle is figuring out the rules to the puzzle, which was so much fun to me. Once you've think you've learned rules, they start to get harder, and harder, and harder to make sure you really understand it. Then once you've learned all the rules to all the different types of puzzles. You can attempt to beat the end game puzzles, where they start to combine the different types of puzzles together.   I like to think that this game was a test, and the puzzles outside of the end game area were just helping you study. That's EXACTLY how it felt to me.

Some of the twists are quite clever, but it's still line puzzles as far as the eye can see. I'd lover a little more variety in puzzle type.  That said, I've been enjoying them so far, and the artwork is very nice.  A solid 3 out of 5, 4 of out 5 if you don't mind never-ending line puzzles.",

The game itself is very different from most modern games and gameplay since it does not have the same protagonist vs. antagonist mechanics, but does allow for a more cerebral puzzle solving experience in a beautifully designed world. Creator Jonathan Blow has truly demonstrated that video games are art and offer something far more substantial than worrying about DPS and leaderboards.",

            "review_text": "The Witness is not a game that everyone will appreciate, but it will strongly resonate with some people. Much like Jonathan Blow's previous game, Braid, The Witness takes a simple game mechanic and explores it as fully as possible. While the actual gameplay involved in solving The Witness' series of two-dimensional mazes differs significantly from Braid's time-manipulation in a platforming context, I feel that most fans of Blow's last game will love this one even more, while those who thought it was pretentious will think that The Witness is even more pretentious.  The game is still 'just' a game, so I don't want to get anyone's hopes up too high, but from playing well over a thousand games over the last few decades, I would have to say that The Witness is one of the most noteworthy and original games that I have experienced. A large part of one's appreciation for the game will be based on what one puts into it though. If you look up any spoilers or hints, you're not really playing the game and are better off spending your time and money elsewhere.  If you play games for the story, you should pass on this one. If you play games for the gameplay or challenge (and have an analytical mindset), you should definitely give it a shot.",
