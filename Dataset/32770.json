            "review_text": "Still the BEST tactical CQB simulation for massive online play!  People don't doubt spend 20 and come play online! All this SIMULATION needs to rock, is more players.... This simulation is super cool on full servers!!  But simulations do nothing without combatants, this is a simulator, not a game! No single player mode. (A few practice levels meant to set up keyboard configuration only)  But servers used to be full and on full servers, this is the best ONLINE experience/CQB combat simulation, not counting (VIRTUAL BATTLE SPACE III)  Graphics are fantastic for this, type of simulation game, action is great. But it is no sigle player story telling game it is a real tactical simulation.  Without combatants, Massive Multiplayer online simulations do nothing. Where is everybody gone???  The graphics really come to live when everybody is fighting..... And they are really good for this type of game!",
