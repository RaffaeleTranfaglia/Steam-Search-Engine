            "review_text": "Unending Galaxy promises real time 4X with a cool twist - build up from one ship, to a mighty galactic spanning empire.  However, the details of executing this promise are frustrating to accomplish - all from a lack of information given to the player to the lull of getting from one ship to an empire.  The game has some great stuff in it from the X universe, which the creator is a modder of. The good stuff is : the ability to make ships auto-trade and auto-mine asteroids to start building you a nest-egg for your future empire. Getting this is no problem at all and is very nicely done.  The combat however is very break-neck speed in my opinion. Big ships that cost quite a bit of money can die if you dont immediately start evasive maneuvers to get out of combat and kite enemies...that is unless you grossly outnumber the enemy, which can take a bit of time, even for small pirate factions.  Couple this with the fact that the game never tells you what weapons do differently than each other(even trying to guess visually is very rough), the one dimensional defense modules that just add shields: which all seem to get blown away with very little effort...and this makes managing a small combat fleet disappointing.  Building an empire is fun in this game. You get to build a lot of trade infrastracture that spans the entirety of a galaxy. But the lack of information on which ships have enough cargo room to build can set the player back at least 10-20 minutes of game time if they do not guess right. On top of this, there is a big system of infrastructure required to get ship parts and supply. which is also not that well explained in the game. This really stops you from enjoying the fun nature of this game for another couple of hours.   Overall, this game has potential to be a very fun 2D , real time 4X, that gives us what we want - adventures in a big galaxy on a small scale that lead to massive galactic warfare in the end. But getting to the end is a big pain in the ♥♥♥ and is just not as fun as it sounds when you see what is happening in the game and know what it takes to get there.",

            "review_text": "Unending Galaxy is a fast-paced 4x real-time empire builder. there's a few issues, but it's got a LOT going for it, not the elast of which being the active developer who is constant working and updating the game, something that is unfortunately rare in the current climate of early access and greenlight trash that permeates the Steam.  down to business then:  Pros:  -Many (positive) similarities to the X series of games, specifically X3 - Terran Conflict, probably the best known of the franchise. This is mainly due to the developer being a serious X3 modder - he brought in all sorts of fancy empire management options and automation that is common in the X games.  -sophisticated mechanics that allow for deep gameplay  -variety of ways to play. you don't have to build an empire or colonize worlds, you can make plenty of money and get huge fleets going just by trading, mining, hunting bounties, and pirating.  -game explodes in complexity once you finally colonize a planet and get around to building industry infrastructure (for some this is a con, but if so, you're playing the wrong game bruh)  -game graphics are simple, 2d sprites, but this actually helps in terms of being able to clearly identify what is happening on the screen  -so many different maps, scenario starts, and game world customization options, that you could tool around with the diffenret starting options forever.  -Race/faction ships all play and feel genuinely differnet, races have well-established strengths and weaknesses.   Cons:  -UI is sometimes difficult to parse, there is a LOT information to be juggling in your head all at the same time, and those who aren't veterans of the X games or of large-scale 4x/real-time strategy games in general are going to feel overwhelmed.  -selecting ships and giving orders is much harder than it needs to be. too many menus to go through in order to give simple instructions. Dev has acknowledged some of this criticism and is actively working on parsing menus and generally improving the UI.  -it's not entirely clear what strengths and weaknesses certain weapons have, and which weapons might be more effective for certain situations.  -combat is simply too fast - large battleships can be reduced to cinders in seconds by a well-coordinated swarm. ships movement as well, is gnereally speaking very very quick given the size of the individual sectors - if the sectors in space were larger, the speed would be fine, but as it is, you traverse sectors and die in combat entirely too quickly. if you really want to keep your ships alive, you'll have to engage primarily in small-scale maneuvers and take personal control of your battleships so you can get them out of harms way quickly  -diplomacy is basically non-existent - this is the only place where the game really falls down, IMO. There are no real permanent alliances or trade options, everything is on a timer and will eventually run out. the ai has no real sense, it seems, of where it's fleets are at and what kind of force distribution is going on - generally speaking, when it's time to go to war, the ai throws everything it has at you (and each other) and whoever happens to win the first major engagement will then proceed to (more or less) steamroll the loser. beyond this, the ai is EXTREMELY aggressive. their only long-term interest is war, and when you are just beginning a game, attempting to colonize a planet and build up your empire, you can easily get smashed before you can even get off the ground.  Most of the cons amount to simple fixes or adjustments in the way the game mechanics work. I'm confident that the dev will get things figured out.   I would reccommend this game for anyone who liked the X games or large scale space 4x games with a real-time twist. now is an especially good time to buy, seeing as there was just a big content update as well as a superb graphical update which really improves the overal look and feel of the game.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed the first 6 hours of the game.  Would compare it to the old X-series in 2d and less complex. You build factories, you build ships and you can fly them yourself or play it like an RTS, which is fun too. Ships can be automated (to go hunting, trade, mine etc.) so you don't have to do all the micromanagement.   It still needs alot of balancing stuff to be done. I also miss the option to be part of the existing empires/factions. It seems like you are forced to have your own faction (might be, because I always choose Mogul as my starting scenario). However, the devs are working on the game and there are updates each couple of days.  Overall it is worth the money, the devs asking for and I'm looking forward to spend more time in this game.",

            "review_text": "Although the learning curve on this game is somewhat high due to a lack of current or complete documentation (still in devlopement), I find Unending Galaxy (UG) to be a refreshing 4X game with a challenging AI, broad spectrum of potential scenarios and replayability, and just plain fun to play. Once a player understands the controls, it is comparitively quick to play compared to other 4X games and yet still has a great deal of depth and a range of options for playability for various styles. For a person like me who has a lot of personal demands upon my time, this has been a great way to feed my 4X game appetite. I feel like in my dozens of hours of game play that I have hardly hit the surface of the game on many levels, and yet, the economic system and combat are straightforward and fast. At times, I micromanage as much as possible while at others, I put my ships on autopilot and sit back and watch the action. It has the feel of a universe which I am still exploring...and a game which will occupy many hours and days of my time.",
