For starters, theres no further options like the previous, such as allowing teams on or off, and the difficulty settings. Those what makes Delta Force a great game, this game is decent. Its a good run though, but too easy for me especially when you dont have the option to turn off respawn which is always on. This is something a child can beat.",
