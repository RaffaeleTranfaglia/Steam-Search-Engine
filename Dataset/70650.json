But i give this game a 7/10 yeas i know i ranked this higher than worms 1 but sry guys thats just how i feel with this. This games graphics are fantastic as well as the music very catchy! but i do reccomend this game if u just want a lil fast paced vs game its not exactly like worms but i like this spin off!",

            "review_text": "This is a boring and generic old match 4 style puzzle game that has really nothing redeeming about it to bother spending time or money here. I got this game with a humble bundle for $1, but I'm shocked to see that the developer wants almost $9 CDN for this title on the store page. This game came out in 2002 according to the store page and it really shows it's age here. There are very limited visual settings and gameplay options. The graphics are decent for such an old title, but the gameplay is really unpleasant and simply not fun. You control a character in a boat, shooting a bazooka style weapon at blocks, trying to match colors and generally clear the screen in a time limit. There is also a battle style game where you match colors and use weapons against each other but it's really nothing special.  Pros: -Bright colorful graphics, decent music and sound effects -Lots of puzzles if you actually have fun there may be a lot to do here -2 player local competetive -Supports Steam Overlay  Cons: -Gameplay is incredibly boring and unusual. Controlling a boat while aiming and avoiding attacks from above is not fun. -No Online Multiplayer, No Steam Achievements, No Cards, No Fun. -Character design is lame compared to other worms titles.  I'm not a huge puzzle game fan, but the few I have played have been much better than this. Don't buy this game at full price, and if you get it in a bundle you may quickly find it to be a waste of time too.     ",
