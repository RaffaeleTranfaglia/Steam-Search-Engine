Simple gameplay and mechanics, very beautiful, stylish and flashy colors, and a GREAT soundtrack, it goes astonishing well with the gameplay.  As soon as you've completed a level, it just continues smoothly with the next. Well done, you can keep up your flow pretty good.  Void Invaders is very challenging, but since Dark Souls I kinda became a masochist so I really adore the difficulty in VI.  There are some pretty nice and challenging boss fights in there aswell.  The price is justified imo, so get yourself a copy and take a nostalgic break!   PS: the developers are very kind and nice persons aswell :)",

I not only was reminded of Space Invaders &amp; Galaga, at times it felt like a little Millipede &amp; Megamania. Only gripe is that is does not work in steam beta, had to simply switch back to current steam which took less than 5 min.",

I love EDM and this game is perfect for it. A great soundtrack really does add a lot to a gaming experience and this game indeed has a very enjoyable experience overall. It might not seem like it does anything special or out-of-the-ordinary, but sometimes sticking to the old formula is the wisest thing to do. This game is awesome and I really do not regret buying it at all.",

            "review_text": "Was enjoying this for a bit, hoping that it wouldn't fall into the trap that many shoot em ups get into in later stages, but it does. Later on instead of making better units, or continuing with more variety, they start throwing 4-5 entire screen covering shot enemies on screen at once that you clearly can't avoid and have 3 waves in a row of this, and just hope you don't take too much damage. Then more really hard guys later, thus making you get through tons of overly difficult poorly designed parts at once, and if you die you must repeat. Why do designers think increasing repetition in later stages and frustration makes for good game design because it gets 'more difficult'. At one level, 21, you encounter this guy that stays all the way at the bottom of the screen, who also constantly shoots continuoues never ending streams of shots at you. So since you can't get under him and you can't shoot sideways or down, you have to try and get through his unending shots, and just hope a few bullets hit him on the sides and head. Since you barely get any damage done at all you need to do this forever. If you die its 'do this and all those other parts with multiple screen filling attack enemies' over and over again. It's a terribly designed enemy that's lacking in design and just hard for the sake of being unfair and lazy.   Many guys look the same. There's no getting health, except leveling up, which the game decides on, based on how many enemies they give you and where. So it can be annoying how they laid it out instead of medkits of floating health from killing enemies like it should. You level up, but it doesn't seem to do much, and you don't know how it makes you better. There are some cool upgrades, although some can hurt more. Bosses are cool, but later stages also fall into lazy design by having 4 bosses in a row so you have to survive them all, instead of just making 1 boss have more health or design him better.   First 2/3 was good, unfortunately bad design wins out in end.   3.5/10.",
