            "review_text": "This is one of the best city simulations out there, especially when looking strictly at games with good graphics. That said, it is not without its flaws.  The Good: - Lots and lots of replayability. You could get lost in this game on just a single city for weeks. - Your cities interact with each other to an extent. You can trade things like water, fuel, industry, and office services amongst the cities you create. This allows you to specialize your cities, such as creating an industry giant that feeds industry goods to your cities where you want to avoid polution, such as a resort town. - You can point and click your way through everything. Given how many options you have for roads, buildings, etc, the menu is easy to use and allows for quick access to everything. - The game feels like a semi-sandbox during normal play, as there isn't really many restrictions in place (and you can switch the building restrictions off in the settings). - As you build up your city, you get to a point where you realize it isn't just about building anymore. Management becomes a much bigger deal. One of the biggest management challenges is transportation, and that adds something to the game that I find quite enjoyable, making it a bit deeper than it might look on the surface.  The Bad: - Some of the mechanics for laying out streets (especially bridges) and buildings can make things a bit frustrating. - The whole Cities XL series are just reboots. They look the same, play the same, and feel the same. This makes for a bit of a hidden 'good' I guess in that you shouldn't feel the need to own them all (I do and don't have any reason to play any of the previous ones). - They removed the online function that the original had, rather than making it work. The idea of being able to have cities existing in a 'truly global' world definitely had an appeal. - The developer is lazy. The failure to make online work, some small problems and unfinished features, and the mechanics that are still issues still unaddressed after so much time just speaks to the lack of care the developer has for its work and reputation. They did 'fix' things to a point where they weren't really game-breaking, but it still sits in my mind that they seem to want to skate by at this point (especially given how much effort they put into trying to create a great alternative to another 'CitySim' game).  If you really like city management/builder games, this gives a good balance between the two and should be able to keep your entertained for quite a while. If you can catch it on a sale, then great! If not, you just need to decide what your dollar is worth. As far as putting a dollar value on fun, you have to do that for yourself, but even with the flaws, the value was definitely there for me given how much entertainment I have gotten from it. Decidedly beats spending the money on gas, a ticket, and some overpriced popcorn and soda at a movie theater for me.",

A bit less tedious, and has a very impressive feature of zooming down to street level instantly to see what the city looks like from the citizen's view. Pleasantly surprised to find Sim City has a successor.",

Cities XL is robust, beautiful, has crazy amounts of freedom, and city plots that are absurdly gigantic. Anyone who is a fan of city building sims owes it to themselves to buy this game. I hope some day down the line I recover from my SimCity burnout and can come back and really dive into this awesome game.",

            "review_text": "At the time of writing this review I do not yet own Cities XXL or Skylines, so for me, this is the best city builder I have in my collection (which includes Banished, Anno 2070, Cities 2008, Tropico 4, as well as RTS builders like Red Alert 3 and AofE) ...   and I love it!    The graphics are incredibly beautiful and you can zoom in right up close to the action (like Google Streetview) to capture some amazing screenies of your city. Day or night, it is very entertaining to check out all the wacky goings on of your inhabitants. You can select a car, pedestrian, truck, or train and follow it around the map. Travelling along the train tracks will allow you to explore the world of tunnels and underground stations you have constructed.  There's a lot of micro-mangement of all aspects your city (including trade between other players and cities youve built) - some may not like this aspect of the game but I find it quite enjoyable and challenging. This is a massive game with lots to do to keep you entertained for endless hours.  There are plenty of gigantic maps and hundreds of buildings to choose from. Additionally, the Cities player community is quite extensive and there are countless mods to help you construct the city of your dreams.  I bought this game on special ($15) long before XXL was released. I hear there is little difference between the two games, bar a few bug fixes, performance improvement, and a couple of new buildings. I think if you are on a tight budget and can grab this version on a super sale (say $5) then it is still worth buying if you can't afford Cities XXL.",

            "review_text": "This is a great game for any city building fan that desires to have a more in depth and harder simulation on building an entire world, not just individual cities. In CitiesXL you are intrusted with the task of populating an entire world featuring over 60 city locations (more can be unlocked via mods). The objective of the game is to develop a world where cities work with one (via trading resources) to help sustain each other in the world. You will have cities that produce and export food and industry to cities that produce and export oil and electricity. In the same token, your oil and electricity producing cities will export to your food and industry production cities. It is so in depth that you can set which city exports to which other city, the amount of export that you are providing also can be set. A lot of people consider this game to be dull or lifeless, but that is not so. This game is not for the casual gamer, it is for the hardcore city building gamer who wants a true challenge in building and managing an entire world of cities. For me this is the best city building game in the market. Far better than Sim City even.",

Seems to cover all the bases, including a lot that Sim City has notably missed out on. A very grown-up city sim.  The downside is that it runs very slowly as your city gets larger and larger. This can become a problem as a population booms. So many calculations per second that even eight-core AMD processors simply can't straighten it out. It's a programming flaw that has been in the Cities XL series since the beginning, and the programmers haven't sorted it out. (It has nothing to do with your graphic card, as some mislead people might suggest.) It is still superior to Sim City (a little bit childish, really) even with this downside, and if you're debating which to get, I'd push this your way. Get both, they're now in the budget section!",

CITIES XXL IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OF THIS GAME.   First off, I'm on windows 8 and have not encountered any of the so called memory leaks, it is possible, but everything leaks a little bit. It ran perfectly well on my computer.   Pros -    Great traffic design   Good graphics   Large build plots   Different types of buildings and densities for each type   More detail and less childish than current simcitys   Citizens are tolerant to taxes.   Cons -    Trade is absolutly terrible, computer will never make neutral agreements or trades that are a tad against the cpu   Token system for trade is complex and not explained well   Cities get laggy because of very large size and details, not a memory leak, its just that the city is consuming a lot of RAM to render everything, bad optimization   Needs system for citizens is weird, more linear wants and needs(this goes up, that goes down)   Citizen AI and system is not very good, you can build retail directly across from a house and the house will complain that it has no retail.   Sometimes you loose flow control on roads and dont regain it even if constructing a new road the same spot   Trading is almost forced in the game, you can move into a region with none of a certain resource and it you cant make the city prosper until you make another one and trade with yourself.      If you just want to mess around with flow control and have fun building small to decent size cities, this is right for you, but if you want to make a massive global economy and dominate the world, wait for the new Cities, which is coming pretty soon. I had fun with it in the beginning, but the mid and end game are repetitive and the only change is how you format your cities.   I'm saying recommend just on the fact that I do not dislike it enough to not recommend it.",

I found out what the problem is with this game. dotnetfx is not compatable with 64bit and you need dotnetfx to play the game, as long as this problem stays its for people with 64bit a waste of money!

I think the economics of Cities XL are a lot more advanced and interesting than the economics of Sim City. However, other things are less inspiring.   Something about Cities XL makes it less fun. I think its because it is more of a sim and less of a minecraft. What I mean by that is that in Sim City I can build a massive and beautiful city the way I want and do so fairly quickly. Cities XL makes you really work for your creations.   My other complaint is performance, on a fairly high-spec PC it still has performance issues. This isn't any differnet than the Sim City titles that have been released in recent years.  At the end of the day, I would rather play my Dos-Box Sim City 2000 I bought from  Gog.com .",

I wanted to turn off the sound, it was simply impossible, it only worked after I started the game and used the menü there - World Map buttons for cities didn't work, every time I chose a map it jumped to some rocky map no matter what I chose. Choosing over the list on the side worked, but not even after the city was founded it was possible to start it on the world map. - some buildings are missing in the menü it seems (incinerator wanted some recycling center in the vicinity, but there was no such building in the list, not even after I tried to unlock all buildings with the cheat) ....I don't really have any more motivation to write about this game, no idea why this platinum version is so much worse than the normal one.....",
