If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together.   The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously. Learn to enjoy killing and being killed. If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry. Play for about an hour or so and then quit. Come back another day when you both are out of it again. Then just repeat this cycle.  If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away. If blowing youself up again and again makes you smile, this is the game for you.",

This game goes on sale quite often, but if you do not wish to wait, this game is definitely worth the $15.  Different people play this game different ways, and there's a lot of interpretations on the most effective way to enjoy.

Along the way, you can set your friends free with the in-game currency, gems, as well buying cool new weapons by bribing the guards (who are cats, of course) with yarn. All of this is accompanied by hilarious commentary which has been specifically designed to leave you in stitches. All of this can be done with a friend, either local or online. If you want to be a bit more competitive, there's even an Arena mode which allows you to compete with up to three other people in ridiculous challenges such as capturing horses or collecting gold. This game also covers the community connoisseurs with a cornucopia of community-made challenges on the Steam Workshop. Overall, this game is worth it for the comedy and even more worth it for the gameplay.",

It's a very intense platformer, particularly if you've got a 'go big or go home' attitude like myself and try to do hardcore mode. The difficulty progression is fairly cozy; it doesn't hold your hand, but eventually you're going to have to do quite a bit of thinking to try and get some decent scores. Absolute tons of character heads to get if you're a customization-savvy person, as well as several weapons to use, although they aren't as useful as I'd like them to be. Trying to get those perfect scores and find the hidden gems gets really tough, but you feel pretty accomplished once you find them all and can still speed your way through the level fast enough. Co-op is really fun as well, with different challenges so you can enjoy a whole new world of levels with a friend.  The voice acting is phenomal, as I would expect from Stamper. The story-line is fairly light, but still hilarious with said VA. Music isn't something I usually comment on, as I don't really pay attention to it for whatever reason, but I really enjoyed the sound-track. Various songs on each of the levels,  Graphically, it's pretty similar to any of The Behemoth's other games; not to say that's a bad thing. It's very good, with plenty of dynamic animations everywhere to keep your attention to what's going on. As usual, a nice, clean, consistent look to it, and overall looks great.  TL;DR - If you enjoy challenging but rewarding platformers, and are looking for something new and interesting, I definitely recommend Battleblock Theater.",

Alongside the fact I had heard it was an amazing game on the internet and through friends was what lead me to get BattleBlock Theatre.  Positives:  - Fantastic, interesting yet hilarious plot. - A wide variety of characters and powers/weapons achievable. - Each map is designed differently with chalanges such as fighting 'cats' and walking 'toast'. - There is always an aim/task at hand from completing maps on 'insane mode' to completing 'Furbottem's Features'. - How one uses the gems and balls of yarn they have collected through maps to buy new characters and weapons. - Online with friends is great with teamwork and completing maps causing much satisfaction. - Fubottem's Features is a great ad on with a much wanted character as the prize for completing the specific chapter.  Negatives:  - There are only 8 chapters. At least make it 10! - As much as it is a great game for many the £10.99 pound price tag on steam may be too much.   To conclude I think by far the positives in BBT out match the negatives. It is by a mile my favourite platform and indie game of 2014. The 28 hours I have played so far have been unbelievably fun having completed all 8 chapters of the plot and Furbottom's Features.  ",

My main issue with the game is the 1 life restart feature. To put it simply if you die once you have to gather all the items again. Personally I would have a 2-3 life per level and grade the person on how many of their lifes they use.

Easily the best addition is the ability to create you own custom heads which in it of itself is a justifiable purchase. The game offers a great singleplayer which is made even more fun in co-op. Multiplayer features a host of modes, so if one doesn't please you, you have plenty to choose from. Custom level building is easy and streamelined through the steam workshop. And If you want to get 100% if you'll be playing for a while.  So grab a friend, 2 pairs of pants, and a boatload of toilet paper and cocoa, and prepare yourself for Battle Block Theater!  14/10 would kidnap a buddy and force him to play alongside me.",

Out of the box its a fun simple quirky platformer. The first levels are simple, but they do good to explain the simple mechanics of the game. The single player is quite long and gets pretty hard. I recommend playing this with a friend. friends will also enjoy the insane multiplayer arena. The arena features a wide variety of amazing minigames. You can play with a few friends or random people online or if you have no friends there are bots. There is also a level editor that works with steam workshop. I have not used that in the full release but is looks quite fun. I was interestd in this game when it was just for Xbox, and quickly signed up for the PC beta when it was announced.

So, now it's been released on Steam a year later, and I completely believe that it was worth the wait. I appreciate the amount of love and effort was put into this game, and making it unlike any other game I've played (yes, it's a platformer, but it's more than that). The only thing I can criticize is the amount of players on the 'Online' mode. This might just be because people are in Private Lobbies, but I'm not sure. Even if that's not the case, it has nothing to do with the quality of the game.    The storyline is fantastic (in my opinion) and it shows character (just like Castle Crasher's did, but with actual narration. Probably more so.). I enjoyed the narrator (StampyTV) throughout the entire game, and laughed a bit each time he had something to say. The multiplayer is great. Unlike their previous title (Castle Crashers), Battleblock Theater has many more gamemodes (both Co-op and competitive). All of them are fairly entertaining. I highly encourage any fans of Castle Crashers or platformers to take a look at this game, and perhaps buy it if they haven't already!",

But in all seriousness, this game is really rather addicting due to its unique personality. Being a platformer, the basic gameplay style is the same: jump platform to platform and avoid death. There is combat if you so wish to kill the cat guards that try to end your fabulous jumping spree, or very little if you choose not to (though you'll miss some gems, used to unlock prisoners (new faces), for that perfect score!). There is a decent variety of melee moves and a good armory of weapons, each with different effects both harmful and helpful. For example, the acid bubble: as the name implies, it's acidic, and you or any enemy who gets caught in it or going through it is killed; however you can jump on top of it and bounce off to reach new heights for some more gems or maybe the ever-so-precious yarn, used to unlock weapons. The silly storyline (it involves a boat of friends appropriately called the S.S. Friendship) and annoying-but-not-in-a-bad-way narrator are enough to motivate you through the solo campaign, though the option of the co-op campaign (same storyline, new levels) is really rather tempting, and is rewarding. Both players earn all gems and yarn earned in every level, except for the mysterious, shiny, golden hat, which keeps a slightly competetive feel to it, even though you're best friends now! There are separate achievements for beating the game on normal difficulty, co-op normal, insane, and co-op insane, so there are reasons to replay it, besides being outstandlingly fun that is. And once you tire of the storyline (or at the very least want a break, because who can ditch Hatty? Nobody, that's who.) there are several different 'arena' modes and the exclusive features to play through. Arena games (including King of the Hill and a silly form of Basketball) offer a competetive PvP side while the Furbottom Features offer more co-op rewards and player integration through the Steam Workshop. There is a level editor of course, meaning that you can endlessly spawn new challenges for you and your friends or to listen to the tears of the other players who don't realize you put some invisible block somewhere (I don't think that's possible, and if it is...don't be heartless, we're all friends here). If you're not big into silly, happy, carefree, happy-go-lucky-e-t-c. games, well, deal with it, because this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. It's a good platformer with incentives to replay and to do more than just the campaign, and I suppose you could mute it, if you're masochisitic. Another valuable point I think is worth mentioning is that this is a semi-popular game, and it's on Steam with an interactive community and game developers (Chicken Toucher achievement anybody?) so this game has really good potential of being updated frequently. With a base game already worth the full price and more, additional content really pushes it over the edge. Hope to see you on!",

The second you think this game is too easy is the second it throws you a hard level where ONE wrong move means you have to try again. Luckily-- unlike LittleBigPlanet you have infinite lives; meaning you can try again and again until your fingers fall off.  I found this game hard enough and I beat it on Solo and didn't get all the gems. I can only imagine how many hours a completetionist would take to get all gems, do all the optional encore levels, AND beat insane mode (one-hit-death-mode).   Once again-- About the closest thing to LittleBigPlanet you can find on the PC. It even has 2x2 games, which is something that LittleBigPlanet lacks. So-- even if you don't want to do the main campaign I'd recommend getting this just to mess around with your friends in an online battle.  ",

The level design is very well done and many levels will have you on your toes, as well as being satisfying to complete, especially in insane mode. (warning: insane mode could drive you, well, insane) The sheer amount of multiplayer content and simple customization provides an entertaining multiplayer experience, with either co-op or vs modes. It's also very simple to connect with both friends and/or strangers, just select multiplayer and host or join a server. The level design, again, is very well done in all game modes, with different stages for each mode that fit the game mode well.   The collectibles are very fun to collect as well. These include weapons and tools to use in levels as well as different prisoners which allow you to change which character you play as. This meshes very well with the provided trading system, allowing you to trade characters and weapons with others, and can be done with friends and strangers alike. With the large amount of characters you can unlock you're sure to find many you like playing as. The generous number of characters to unlock also ensures it'll take a long time to get them all, meaning there won't be extra gems in your wallet doing nothing for a whiiiiiile.  One more thing that's great about this game is the narration and quips. The writing is very clever and amusing to listen to; it has me looking forward to every cutscene. As for the quips (which are basically comments made by the narrator during gameplay), it's as if there's multiple ones for every situation, in every game mode, which make gameplay even more lively. And if they bother you or start sounding repetitive, then you can simply turn them off in the menu.  Basically, the game has great gameplay, multiple game modes to keep you playing, many fun collectibles, easy and amusing multiplayer, engaging writing, oh i forgot to mention the LEVEL CREATOR. well, there's one of those too  Also, the secrets are fun to find, especially the secret levels (because of the secret music, mostly).",

It has a humorous theme to it, making the game great for people who want to sit down, play a game, and have some good laughs. I've never been a fan of 2-D platformers, but this game has led me on and on, having me sit down for hours on end. It is by far the best game I've played by Behemoth games besides Castle Crashers (I haven't played Alien Hominid HD, I'm hoping for it to be published on Steam!). I think that anyone who has interest in this game should buy it no matter if it's on sale or not. This game is worth every penny, and I'm still looking forward to spending many more hours playing. Sadly, there are some cons though, but every game has some negatives. I'll be straight forward with my review.  Pros: Very funny and humorous, good replay value, fun co-op, fun multiplayer, and hilarious narration. Cons: The story can be repetitive over time, and at times it's difficult to find a multiplayer game to join.  There are plenty of other pros as well as cons that I could add, but I'm finishing up my review here. This game is amazing, and I think that plenty of people would enjoy this game if they bought it. I'm hoping to see more games made by Behemoth in the future.  9/10 ",

The graphics are really fantastic and i could see that just from the main menu and also the gameplay i knew they would be fantastic as they were in Castle Crashers(added bonus hatty is now in Castle Crashers if you got at least 1 achievement in that game! :D). The gameplay of the game is very addictive and its hard to not play this game as its a platformer thats full of action and its really fun in single player and co-op as in co-op you can throw your buddys to higher places to get to a switch but you could also throw them into goo or water etc. by accident so that can be funny :),speaking of funny the commentator adds a lot of comedy to the game also as his phrases just fit into the game and i think he is really great at his job as he says things like 'of all places you die there' he is reallly brilliant and does an really awesome job :). Theres also other modes like arena where you can play a variety of modes with buddies or other onliners 2 of my favriotes are time trials and ball game and you can be on same team as your buddy or compete but either way you still collect a lot of gems which is awesome and a good excuse to revisit arena mode to collect more gems :) i also find it really fun to collect the gems and the yarn and discover secrets/shortcuts in all levels they are so collectible :) this game is a top seller and to be honest i can really see why and expected it to be a top seller Castle Crashers snd Alien Hominid were probably top sellers as they do a really awsome job on there games and i wasn,t in the beta but the beta was sucessful i believe :) they gave steam beta testers the game for free but gave people who weren't in the beta(like me) got 30% launch week and 35% loyalty discount if you have Castle Crashers so i got 35% off thanks to that which i think is genorous + kind of them to do as the game at full price is £11.99 but getting it for £7 was great i,d get at full price but still :D if you can you should defo get this game you won,t regret its a game where you,ll say just 1 more level but you end up doing more its well worth the money and im so glad they this and Castle Crashers were added to steam due to all the features,content,graphics etc. well worth the money (ps over 400 levels and also over 300 prisoners to free and of course weapons and the ability to switch between the 2 and tons of community levels this game is endless with that added) :D",

Most of the time. When they weren't being stupid. If you're a fan of platformers and raging over friends being stupid, definitely buy this game.",

There's cats, and gems, and yarn, and more cats, and some weird Tanuki badger things (minus the weaponized testicles). There's molten lava trampolines and rockets. ROCKETS!!!

            "review_text": "Truly one of the funniest gaming experiences I've had, from the gloriously absurd start to the somewhat harrowing finish. Seriously the opening intro is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a game, and indeed any media. It will depend on your style of humour, I suspect, but for me it was just hilarious.   The gameplay itself is non too shabby either, starting with the basics to settle you in but quickly providing a challenge that just about manages to fall on the right side of frustration and rage, though at times it will certainly threaten your ability to keep your composure. Later levels could be described as fiendish but you always seem to finish each level on that one last go, where being forced to do it one more time would doubtlessly end in a panicked scramble to find another working controller or mouse.  I'd also argue that the game ends at about the right time as well. It never feels too repetitive as each chapter is different in its dangers and enemies, and just about manages not to outstay its welcome, though if the game were any longer it might start to drag.  It is a game I would say is best played for no more than an hour at a time; any more tends to get a bit too much. That isn't a bad thing as such, some games are just like that and this is certainly one that is best enjoyed in short bursts.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys silly humour in games to buy this. For the type of game it is I would say to pay £5 at most, but I've always been frugal and personally I picked it up in a previous sale for less than £3, IIRC, and it is worth every penny.  I have only played the main solo storyline, I will add. I did have 15 minutes playing some online 2vs2 arenas or free-for-alls but I've never really been in to online gaming that much. I suspect for those of you who do enjoy that side of things, that another sackful of hours can easily be spent either mercilessly killing strangers or working together with them.   All in all, it's a thoroughly enjoyable game, it's humour is fantastic and raised a smile on more than just a few occasions, the gameplay is just about the right level of difficulty and it has cats. Evil cats. And hats.",

The only con i can think of is that there may be bugs aka glitches but they dont make the game impossible to play or hinder you at any circumstances.

The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!    Oh, this is so hard!    Heating, cooling",

            "review_text": "I can't really think of what to say about this game. I spent so many hours screaming at my computer, but the payoff in the end felt like it was worth it. ;_;  Essentially, Battleblock Theater is a cute platforming action game with a simple premise--Hatty Hattington is your friend and while on a ship with his friends, it crashes into an island with a run-down prison on it. Hatty is kidnapped and forced to wear a cursed top hat. The rest of the game consists of a bunch of soul crushing levels you go through until you can try and rescue Hatty. The end.  BBT features a few game modes: Arena, Campaign and F-something Something, which is a bunch of typical game modes like Death Match and Capture the Flag (8 modes in total). The campaign can be played single player or multiplayer, which changes how levels are laid out and encourages team-work. Of course, it's up to your friends how helpful they'll be... While I haven't played Arena or FF, I enjoyed the campaign a lot. I beat the game in single player mode and played to the final area with different friends. A criticism of the game is that it gets very challenging after the fourth level. Incredibly challenging. It's not even a gentle slope.   The game has a few modes even within its campaign. You have the general levels and then the stage is finished with a time trial. You can come back later for Encores, which are timed levels that are unlocked after doing the final level in each stage. Each level has rewards of gems and yarn balls which can be used to buy more character heads and new weapons. The game encourages trading to get more heads and weapons, but there are enough yarn balls to get each weapon already. The challenge is in getting more heads. The wide range of appearances for characters gives each player the chance to have a pretty unique character, and each head has a little blurb in your inventory.  The game recommends the use of a controller, but the keys on the keyboard are mapped simply as well and are easy to use and understand. Levels offer variety and may require some thought as to how to approach them. In the later levels, it becomes more timing-based. The final levels are infinitely easier in single-player mode. Enemies in the game aren't too varied, but it's attributed to the story and doesn't make a difference in the end.   The levels are also sort of presented as if you are performing in front of an audience, so there are reactions when you fail which is a nice touch. The narrator also comments every time you die and succeed. The game's music fades into the background on most levels, but it generally seems to fit the pace of the game. The final level in particular had some good music.   Anyway, not much of a review, hopefully it convinces you to get the game.",

Altho if you dont have a controller for the pc version (like me) you will kinda struggle and wont have it as easy as someone who owns a controller.   The multiplayer part is a bit weird , takes along time to find a game and if you dont have any friends to play with this is a obvious decision to play with other players, however because this takes so long time it really destroys alittle bit of the exp of the multiplayer of bbt. I do still recommend this game it's fun and takes some time to finnish everything so it is a great game to play when you are bored.",

BattleBlock Theater is a very fun game, with challenging platforming that I, a pretty damn good platformer, had trouble with. It's more dangerous than telling a girl she's chubby (voice from afar says, 'OH MY GOD').   It's a great game that features a variety of looks you can choose from, plus custom looks you can make (though requiring you to make make them yourself, but I am not really bothered by it).   Not only that, but the announcer/ storyteller is the very definition of ridiculous. He's silly, fun, and at times acting stupid for the fun of it. That, combined with the hilarious ways you can die/ succeed makes play this, as difficult as it gets, absolutely, gut-wrenchingly funny.  So if you like being silly, stupid, and being challenged, BattleBlock Theater is your cup of tea.",

It also really helps that the narrative, with Stamper lending his excellent and hilarious voice, is used as a great reward for clearing out some tough levels.

The best part of the game is the narrator, just watch the trailer it is extremely representative of the brilliance of the cut scenes. The game itself is also great, stylish silly, with a nice range of obstacles that are introduced steadily to create a good difficulty curve. There is no penalty for dying so you can play through the levels throwing yourself repeatedly to your death until you flounder your way to the exit. This process is even more hilarious in co-op as you repeatedly inadvertently thwart your partners efforts. There are loads of weapons and characters to unlock as you play. The frustrating parts are the finales which are like the other levels but with a time limit. It is quite telling that 98% of the reviews for this are positive but only about 4% of people have completed the story, just keep playing the fun levels and don't worry too much about finishing the story.",

The story is very engaging and made me want to play it all in one go (althogh you can't really do that), and the narrator throughout is very funny, if it does not get a little repetative after playing it for a long time. Besides the story, the gameplay is very smooth, and it feels very natural to be playing. The levels start out easy and get to be very hard. The game also has very good replayability because you can always try to get a higher rating on all the levels.  Overall this is a very good game that works very well, and will make you want to play it all the time. The one recommendation I have is that if you do not already, go get a controller. This game was ported over from the xbox (and a very good port too), and is thus designed for use with a controller. Along with my belief that all platformers should be used with a controller, this game pretty much requires one (although you technically can use the keyboard). I would give this game a 9/10 on my very strict grading scale and would recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Go get it  NOW .",

The story mode, placing you as a hapless prisoner in the titular Theater attempting to rescue your friends, has a perfectly placed difficulty curve and introduces you to all the mechanics of the game. In addition to this, it also has some great versus and co-op multiplayer options and an expansive level editor to ensure that there will always be new content for you to enjoy! BattleBlock Theater is full of collectibles, replay value and belly laughs - I highly recommend it! Unless you dislike fun. And why are you reading this if you dislike fun?

The writing was good and made me keep playing to see how the story unfolds.  The music fits the game very well, that in conjunction with the narrator's voice will compel you and make you laugh instead of getting mad whenever you die (well, sometimes you'll get mad anyway but it's a part of the game!).  I haven't played too much of the multiplayer content but from what I've seen it looks like there's quite a bunch of stuff to do. Really, next time you have friends in your house, grab two controllers. buckle your pants and let the fun begin (there's a co-op mode for 2 players AND a competitive co-op mode, which means 2 vs 2 players) !   TL;DR: It's not an expensive game and there's plenty of content. If you like platform games and/or wants something to play with friends, this is a good game to get.",

            "review_text": "Battleblock Theater’s premise is simple enough. One day, a boat filled with hundreds of friends is hit by a massive storm. They become shipwrecked on an island with anthropomorphic cats running a prison-like theater. Hatty Hattington, who is the friendliest friend of all of the friends on the friend-ship, is cursed and turned into the bizarre ring-leader of this island. He then forces the friends to travel through several lethal levels for the entertainment of the cat people.   The game itself plays out as a series of puzzle-platformer levels, requiring you to collect at least three gems scattered throughout the level before the exit opens. As you travel through the game, you will eventually be required to perform precision platforming, while being attacked on all sides. The single-player can get incredibly difficult, but thankfully all of the levels allow for unlimited retries, placing you at pre-determined checkpoints throughout the level when you die.   As mentioned, every level will require you to collect three gems placed throughout the level but you will want to collect as many as you can find. This is because when you finish a level, you can spend these gems on buying new prisoners to play as. What prisoner you get, however, is totally random so you may spend a huge number of gems before you find one you like.  Additionally, each level has a single ball of yarn which can be used to buy new weapons. These weapons become crucial in the end game as many can help you to more easily traverse a level. One weapon fires out nerf-like darts which stick to the wall and can be climbed to reach areas more easily. Another fires a ball of acid, which can give you a boost if you jump on it.   The game features a co-op campaign, as well. However, you should avoid this mode completely if you play online without a mic. You can indulge in the mode offline as well, but if you don’t communicate with your partner, levels will be almost impossible to finish. Often times, playing online without a microphone causes a ton of frustration, especially when one player simply has no idea what to do in a level. The game doesn’t give you any good tools to communicate non-verbally, which is a shame because playing it with a partner who you can communicate with is a joy.   While the co-op and single-player campaigns can be a lot of fun, it’s clear that The Behemoth put a ton of effort into building a really unique competitive multiplayer mode. While there’s the typical death match style game, other match types offer a lot of variety to players. In Soul Snatcher when your enemies die their souls float out of their body and you must capture and hold onto them for as long as possible without being killed. Color The World places two competing teams into an arena where they must touch as many blocks as possible to color them for their team. Grab the Gold features a floating whale, traveling through a level, periodically dropping gold. Players must collect the gold and deposit it into a floating safe. There are a few other modes as well, each with their own unique brand of insanity.   However, the fact that many of the arenas are too small is one big problem. Often times, in a group of three other players, opponents simply beat each other up because you are always right next to each other, even when this isn’t the objective. It often leads to stalemates where neither team is actually doing anything to win until the last few seconds of the game. This is especially true in a mode like Grab the Gold, where having a lot of room to move is almost a necessity in order to score any points.  The game does, however, feature an incredible level creator. There are already a good number of user created levels. Additionally, there are a number of levels being created by The Behemoth in a special featured level section. Assuming this support keeps up, the game could have a very healthy lifespan.  Battleblock Theater is pure fun, whether you’re playing it multiplayer or single-player. The campaign is ludicrous and challenging, though the co-op should be played with people you know. The multiplayer is fairly unique and amazing as well. This game is a fitting follow-up to one of the best downloadable games of this generation and hopefully The Behemoth will continue to support this game.  -Hatty Hattington   ",

            "review_text": "BlattleBlock Theater is a really fun game that succeeds in the crowded indie side-scrolling platformer genre by modernizing a style of platformer that you don't see very often. Most games take the Mario Bros. or Metroid route where you're either going from point A to point B or exploring an open world. BattleBlock Theater takes the Lode Runner path less travelled and drops you into a seires of rooms where you need to collect enough items to unlock the exit.  Where Lode Runner-style games were mostly about enemy avoidance BattleBlock Theater hits a really good mix where each level offers bite-sized adventures that require platforming, exploring, and light puzzle solving to progress. The difficulty curve is good and it mostly hits that tough-but-not-too-tough feeling.  Dan Paladin's distinctive art style that's become synonymous with Behemoth games is on full display here as usual but it's the ridiculous cut-scenes voiced by Chris Stamper that will probably be what most people remember from the game. They're silly and nonsensical, but hit a charmingly juvenile range and sound like a fairytale as told by an insane person. Stamper also manages to be one of the most listenable announcers in a videogame that I can recall offering color commentary as you navigate the game's stages. Yeah, you'll shut him up eventually once his one-liners are played out and repeat for the umpteenth time, but the charm lasts far longer than any other game.",

I was hooked the minute I watched the first trailer here on Steam, the narrator made me laugh til tears streamed down my face. And the best part is that he's in the game, and he's your guide to having the time of your life.  With probably over 5000 possible combonations of head/face, weapon/tool, and team color you'll never get tired with your character. I've switched character after each set of puzzles and that's probably only 50 of those choices.  Playing the game with the narrator on chatterbox mode makes the game what it really is: hilariously great. There are villianous cats, black markets, plus pigs you can ride on.

But it's the dialogue, the cutscenes and the announcer that really make this game what it is. When played co-operatively you will kill your friends.... often. Sometimes on purpose with weapons ranging from paper airplanes to bombfrogs. But sometimes by throwing them into spikes or water, or bombs, or something else. Your friends will probably hate you for this, but chances are you will be laughing to much to care.

The story's narrative is incredibly well done, (Stamper gets me everytime and is perfect for this game). While its great to enjoy a ridiculous/funny narrative solo, its even better with a friend in this case, especially when you can do horrible things to each other.   The game-play is like most 2D platformer games — there is a lot of jumping, avoiding bad things, finding shinies, and more. This is really fun (or painful) to do when you have to rely 100% on your partner to get through these things. We enjoyed tossing our way through obstacles and learning the penalties for failure (e.g. jumping and throwing ourselves into spinning saw blades, laser beams, and other nastiness). That moment when your about to make the jump but your partner jumps on your head as leverage and you end up drowning... yeah...  Overall, this is an excellent (if frustrating at times) game which is great for 2 players. Feel free to ignore any mention of 4-player co-op from other sites — this caps out at 2 players cooperatively. They do offer 4-player, but it's really just 2v2 'Time Battles' against each other.",

It has the tendancy to really test out your friendship with anybody in co-op because you have the option to kill each other and fight over a certain golden hat that gives you 10 gems to the person who captures it, and ONLY to that person. It can ruin friendships, strengthen friendships, and it fits with the story reather well. If you like platformers that are co-op based or just platformers in general, then you'd love this game. But it's not serious at all. It has a comedic narrator that provides hours of one-sided conversation whilest making fun out of your failiures.",

Singleplayer is just the main campaign that can easily kill your patience and peace very easily. Multiplayer can be played with 2 or 4 players, 2 player is for the campaign 4 player is for minigames.  Since I haven't managed to play the minigames yet I can't really review 'em.  User created levels can be easy or even harder than the campaign levels, they can also be played in singleplayer or multiplayer.  Now let's cover the other parts of the game.  Secrets: Usually very fun to do, but sometimes very hard to get to due to the annoyance of getting the way to get there wrong, unless you're using a walkthrough, you sick person.  Heads: Collectible heads that you can get from logging in at a certain date or buying heads for gems which can easily be bought, until the price starts going up. There are 5 types of heads, Square, Triangle, Circle, Cylinder, and special heads. Special heads are unlocked by launching the game on a certain date or by an achievment.  Weapons: You'll unlock these easily while you're playing through the game, you'll most likely have all of 'em before the game ends.  That pretty much covers all of it, except for minigames.

I thought this would just be a puzzle game, but no, I found a game with great artwork, a compelling story line, and an all around great game. I haven't played through the entire game (you could say i've hardly made a dent progress wise) but from what i've seen so far, 10/10 would recommend. Lastly, the game has some great multiplayer games and an even more challenging mode (insane mode) for those who like some extra work needed to complete the scenes.

With the whimsical gadgets and weaponry you can secretly buy, you become one with customizing BattleBlock Theater. If you think the game is crap, don't be a bad man and keep it all in. Use the level creator, editor, and publisher to show the world who you really are. If you are still evil, release it all in Arena Mode. Battle opponents, friend or stranger, in many different ways. If you are bored, when the game launches, don't play. If you stop, you will see people going at it. It is pretty fun. I recommend this game.

Some of the challenges in chapters 5-7 felt as though they should've been at the end, and some of the end challenges should've been earlier on. But even then, there was still a clear sense of progression, as new concepts were introduced, and increased number of challenges between check points.  Although I say the narrator is funny, the type of humor may not be for everyone. But if you enjoy a good puzzle platformer, this is definitly in the top 10 of all time.

Art style   Battleblock Theater is also one of those games that can make you nostalgic as its art style reminds me of a another platformer called drawn to life anyone remember that game on the DS? Honestly this game is better playing with a controller (which it has full support for of course).   Difficulty/ Modes  The game has two difficulty settings normal mode and insane mode, along with three different modes: story (pre-made designs by the dev),arena, level editior, and the final mode that allows you to play levels from the workshop (kinda like super mario maker before it existed)   Conclusion  On to the question do I recommend it? Yes, haven't try co-op but let's just say its twice as trolly, twice as rage inducing, and twice as fun.",

On one hand it means high replayability, you can't master every level by simply memorizing everything. On the other hand, it makes Encore levels frustratingly hard.  For those who are not challenged yet there is a 'hardcore' mode, where you cannot die during level, or will have to restart. Ultimate challenge.  There's also a level editor and easy way to play user-made levels.  There's also some sort of multiplayer mode which I never tried, so I can't comment on that.

This is a true platformer with some personal twists. There are many story levels as well as challenges to traverse with unique obstacles to face. Going it alone is great fun in its own right, but the enjoyment and replayability of the game sky rockets when you play with friends.   Buy this game if you...     enjoy the humor presented in the trailers.    have fun finding little gems in odd places.    don't have a problem beating large hostile human-sized cats.    want to spend time with friends playing a platformer while occassionally hitting them off ledges.   This is an extremely well built little game with a good story and great humor.",

The coop is extremly fun, hugly chaotic (which is good) and a fitting diffitulty level. Not to hard, not to easy. There could be more riddles and lesser jump and chaos and run, but still fine. The only negative aspect is the checkpoint system. From time to time you will respawn at the beginning of a level scene where he died, even so you actually solved the scene already and touched the checkpoint. Your friend will then respawn at the checkpoint and you where he died, if he know dies before you finished the scene a second time it is possible that both of you respawn before the scene....thats ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, especially in time challenges.  Edit  After some additional time in the game I have to change my review: In the first 6 chapters the respawn bug is annoying, but in chapter 7 and 8 the respawn bug made be deinstall the game. The time trials the respawn system is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. You often spawn inside a dangerous area, meaning you will die the moment you spawn , meaning you need to restart the mission. I realy would like to like this game because it starts so awesome, and the final chapters are hard even without a time limit, but with time limit they are just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. If you need to finish some scenes within one level 4 to 6 times because you respawn their even so you are already several scenes ahead...that just robs every fun.",

BattleBlock Theater is random is a more basic sense. Everything is genuinely unconnected, and seemingly unplanned. There are four different framing devices for the 'plot', such as it is, and none of them have anything to do with each other, or the gameplay.   The game is very clearly built inside its own level editor, all the maps are inside awkward squares and are made entirely of mostly-generic squares.  What the game really needs, (ironically, for a game designed with a player-usable level editor) is an editor.The jokes sometimes work, and sometimes don't. The levels rarely have a particular idea or theme behind them. A typical level doesn't require any particular dexterity or puzzle solving skills, just persistence. About one in five levels have some good concepts, but they don't make up for the time spent on the others.  The jumping mechanic isn't great.  Overall, there are some fun parts in this game, but they're mostly drowned out by the filler.",

The gameplay is far too simple and repetitive that it gets boring really fast and everything in the game is already found elsewhere. Sure, the humor and the narrative is there but strip the game of everything and you will find a very weak concept at its core.   At the beginning, I am only interested in this game due to the rapport of the company. I have a level of expectation for this game as it come from the makers of Castle Crashers. One could argue that Castle Crashers is nothing new as many side scrolling games to the likes of it has been there for the longest of time. However, at least the combat was polished and the adventure was engaging to warrant the players to keep playing, both important aspects that are crucially missing from BattleBlock Theater, be it single player or cooperative mode.",

Now, the ending. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that you will be utterly and amazingly confused. They even make fun of themselves by pointing out how confusing it is.

            "review_text": "It is a good game, fun to play alone. it is also a bad game, terrible to play with friends. If you play alone, you may find the occassional bug or get annoyed at timers that are insanely short, or perhaps you will notice that dissapearing blocks stay solid after they show their dissapearing animation. but when you get onto the multiplayer, you will find terrible, fun destroying problems that will make you dislike the game. frogs climb on top of each other infinitly, puzzles that are possible for one person, but for the others, they will constantly do the puzzles wrong and end up dying without doing anything different from the person who did it successfuly, and one problem that made me way more annoyed than it should: standing on your friends head. Im playing in the arena, trying to play basketball with my friend, when they stand on my head, making me unable to move, and becasue I cannot attack when I have the ball, I can do nothing but get angry and try to tell them to get off of me. Another problem I have with the basketball game is that if they get infront of you, you are going to get scored on, there is nothing you can do about that. One more problem I have is with another multiplayer game, horse, in horse you go to try to steal your opponents 'horse' and get that back to your base. The horses are overpowered, and if somebody gets in front of you with the horse, you loose, nothing you can do, the horse is just as fast as you making you unable to get your 'horse' back. The game is also quite generic and brings nothing new to the platforming genre. It has okay comedy if you want to entertain a kid with a lot of poop jokes and almost swears. Overall, I would not recommend this game due to the hit or miss comedy, the bland single player, and the broken and agrovating multiplayer. My friend and I also were forced to quit a level after it set both of our spawnpoints into an inescapable wall.",
