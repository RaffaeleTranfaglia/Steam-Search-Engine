The game is very  well polished  with  great graphics  and can prove to be one of STEAM's best Free To Play games.   As a new player diving in the game, I was instantly consumed by the fun mechanics and playstyle of it. If I had to compare  Block N Load  to another game, it would be kind of a mix between DOTA/LEAGUE with Team Fortress 2 characters, and the freedom of Minecraft all mixed into one.   The battle maps in this game are very diverse; there are multiple playstyles you have to incorperate into playing each map. By allowing contant map rotations, it is a very refreshing game that has lots of replay value.  The characters in this game are simply amazing. Each character has their own unique set of tools for the job. Each one is valued in its own way. I've found that playing with a team with everyone having completely different characters, are the games that win the most.    CONS:",

As far as I know, little is being done to ban players from matches, and there is currently no system in place to prevent chat-spamming, afk-ing, or team-killing. Until more moderation is placed in this game, I DO NOT recommend you purchase this game.  Edit: Due to concerns from commenters, I would like to make it known that this game is fun, it is entertaining, it's full of fun, quirky, and interesting mechanics. Want a fun 'TF2'-esque shooter with a bit of a sandbox feel? This game is for you. HOWEVER, and this is my own personal opinion, until better community moderation is in place, I, as a random steam user, do not recommend it.",

The game is still in BETA, and it is amazing.  Block N Load currently offers 5 maps and more coming soon:  – Cube Cove – Teeny Tiny – Wilson Bay - Mountain Express - Heroes Playground  Each map offers a whole new experience, and requires diferent strategy.  There also is 6 Classes currently avaliable: -O.P Juan Shinobi - Starring as Ninja ( Not based off of Obi wan kenobi ) -Doc Eliza Doolally - Starring as Chemist -Cogwheel - Starring as Cogwheel -Nigel Purdey-Longshott - Starring as Sniper -Tony Turretto - Starring as Engineer -Sarge Stone - Starring as tank  Each class offers a whole new play style Each class can only rank up to level 10. You unlock a special skin when that character reaches level 10.   Block N Load features addicting and fun game mechanics, but is easily exposed to trolls.  Trolls can: - Team Kill - Spam - Destroy what you build - Destroy traps you place  Although its simple to troll, I have encountered 0 trolls in my 13 hours of play time. Most players are kind, willing to help and are just pure awesome.   So what are you waiting for? You should of had this game long before I made this review!!!!!!! Now go get blocking Pvt  ",

It's basically a crossed between TF2 (class-based team shooter) and Minecraft (block digging and building).   On the smaller maps the matches are 10-15 mins, bigger maps with multiple objectives can be 30 mins. While its straightforward to understand, you need to be able to think and adapt each match, because every time is totally different because of how you can dig and build anywhere, and have lots of different types of blocks to choose from when you setup your character.  This is a shooter where you need to think and improvise!",

Every other attempt to play this game has led to a huge amount of bitter disappointment, as I never found another game. Until the game incorporates some sort of AI vs mode, there'd be no way for players to find a game when they feel like playing it. My '2 hours played' comes from waiting in queues for ten minutes at random intervals, until giving up on the idea and closing the game. I've applied for a Steam refund, but since i've left it a little too long, I don't like my chances...  I do not recommend buying this unless you have a large group of friends to queue with.

Each class has its own perks, and each one of them brings their own weapons and special blocks to help their team. All roles can be fulfilled by anyone, but some are better than others at certain tasks. All classes are balanced and competitive. Heck, you can duel as any class with an opponent and you'll always have a hope to win! There are no instakills in this game, if you want to bring down your opponent you gotta earn it like a pro.

I find it to be generously priced for it's content and quality. I think of particular note is the free demo; it acts akin to the full version of the game minus ranked mode and with only one hero of each archetype available which lets you get a good feel for the game before putting down money.",

            "review_text": "This game isn't bad, it just could be much better.  There's too much going on at once, that it can often feel hard just to focus on the player three bricks ahead of you. You HAVE to have a decent class line-up otherwise it's almost impossible to play.  I'll come back in a year or two and edit my review then, but as for now I'd advise players to wait a little while on this one.  It's a great idea, being able to have total control in a team based shooter, it just needs time to refine it.   This game is filled with ideas that look great on paper, but when you put in motion it all falls apart.  Tony (This game's version of the engineer) is painfully weak. He has a rivet gun (Shot-gun) but the damn thing is extremely inaccurate and when you do hit, everyone completely out damages you almost instantly. He can place seven sentries, but none of them are any good. They all have a painfully small health pool and do almost nothing for damage against everyone other than another tony.   Defending is much harder for the simple fact that they always tunnel in on the cube (What you must protect) completely bypassing the tony's sad excuse for a defense. what you end up with because of this is a messy cesspool riddled with holes of variours depths and tunnels going 9,0000 different ways, which makes defense all but impossible because without spending a good portion of the round smoothing the area around the cube out, there's no point behind placing sentries or traps or anything else for that matter. If they were to removed the digging aspect when near cubes, that would be fine.  (I like the buliding aspect, not a huge fan of the digging. it's annoying to deal with.)   This game's version of the spy, while very strong (He's an infiltrator with a small health pool, if he's not dealing hefty damage, there's no point behind having him) at times feels too strong. that's manily because he 'teleport' anywhere on the map with ease and the moment he takes too much damage he can just 'Teleport' out of harms way.  Nigel, this games version of the sniper, is... okay? he can head-shot (For a lot of damage, but I don't think it flat-out kills someone) is odd in the sense that he has no-scope, making longer range marksmenship nearly pointless (A sniper that can't snipe all that well, Sounds really stupid but hey.) which leads to him being played more as a CQC class, which because his rifle has no scope, he does quite well with.   In TF2 you can phase into and out of players on your own team, in this game it's the reverse. You can't phase out of your own team( Is a utter nightmare when a newer player follows you down a hole and you want to go out the way you came in.) but you can phase into and past the enemy team, which makes CQC at times literally spray and pray. (Most likely why Tony's Shot-gun is utterly worthless, which it is. It's something even the 'Vets' mostly agree on. it's too weak and too inaccurate to be his sole means of self defense.)   Tony can buff his sentries (At a cost of chewing through his ammo) to deal arguably greater damage, which is fantasic on paper because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his sentries are on their own. However, you have no idea when your sentries firing on someone or being fired on when you have seven of them scattered across the map. you can repair them also while someones firing on them, but the range of his repair tool is sad. you tend to take spash damage when a cog or sarge is spamming at it, but most of the time it's pointless to even bother fighting off cogs/sarges due to their higher health and greater damage out-put. even if you can catch one low on health, you'll most likely still lose due to how lack-luster the rivet gun is.   Tony can not place respawn pads, which is odd because that would give him a greater offense role. (Setting up forward bases would be much easier.)  The respawn rate is... Bad would be a compliment. (34 seconds... Just let that sink in for a moment. Thought 20 seconds was bad, I feel sorry for you.)   Map sizes are quite nice though, would prefer if each side got seven players, but five is alright.  Sarge (This games version of the soldier) is pretty worthless all and all. Because a tony can place health and ammo packs, Sarge can't. If you haven't unlocked Cog yet he's okay in a very loose way. But the moment you get a cog, do not bother with Sarge. Everything Sarge does, cog literally does 10X better.  All of this aside, the game can be something that can go toe-toe with TF2, just not right now. A few years time, this game might be something truly good.",

Perks are also buyable, but only with the free currency. -A ton of maps Of course, some are better than others. -Each game is different You build and fortify your base, so each game will be different. -Not region locked If your friend is from EU and you're from NA you guys can still queue together, unlike a fair amount of games.   Cons -High queue times During weekends and afternoon weekdays the queue times are short. But other than that they can be a bit long, and you will run into the same people a lot. They are also a lot longer for players just starting out so you don't run into people who stomp you. -Unbalanced The game is a bit unbalanced for sure. -Ranks Your rank can only go up, not down. This removes the stress from the game, but rank is less skill and more grind. They are fixing this soon (maybe) with a new ranked mode.  Overall, I for sure recommend this game. It is a ton of fun",

So basicly the game is a bit too fast when you want to sneak and too slow when you just run and gun since it can take a long time to finish a round.  The graphics aren't top notch but look alright. Controls feel a bit clunky at times specially when moving faster with the ninja. Animations could be done a lot better imo.  i'd recommend this game for the time being but i don't think it'll last very long.  Other than that, it's xp waste while you play runescape &gt;.&gt;",

It feels like Jagex realy took down the game's quality in an attempt to make this game more widely available. I mean, we used to have all heros and the only problem I can think of is a semi-long que time, not to mention the fact that most people had to pay $30 for this, and are only compensated with a $10 premium package. But with the addition of having to buy heros, perks, and other things, it seems that this once great game is going to freemium purgitory. However, the game is very innovative and fun, especialy if you're a fan of minecraft or TF2. overall, I would give this game a 7.8/10 for the new updates. Please Jagex, if your reading this, make some sort of change for everyone who is very dissapointed, who bought the game and are now disgraced by the fact that they have to share a que with unskilled free-to-play players who only make the game that much more frustrating. I would recomend something like a server for premium members, or even better, a remake of the origional.",

Also, some voice lines are really funny. Sure, some characters take time to learn, but the game is always about team effort and composition.  The stages are enjoyable, comprising of small ones with 1 cube to big ones with 3. A lot of them also have good spots for hiding e.g. respawn pads in enemy territory  When it comes to matches, they always differ from one another; for example, I could end up with a bad team in one match, losing really badly, and suddenly have a skillful one in another, winning with a big margin.  I'd say, this is one of the most unique FPS games I've seen. And since it also became free-to-play, there really is no restriction on playerbase.

I have high hopes for this game as it's not a pay to win and i hope it never will be.  The gameplay is superb, but each character has multiple playstyles and this takes getting used.

            "review_text": "This is a very interesting game. It takes MOBA style objectives in order to win, FPS style shooting, Minecraft style building all bundled together into one game. When first entering a game you have 5 mins to build with blocks. The goal of the game is to Protect your 'cores' while attacking the enemy's. Within these 5 minutes you have to build fortifactions, and maybe a setup to build into No man's land. When this time is up the barrier that blocks you disappears and you attack. Every character is uniquely designed weapons wise. The medic has a gun that arcs balls, a robot with a chaingun, a soldier with a m60, a hunter with a sniper (scopeless), a ninja with shurikans, and an engineer with a shotgun. While these characters are interesting I do have to admit certain guns are directly more powerful than others. The sniper rifle can be used in CQB and is generally better than the Medic's 'bubble gun'. In certain times it can even trump the shotgun that can only be used in close quarters. While the chaingun does do fast damage. With that said maybe these classes aren't right for me since I use cogwheel the robot tank mostly. With all that said, this game plays well and is a lot of fun. However I came along with some issues.  Number 1: The game can be VERY slow. As in the two teams just defend and no one tries to make a move. I've been in many hour + games.  While this is mostly the player's fault, it can be resolved with a timer ticking down or some sort of penalty.  Number 2: If you get stuck with a new player, you lost.   The game has a video explaining what to do, and it doesn't explain well. A hands on tutorial would be best to fix this  Number 3: If one person leaves, you are at a serious disadvantage and have a way greater chance at losing the game.   Like issue number 1, this is more player's error, but can be fixed with a severe penalty. Leaving a game because you died once is no reason to make your team lose.  Numbner 3.5: There are as many AFKers as people that leave too.   Once again, have a penalty for AFKing, or make it easy to report these players  Number 4: This game is no way worth the price it's being asked. It's a fun game, but not a $30 fun game.   Making this free to play with skin sales or making it atleast $15 cheaper would make it worth it. At least what I'm shown isn't worth $30  Currently playing the beta, I'm going to recommend this game as it is tons of fun as a free game and I completely respect that it's a game in beta. However if these issues aren't addressed, I can't recommend it. With all that said the biggest issue is the pricing point + the ingame marketplace where you must pay for skins. With that said, this game can be very interesting with time to come.",

Heroes had to be either bought up with xp (for real money) or trained up all over again. Fighting one vs one with a unleveled character vs a fully leveled character = loss. Did also not help that you still appear in the top league because of your experience in the game and facing the hardcore players with your now low level heroes.   I did not like the new direction and how they treated their loyal players who actually bought the game. At a minimum we should have recived at least one or two of the new characters for free.

            "review_text": "From my experience in playing this game, it may have been just 1 hour, but it was the worst hour of my life.   Let's start this off with the servers. The servers are horrid. I had a 23 ping on the server (on average[US server]) and everyone else was lagging around like their getting their internet off of a dead raccoon.  The Balance: There basically is none. Leveling up grants you more power basically. So a new player will have no chance of beating a higher level player. As you level up, you gain access to more abilities such as lower active cooldowns, more uses on your active ability, and so on. And not to mention that you have to be level 6 to get access to change what blocks you can use. That might not sound bad, but here's the thing, those blocks have more heal, plus there's an actual bomb that you can use to destroy blocks. You'd figure that everyone would have acccess to it, right? Nope, you have to be level 6 to get it.    But wait, there's more. One would think that if you're new, you'd go against other new players, right? Wrong, you get thrown in with higher levels, so have fun trying to play a game where everyone who's played longer has abilities to destroy you instantly.  The 'heroes': They're okay at best, but the only way you can do anything to kill enemy heroes is pay to get better ones.  On the topic of paying: The game has a P2W (Pay to win) system. You can pay for new, powerful heroes that will just destroy everyone else and there's nothing you can do about it. The IGC (In Game Currency) you get is literally nothing after any match making it so you have to literally grind the hell out of the game to even afford someone new to play. Yes there is a free rotation, but you still have to buy someone to play as no matter what (unless you wanna live off the rotation for the rest of your life).   Last words: The game it's self is an 'ok' game, it's just that all the bull ♥♥♥♥ that they just packed in makes it literally unenjoyable to play. The leveling system breaks it, the pay-for-perks system breaks it more, and the heroes that just destroy everyone else just puts the final nail in the coffin.   A game may only be as good as the player, but when the game has too many broken aspects, the game is the bad one, not the player.",

Some heroes are easier than others to play and harder to counter if you are really new to the game and it might get a bit frustrating so be carefull, they aren't actually op as you may think.

Right then I knew it would be a fun and casual game and not something that requires too much time.  The concept is brilliant and the amount of teamwork needed makes it a great game to play with friends. Alternatively, this also leaves you prone to being teamed up with people who could care less and just do their own thing. Luckily, I haven't experienced the latter and have actually seen a good amount of willingness to teach and help players that are newer to the beta.  The only concern I have is that Jagex is going to be charging a price for this game according to the description. If this is the case, this game will fail, just as the several games that Jagex has tried to make before it. There is no way I would pay more than $5 to play this game the way it is. It's too simple and too casual to invest more than that. If you want to gain $$$ then add skins (like you are doing) and possible even characters but try to stay away from pay-to-win mechanics (which unfortunately you are also known for in RuneScape, your most successful game).   tl;dr Not worth paying more than $5 for, a fun and casual game, has potential, hopefully Jagex gets it right this time.",

It plays like normal fps except you can dig under them, jump over them and set all sorts of traps for enemy team. Gameplay for the most part is good but there are some bugbears for me.   Matches can drag on and being on a losing team for 45 minutes because people refuse to surrender can become a massive chore if you're only one on your team who is not turtling. So your enjoyment of the game is reliant on the team you play with. Playing with random teammates at worst can be a massive chore, since it's really hard to get anything done by yourself especially considering you need to be point blank range to actually do proper damage to the core, and good luck with that if all your team does is turtle.  On the technical standpoint I didn't see any massively glaring problems and fps stayed good at all times, Characters speaking same one liners all the time does get annoying and frequency should be cut to half.  I feel another thing that might put off people from the game is the pricepoint, I myself got it with 33% discount but I'm not sure I would have paid the full price at 27 euros.

All of my teams have been fairly helpful. So far I have not been put into a completely one-sided-beat-down match (after 13.2 hours of playing), and it can actually be pretty difficult to break through a tough defense or stand against a coordinated offense.  That said, teams must cooperate and build on each others' characters' strengths to pick and fill roles such as support, defense, tank, assassin, etc to complete the objectives as efficiently as possible. The game doesn't lag much at all for me (I believe they only have one American server atm, so that might be why people are complaining about lag). Some of the character models do look a little bit awkward but I think that it's excusable since they're trying for a zany/cartoony feel. From my experience thus far, the game is very balanced as well. There is no OP character/structure block. The only change that I feel needed is better mini-map readability/zoom.  I think that this game, as is, (as a game and not a piece of software or anything else, so this rating doesn't account for lag, dense individuals in the community, bugs, etc) well deserves a healthy 9.2/10  (P.S. idk what some of the other comments are saying when they mention P2Win, since only skins are available for purchase outside the base game. Also, the 'original' price tag is $33 because it comes with Ace of Spades ($15), early access, and a skin pack (other skins can be EARNED in-game). This makes the game + skin DLC $18, which is less than a League of Legends RP card. The game is actually somewhat hard to review due to the mishmash of things that go in together (but they go together pretty well in my opinion), so I recommend watching gameplay or finding a friend who's played it before making a verdict to purchase this product.)",

Cogwheel:You cant really face this thing 1v1 there is almost no way you can win,His damage output is massive not even sarge can compare and not even the rocket launcher can kill him fast enough,Apart from all that he gets mortar which is counterable but also gets Radar,and spawn as if his presence is not pain in the ♥♥♥ enough.  Plus except from his massive power he doesnt reload,and he also has a lot of bullets AND bombs.   Scientist:Well i cant really recall his name but this guy is a pain in the ♥♥♥ but at least he is predicatble altho his poison is very lethal and it kills you beyond fast,I think in order to balance it it shouldd do like 20% maybe less damage since atm he is capable of droping ur hp at 50% with just a single bomb,does that look ok to you?   The sience ♥♥♥♥♥ i just hate this one but not because i think she is unbalanced,the only thing that needds to be balancedd about her are the orbital strikes Not the damage but the duration it needds in order to fire up (3 seconds) are too few this would needd like 8.  I tried once to break it just as she put it down with my engie and i could not make it in time its rediculous 3 seconds are not enough to break down the orbital....    In overal this game is nice but it needs balance to a lot of stuff,and i recomend it because either way i had my fun and still do and i like it and i am just gonna try as many characters as i can",

            "review_text": "A Awesome Team based game where I get to kill the following: -Mexican Ninja, His ninja-ness AH! -J-pop Singer, She has a thing for cats and Uzis. -A Genie, She likes to call the player 'master'. -Italian Construction worker, Watch out he'll call his third cousin Luigi. -A Texan Talking Hamster, A Rolling ball of Death. -Creepy Killer clown, Don't worry he'll give you his best punchline literally.  -German Steam punk Boxer, You'll love the science, it's pretty sweet. (pun! get it because his name is 'sweet science' Funny right? :D) ETC Pros: Game is based on teams building, traps, vision, bunkers and defenses. Different characters, with their own unique weapons and abilities each in one of following three roles: Brawn, Skill and Brains.  Brawn Classes: Have radars and re spawn pads that help their team with showing where the enemy is and spawning their team mates closer to the enemy's base. Always in the Front of battle.  Skill Classes: that require a bit more technique due to how they fight. but have more traps blocks, such as fake blocks (breaks when a enemy steps on making great for hiding traps), Bear traps, and caltrops. Can be in the middle of battle but also can sneakily take out enemies and trigger traps from a safe distance ( All class can too but skill classes have better weapons for triggering.)  Brains Classes: are more of a support unit, they can fight but are more in to defending ally bases and supporting, using their Health and ammo crates to hide them all over the map can really change the battle, Also having Force which let allies in but blocks all bullets and enemies. They are mostly in the back defending off invaders but can sometimes push forward.  -Good videos are how to play each character. (except Kreepy the clown because he's newest one.) -Steam workshop maps for custom matches.   Cons: You have grind a bit to get some characters but missions come daily which give you a good amount of in-game money every day as matches don't give a lot. -Sometimes Players are new to game or just plain don't listen, and makes people get mad as they don't do their roles. -Players who block the cube in, A term which means a team will build a shell your cube (base), sounds like a good plan but allows enemies to have more cover and are able to hide in the shell. Characters have levels that the more you play them they level up and their abilities become stronger, I don't see this as a problem but some people might. Queue time is a slightly a bit long due to a bit of a low player count. Overall I give this game a 8/10, While this is fun its not all perfect, Make sure your PC can run it and please be a good sport to make the community slightly bigger :3  Also WHAT THE BLOCK YOUR WAITING FOR?! GET IN HERE AND BLOCK IN!!! p.s Sorry about my grammar.",

There is also a pretty unfair advantage when enemy players build mobile respawns, turrets, and shields right next to your cubes and base. If there was more focus on working together and not just rushing the enemy cube at all times it would most likely be worth a buy. But as good as the game is in concept, it just doesn't feel like it's ready to be a fully released game. I hope this game gets better in the future and that it continues to grow, but for now I just can't see a point in buying it.",

There is no hand-holding at all, no intuitive user experience to help you out in your first matches, nothing to help you learn what the hell is going on besides some introduction video.  The community is extremely toxic. In one match I played, I entered in the middle of some drawn-out dramatic conversation between a few players on the previous match, and when we got to the voting stage for the next map there was a lot of arguing about why one map was better than the other. This arguing continued into the match itself. I didn't even bother to take part in it.  When the actual match started, I wasn't instructed to do anything - it was free play for the building stage. So of course, I had no idea how one block I was carrying was better than the other, nor did I know where to place anything, nor did I know what the radar thing or the dynamite thing did (besides blow up for the latter, obviously). By the time I was starting to figure anything out, build stage was over and I was killed in five seconds by a player on the other team who was waiting by the barrier for it to drop.  Immediately after this, I exited the match. Not out of rage, but out of respect for my team; me dying constantly and placing random blocks everywhere was not going to help them win that match. Even this was a chore, however. Instead of exiting the match, I had actually found the surrender button (naturally none of my teammates agreed to the surrender, but that's neither here nor there). I had to ALT+TAB and attempt to close the game that way, and  then  the game allowed me to leave.  I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I was hoping for some better introduction to the mechanics of this game than some promotion video. Very disappointed. I've unsubscribed from the emails and I won't be pre-ordering or following this game whatsoever.  It's still free to try the beta by signing up on their website, so you do have that option instead of actually pre-ordering the game.  I'm aware that many players are very against Jagex as a developer, so bear in mind that they are developing this game. Also bear in mind that your progress in the beta will not transfer over to the full game. When I asked about achievements, the developers ignored me, so be aware that even if you get achievements or any kind of progress it's likely to be erased.",

Since everyone moves so slow, everyone is easy to hit which makes the gun fights very underwhelming.  The objective of the game is to defend your base while also trying to destroy the other team's base. It seems like the defending has some strategy, but most of the time covering the attack point with sturdy cubes and destroying all access leaving a floating metal island is the only strategy that doesn't fall apart immediately. Most defenses are rendered completely worthless because it takes about 1 minute to tunnel into the attack point from any direction, and you can also hide spawn point and radars anywhere. Most of the time when you find where there team is attacking from, they spawn in, kill you, and create another base in another subterranean position. Rinse and repeat.  ",

They changed the art style of the game to basically ripoff Team Fortress 2, at least Ace of Spades had a somewhat unique art style.  And that's not the only thing they ripped off TF2. Pretty much all of the classes are a copy of its Team Fortress 2 counterparts, hell that Rambo-looking guy is a 'Heavy Weapons Specialist'. In Team Fortress 2, one of the characters that he's based on who wields a Minigun is called the 'Heavy Weapons Guy'. The similarity there is totally coincedencial right? The other class he's based on is the Soldier, who wields a Rocket Launcher and a Shovel. The Rambo-looking guy wields those weapons, and a machinegun (which works almost the same as the Minigun in TF2, without the spin-up).  And they didn't even copy most of the good parts of Team Fortress 2. You can't even rocket jump with the Rocket Launcher, as supposedly it's not a combat weapon and it's more for 'destruction'. Even in Ace of Spades one of the Rocket Launchers allowed you to rocket jump.  And what is with the atrocious matchmaking system? You don't even get a server browser, you have to wait about a minute or two to join a random match.  Notice how the logo of this game has the same fonts, and colors as the Ace of Spades logo. They didn't even try.  Jagex are really brave for trying to charge £12 for a game that is practically an inferior rip-off to a game that costs nothing (TF2).  TL;DR: Just play Team Fortress 2 instead and save yourself £12.",

They shut the entire thing down and made a worse paid version, which died rather quickly. Now we come to this game, it's Ace of Spades again but with a different name and a few new features, even the font is the same! Everyone who bought AoS has been abandoned and now they're cashing in with an entirely new product that could have just been an update to the original.  As soon as the player numbers for this game dwindle they'll end all support and probably work on something else they get make money off of. If this game was free, I would be alright with it. But abandoning a game and a paid update is not something we should be supporting. If you want to play a game like this, play the original at  buildandshoot.com  This is not worth your money.",

What I found as a good soloution is lowering the graphics to lowest but keep the blocks flying setting on low, I never saw a difference in the amount that flew.

The graphics for a cube style game are very polished, colorful and clean too look at. The movement is fast and satisfying and the guns Ive used so far are really fun. There are many strategies that you can use to protect your base and get kills, and cool gadgets to play with for both defense and offense. It has that fun factor and uniqueness that makes it well worth the asking price. I would recommend watching the tutorial videos on the characters before you jump into a match though to gain an understanding of what you can do and the roles for each character.

As a veteran, I often queue up with veteran friends and I also join the solo queue from time to time. This isn't the kind of game that you will enjoy if you are playing solo. You will lose. A lot.  I'd say only about 5 percent of the active playerbase actually knows what they are doing. It has always been this way. There are so many horrible players in this game and there is no separation between the good and the bad. The Matchmaking system, even after being updated, grows longer and less effective as you rank up. If you only want to play solo, then don't even get the game. If you have friends or if you make friends in the game, then it's enjoyable.  The game itself is fantastic, but it's consistently unbalanced in some way or fashion and it's missing the neccessary components to hold a decent retention rate.",

            "review_text": "While my general outlook on FPS games is typically very cynnical, I think by now my problem is less with the genre and more with the ever more dry and overrated Call of Duty series.  That being said, this game is a very creative one indeed. It feels like on odd mixture of Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft, two games that should NOT ever be blended by any other means. However, that idea is used very well here.  The premise of Block N Load is to build up a fortress to protect your team's 'cube' in the given time. Once the clock hits zero, both teams will duke it out in an attempt to destroy the other team's cube. You can either stay back and defend your own base, or hit the offensive front and attack the enemy.  There are multiple different characters that play differently, reflecting TF2's class system. However, I feel like some of them are a little unbalanced. My personal gripe goes to the 'Sniper', my usual go-to in a shooter, as his range is not what the title entails. Also, unlike TF2, the characters in Block N Load have a very malnourished personality to go with them, which is a bit disappointing, but not a gamebreaker.  The building aspect is very interesting. Your team can build up your fort to defend your cube by using blocks and special buildings like Turrets, Glue, Caltrops and Tiki Heads, which all serve a purpose of defense. This means that you can strategize with your fellow team members to create a nest egg that will surely keep your base safe while they're on the offensive.   Overall, while my previously mentioned distaste to most FPS titles, recent installments such as this one have steered away from the overly cliche, boring and unchanging Call of Duty and Battlefield series.  If this game were to improve, I'd ask that more options for weaponry be added to the game. Each character can only use a pair of weapons. This is ok, but the problem arises when the weapons cause players to single out classes for being terrible, because their weapons are no good. More weapon options on each character (similar to TF2) would allow more customization and a bit more balancing to this game. It needs some improvement, but it has so far met my criteria for an interesting game.  Final Mark: 3/5",

            "review_text": "Are you a fan of a creative shooter that is fun to play? Do you like the team-based, class-based combat that exists in TF2? Do you like building PVP bases in Minecraft?  If anyone of those questions are answered with a 'Hell to the Yes!', Block N Load might be for you.  BNL is an interesting mix of class-based combat that is featured within TF2 and the building and destroying aspects of Minecraft. You start out with 3 heroes, each with nice beginner rolls, but cover nice areas of combat. You can purchase additional ones with in-game collected gold or with Steam Credit bought Platinum. This is the only bad thing about this game so far. If you just want to try out a class but don't want to waste your hard-earned gold, you can't. Thankfully, that is the only thing this game is bad at.  The goal of the game is simple. Within the battlefield, there are 2 cubes; one belongs to you, and the other one to the other team. Your goal is to destroy their cube. Simple enough. Each team is given 5 minutes in the start of the match to fortify their base with traps and other objects. Once the 5 minutes are up, the forcefield splitting the 2 teams dissapears, allowing each team to come togeather. There are 5 players per team, so that means 10 player games.  If the other team was stupid enough to not make any defenses and focused on complete offense, their Cube would get trashed, making them lose the game. Nicely enough, if the opposing team has a good enough defense, it can keep you busy. You must focus on complete offensive pushes while still keeping a solid defense, and this is where the game turns from good to great. Your team must know when it's time to hunker down and defend for a bit, or go on a complete Cube destroying run.  Because theoretically every block can be destroyed, this allows for pretty flexible games. You can either fly over the map using Speed Pads and Bounce Pads, or you can tunnel under the ground. You contain 1 primary weapon, 1 secondary weapon, 1 melee weapon to contrust and deconstruct blocks, 6 block choices, and a usable ability. Ablities change between players. For example, Tony's ability allows for faster construction of blocks. Classes also have passive abilities that don't need to be activated to be used. Using Tony as an example again, whenever Tony builds, he takes less damage. Blocks are interesting as well. Each class has a class-specific block, several role-specific blocks, and a couple of general blocks that can be used by anyone.  This could be described as a bad thing, but it doesn't really bother me. Once you get within a game, it will take a while to finish the game, depending on several variables. Some games are 10 minutes long while others can be a half-hour long if there is a lot of struggle. If you leave during the game, you will be penalized, sort of how in CS:GO you don't earn the XP for that round if you leave early.  All in all, BNL is a great game that everyone should play. Ever since this game turned Free 2 Play, there is no reason to not play this. Download it right now and play!  9/10 Amazing blend of TF2 and Minecraft.",
