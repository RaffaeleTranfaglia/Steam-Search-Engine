I would recommend this game for anyone that appreciates musical composition and eloquent ear training puzzles.  Edit: The Circuits Composer mode was a free update and essentially an entirely different branch of this game. For those that like the music from Circuits, now they can take sound bytes (either from the game or just similar sounds from the game's composer) and piece them together with a simple yet limited GUI. This is probalby the equivilance of what Windows Movie Maker is in the video editing world. Although limited, it's pretty easy to create some simple electronic ambient background music.  If musical puzzles or simple electronic music creation is what you want, I'd recommend Circuits a go.",

So, I checked my library and found some games I never played before (those are gifts, actually). And then, I downloaded one of those. The name is Circuits. The size is quite small so it didn't need much download time to complete it. I played this game and... hell, this game is awesome. The game itself is about music puzzle divided to levels. So, the gameplay is simple. First, you listen to the sample music. Then, you'll be served some puzzle with some notes missing. You have to fill the missing note with the tone available. Rearrange it well, and you'll pass! The graphic is quietly simple, but it bring the game so relaxing to play and give you more concentration at the music. The gameplay seems too simple, but trust me, this game is not getting you bored. Beware that you have to use earphone and have good sense of listening. I have played it for a while and I get stuck on level 4! (well, that was my level when this review is written, maybe now I am going at igher level) I really recommend this game for you. If you are looking for game that is relaxing and challenging at the same time, good art, and much of music on it, then this game is for you!  PS. Sorry for some grammar errors. English is not my primary language.ï»¿",

            "review_text": "Circuits is less of a puzzle game and more of an audio based game of memory. You must compare audio clips to a final version of a song, and sometimes the clips are a 8 seconds long, and the difference between clips doesn't make itself apparent until after halfway into the clip. What should be a fun little puzzle experience becomes time consuming by the nature of audio and having to sit and listen and compare. It is less about challenge and more about patience and investment, and it feels far from rewarding.  It has a nice visual presentation, but it does little to change the slow, monotonous nature of the puzzles. It would be like having a visual puzzle piece fading in or drawing pixel by pixel then disappearing when you were no longer looking at it, requiring you to simply remember what it looked like. Perhaps there isn't a better way to do it with an audio based puzzle game, but hopefully that shares a bit of info for people looking for information on the game.",

However, it is not like that; the gameplay is quite simple, you just place different samples in the already constructed circuit. The game consists of 25 levels with increasing difficulty. In each level, you will be played a song which you have to construct by placing samples/beats in its proper spot. Unless you have very precise hearing, you will end up rewinding song multiple times and trying different combinations. It is not so much of a puzzler, because you do not have to think but hear.   Even though, the gamplay is not that diverse, I did enjoy the tracks and playing around with the differnt combinations. Anyone who likes music games might just enjoy this game, but do not expect anything special. Anyone with not so good sense of hearing will find this game frustrating. Hopefully, in future they add the ability for you to construct the whole  circuit  and make your own songs (maybe even a workshop where you can share your songs for others to solve).    Bottom Line  Anyone who doesn't enjoy  point and click  games, should not buy it as you will get bored very soon. If you do not expect more than few hours of gameplay or replayability, and are interested in music games and by the concept; then you should get it.",

I tried it out myself and I am sorry, but the game is boring and tedious. It probably does not help that I am tone deaf. I think there are good production values to this game, but I just can't get into it.  I feel like the name of the game is misleading since it makes you think electronics or something, but really it's a musical puzzle game where you have to put snippets of sound in the correct order to make the song play correctly.

I enjoy the idea of arranging pieces to form a musical piece i can listen to but i feel like a number of the tones are a bit too harsh on the ears (especially when you consider the game is supposed to be played with headphones). Also, at the beginning, it seemed like you were intending to color code the different pieces of the music, with red as lead and piano, yellow as techno or background and purple as the percussion and rythym. However, this concept isnt held through. The transition between levels is excrutiatingly painful on the eyes, going from a bright white/gray immediately to black, lasting just long enough for your eyes to adjust and then back to bright murdered my eyeholes. If you listen, you can hear breaths being taken at the beginning or end of some non lyrical tracks, which is a little unsettling. Other than that i enjoy the music (just soft enough that the harshness of some tones doesnt scar my hearing) and the puzzles. 6/10",

The user is presented with a circuit diagram and a number of different audio samples which must be placed in the correct spots along with the use of a few different mechanics (repeat, loops, switches) in order to reproduce a 15 to 30 second song. There are 25 levels in total which I was able to finish in about 4 hours.  The aesthetic of the user interface is spartan which I personally liked. I had mixed feelings about the music. I liked certain parts of each song, but I can only say that I actually liked about 5 out of the 25 songs in their entirety. A lot of the songs make liberal use of the vocoder, which is something that I absolutely detest in any music. Having to listen to those particular samples multiple times in order to place them correctly was unpleasant for me.

            "review_text": "For the price of upto $3, I think the game is overall worth it. It's a nice experience, although short and not too challenging gameplay wise, it's a relaxed casual music game with great music that's enjoyable to listen to.  Sadly, it gets boring to listen to the same song over and over while trying to find out what node you were wrong with, and when you finally get it right, you'll just skip the song because you've heard it so many time until that moment of actual victory. I think it would've been better if the song were to remain 'bland' (only the nodes you put in, no extra music), and when you actually try to play it (to check if you were correct) it adds all the other layers, to feel some measure of success and progression.  Apart from that, having actual parts of music development that don't occur from the nodes you've placed is rather confusing at points and there should at least be a way to disable that while testing out your song (apart from switching between layers). At times it was hard to figure out which node was playing what type of music, and some nodes were mostly too quiet to hear and comprehend which required me to guess and check with the hint tool if I was correct or not.  The game doesn't really have any replayability, because once you've finished all 25 levels (I think I finished them in about an hour or two), you've heard all the songs and you wouldn't really go back to play those songs again. There should be some sort of difficulty level per song (maybe something like 'easy' 'medium' 'hard') which include more/less nodes according to the difficulty, and more song complexity accordingly. Some sort of rating (according to time or some other measurement of performance) may improve replayability.  Lastly, a 'free-creation' mode would've been great, using all the nodes in the game to create your own levels or songs to share, or just to enjoy on your own. That would've changed the game immensly, making it a whole new experience.  Overall, it's a pretty nice game, lacks in a lot of respects, but for $3 it's pretty worth it just to give it a try, and hope the developers will make a 2nd version with some gameplay improvements :P",

In most songs you're allowed to switch 'layers' so you're only hearing for example the melodies or the bass, so you can limit what you're hearing and make it easier to replicate. But the last two songs are the most complex pieces of music in the game, and don't allow you to limit the layers like you've been taught the rest of the game. There are parts in both of the last two levels that are so complex with so many instruments at varying loudness that it is impossible to make out the instruments you're actually trying to replicate.

The music is rather nice, and the tasks set for you are more relaxing and nifty than super puzzling. I wish there were about twice as many levels, on continually increasing difficulty levels.

While most music games are based primarily around rhythmic timing, Circuits is more based on pitch and tone recognition. This makes for a pretty unique experience. Given that it's a music-based game, having a solid soundtrack is important - thankfully, Circuits delivers on that front with a well-made relaxing atmospheric soundtrack. My biggest critique is the relatively short length.  If you consider yourself completely tone-deaf, I'd have a hard time recommending this. But if you're looking for a relaxing, musical way to pass by a couple hours, then it's hard to come up with a better recommendation than Circuits.",

Though at the moment you have only about 2.5-3 Hours of Playtime ( 25 Levels ) you actually spend all of the time playing it.  It is a short game but i do recomend buying it since its only 3â¬ (i got it on a steam sale for 1.04â¬) Also there is a composer planed and will shortly be released wich will hopefully lead us to buttloads of Community Content on the Workshop. ( I for one will definetly create some )  The soundquality is great and i can recommend it to any Audiophiles (as myself) and i encourage you to Play them on high Quality Headphones to get the full experience out of it.",

So without no further excuses, let's go.!  GAME: In circuits you have to rebuilt a song, the way to do that, is to listen very carefully to the song a couple of times and then listen the parts, that process may be a little hard at the middle to the end of the game cause, you keep receiving more variants of the song, not just more parts to deal with but a hole new noise and stuff you need to re-construct the song. tip. don't go trying every piece in every space, you are not going to go anywhere like that, because it gets tough, real challenging, thought out the hole gameand you know experience the game, fell the song, and mostly don't give up.

The creator went above and beyond my expectations, and the full game is one of my favorites in my lirbrary so far! The music in the game is amazing, the controls are easy to use and enjoyable, the graphics are simple, but they are also beautiful at the same time!  Circuits is played by first listening a song or part of a song, then filling in parts with the short clips that are provided to you. You will fill in parts for beats, bass, piano, synths, and even some vocals parts. If you get stuck on a certain part, you can listen to individual layers (such as one layer for bass, one for synths, and one for vocals) so that you can hear each part in more detail. If you're still stuck, you can also use the hints to show what is wrong, or place one sphere in the correct spot. Once all parts are placed, you can play the song to listen to how your work has turned out!  I would suggest buying this for anyone who is interested in listening to, teaching, or creating music. I enjoy learning and teaching vocal music, and have developed a good ear for hearing and learning parts from it. When I saw this game, I though that this game was perfect for me, because I already could pick out parts easily without switching layers, and continue to play to train my ear even just a bit more! I would highly recommend this game!  EDIT: After 10.4 Hours total, multiple playthroughs, and some achievement getting, I have finally completed this game 100%, and enjoyed it very much! Please support these developers, so they can create more great things like this!",

I thought that since I had real studio monitors, that I could get by without putting on my cans, but it really helps having everything else shut out.  A warning. Levels 24 and 25 are seriously difficult, as you have no option to separate layers, and some of the parts are basically inaudible, so you have to pay attention to the harmonics caused by those sounds, or use hints. I finally gave in on 25 and used a hint, and it revealed that I had a part basically backwards, lol.  This little gem is definitely worth the price of admission.
