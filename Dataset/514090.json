            "review_text": "If you like puzzles, you'll like it. Cons:  The music is repetitive. You can switch between 3 tracks in the options, but quickly just turn it off and turn on your own music. There's not enough space to lay out all the pieces to look at them all at once for the 300+ piece puzzles. This makes it more difficult &amp; time consuming. I still recommend it.",
