It looked good and interesting story to start but then that is where it just ended. Game enters automode when you start journey and your party auto walk from one battle to next. All you can do is pick their attack and then later buy new items for them but that is all. It is very repetive and dissapointing. Graphics are very nice but I have to give thumb down because there was no story at all.",
