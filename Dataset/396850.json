It looks pretty. That's it. The characters are lame, the story is meh and the ending is even worse. Combined with easy puzzles and a repetetive soundtrack (which doesn't even loop correctly), it's overall a boring game. (Also, I almost fell asleep while playing..)  Therefore, I'd rather recommend other hidden object games than this one.",

            "review_text": "Reading the reviews on this, I was hesistant to play it, but it was a good price so I went for it! I enjoyed the game, it actually makes you think. A lot of hidden object adventure games let you vaguely put an object near an area and your done. This one makes you actually work for it. The detail put into the game is impressive, but there are little things that could be better. Like in one of the hidden object scenes they call a peacock feather an ostrich feather. (Yes, I am that person :)) I am not sure why the title is Chronicle of Witches and Warlocks as there does not seem to be any witches or warlocks. That being said, it is just a title. I had fun playing it. It was not the best I have ever played, but I think the reviews are a bit harsh.",

The art is as expected, the hidden object scenes are quite easy, and the storyline is standard supernatural time travel stuff seen in a lot of these games.  The things that are most well hidden are the witches and warlocks. I didn't find any of them in this game.  Most negative reviews seem to be about technical problems. Luckily I didn't encounter any, but YMMV.  If you decide to buy this, get it on sale or in a bundle. It's also great for 100% achievement hunters.",
