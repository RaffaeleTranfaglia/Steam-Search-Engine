Don't have the time to make a fully detailed review so i'll just focus on what i would think are some key points to be adressed. I'll be adding to this review as i go.  - The loading times are ridiculously long, not a huge deal for me, i've got patience but you know. Something to look into. Starting a sorcerer and loading the actual game took around 10 minutes.  - If you're using Windows 10, be ready to deal with quite a ton of technical bugs. Compatability issues, when minimized you can not summon the game from the shortcut, you have to relaunch.  - Constant crashes, i can't get farther then thirty steps without my game crashing.   - I love the style, oh it gives me a little bit of nostalgia that i can not toss aside, i still look forward to giving this a full play.   This is all the reviewing i can do until the game is more refined on Windows 10.",

Once they got what they wanted, they ignored us already.   It's like they're just focusing on their main game which is 'Blaze Khan' server.   They don't put too much effort on Khan Steam.",
