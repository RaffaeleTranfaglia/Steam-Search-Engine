            "review_text": "NOTE: As of May 31, 2014, all multiplayer capabilities have been removed from this game. This is the only reason I do not recommend this game. Otherwise, it is probably the best game I ever played in my life.  I absolutely LOVED this game when it was in its prime. I've spent most of my hours playing Chernarus Life when it was still a thing that existed, usually on the Excyted Gaming servers (even if the admins were absolutely rеtаrdеd sometimes - fυсk you Eric). Regardless, I've played through the campaign, spent hours and hours at a time working with other players to liberate towns, outposts and encampments in Hohei Evolution Blue and Evolution Red on the Anzu's War Games servers.   Eventually, after playing this game for a while, I purchased Operation: Arrowhead. The original ARMA 2 still had an enormous playerbase even though OA had been released for quite some time as well. I found myself enjoying ARMA 2 over OA any day. The fact that OA lacked Chernarus Life and replaced it with the less-good Takistan Life Revolution and Island Life was offputting for me, since those maps were less well suited for a civlian-vs-cops type scenario, whereas Chernarus was literally the perfect 'Life' map.  ARMA 2 was a bit clunky in the controls, but once you got them down (or simply adjusted the keybindings in the options menu) the game was such a blast to play. I probably spent about 50 hours in the mission editor alone, creating my own little missions and scenarios to play through with friends or on my own.   I won't get in to the specific features of the game itself, because now that the multiplayer is gone nobody will ever be able to experience the game in its full potential again. The game is entirely dead now due to the GameSpy shutdown, which hosted ARMA 2 servers, but you can still play multiplayer in Operation Arrowhead. That being said, this game was absolutely fantastic.   10/10 from me, even though it had some bugs and a few odd things here and there, that's what made it ARMA 2. ARMA 3 doesn't come close to this game. Not only does ARMA 2 have more guns and vehicles than ARMA 3, but the mission editor is much better as well. So, for my conclusion?  Don't buy this game. It would have made a great purchase any time before 2014, because the multiplayer still worked and there was a huge fanbase with a wide variety of servers and community-created addons that made the game so much better. ARMA 2 is now just a mediocre single-player campaign. For $12.99 USD (price as of August 12, 2016) this game is absolutely not worth it. I'd say it's worth about $5, but I really think that Bohemia Interactive should make it a free game since all it's used for nowadays is being able to play the DayZ mod.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: I have changed key portions of this review due to fanboys freaking out over a difference of opinion. Let me clarify something; If you honestly enjoy this game despite its flaws and quirks, that is COMPLETELY fine. I'm glad you enjoy it, and I wish I did, but I simply do not. That's all it is. You're not an idiot for liking it, and I'm not an idiot for disliking it. Please, read the review, and consider it as someone else's point of view. It should not change your point of view if you enjoy this game. Thank you, and enjoy my review of Arma 2 :)   I've have given this game many chances. I play it for a bit, than uninstall it, and then I reinstall it, thinking I may have missed something, seeing as a huge portion of people love this game.   However, the more I try to play this game, the more I am mindblown this game is so popular. Let me elaborate a little.  First off, I'm not knocking the games aesthetic appeal. It's a very good looking game for the most part. There are a few textures that look like they were made for a 90s PC mystery game, but overall, I am pretty impressed with the games looks, and how fast it runs.   That's not my complaint though. That little feature right there, is the ONLY thing this game has going for it. Once you get past the looks of the game, get ready for a mind bogglingly BAD control scheme, unusable menus, and possibly the worst voice acting and music you've ever heard in a game.   Let's start with the music and voice acting. Good lord are these bad. The score sounds like it's from an old 80's Segal movie. It's trying SO hard to be badass, and it falls so short. I'm not saying it's BAD music in itself, but with scenarios they play it in, like WALKING ACROSS A DECK, they've decided that blaring rock solos so loud, to the point where you can't even hear character dialogue, is appropriate. Really? Why is that an issue? The music should never drown out dialogue in a game, especially when it's ambient background music. This should only happen if the music is LITERALLY happening from something in the environment, like a concert or something. Now along with audio, lets look at voice acting. Now, not ALL of it is bad, but the majority is pretty much something out of vampire diaries. I know most marines and soldiers are normal guys who all want to have a good time as much as anyone else, and use phrases like 'bro' and 'dude' like anyone else, but when those phrases are used in this game... Oh my god. It legitimately sounds like that ONE kid from school that tried way too hard to fit in. They emphasize 'BRO' way too much. 'Tell me about that new sweet house of yours, BRO.' And if you read that with a 90's surfer accent, you'd be spot on.   Let's move onto menus. This SHOULD have been something simple. However, I made an online game over LAN (so no one would join) and was simply trying to get the hang of the controls. First off, just trying to make the game, was a task in itself. WHY IS THERE NO SIMPLE MODE SELECT?! Instead, we get this rediculous list of unspecified random words. 1. FIRST OF WAR. WHAT IS THAT??? Is that a mode? Is that the campaign? What is that? A little description would be nice, but no, there's nothing else. Just a huge list of things like that. So I selected a random one, and I get the campaign. That's fine in itself, but I'll get back to this later. Let's move on for now.  So let's talk about controls. I have never, in my life played a game, that has the most backwards, rediculous, most roundabout way ever, to make controls for a shooter. Now, I'm no huge CoD fan at all. I've played a few, but I've never lost my crap over them or anything. They're mainly just 'meh' games. But I'll tell you one thing; NEVER have I EVER complained about controls in a CoD game, or a BF game, or a Halo game, or just about ANY other shooter ever. Why change this scheme? I've looked at the controls, there's no reason to have them that way. Why can't MMB be the button for zooming with the scope? Guess what you use instead? THE '+' key! So NOW you're juggling between your mouse and your keys, and switching hands and WHY NOT JUST USE THE SAME CONTROLS THAT HAVE ALWAYS WORKED? So why not use the MMB to zoom the scope? Oh, I see why! Because it's being used to scroll the 'ACTION WHEEL' so I can open a ♥♥♥♥ING door. No, you can't just click to open a door. You scroll to select the action, and THEN click to open. Mind you, this is how ANY action in the game works. If there's multiple things going on, like say, you're near a door, and a gun, and a person to talk to, you have to scroll through all this ♥♥♥♥, and pick the one you want AMIDST all the action going on. So have fun juggling with your scroll wheel on your mouse, while trying not to get shot. Why isn't 'F' the action key you ask? Because THAT'S being used to switch weapons! WHY NOT THE NUMBER KEYS?? BECAUSE THOSE ARE BEING USED FOR RANDOM SQUAD DIALOGUE! ... 'C' is crouch, which is fine, but for SOME reason this isn't a toggled crouch. You have to hit 'X' to stand, and 'z' to prone. WHY? Why get rid of these instincts that have been ingrained in our brain since the first Halo game? Why change something that works perfectly well? Why not HOLD 'C' for a couple of seconds to prone, and just hit it again to stand?   So as the tutorial is teaching me this, and I think I'm getting the hang of it, and I continue to hear more robot people try to voice act, I finish the tutorial. Well you know how I'd selected the mission from the 'create a game' menu before? Well instead of acting like a normal ♥♥♥♥ing game, and continuing to the next mission, it just repeats. WHAT? Why would I want to do that? Why not go to the next one? That's literally the most irritating and pointless system possible. This isn't Gallaga. I don't want to try and replay to get a higher score. I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. So I try to quit the game, but hitting quit JUST RESTARTS THE ♥♥♥♥ING LEVEL. I had to ALT+TAB to minimize and then task manager that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I figured since I'm doing all this crap, might as well uninstall it!   I can't recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a game that plays well. If you can see past the broken controls, bad dialouge, a mediocre score, and unworkable menus, and truly enjoy what Arma is trying to be, then go right ahead, and game on. But for me, some one who is probably overly critical, I can't enjoy, or recommend this game.",

The game screams authenticity throughout its campaigns and expansions, and contains some of the nicest environments for its time. It's now a fairly dated action military sim. The campaign story felt real, but the plot itself was rather bland. Team fights were predictable, and needlessly complicated with the jarring communication system. Oh, and the dialogue was awful. Your team sounded like robots and shot like they had aim-bots (which wasn't necessarily a bad thing).   I will say that the tutorials were in-depth and entertaining. They break down a game that would scare any person if they looked at the key binding section first. I will also say that the multiplayer system is just as rewarding. I commend its development team for being so open with its community that has returned the favour with brilliant total conversion mods such as DayZ and numerous RP servers.   If you want a game with in-depth mechanics in a military setting, this is for you. Get the expansion too - another game in itself. Having developers that make expansions that thorough is now an unfortunate rarity. Support them with all of the monies.",

Otherwise it's just too control complex to be fun, especially (plane) flight. The beauty of a PC game vs a console game (among a long list of things) is that controls don't have to be limited to roughly 12 buttons. But seriously.... you dont need to use all 116 keys and every part of the mouse for EACH control scheme (infantry, land vehicle, helicopter, multiple types of aircraft etc.) It's near impossible to fly without a joystick. imagine, if you will, the following:   A + D = roll... Yep got it.  W + S = pitch ...so far so good =)... now add  Q + Z = trottle up and down... ok so it's hard to bank left and use throttle, I can handle that... but wait there's more!  X + C = Yaw.. so now that you're trying to make fine adjustments to properly lead and strafe you need to completely forget you're throttle because you're trying to maintain your bank to match your're adversary. but wait... turning too hard makes you loose velocity.... so stop tuning with yaw, correct speed. return to yaw. But wait there's more!   F = to select your weapons, which aren't quite clear what they even are at first, until you accidentally fire one of the 2 only missles, 2 bombs, or 300 bullets you have (which you can empty in 4-5 seconds.)   But wait! There's more! While you're trying to simply stay away from the ground and fumble in utter dumbfoundedness with you're weapons while trying to hit a peanut sized target with next to no ammo remaining, you moved you're mouse! Oops it controls pitch and roll too, at the same time as the keyboard! While trying to grasp all this at once you realise your landing gear is still down.... ok so now it's off the the scroll wheel menu (which is actually quite alien at first) to retract it. Now you're distracted for a few seconds from the incoming ground with your upside down aircraft seemingly resisting all your movements by about 25%. So on top of all this you now need to compensate for the resistance to your movement. Oh and remember to close/retract/lower your flaps. Whatever term the game uses is useless because you're scroll menu offers 'flaps up' or 'flaps down'. Am i lowering them from the top of the aircraft to close them? Or was it bring the flaps from the bottom up to retract them... Oh hey, there's a note on the top right of the screen, something about using TAB to acquire targets... Wait... there were instructions there.... that's ok I'll restart again.... *reading* Welcome to the tuto... *switch* times up! new message! In this excercise we will be going to *switch*. There is litterally a 5 line message that is on screen for less than a second.   Did I mention this is only the boot camp?   Now lets clear something up. I LOVE complex games. From ROTK to Total War to Crusader Kings II to Europa Univeralis. I enjoy a steep learning curve because the time invested usually nets a fantastic game that not every moron can just jump on to 'pWn HiS n0oBzoRs' or whatever it is they do. I have over 14 hours of play simply in the tutorials. I have nearly given up on the main game. But I'm a stubborn type that will keep doing it till it's done. But most people will have given up ages ago, which is a bit of a shame. The game has a fantastic engine overall and is almost unerringly realistic. If the tutorial gets a very extensive tune-up I could see many more positive reviews. But too many people are kicked flat in the teeth with this (fun but) incredibly newbie unfriendly game.   Ending on a positive note thought, glitches have been non-existant to me. So I don't know if I'm just missing them out of sheer dumb luck or they have been fixed by now.",

When you come under gunfire, you better get down, because there are no indicators of where the shots are coming from, and you die easily. Buy weapons to keep an edge over the enemy, if they're firing from an overwatch position, bring a sniper, or an ACOG scope, if it's CQC buy an automatic rifle.

To a certain extent, I can understand the appeal to hyper-realistic first person shooters, though, when you're required to hold your character's hand through the entire experience of firing his rifle, you might as well assist him in rubbing peanut butter on his testicles and beckoning his dog into the room with him. Then assisting him to pat the dog on it's head whilst you reassure him that his wife will never find out, and the dog won't remember.  If you love reading maps, playing typing games, or even cleaning your bathroom, GI Joe Simulator 2009 is the game for you.

They stretched the engine to the very limits, but it's just too old to do much with.  As for the gameplay, the engine is still holding the game back. Compared to modern gameplay (and even real military combat) it's really slowpaced and clunky to control. The shooting mechanics are pretty in-depth and fairly fun though, but you will often find yourself getting killed with little indication simply because of the failures of the engine. There is little feedback in this game; shooting someone causes no movement or any kind of indication of pain or disability, so it's incredibly hard to tell if you are hitting and doing any real damage some times until they fall down with the prone animation or the death animation. You almost immediately notice just how many work-arounds they had to implement to get the engine to do what they want, sort of like how Blizzard had to work around their old engine for WoW.  As for the simulation side of things: it's probably the best you'll ever get to a fun simulation of combat without playing those really cheesey and un-fun military simulators out there. The game can be as realistic as you want, since you have to set the rules for yourself. Want military-grade training and cooperation with a heavy dose of roleplay? You might be interested in ShackTac. Want to just mess around and have fun without much serious RP? There are tons of those, but I recommend getting friends to play with for this.  Over all, the game is really showing its age even though it isn't that old. The technology wasn't ready for a game of this scale when it was released, and it shows, not to mention the really bad engine. But despite these things, I think it's safe to say that this game is the most fun you can have in a cooperative video game. There is nothing like playing ACE with 3-7 friends on missions meant for 20-30 people. There is nothing like assaulting militia bases in Takistan with 3 of your best mates, going up against the odds well into the morning. There is no feeling similar to what you can get when you organize your close friends to all install ACE mod and playing it for the first time, helping eachother out of the ropes.  I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore, as ARMA III is now here and there is no reason to play this game anymore since the mods have all been updated for the new game. But rest assured: this game will always have a place deep in my heart.  I only have a few hours played here because there's no reason to launch ARMA II over Operation Arrowhead.",
