If that isn't enough to sell you on getting this game, it has the same type of real time animation graphics that the infamous Street Fighter 'The Movie, The Game' did.  But in all seriousness, the game play is a lot of fun, and the controls are tight. If you're into this type of genre of game, you should give it a try.  ",

            "review_text": "Pure, stupid fun. That's Streets of Fury EX in a nutshell. It reminds me of the sort of game a bunch of my buddies in high school and I might have made, had digital cameras and cheap chromakey software been widely available then. But underneath the somewhat amateurish look is a surprisingly deep and fun side-scrolling beat 'em up, with tight controls and a robust combo system. Stringing together multi-hit beatdowns is a snap, and each of the many unlockable characters has a full arsenal of combat moves, including chargable super attacks. Up to four players can join in local co-op, and survival and challenge modes are also available. Sadly, there's no online play, nor is there a training mode to practice your combos.   If the game seems familiar, that's because it originally made its debut in 2007 on the Xbox Indie Games service, and was a finalist in the the 2008 Dream Build Play competition. The 360 version was fun, but clearly constrained by limitations of the hardware and the platform. The smooth animation of the video-captured sprites meant that only a few actors were used, and their footage spread across multiple characters with extremely similar movesets. In a genre that's already heavy on repitition, that's not a good thing. But for the remaster, the developers added a slew of new, distinct brawlers, many of whom parody popular fighting game icons (check out the martial artist with his Ryu-style Shin Shoryuken, or the scarf-wearing send-up of Street Fighter 3's Q). Guard Crush Games even apparently got one of their dads to play the end boss! The fighting system has also been revised, with some control changes and a 'stamina' meter added, which can be used for powerful special moves or to block enemy attacks.   Overall, this is definitely worth a look even if you played the original eight years ago (yikes, has it really been that long?).",

Once the novelty of the graphics wears off, you're left with a pretty solid beat 'em up. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups don't get too much love nowadays, and this is definitely one of the best modern ones out there.",

You have to figure out how to approach some enemies, and they all have different abilities, so you can't just keep rushing in and trying to start your standard combo.  Combos are fun to pull off, and fairly satisfying.  The visual style is unique and ridiculous (as you can see from the screenshots and video, it's normal-looking people mo-capped), perfectly fitting for what it is. Because it's so blatantly ridiculous, I think it's funny.  The story is also ridiculous just like every other side-scrolling beat-em-up. Don't worry about it.  Music and sound, also great and perfectly fitting for the thing. I think the hit sounds having a bit more oomph would make combos feel a bit more satisfying, but it's alright as it is now.  I was hoping to see some bboys because the French are known for bboying, but I didn't see anything like that. Maybe in a future update or something lol.  All in all a great game. Worth the full price especially to support the devs because this is mad fun, and a must-have if you like clever beat-em-ups.",
