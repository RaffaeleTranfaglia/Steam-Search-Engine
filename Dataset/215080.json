            "review_text": "As a particular lover of turn based games and role playing games in general, I decided to give a try to this MMO. Once he landed on Steam, I got into the beta and started to enjoy the universe of the World of the Twelve. Despite having few hours compared to many other players, I can say this game is actually enjoyable and well made. However, there are some factors that could lead some people to avoid this title for various reasons. Let's analize every detail of the game. If you want to skip the wall of text, just go to the end, where there's a short version.   GRAPHICS   The graphic is 2,5D Cartoonish - Style, similar to animes. I like it, but somebody may not appreciate it. Colourful environments, characters and enemies (aka mobs). However, sometimes you'll encouter a bunch of graphical bugs like invisible enemies, sidekicks not appearing,   your avatar being nude (yes, you heard it right!)   or colors that make your eyes to cry blood (phosphorescent enemies). At last, talking about the active parts of the game, while the enemies are well made and be distinghuished between their gender, the characters (not including npcs) tend to be more feminine. If you give a try to the game, you'll notice that even the males look like females.   SOUND   There isn't so much to say about the sound. Each sector has its own, enjoyable track, including islands. The only bug you may encounter is an infinite loop after the dungeon of Zeppelantern.   GAMEPLAY   Here we come, in the longest part of the review. Let's start with the choice of your avatar. You can choose between 15 different races, each one with its peculiarities and abilities. You can even decide if you want to have a male or a female, with the exception of   the foggernaut (it's a robot!).   Regarding the gamestyle, it's a turn - based game during the fights against the mobs and the other players, while it's in real time during your journeys, explorations, harvests and crafts. Yes, because in this game you don't only get experience by killing tons of monsters or by completing dungeons you may access with specific keys and after you reach certain levels, but you can also produce your own items by collecting the resources in the environment and by crafting them in specific workshops. You can also decide to group with some other people (or recruit up to 2 sidekicks) to face evil forces or stronger enemies that you couldn't defeat if you were alone. Now the negative aspects of the gameplay. The tutorial itself is kinda crappy, made not properly because it teaches you only some parts of the game. It's useful just to know how's the interface, how to fight and how to collect and plant the enemies in the field in order to generate a wave of monsters to fight. Ah yeah, also to get the starting experience when you'll start with the real game itself. The second most negative aspect is the interface. It isn't intuitive at the beginning, you can't move nor rotate the camera while you're in real time (but you can zoom in and out), while in the turn-based combats you can move it in a way the game doesn't explain. In fact, it doesn't tell you that holding the right button of the mouse and moving the cursor on the borders of your screen will allow you to see the entire battlefield. And, at last, the quest system of the main missions is kinda...lame. You don't get involved in the main story and you do just some random quests in order to get experience and your first and only free sidekick. But, considering how's the game, you don't play it surely for the main quests.   GAME SYSTEM   The game is totally f2p. You're granted access to every part of the game (with the exception of the last 2 islands introduced not long ago), you can choose a nation at level 18 and do every kind of job. The nation system will allow you to player versus player fights and each nation has its own peculiarities. You're granted a free sidekick you can keep forever with every single character you make (until 5 per account) plus a free additional sidekick with a weekly rotation system. The real money allows you to buy the sidekicks and keep them forever, cosmetics, costumes and booster packs that let you drop more loot and get more experience (in a small percentage however) plus the access to the last 2 optional islands. However, these zones are reserved for characters around level 140+.   SHORT VERSION    PROS   - 15 races to choose from, with possibility of gender changing, that can reach until level 200. - Different zones and islands to explore, with a huge variety of enemies - 4 Nations to choose from, each one with its dominant element and peculiarities. - PVP, Guilds and PVE system - Huge quantity of dungeons, with specific dungeons you may find only in a certain nation - Rewarding system well made - Great variety of jobs, in harvesting and crafting, letting you to get your own items and to collect kamas (the game currency) fastly - Colourful graphics - Good sound system -   Mobs having  ehm...sex?      CONS   - Shabby tutorial that teaches few things compared to the real potential. - Not-so intuitive interface - Main quests system not involving and realized superficially - Might be boring if you focus only on getting experience - Requires a lot of time and patience, 2 things that most people don't own...unfortunately.  I recommend to try this game at least once to every kind of afficionado of rpgs/mmorpgs. However, if you are included in one of the following categories I'm enlisting, just don't play this game:  a) You don't like turn based games b) The story and the drama in a game is everything for you c) The graphics is the most important thing for you d) Anime haters e) Average Call of Duty player",

            "review_text": "Wakfu is...an experience. I am still going through my experience but from what I've played of it so far I can give a fair and detailed review of it. I will cover it in four sections; tutorial, gameplay, combat and community. I would also like to mention that I used to pay for and play this game when it was still in open beta about four to five years ago.  Tutorial: The tutorial for Wakfu reminds me very much of the character actors at Didney Worl; they never break character. Your UI can give you all the information you need to break the fourth wall but when it comes time to learn from an NPC they will talk to you, the player, as if you are your character. The NPCs outside of the tutorial follow suit to this.  Ankama has made one class exclusively for the tutorial which, in my mind seems rather pointless. Back in beta the reason I bothered going through the tutorial areas was so I could get a proper feel for my actual class before I committed to playing it. That said, you can opt to skip the tutorial. I wouldn't advise that if you are a brand spanking new player.  Gameplay: Wakfu is what most people call a grindfest, but there is reason behind it I like to think. Monsters will drop items that are guaranteed to end up being used for something, no matter the level. Gear can either be combined into sets to be sold, worn or even ground into powder which can be refined into runes to improve the gear you use.  Killing mobs and running quests aren't the only thing you can do in this game, you may also pick up professions. All of them in fact, conveniently located in the starter area known as Astrub. With this in mind a lot of players tend to lean towards one or the other based on their mood at the time. I personally rarely fight and would rather just go farm wheat fields.  Combat: The combat in Wakfu is unique, something I've never seen in an MMORPG. Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is it. You (and your teammates if you brought any) as well as monsters have a set initiative score, which is a stat you can increase. Those with higher initiative go first and you follow along a grid-based system to fight your enemies. Your character has access to a plethera of passive abilities (able to swap them out between battles on the fly as you unlock them), class-specific utility skills and three skill trees, each one has an element (meaning that you will have access to three of the four elements, I advise you to look through them when you make your character even if you haven't unlocked them).  The player versus player content this game provides comes in some different ways, but ultimately ends up the exact same. There are four nations that you may pick from to be your home upon reaching level 15, with the option to join an outlaw nation at level 30... I wouldn't recommend this though and some people get confused. Let me break this down real quick, if you play this game and hit level 30 you'll recieve a quest called 'Riktus for a Day.' Do not complete this quest, you will automatically join the outlaw nation that only has one outpost in the ocean and are free game for anyone wherever you go. Aside from this, at level 30 you can opt to become a guard of your nation, sworn to protect the land from Riktus, eco-terrorists (will cover this in another section) and PKers.  Another feature to note for combat are sidekicks. They are NPCs that can act as party members you control. They aren't as powerful or versatile as players but they get the job done when you need it. Part of the beginner quest is going through a dungeon, rewarding you at the end with an Astrub Knight. This is the only sidekick you get for free, with the addition of the free trial sidekick. Out of Ankama's list of sidekicks, one is chosen every so often as a free trial. Kind of a try before you buy sort of thing, this gives you the option of not only playing as yourself and the Astrub Knight, but a third teammate once every...I wanna say three weeks but I honestly never noticed. These guys don't offer what other players can provide and you can easily solo your way the entire game with a little patience, the sidekicks only offer you some help along the way.  Overall the PvP in this game is pretty fun so long as you don't get stacked against someone much higher level than you.  Community: As far as I've seen, pretty dead. I wish I could say this, but in the town hubs (Astrub and nation outposts) there are people everywhere. The further out you go you see less players though, most of them are hidden in small haven bags (which act as a portable home and player shop) either afk selling their wares or just plain afk. That said, if you're looking at only the game's point of view then you are sadly missing out, the wiki for this game is regularly updated and the forums always has people poking their heads in to say hello. That said, if you plan to play this game for a while then get into a guild ASAP, I suggest you head over to the forums to find one to your liking.  Before I finish, I want to add that this game does have a cash shop. Is it pay to win? Not really, most of the things you can buy are either cosmetic or do really minor things. You can buy weapons but they don't compare to the gear you can find and make. You may also buy extra sidekicks which can help out, but aside from your Astrub Knight you have access to a different free trial sidekick every once in a while.  Overall: Steam is asking me if I recommend this game and do I? I'm a little torn, but yes I do. This is a very fun game with combat mechanics that require you to actually think when things don't go as planned. The community is there and very friendly but only if you take the time to actually look for them. When you're feeling bored of grinding mobs, go grind resources! Its tedious but addicting after a while.  TL;DR Game is fun, try it out. RTFR.",

            "review_text": "Been playing for about 2 years.  It's not bad, but three things bother me immensely:  - Community is very cliquey, very hard to just play with others without them trying to recruit you or straight up use you as a loot wh**e. Which means, they bring you along, but you give them item drops in return to come along. This is probably the worst thing about the Nox (North American) community.  - Ankama in general ignores the North American region in terms of feedback and communication. Which is always hard as foreign companies based in foreign countries have a harder time bonding with the community. The moderators and staff very rarely visit the NA forum. In fact, other than Sabi, we have little to no interaction with them at all.  - Very grindy gameplay; this has been improved a lot very recently, but it is still unbelievably painful to get anywhere. This ties into the first point a lot as well. Progression screeches to a crawl after level 100 and without a dedicated group finder, you're basically solo (unless you have friends that also play) 90% of the time. People even go so far as to multibox 3-6 accounts just to not be alone. Which I suppose is an entirely different level of alone.  All in all; it's not a bad game, it has its moments, but dear god after 2 years, they are only now starting to fix a few glaring issues that have been prevalent since day 1.  My score as a standalone title: 6.5/10. Compared to most other MMOs: 7.5/10.  Warning: They will try to milk you for as much money as they can get away with.  My reply to their support after being denied for another thing I needed help with. My last request was years ago and they still didn't help me, so it's not like I constantly harrass them for assistance. You win again Ankama, hope that 20 dollars was worth it.",

            "review_text": "This game was almost everything I asked for artistically and combat wise and was an extreme upgrade from playing Dofus (which I also loved). I started late; last year and had a beautiful time where I met a very friendly guild, new people, and learned how to do everything up to Present dungeon with the help of many friends.   Although, everything changed when DDOS' were happening where relics were duped and things were magically bought off the market for absurd amount of kamas and everyone became rich. This did not help when the promising new update of Moon Island and Heroes where it basically made everyone play by themselves and did not have to rely on anyone else to do dungeons anymore. Things became very introvert and very independent.  Overall, I would not recommend this game if you start this year and on. The community is very small, but polite (once you get to 175s+) and is very heavy on finding a guild. You will NOT survive alone.   As agreed with many people, this game would have gone a lot further if they listened to the community.",

            "review_text": "It's kinda rare to see Turn Based Strategy MMORPG. Wakfu is one of those rare gem. The gameplay kinda similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but you only control 1 character, well. with sidekicks though, but still not much.  Now on to the review. + So many different class to choose of. Each class have quite a lot of skill, you could make your own unique build. + There's a profession system in this game, so apart from the main game itself, you could become a farmer, a blacksmith, tailor, and many more. + Community oriented game, you can't sell your stuff to NPC, this game is really community based game, you must actually sell it to people, or... just throw it out. There's Region president election, Guild, and many more. You can join the bad guys, or become a guard instead. + For people who prefers playing alone, there's a sidekick system. At least, there's someone to accompany you. Though, i recommend you playing with actual players.   - The community is almost non-existent, many people said this game is still alive, but that's not applied in my case. I'm playing in asia server, not sure about other server though. - Grindfest, and it's even worse than other MMO in general in my opinion. - Customization, There's costume and stuff, but... well, it's not rare to see people with a same face. - Progression, this game had quite an interesting story, but to progress in the main story is really hard. The level gap to actually progress in this game is really high.   If you have a friend to play with you, i really recommend this game, It's really fun to play wakfu together. If not, find one right away, join a guild, and have fun. ",

            "review_text": "The developper has a shotgun approch to balancing, for 3 months the class I played was unchanged, then suddenly the dev nerf'd dmg output, healing and summons per turn by -50% making it not even remotely viable anymore.  To be clear: that's half the summons and half the damage, so only 25% the original damage potential.  Accoridng to rumors, all because of 1v1 pvp, in a game where pvp is barely even a thing.  Aside from the asinine balance, there is an unbelivable amount of bugs and performance issues. The game is coded in Java and has memory leaks that make the game stutter real bad. A lot of content introduced had been disabled because the dev couldn't figure out how to fix it.  Community seems really young and rude with very few exceptions. There's a lot of 'white knights' that defend the dev's changes for no good reason and seem to advocate worse conditions for their fellow player. Most likely because they're subscribed and wouldn't be affected by the changes.",

            "review_text": "After having played for a good month or so, I have to say, this is a rare find among rpgs. Albeit starting the game is mildly difficult, it's a fun and interesting game to play! For what it's worth, I love this game mostly because it's all about the player.  The economy is not run based on a setup from the developers, it's completely player-based, meaning you can set up shop in the little customizable bag you are given at the beginning of the main part of the game. Not only that, but there are a bunch of balanced, customizable classes you can jump into depending on your play style! Couple that with spells you have to use to improve, gear you can craft/find/buy from others, and all sorts of bonuses like Clan Member bonuses and Guild bonuses, you can increase your stats and quickly find a build for yourself! If that wasn't enough of a hook for the gameplay, you have several opportunities to 'Restat', or change up all your spells and ability bonuses!  There are a few major downsides to the game: There are NO NPC characters that are useful. By this, I mean there are no shopkeepers or helpful questline helpers, it's all based on you and your groups. This might be bad for some people, but this means you can literally cut through all the crap with hirelings and stuff, and just find like-minded players to work alongside!  + The game is simple to work with, using mostly the right and left mouse buttons to control your character and your surroundings. + You control the environment! You can decide what crops to take and what all is removed from the area, like herbs, trees, and even the monsters! + The economy is easy to understand, you sell anything at whatever price you want! It's up to the player that wants what you have to pay the price. + The graphics are good, as well as the sprites and animations!  - There are bugs, as with every game. If you spot something, report it, please, the devs will want to know what is going wrong. - Guilds are at a downside, as there are what are called Haven Worlds, or a World for your guild members to use. Others can slip in and steal stuff from it if you aren't careful, and you'll want to realize you probably WON'T be getting one for a long time if you're a new or semi-poor guild. - PvP is included, so those of you who are low-lvl with high professions, beware other players! Some will want to steal all your crops and leave you nothing in return! - You have to reintroduce anything missing into the environment. If there are no more Ash Trees, to name something important, then if you have the seedlings for it, you'll be forced to replant.   There are ways around all the farming/environment stuff, but until you get enough money to buy the Haven Gems needed, it's a bit much to go after. Alot of the players love to help one another out, so ask questions if you want to know something. That said, enjoy playing Wakfu, and hope to see you in the World of Twelve!  P.S. if you steal my crops, I'll shoot you. It's as simple as that. D:&lt;",

The player-driven economy is a bit broken, but anyway with the new players who joined on steam release there is market and trading for us new players as well. Definitely a game to pick if you are looking for a good turn-based mmo (you have only Atlantica as second choice eheh) and especially the feeling of being rewarded with your hours of gameplay.

Positive:   - Nice art - Fun turn based combat - Strategic - Big world, lots to do. - Lots of classes, with lots of ways to build them  Negative: - Cant be played alone (Unless creating multiple accounts known as multi-boxing) - Hard to learn. Almost no tutorial to get u anywhere. They drop u in the game and good wish u good luck. - Grindfest, Dungeons take long and the items have rediculous low drop rates. (Any good item will usually only have 0.1% to 0.3% drop chance. (token machines allow items to be bought with tokens earned from the dungeon, but will still take about 30 runs for 1 decent item) - Even tho the game is technically free to play. It asks money for tons of things. even certain areas require monthly payment to be accesed (newest areas) - Bad customer support. Sending in a ticket with a problem can take up to weeks for it to be replied. sometimes it will not even get answerd at all. - Extremely buggy. The game is FILLED with bugs. And not small ones ether. Things such as duplicating items turn up very frequantly allowing people who abuse the bug to make tons of money without any punishment. Every patch they introduce multiple new bugs. Some so major u wont be able to play for a long time.  (For example as of writing this review they added the 1.43 patch, Witch makes every fight in dungeons bug out. Not start. and force u to relog. On top of that they have serieus lag issues aswell. making it impossible for people to play due to things such as 1 spell taking 10 - 20 seconds to respond. This current bug has bin going on for 3 weeks and still they do not have a clue how to fix it. And even tho they will fix it eventually. With the next patch added 100's of new bugs will come with it aswell. only to remain not fixed for weeks again)  All in all i actually really love this game. And if it wasnt for the horrible costumer support and frequant bugs i would mostly reccomend it. But i cant. Seeing as u will most likely not even get anywhere in the game, due to bad early tutorials. And constant bugs.",

            "review_text": "Hello all! Finny posting here, some of you who are reading this might want a brief review, some of you might just be looking at another Hardcore Wakfu players opinion so I'll give both. Played hours here 600 odd actual? 3.3k (no life)  1st things 1st, this game is extremely unique i've never played a game like this, a game like this is truly amazing and so is the fact that the game is available on the Mac platform (what i'm using).   TLDR: Game is amazing but VERY VERY grind-y, lonely and un-sociable (Read bottom paragraph). Would recommend :]  Story: This is extremely limited, this is newbie friendly but is very short and only links to Ogrest which is still yet to be incorporated into the game (I think this was going to be level 200 content) once you progress to mid 100 content (level 50) the newely revamped islands (currently 2 out of 5-6+) you then get new quest-lines which feature ways to get Kamas (In game money) quicker through even more exploration of the game, this is tedious but can be fun for people who are casual and don't mind spending 20 hours+ running around the game. The story then jutters and jumps to mid game content (level 100, 118, 120 and 125) these questlines again feature kama making methods and are EXTREMELY fun and give an insight into the story of the game and the Ultimate Bosses (weekly bosses, sadly no challenge what-so-ever) you then have the section of the game which is the most grindy, intensive, game quit feeling inducing moment ever, this is the jump from 120 to the next 140 quest, this is the most boring and lonely grind experience ever, this puts most people off the game. From here you have more quests more frequently and you would have probably found a guild and start to have some online Wakfu friends, you then lead into the high level content, I won't speak about this since you'll probably have a basic understanding of the game and some good friends etc.  Guilds: This is all down to preference but the size of the guilds aren't huge and you are basically forced into high level guilds just to see anyone online, there are a few English guilds which are really nice and newbie friendly (notice how I said few, it really is hardly any guilds that are newbie friendly) when entering this game it's not advised to ask high levels for leeching I will give you a quick run down of why:  XP is grindy as HECK You'll be on 0.5-0.75x XP meaning that someone grinding you a few levels will feel like a life time, period. Fun factor Is it fun for high levels? Yes and No, depends on their mood and what you're like as a player etc. Language Barrier  Hit and miss remember this game is multi-cultural so be wary of whom you ask for help due to language barriers!  In game revenue / money method This is called 'Kamas' you gain some each fight and with chests that you open from completing a respective Questline, this is tedious but you get quite a lot of money, awesome!  On Remington you have quite a nice economy meaning that while some items are crazy high they are endgame and so you'll only aim for these once you have complete knowledge of the game and dungeons etc. Majority of other high level stuff is dirt cheap so that's cool!  Dungeons: Fun and grindy you don't have to run it 1,000 time for an item to have 1 chance of dropping it but instead....! You can run it 1,000 times to get enough tokens to buy it huzzzah! So it's all down to your opinion, there's also major awesome guides online showing you how to complete these dungeons as-well as other players that you'll be running with experience!  PvP: Completely broken due to only a select amount of classes being revamped and overly powerful, unless you follow the crowd with new classes i'd advise against it.  Classes:  Old ones are much weaker and often not taken/ accepted as much in dungeons compared to newer classes, same with other games but sad really R.I.P Sadida ;w;  Bugs: This game has a fair amount of bugs in it but these seem to be ironed out fairly quickly, until recently where dupers have been duping end game items and selling them for very low prices, this has in turn kinda ruined the economy and the player base due to not trusting the market and other players, a lot of people such as my self feel slightly cheated that new people pick it 1-4 of these duped 20million each relics and I spent months farming 1 worth 4 million... This is a major problem as of May 26th 2015 so if you're reading the review take this into account!",

I did the tutorial and then bam!! I was dropped in a world with no info!No clue what stats i should be investing my points,no idea what my skills did,the quests were scattered and the constante mob noises were trully annoying!  Still i kept on going,but i soon realized another important issue! This game is impossible to play alone! Half a dozen quests in and i'm stuck fighting mobs way above my level!I either missed something or you need to grind a ton inbetween quests!  I thought the interaction with the biomes to be interesting and was looking foward to explore the politics meantioned in the description since it seems amazing.  By me this game just doesn't deserve a recommendation!I was expecting a fun game and instead i got a grindy, confusing mess. . .",

This game does a pretty good job of putting the combat experiences of those games in a multiplayer setting.   Besides the combat, I also enjoyed the game's environmental mechanics because it kind of gives me a Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing kind of vibe where the world gives you these resources to do things with, and the players are responsible for tending to them or making something out of them.   As for the grinding, I personally don't know if it is actually necessary or not, but in any case I managed to skip the first story quests altogether and head to my chosen nation (Bonta) and then proceeded to grind the highest level mobs and dungeons that I could manage, purely because I love overwhelming myself in these tactics games and barely pulling through.   It also helps that the only punishment for death is no exp gain for a lost battle, reduced stats for about 3 minutes and a respawn back to the previous checkpoint area of your choosing.   I've spent no money on the game so far, but I might in the future if I keep playing. Paying players get some nice bonuses, but I've been playing comfortably without them. There's also some nifty costumes and stuff too.   I recommend the game because it's free and I enjoy it.  If you get it, I'd definitely recommend doing the tutorial and trying out a few different classes. I went through a couple classes and then went with the Elitrope as my main because I personally loved the portal mechanic. My brother went with the archer because he loved the obscene range and then the huppermage because of the elemental/light attack dynamic. There's a lot of variety, so don't be afraid to try a few out. Also, your lower level alts will gain an experience multiplier to make grinding levels faster,",

It has a way of easing you into the gameplay and system that fealt like the right ammount of hand-holding and freedom to make mistakes. I do understand that Wakfu or it's parent game Dofus are not for everyone. It being on the turn based and tactical side of MMO's it does take the right fit for a gamer to enjoy.   That being said however if you are new to turn based tactical RPG's and want to give them a try, this game will not let you down. It can work as an excellent introduction into the genre, and the community in this game has proven time and time again to be very welcoming to newcomers, and you will get every bit of assistance you could ask for.  All things being equal, I would highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys this genre of game and my personal overall score of this game would be around 8.5/10  The flaws are few and not wanting to repeat what my fellow reviewers have said I will make a refrence a particular reviewer for his/her hard work and broad grasp of the game. Having read through the majority of the reviews the one I do most agree with is Myrtæth's.  Myrtæth gives a fairly informative and detailed review of the game.

I played it on every game station it has. Started on PSX, then Lion War on PSP came out, I even installed emulator so i can play on my phone. Thats how much i Loved it.   The Grid-Based battle. The Story written. The Plot. The Character classical grinding process. The Class complexity and lots of skills each of them have. The Game was simply.. perfect.  Until I reach a point where I want to explore another great game with same criteria. I try a lot of games, not very satisfying. Sometime the battle was not good, the story not interesting, too easy. it always lack of something, that tend to makes me stop playing. 'Maybe FFT is the best game after all.' Thats exactly my thought at the time.  Then, I found Wakfu.  It was an RPG. MMO at its best. Grid-Based Battle, and Free roaming. Various Character you could choose to play with and the complexity of each character skills, is remarkable. It has profession system, side quest like. A Guild, Nation, Outlaw, and environmental system. Also, It has many secret too. I found several secret places that even havent used.  I saves several and upload on my profile. It has so many element that hasnt been implemented, yet the game was this much interesting.  Long story short, this game is worth your time.",

The “Wakfu” here is not the fantastic French Cartoon, but a MMOSLG game. The game offers many distinctive classes/characters which have 3 different elementals each. People in the game, will never repeat killing stuffs, but also plant something, including mobs. The diverse crafting system will satisfy the most needs of your gears, furniture, keys (for entering dungeons) etc. Different pets/sidekicks offer different passive buffs to enhance your char/team.   Although you can solo most dungeons with your sidekicks, you will still need a community to share the thought about the game. I had joined a friendly guild in Asia server which is called Sacred Feathers. They offer me a really professional suggestion which saved a lot of time/money for me.   I think most ppl in that guild are Chinese but they really friendly, the guys called Mathers and Izayoisakura really helped me a lot, one is providing useful suggestions, another offers power levelling.

I have a level 25-ish character now, there are tons of dungeons, some quests here and there, and a craft system that DOES NOT limit you to only 2 ♥♥♥♥ing proffessions(as many as you want to have, instead). I also really love the idea that the entire ecosystem is the entire playerbases responsibility. They do a pretty decent job keeping it all going. If they decide, 'I HATE THESE GOBBALS!!!' They can decide to kill all of them and extinct the species. There are 4 nations and they all have their own set of laws, and they are either enemies or allies of each-other. The laws are pretty cool, cause if the governor chooses to declare an endanged species as 'ILLEGAL TO INTERACT WITH', you can disobey them and become a criminal to your own nation lmao.

Hell you can even re populate the world with monsters.  Do not go by what all the bad Steam reviews say... Most of them just got mad they updated the class they had and made it much harder to play. The support maybe bad or not but most mmos are worst. As for the bugs, all AAA games mmos or not on consoles and pc have more bugs then this so dont let the thumbs down run you off.",

This game is a remake of a popular game known as Final Fantasy Tactics. a Square grid based, turn based tactical game.  There are some great features of the game but most are overshadowed with extreme lacklustre support and game management. Ranging from hacks and exploits never being dealt with causing the entire auction house(market) to flood kamas into the game nulifying the years spent aquiring them. Top end-endgame gear being duplicated and flooding the system making them about as expensive as a level 20 set.  Even dealing with the PKing system which is an absolute joke if you run into a kiddie that has nothing better to do then camp decent leveling zones ( such as A.W) and kill you for no reason hours on end. (Which wasnt really a problem after a while because i just Ddos'd him anytime i needed to enter the zone again so my friends and I could atleast play the game hassle free.)   Then there is the subscription issue. As a player that has been with Wakfu and Dofus for many years now and owns all DLC and content. My subscription has finally ran out and I am no longer able to enter most end-game zones to further progress my character. So I provided Wakfu with money to assist with producing new content for them to release the content and then make me pay again to play on it... Seems a bit stupid from a consumers prospective. My friends and I have now actually quit Wakfu due to extreme neglect from Management and lack of content advancements over the years.  While i DO recommend this game for a new users for a few hours to pass some time. I do not however advise you to ever pay them for their lack of service and progress and just quit once it gets a little boring after a hour or two.  PS. There is a reason the 'Bug and Issues' forum is bigger than the 'General Disucssions' forum..",

So far, the only thing I've seen in-game that costs real money is an account-share vault that allows you to store items to be used by all characters on your account. A huge improvement from what I saw so long ago.  The fighting style is very similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, one of my favorite games of all time. Play with friends or else you'll feel lost in this big, confusing world. You can solo but it's a lot easier with friends and the game seems to lean heavily on party play.  I'd rate this game a 9/10 with a half point deduction because of repeatition (which is in pretty much every RPG) and another half point deduction because it's not as fun to solo. I highly recommend you play with friends.",

Although the brief descripions left me a little unsure as to what classes were actually effective in a fight. Although I've seen a bit of plot kicking around, I wasn't entirely sure what it was nor could I be ♥♥♥♥♥ to find out. The battles were kinda fun for the first two or three before the tedium set in. That was mainly because while there were a bunch of skills they only level up when you use them. Which meant that you'd only wind up using a couple that were strong enough to actually do anything. Even then I found that enemies I fought that were something I could techincally beat, especially in matches of 1v3 or more, I'd still have my ♥♥♥ handed to me. So either I'm terrible at tactics in a general sense, which I can't entirely deny, or I'm just finding all of the battles meant to be fought with other people.

It featured a pretty huge world with unique enemies on nearly every zone and map, with many freaking dungeons to enter as a team of unique races, each with their own set of abilities that all contribute to your chances of clearing these dungeons.  Wakfu is supposed to be the sequel MMO to the world of Dofus, the world is flooded because of Ogrest, an ogre who swallowed a dofus, which in dofus, was the most rare and expensive thing in the world of twelve. You can play 14 classes, same as in Dofus, each race has been graphically updated or changed a little.  What wakfu did right is that it tried to create a world that was entirely run by its players, environments and even the 4 divided nations are still entirely run by players, with its own governors, vice governors, treasurer, eco protector, guards, soldiers, activity chiefs you name it. From the tree's to the monsters its all provided by the player themselves.  which is also exactly why its greatest and most unique feature is also its worst. Imagine the average lazy ♥♥♥ MMO player destroying an entire ecosystem you as a player worked really hard to preserve within an hour? it actually costs money from the treasury (who you pay your taxes to) to patch up, annoying right? imagine an item on the market you want with incredibly high taxes to go with it.  better vote for a different governor next time, what's that? You didn't know you could? Well you can! Every week or month (can't remember) there's elections for a new governor, even you can become one. With enough votes you'll win and you can put your own friends in charge of handling various government jobs in your nation.  you can even declare WAR on the other nations and allow your nation's people to attack visitors from the other nations on sight.  with this system though it's easily abused by guilds and stuff funneling their votes into a guild master or whatever, which is too bad. Combat is a little more fast paced which I find sad really. Bosses can be very fun to fight in a grup though. The classes themselves feel a little like dumbed down versions of their Dofus ancestors, you'll only be using maybe 6 or so abilities through your entire playthrough.  It's still worth checking out as its free to play, and I still do recommend you play it. It's artstyle is incredibly nice.",

And all of those abilities take, like, no time at all unlock. Streamlines the process in a way I don't mind, as from then on really all it's building up to is making those abilities more powerful, and even that's made as easy as possible without taking the grinding out of it. Various effects and damages scale with bonus damage provided by items, and every now and then if you're no happy with the level of your abilities, or the way you've allocated your stats, you can just re-do it (albeit only once a month for whatever wierd reason).  And then I guess second is the turn-based grid-based pseudo-strategy approach to combat. Fresh breath of air, and it works well, though this is one of those wierd MMOs where you have to do not-combat things, but they still use the combat system for whatever reason and it looks incredibly out of place and is unnecessarily complicated. Only those things though, actual battles are just fine.  The english localization is kind of a bang-up job, as all these types of games tend to be. And certain systems being as complicated as they are means this doesn't help learning the game very much. It took me about halfway in to my current playtime to realize what Lock and Dodge even did, so either I can blame that on the game or tell you to do what I didn't and go do some research.  There's also buddings of a Runescape-lite kind of thing going on where you have different crafting and harvesting skills and using them levels them up. This is not a bad thing, I like Runescape, and it's nice to make it feel like you don't need to invest in combat to see most of what the game has to offer, but going the whole hog and having freaking full-on ecosystem management puts player-to-player trust at arms. Everyone can plant the seeds of the things they just cut down to resupply for anyone else who wants to cut them, but there's nothing going on to say you must.  EDIT: Playing it again after putting it down I did remember one other problem with it. Most of the game's dungeons say they're supposed to be done at certain levels, but you can only do them that way if you have a party of friends with you. It makes no concessions for solo players, and it's not exactly the best environment for finding people to help you out.",

The F2p model is a joke its one of those Booster subscription deals and some of the stuff in the cash shop does not really make sense. While the nations were a interesting idea there is balance problem and over time it has made Ankama set most of each nations maps to be almost the same so as not to smooth the leveling curve. Gods help you though if you need to get to another nation that your at war with, The political system is heavily abuse-able. I'm not sure if its a problem in this version but it was a huge problem in the beta. Multi boxing is still alive and well so that mmo part is not really there though other players that are willing to help are a dime a dozen.

There are plenty of classes to choose from and plenty of things to spend your buck on if you choose to do so.  This game has a strange twist to it. There are no selling npc's, you -craft- your own money, you trade your own good, and you make nearly any damn thing you want! You can (from what i can tell) be almost everything or anything you choose to be! This game is truely one that allows you to choose your own tale from it seems, but it also has a quest line you are able to follow.  There are tons of things to do in this game, that one review couldn't cover it all unless it was 20 pages long. Take wakfu for a spin, and read the info the game provides! For once, it isn't something that lies and just tries to get your attention, what you read, is real!  TL;DR +Amazing combat +Limitless things to do +Play with your friends +wonderful community +Make your own money  +/- economy based on players +/- can accidently extinct things +/- No selling npc's but every item has a purpose +/- Your own market to sell stuff +/- Best played with friend(s)  - Can't really think of any besides +/- = the player practically runs the world.",

RIGHT!) kill a sheep! get a sheep equipment set, kill a pink bird, get a pink feather like set! i really love that idea  you can craft a LOT, you can run around, plant trees and flowers, sure other players will just take those trees or flowers away from the ground, but you can just replant them again if you got enough seeds try to make it YOUR world with YOUR pretty or ugly flowers! maybe the others wont be high enough gardener level to destroy your beautiful landscape idea XD well okay, its mainly just ingredients for crafting if im not in the mood to fight monsters etc, ill just run around, take seeds from flowers and plant them all over the world to get my gardener level higher :D btw, you can even get .... ugh... monster seeds (i know, it does sound weird saying it that way) you can plant those seeds into the ground to grow your own monsters! but i think it only works in areas where those monsters actually are, you cant grow lv 20 monsters in the lv1 area (sad xD)  IF you are a solo player and HATE teaming up with others like i do, you can just be weird, pay a bit of money in the cashop and be allowed to use 2 others of YOUR characters for your team, that way you have a 3 player team which you alone control, yes, you heard right, you can make up a team by yourself ;) perfect for anti-social people like me xD (it doesnt stay forever tho, its like 2 euro per week, cheaper if you buy it for longer, but i guess you know how that works)  CON! 1. the monster you capture, does NOT level up with you, it stays at the level where you capture it, which means, you wont be able to keep your favorite pet till high level because it will be really really weak then.... (really sad...) 2. you cant keep your favorite look in the game because the set items get weak, there is no way to preserve the look of an item (as most other mmo's do) so you end up looking really ugly in the end because of 'high-stat-item-ugly-look' stuff  ",
