            "review_text": "I will try to keep this recommendation short, but whatever I put here know there is still much more awesome to this game.  The game is huge and can take anywhere from 15 hours if you rush through it, to 30 hours if you take the time to read all the lore and details that is everywhere in the game. Said lore is expansive and actually very interesting to read. So is all the dialog, with very well done voice acting especially by the protagonist. The sounds are great too, including the weapons.  The game is first person and seamlessly moves to third person whenever you hug a wall or climb a ladder. You can use a variety of weapons from pistols to shotguns, rifles and crossbows, even rocket launchers. There are non-lethal weapons too like tazers and a tranq rifle. You have an inventory you have to manage which holds your weapons, ammo, and everything else you might want. There are plenty of lootable objects, including your enemies.  The game works like this: you are given a goal and are free to get to it how you wish. And I mean really free. Not like some other games which try to make you believe their attempt at stealth actually counts, because in the end you just kill the guys anyway. No, here you actually do have a choice. It is quite possible to avoid contact with any enemy in the game (except bosses), and doing so actually earns you more rewards than if you killed everybody. And if you're real good you can silently take everyone out and earn the ghost rewards. You do this by utilizing alternate routes, many of which can only be accessed if you take non-combat perks. You can also talk your way through certain areas, or hack certain things so you can slip by. This is far from a linear game.  Perks you can get include higher jumping, more strength (to pick up that vending machine revealing the vent behind it, or use it to access a high ledge, or even as a shield from gunfire or to throw at your enemies for lots of damage), poison resistant lungs (to move through contaminated areas), hacking, stealth perks, and more. And of course there are perks to aid in combat like less recoil, damage resistance, ability to see through walls and mark targets too.  Yes there most definitely is replayability. You are given choices throughout the game which does have a minor impact on what happens along that avenue, including what some people will say to you. If you choose to go in guns blazing your first time, you should probably try it a second time as a stealth person; you will learn things about the game you never would otherwise. There is also a new game plus so you can keep your perks from last game and eventually have everything unlocked during your second, if you so wish. Some people don't like achievements, but if this game didn't have one for beating it without killing anyone and another for never setting off an alarm, I most likely never would have bothered and therefore would have missed out on some fun and challenge.  Closing remark I would like to say that this game is a very worthy successor to the original masterpiece of Deus Ex. If you enjoyed that classic then you are all but guaranteed to enjoy this too.  If you want a very in depth game filled with many hours of memorable gameplay, then do yourself a favor and buy this. At 20 bucks it's a great deal, on sale you have no excuse to pass it up. Buy now!",

I also thoroughly enjoyed the Developer Commentary and it provided a lot of insights that I never knew about the game. But the biggest and most noticeable change is actually having two beautiful energy bars that automatically refill to play with. Makes everything so much easier. The 'golden haze' effect will be missed, however, but the game still looks great, almost remastered even. The cutscenes just now feel a bit out of place compared to the rest of the game.  If you haven't finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution yet, get this and do it now. There's no reason not to because you are seriously missing out. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "As a fan of the old  Deus Ex , it had been a long wait since the early 2000's for a worthy addition to the franchise. Set 25 years before the original,  Human Revolution  is a very convincing take on the FPS/infiltration/adventure genre with yet another compelling story whose ramifications deepen as you progress through the game. The numerous characters are supported by a very solid voice acting cast, and the quality of the writing helps create a strong feeling of immersion.  The game gives you a degree of freedom in how you handle situations, but in spite of providing you with a vast array of weapons, it greatly rewards stealth and non-lethal takedowns. You are also given multiple choices in how you approach interactions with other characters, and can sometimes persuade them to help you a little more than they were prepared to. As the plot thickens, so does the level design: between the first mission and the later stages of the game, the areas you have to work your way through become more and more complex, and stealth becomes more and more of a challenge.  Luckily, progress through the game allows you to upgrade your character's abilities with a simple-yet-rewarding XP system. Will you invest points into your hacking abilities? Enhance your social skills with a body language analyzer? Upgrade your dermal armor in anticipation of unavoidable combat situations? The choice is yours! This system succeeds in giving you more options without ever turning you into an overpowered killing machine. On the highest difficulty setting, combat will always be hazardous as you can die very quickly: all the more reason to go for a stealth-based approach.  The  Director's Cut  version is supposed to offer revamped boss fights (the original ones were an abomination). A commendable effort that is supposed to give you more options, but shooting them in the face remains the most viable one. A more convincing selling point is the integration of the game's only DLC campaign ( The Missing Link ) into the adventure. Good DLC,  bratán  - intriguing story elements, good characters and some well-designed new areas to infiltrate will provide for a very welcome extra few hours of gameplay.   The Missing Link  almost makes the final two areas of the game a bit bland in comparaison. The penultimate one feels a lot simpler than what you've just been through, while the last one is simply disappointing - necessary from the story's viewpoint, but entirely forgettable when it comes to gameplay. Nonetheless,  Director's Cut  is a solid excuse to give this modern classic another go and, why not, get back into the  Deus Ex  universe in anticipation of  Mankind Divided 's release.",

I was very curious how this new one will be, but on the other hand, I was afraid that this may damage legend of this classic title. To be honest I didn't believe that new version may be as good as original. And I was wrong! It is such good! It's great game in every aspect, well designed, polished, almost perfect. This is a pleasure to may play such game.  VERDICT: If you are a fan of original Deus Ex, you probably played it. If not, what are you waiting for?!

Mainly unsatisfied with the 'Missing Link' DLC being completly seperated from the main game, I looked forward for this complete package.  With the integration of the 'Missing Link' DLC and some other small Pre-Purchase DLCs into the main game this would just have been a simple 'GOTY edition', but you get a bit more. Beside some better facial animations and the redsigned Boss fights you also get a full developer comentary for the whole game.  This changes and additions combined with a big standard discount for owners of the original version (and 'Missing Link' DLC) on Steam make this a must have for everyone who plan to play this game again.  To the game itself is not really much to say. The setting, the visual style and the sound/music are wonderful and make the world believable. The only negative point for me is the not real existant free decision in terms of ways to solve the problems/missions in the game (the stealth and hacking way gives you way more exp points). It is also sad, that the developers skipped the possibility to choose through the whole game if you prefer heavy augmentation or try to stay as mainly 'organic' ... meaning your way to deal with the changes 'You never asked for.'!",

You play as Adam Jensen, most handsome game character ever made, that beard d'oh, makes me jealous.  **BACK TO THE REVIEW**   Personal Rating : 'Worth playing' Traditional Rating : 9.5/10 Platform: PC Genre: Action FPS/Stealth    Gameplay (9/10)  Nothing beats this, first person combined with third person when you stealth-ing is work flawlessly. And things become more perfect since you can choose what style suits you best. Do you like stealth? sure to avoid camera and enemy, hacking into places, doing things unnoticed while taking down enemy one by one (and make a human pile with it). Or you love shooting enemy in the nuts and going uproar, the choose is yours.   Story (10/10)  Every. single. action you take have different outcome. You like to kill? it's fine, you like to save people? you can do it too, you want to make someone get busted? there's an option for it. and not to mention those option is only for single event. There's so many option you can do, from bragging, lowballing, anything. that makes you feel you're not tied to a single linear story. Different ending makes this game even more replay-able   Character, Sound, and Narrating (8/10)  Sound effect absolutely awesome and well made. Meanwhile in every game you may skip every chit-chat because it's so boring, but not in DXHR, the character sub was very excellent, that you will sucked into and obviously don't want to skip it.   Graphics (8.5/10)  graphic is subjectively depend on the person and objectively depend on the system. but for myself, graphic was well made, characters detail was top notch. City landscape, ship, labs, and every other place, including elevator, totally awesome.

            "review_text": "Deus Ex is a cyberpunk-themed, action-adventure sci-fi game developed by Eidos. It is an FPS but shows our character from the third-person perspective once behind a cover. The game, thus, puts a lot of emphasis on stealth-based approach taking down enemies one by one without allowing them to see us. The more silent approach you pick the more experience point you obtain after a successful takedown, therefore, the easier to level up. Once at a new level you can spent your hard-earned Praxis points on various skills further enhancing your capabilities: you can learn taking down enemies by smashing through walls, you can run and jump almost silently or if you want you can just become invisible for a short period of time.  There are two areas where Deux Ex shines: 1) Story: You need to find out why Sarif Industries, the world's leading nanotechnology firm was attacked by an unknown group of mercenaries. You look for clues in Detroit and overseas in China, Singapore and even Australia. Each city offers a lot of side missions for you to further develop your skills and to get to know more of the story or just the world Deux Ex takes place in. It is common that you can make a decision as to how you want to accomplish a mission: if the requests are coming from more people you can decide who you'll favour eventually. There are collectibles in the form of e-books providing you with further background of the year 2027.  2) Gameplay: As mentioned, while running and gunning is also an option the game is best played by picking the silent approach: each section offers extra bonus if you do not eliminate anyone and if nobody sees you coming. I also liked the hacking sequences - I hacked each and every panel in the game even when Jensen was in possession of the code to unlock a specific door or to turn off the turrets aimed to protect a certain area.  Now, the Director's Cut is a newer version and has been available for a while instead of the vanilla edition. It comes bundled with the game's DLC and offers some graphics and AI improvements. As you can see from the store page patches were released as the DR version suffered from some pretty annoying bugs. Personally, I did not encounter any of these and I liked how they changed the boss battles in favour of those who decided to remain silent assassins throughout the game. The Director's Cut employs more vivid colours - I can understand this irritates some people. We have some documentary videos, audio commentaries and the good old new game plus mode which is so famous nowadays.  Overall, I was satisfied with Deus Ex and with the Director's Cut I completed the game 3 times. That's 3 times 30-35 hours if you complete all side-missions and talk to everybody and explore every corner just to see if there are some extra equipment or Praxis Kits lying around. What's more is that the game offers 4 endings but in order to be able to see all of them you need to complete a lot of missions in the last segment of the game.  If you want a story-oriented, long-lasting cyberpunk experience then Deux Ex is for you. With the Director's Cut coupled with a discounted price you cannot make the wrong decision by purchasing Human Revolution.",

I have very few complaints with DX:HR. About the only thing I can think of is that it is too easy if you have a lot of experience playing stealth games. Which is funny because one of the complaints voiced at launch by others was the difficulty of the boss fights for stealth oriented builds. Don't let that whining dissuade you from picking up this enjoyable experience. I'm going to say it straight up. Anyone, who said they had difficulty with the bosses, sucks at video games.  Note that the biggest change to the game in the Director's Cut is that the bosses fights have been altered to offer more opportunities succeed for stealth builds and in general. I'm not complaining. The boss fights in this version are much more fun.",

It helped me see things different and finally I could be in a universe which really interest me: our world. I believe that this game shows the truth. The fate of mankind both in the present days and in the future.   This version includes all the extra content you can get, the Missing Link DLC (see below) and many hours of developers' commentar. I played through the regular version in 24 hours, while this one took more than 40. Worth the extra money? Definitely!  But don't worry, I'm not going to chant odes about how great this game is, simply because it isn't. From a technical perspective, mostly.  First of all, this Director's Cut version uses an older build of the game, so the many bugs they fixed in the normal version are still present. These include graphical issues, like presented  here ,  here ,  here ,  and here . The character animations - especially during dialogues - are also ugly, and it seems they forgot mimics too. Although they said they had a lot technological limitations, it's a shame considering it came out in 2011. I found one  npc fail  as well. Also, I had problems with getting a decent fps. It dropped many times below the playeable limit. It was nice to see how they improved the visuals in the DLC.  It was stunning  . The 'improved AI' as they promoted is still dumb as a rock. Once you get into a fight they can hunt you down, but as far as you prefer stealthing, they're easy to fool. Too easy.  Other than these, it's an outstanding piece of art.  As I listened the developers I kinda realized how much effort they've put into this game. Level designers, voice actors, story writers, everybody did an honest and dedicated job.  The story, is by far the most complex and well-written I have seen. It always keeps the tension, has many twists and makes you play more only to see what'll happen next. They hit the nail on the head with this cyber-renessaince design. It fits very well to the atmosphere. I mean, it creates the atmosphere. A dark near future world full of transhumanist aspirations and the contrary between technologycal advancement and human dignity. Takedown animations are badass, the weapon arsenal is diverse, the stealth mechanics works as well as combat situations. There are plenty of ways how you can achieve your goal. I discovered many (and I mean MANY) other alternate routes for the second playthrough.   One very important thing I can not go past without a word is the music. Michael McCann is an amazing talent, his melodies define my every day life. I listen to this album regularly, and yet  I can not get enough of it. It's a masteriece.   To sum up this review, you must really play this game if you're interested in the topics mentioned above. It worth every minute you spend with it. Wait for a sale, then go, buy it!",

Still, the changes are good. Not perfect, but pretty good.  if you DON'T already own DX:HR, then this is a good upgrade and fixes a handful of really irritating problems, while including the DLC where it makes logical sense in the storyline. Or, if you don't own Missing Link and its been a while since you replayed the game, then I recommend going this route, playing ML by itself robs a lot of the impact it could/would have and again, this fixes a lot of quality of life issues; I plan on 100%ing the trophies on this one too, because I am a ♥♥♥♥♥ :&gt; (and I really really liked this game, director's cut or not)  ",

Not enough explosions or destruction for me. The story is meh and hte game feels a little short... But still nice. 7/10 would reccomend to buy on sale, but is still great either way.  Long version:  Everything is clunky, but ok in it's own odd way, and every gun in the game is useful (at least the lethal ones, I didn't bother with silly concepts like 'restraint' or 'stealth and subtlty' or 'mercy' or 'doing the right thing.' :P) I blasted my way through the game and had fun getting yelled at by every character who had a problem with it (I only wish you could flip them off more often.)  I found myself dying and reloading saves often, and my advice is to use the weapons you have now, and not bother with sparing ammunition. You'll almost always have the resources to spare, especially near the end of the game where you're an expert at placing one-hit-kill headshots on your enemies like no tomorrow. So seriously! Hurl that grenade, don't stash it! You'll miss out on all the fun if you're just using the pistol all the time or saving your superpower energy!  I kind of wish the game's story was a little clearer. I still don't know what Adam's initial mission was- something about figuring out who's behind a terrorist attack at the Sans Serif Font Building or something. The relationship between Adam and the girlfriend was shoehorned into the plot, and Adam Jensen's voice actor doesn't emote half the time, and needs a throat lozenge (seriously, it's really bad. I reflexively cringe half the time that he talks.)  All three endings to the game (without spoiling anything) are just essentially slideshows, like Fallout.  Unsorted thoughts on the game:  -Alcohol blurrs the screen really badly, and it's unreasonable. It's also hard to use items in your inventory. You would think that sorting your inventory by clicking and dragging would be easy, but somehow it's not. Using items that aren't on your hotbar requres the use of a dropdown menu, like you're in windows Explorer. Even dropping items.  -Your inventory gets pretty small, even when you can upgrade it. It would be kind of fun to not have to worry about inventory space, like in Half Life, but meh.  -Everything is orange. I suggest downloading a mod to remove the silly orange filter, because it gets kind of annoying, especially when you get to the China area.  The city hubs are a little... Dull. Not a lot of things going on, just lots of people standing around in the street. There are two city hubs: Detroit, and Generic China Future City with bad stereotypical accents. I hate 'China City Who's Name I've Already Forgotten.' It's layout is like a maze, and you get lost easily, even with a map and a compass. A simple task of getting from objective to objective turns into a game of wandering until you find the right path.  Mine templates are useless. It's hard to gauge how far a thrown weapon will go, and sometimes you'll have to throw a second grenade because you missed. Stores don't sell enough ammo. There's not enough superpowers, but the ones you have are awesome.  The cover system is really poorly implemented, and sometimes it doesn't even work right in firefights- jerking your gun around suddenly or in directions that you didn't expect. Even with full armor upgrades, a pointblank shotgun blast will still almost always kill you in a single hit. This makes the game unforgivingly hard.  One last note: I -HATE- the sprint function. You run for literally three seconds at maybe 10% faster speed, then have to wait three seconds to recharge it. Sure, you can spend valuable exp on expanding that sprint by two increments of 2.5 seconds each, but it doesn't do much of anything.  All in all, a flawed gem.",

The characters are memorable, layered, the conversations feel very natural, the writing is awesome.  There are many moral choices and all lead to different conclusions. There are different endings and overall the lore of the game is somewhat ironically feels like it's pointing the finger to our real world. You will see some of teh best looking endings in gaming history. The gameplay is polished, the rpg elements are simple to understand and well implemented.  Yous simply have everything here... Queasts, sidequests, different collectibles, reading materials. You can solve missions in many ways, somewhat reminding you of games like the Hitman series just in a Cyberpunk enviroment. Yep you can be like Hulk, Rambo, Leon the professional, or Sam Fisher to tackle your missions, using your enviroment in many different ways. I strongly recomend this game to any gamer regardless of what type of game you like to play, it feels like there si something and everything for anyone here.",

The replayability is low because you can choose your ending at the last part of the game and it feels like your actions dont have that much consequence in the end. You can get the same endings as a ruthless murderer and a completely non lethal operative. The story is compeling and persuasion and dialoge feel so natural, It feels like you are in a scifi political drama with intense gunplay and stealth. The atmosphere really immersed me and its unique design never felt repeated or overused. The greatest strenght this game has is how you can play a level in so many different ways. You could run and gun or move a couple boxes and find a vent or knock out a guard and steal a password. This game gets a solid 9 out of 10 the only negative factors are the endings and somewhat choppy npc animations",

Its a hybrid in a sense that you can go into every level or map guns blazing or you can sneak in take-out a few guards silently and complete the objectives wihout tripping the alarm. Each playstyle has its +s and -s but it really only suits to the player's choice.

Pacifict? Check. Terminator? Check. Hacker? Scavenger? Little-of-everything? All of the above. I loved it.  And more than just the amount of choice was the implementation. I've said in other reviews that what I want in a game is one where the challenge comes from fighting the bad guys, not from fighting the controls. 99% of everything I tried in this game was a fair challenge. No shoddy, sloppy work. I push the button; thing happens the way it's supposed to. And there were plenty of times when I had a nutty idea and thought, 'Can I do that?' Yes I could. Punch civilians in the head! Throw turrets into the sea! Make modern art with piles of unconscious enemies! Steal EVERYTHING!  My only real complaint was with the implanted DLC. While I did grow to enjoy it by the end, (especially Quinn), at times it felt uneccesary and shoehorned in, and there were parts when the writing was bizarrely sexist. Oh well. Once I got off the boat it was back to the main game and everything was fine again.  Overall, DXHR is going in my favorites list. I look forward to New Game+. The D-Row Ballers won't know what hit 'em.  P.S. Major congrats to Adam Jensen's voice actor. The Neo-esque gravelly growl could have easily been monotone and emotionless, but he managed to put a ton of subtle personality into the performance.

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a surprisingly good game.  I'd been told it was a good game previously, but never had a chance to try it out. By the time I remembered about the game, it was a few years after release and the graphics looked somewhat dated and I was foolish enough to give the game a skip based on that.  Then a friend of mine offered me a spare copy of the game going free, so I thought 'Ack, why the heck not!' and installed with haste. I played it straight over the following three days, putting 25.8 hours into the game, completing it on the hardest difficulty (or at least, the hardest available. I think there might be an even harder level now available after completing the game).  Oh boy, it was good.  Problem was, I went through the entire game without killing anyone. Or so I thought. Then I remembered I shot someone in the tutorial. Whoops. Oh well, just an achievement.  The game was rather easy to play, especially if you play non-lethal ghost. I've not tried out going loud - I suspect it'd be much harder, considering the amount of damage they deal on harder difficulties. So one might want to take that into mind.   Gameplay wise the game is above average - it's not exactly a great shooter, but the stealth is decent enough. It could be improved and I hope in the new game they make the combat a little more intuitive and/or realistic. But there will always be more one can want.  Yet what makes it great is the world and the story, and how people react to your actions. It feels nice when people comment about your lack of lethal use throughout the game - and, without spoiling anything, saving certain characters also happens to have a significant impact on the game too.  Obviously in my review, however basic it may be, I'm biased to a degree because I didn't actually purchase the game - but having played it, I would've bought it (at sale price, because I'm stingy) had I know what the game was actually like to player.   P.S. Illuminati P.S.S. Thanks Zero!",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is a breath of fresh air, especially after the disappointing sequel to one of my favourite games of all time, Deus Ex. Invisible War was a mess. BUT, Human Revolution rejuvenated the franchise after returning to the core roots and pillars of gameplay which were founded in the original. Stealth, action, meaningful choice and consequence events, and of course many other role playing elements. Adam Jensen, ex-SWAT and military, is an awesome protagonist, and is easily one of the franchises best characters, just as JC Denton was in the first game. Augmentations are back, and are as awesome as ever. These give Adam a slick feel, especially as time progresses, and allows endless possibilities with character development. Augmentations give the player new avenues into approaching objectives which allows the game to feel more open ended and replayable.  BE WARNED, not all augmentations can be purchased in one playthrough so choose wisely depending on your playstyle.  5th time playing it myself (1st time on PC), and I was still discovering new and rewarding approaches to tackle my objectives. The dialogue system, which is very similar to Mass Effect, works extremely well in giving the player more choice and is intricately designed, much like the new hacking system. As far as the story goes, it absolutely works with the themes of the game. Conspiracies, secret organisations and of course...  the Illuminati  . And not to mention, the writing in the game is impeccable. One of the best scripts I've seen in a video game.  The 'Directors Cut' tag has added quite a few benefits over the original, the most noticeable being the New Game+ mode which was widely requested by fans for a long time. It's here and it absolutely works. Being able to continue on from where the game ended and keeping all augmentations just makes the game more enjoyable and also a little bit easier, allowing the 'Give me Deus Ex' difficulty to be quite manageable, as it is very tough (1 or 2 hits and its 'See ya later, Frank'). Only weapons and other inventory items will have been discarded if New Game+ is activated, which is not a very big hassle as it would have made the game way too easy, and that is not at all good for a game like this. The new 'Directors Cut' also adds developer commentary which is quite insightful as it delves deeper into how different aspects of the game were considered and made.  In conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one of last generation’s best games, in MY OPINION. The rewarding gameplay, multiple approaches to objectives, and just the sheer amount of replayability along with the engaging and well written 20+ hour storyline makes for an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience, especially for fans of the franchise, like myself. The only downsides, which I haven't yet mentioned have to be that the game only rewards one approach of gameplay,   stealth and non-lethal  , which is actually fine because ultimately this is how Deus Ex should be played, and it’s the way I played it. The other disappointment is in the boss fights. Although the 'Directors Cut' added more flexibility to these encounters, they still lacked in the multiple approach department, especially   taking these bosses down non-lethally  , which isn't very much like Deus Ex. Lastly, the inclusion of the 'Missing Link' DLC, adds to the games total play time, but nothing more as it is quite a disappointment. The 'Missing Link' should not have been embedded into the main game, as it seems rather forced due to the tedious objectives that need to be completed in a constricted hub, which ultimately results in rather stale and boring gameplay. All in all, I wish I could go over everything, but this was a short review. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Directors Cut is one hell of a game and can easily be respected as one of the series' best. Hardcore fan or newcomer, this game should be played by anyone who enjoys lasting and rewarding RPG's. Having played the PC and console version, the PC version is far superior.  9.3/10  Note: I managed to do everything in the game, including most achievements and the DLC, in around 17 hours (speedrun, kinda). If it is your FIRST time playing the game, expect to put in at least 30-35 hours to finish the story and do some of the side quests. I just memorised MOST of the games layout and approaches, and also knew where the main interest locations were.",

Who wants to spend their game time checking all lockers one by one in a locker room hoping one of them might contain something important, in the name of realism? DE:HR makes you do that. Same for the computers, every single computer in every room can be accessed and hacked, without a clue of whether they might contain something important. It's a completionist's nightmare.  Besides that I like the setting and characters, and the RPG system (even though it's not as complex) honors the Deus Ex legacy. Level design is overall good with several paths of approach, but doesn't feel as sprawling and natural as the original, and you can see the designers are pretty green with mistakes like the above. At least the stealth gameplay is very rewarding.  Overall very good game, well worth playing. Just don't bother checking every nook and cranny, or you might get tired of the hacking minigame. Stick to quest-related areas.",

            "review_text": "Stealth games have lately sucked, mainly for the simple reason that you’re too damn strong and the game keeps telling you that killing them is wrong when they would do it right away if they had a chance. It makes games such as Dishonored kinda suck as I personally don’t even feel like playing on a stealthy way when you can just kill them on one hit and they’ll take minutes and dozens of men to do the same thing to you. That’s different on Deus Ex. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the first game as it was overly confusing and too complex when I first got it over 10 years ago, I was young and I couldn’t get a liking to it… But when I grew up, I played the living f#ck of it. So sure I would get this game. I got the normal one, I got the DLC, and I even got the Director’s Cut Edition. Is it worth it? As usual I’m gonna start by what it does wrong.  First and foremost, the animations. I’m not sure why, but I just can’t get a liking to most NPC’s animations. They look stiff and really forced, specially at the start of the game. Hostile NPC’s do look believable, but friendly NPC’s keep acting like robots, lots of them even reusing the same animations like you wouldn’t notice.  Something I also found somewhat annoying are the boss fights. Now hear me here, they were A BILLION TIMES WORSE BEFORE. On the original game, you had to fight bosses on a lethal way, no matter if you’re playing on a stealthy hacking way or guns blazing, it was a big gameplay flaw that could seriously ruin stealth runs. It was somewhat fixed on the Director’s Cut by giving a few different options such as using turrets to do it for you, but it’s still weak. It could have been way better.  Another thing I didn’t like were the endings. On a game this damn long, around 20 hours of good story and gameplay, WHILE IN THE ACTUAL #NAL F#CK SH#T DO ALL ENDINGS JUST TURN INTO STOCK FOOTAGE WITH A VOICE-OVER!? It’s the laziest sh#t ever! It TRULY feels like you’ve accomplished NOTHING.   Lastly, the hacking minigame is a bit too random at times. You start it to get a door open, suddenly it starts flashing red colors on a 25% detection checkpoint and you’re WAAAAY too far away to get there in time. If you go into a stealth run and are forced to hack stuff, you better stock on viruses. You’ll need them if you’re unlucky.  Taking the trash out however, we do find quite a few gems on the game.  Where the game shines the most is the gameplay. Remember the comparison to other stealth games such as Dishonored? Here you truly can do it however you feel like, and it TRULY feels like it makes a difference. In Dishonored it barely changes the last levels and gives you a different ending cinematic, while here taking the brutal guns-blazing option from the start makes others question if what you’re doing is right.  I also like how weapons work. Lethal or non-lethal, you can upgrade them throughout the game and turn a sh#tty generic pistol into a death-sentence that has a silencer, can work through armor like it’s warm butter and has 25 bullet magazines. At the same time though, the game never gives you too much ammo of one thing, usually only giving you two or three bullets out of enemies you’ve taken out, making you actually take aim and be careful on whatever the hell you’re doing with your fancy toys.   That also somewhat expands to augmentations. Throughout the game you’ll get Praxis thingies that can be used to make your character better in a good variety of ways. Want to be invisible for short durations of time? Want to see through walls? Want to jump higher? Want to be immune to fall damage? Want to have a better aim when shooting? Want to make less to no noise when walking or running? Want to pick up a fridge and shove it up someone’s #ss? It’s all there, and you choose what to do.  The voice-acting and music department is actually quite a big point on this game. Everyone sounds real, truly immersed on their role on the big story the game has. Specially the main character who, although a bit clichéd and being a bit parody to Robocop, is likable and quite a badass.  The game also offers a good variety of ways to get to the desired objective… Except with bosses as I’ve already said. Even on Stealth runs, there’s usually multiple ways to get there, it’s all up to you to find them.  Also, the game shows some Dev foresight as they got NPC’s ready to react to things you might have not expect to. You steal everything from the building you’re working at as security chief? People will send you emails complaining about multiple thefts happening. People give you a quest about taking out drug lords you’ve already executed and dunked their face to the ground? They’ll call you out on it. These kinds of things are quite unexpected and funny as hell.  Do I recommend this game? Yeah! It’s a really good experience which truly gives you freedom to do whatever you feel like. It has a good length, the DLC’s already added to the game and it’s a fun experience. The bosses suck, but that’s a low price against a good amount of great content. You might have never asked for this, but you should give it a try.  TL;DR Edition: A good example of a stealth game. Boss fights kinda still suck, but offers tons of variety on a quite long experience. Would totally recommend on a sale. IT TRULY IS A BOMB!",

Story The story is fantastic, the prologue pops you straight into the action and sets up what is to be a lengthy and immersive story on a great journey through numerous locations in a futuristic setting. I found myself fully immersed within an hour and loving the progression that is presented to the player for their experience, this made me want more and more throughout! Not once was i bored during this game, i found myself reading all the emails and notes through the game to build up the story and exploring every area so i found every one. 9/10  Visuals Stunning visuals throughout, although they may not be to everyone's taste. The graphics are top notch for the generation and beautiful environments really add to the immersion mentioned above. One thing to note, which some may not like, is the yellow hue to everything, however, i feel this adds to the unique beauty of the game and gives it its stunning unique look (much like the green hue in fallout 3 for example). 9/10  Gameplay Never a dull moment with the gameplay here, there are three approaches to every area: &gt; Stealth - sneaking around, ducking into vents, cloaking etc.. &gt; Techno - Hacking, using robots and turrets against foes &gt; Combat - run and gun Having these three approaches and being able to mix and match at any time allows for so many different combinations of dealing with situations that there is very little repetition. The one part that truly lets the game down here (and is quite infamous) is the boss battles, which throw this out the window and turn into a battle, however, this is disregarded as the directors cut overhauls this for the better! 9/10  Overall i loved this game, its rare to have such a good shooter in this day and age with all the rehashes and lack of innovation, this game is my personal GOTY.   + Great Story + Stunning Visuals + Awesome sounds and ambience + Innovative gameplay  - Boss battles (fixed) - Yellow hue may not be to everyones taste   9.5/10",

The story, gameplay, and characters are amazing, especailly the protagonist Adam Jensen. The game starts off pretty slow and you really don't feel all that powerful. But once you get over that hump, you literally become a badass, especailly if you invest heavily in Hack. I racked up so much EXP from hacking. And the mini game that is tied to it is really fun, especially when you get to level 5 and have like 6 secs to get it done.   The game lets you play quiet or loud, though it basically encourages you to play stealthy either way. Running into the middle of a group of enemies is most likely gonna result in your death. Luckily the stealth in this game is done very well, so it makes it fun to sneak around air ducts or find those hidden paths around enemies. And the game gives you EXP for doing that as well, so you don't lose much by skipping large battles.   The only major cons I have with the game are that the cutscenes don't really scale with the game. The game on max settings looks pretty good, but the cutscenes are lower quality no matter what you play on. Its not a big deal, but it would have been nice to see sharper scenes. Another con is the use of batteries to do pretty much anything. For using camo or armor, yeah, it makes sense to have to use battery life. But to knock enemies out? That just seemed like a pointless feature. I really hope in DX4 they remove that.   Overall, this game is a solid 10 in my books. Everything about this game is amazing.

Gameplay is enjoyable and unique and the story isn't bad either, in fact it has a quite deep meaning. The game deals with fairly heavy themes like what it means to be a human, is self controlled evolution right, is controlling and manipulating masses necessarily evil and does our advancement in technology allow the discrimination of those who can't afford the newest conveniences.   Human Revolution leans heavily on stealth, which can be frustrating for those who are used to more action packed approach, as the game practically punishes the player if he decides to go guns blazing into the action.   All in all I would recommend this game for those who enjoy stealth games and the cyberpunk setting. Also someone who finds enjoyment in conspiracy theories might find this game interesting, but then again I'm not going to spoil anything! Just see it for youself.",

After the dock mission where you infiltrate a dock facility to hitch a ride on some transport craft to track down the scientists you miraculously get capture and start the next mission with nothing, youre basically back to level 1 and have to regain your stuff. Now once you regain it you dont get it all back. So i spent countless hours unlocking abilities and upgrading my arsenal and whachamacallit upgrades only to get back a grand total of 8 of those upgrades back. I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME unlocking those abilities and i dont get back a fraction of it, it takes 2 upgrade points to unlock a new ability and 1 after to upgrade that path each time and i had almost everything complete so that would be about 20 to 30+ upgrade points i spent and i get back 8 so where did the remaining 12 to 22 go? So all those cool gadgets like the grenade launcher i unlocked and what not are unequippable because i spent the upgrades on other stuff thinking maybe once i get my stuff i can get it all back nope. Im now done with this game. i tolerated the poor AI and laughable actions they do, maybe on hard it would be a challenge since all that any developer does is increase the AI weapon damage which is really all subpar developers do. This game is weak, the system of using abilities and requiring equipable items to replenish them is a waste. You have limited item space and weapons with ammo require alot of space to store. inventory systems in games need on update. Separate equipment from item inventory so that you can equally store you stuff. Weapons should be stored on your person not in a magical inventory that hides everything. I can go on about all the stuff in this game that sucks.",

I LOVE THIS GAME.....just not this version, it has bugs galore reason being is that DC is a revert back to the first release WITHOUT the polish. I played this game years ago on a 360, the graphics then were better than this release. Check the negative reviews and forum/boards if you want more info, they say the same thing as of now the DC version has 144 bugs. There is no excuse for eidos to re release such a magnificent game while simultaneously bringing shame to its legacy and originality. Eidos has no interest in fixing bugs that were already fixed to begin with, and as quoted from there own forum they have 'moved on' which is a slap in the face IMO. Buy this game please BUT get the retail version and not DC or for PS3/360 if you have the system. I played this game on a self built high end PC, still wont make much of a difference im afraid. In a nutshell the game is amazing and with MANKIND DIVIDED coming you must play this ASAP but get non DC version. Amazing game that got a hard one in the butt, unfortunately some bugs can make the game unplayable or break your progress. This game was like the sweet hot chick who always said hi and winked, but had a mean boyfriend that messed her up and ruined her sweetness.",

It adds some interesting plot points near the end of the story, but you're constantly backtracking through the same areas for hours, going through mandatory 'bio scans' to move from one area to another and back again. Worst part about it is you lose most of your inventory unless you reupgrade your carrying capacity instead of respec'ing into useful augmentations.

Actually, it feels too close to the original one for me : the world is very schematic. The story, the characters, the theme, everything feels one dimensional. The so called 'depth' of the Deus Ex games comes solely from exposition and logs that are firstly very boring to read and secondly not interesting. I'm an avid SciFi reader and DXHR feels older than anything written in the 1970's. DXHR's SciFi layer is essentially chrome for a power fantasy. At least, a game like Crysis aknowlegdes this aspect and focuses on the gameplay. Here, it's really a mixed bag.  The only aspect I really enjoyed (or at least that intrigued me) was the 'social enhancement' or whatever they call it. In some (rare) dialogues, you can evaluate the person you're talking with, diffuse pheromones and either charm or pressure the persons depending on their personality type. It's still schematic but the creators clearly put a lot of thought into it. You actually have to read them, and it's not as obvious (and stupid) as LA Noire where a liar will have a forced 'liar's face'. For me, it was the only occurence where the characters in DXHR felt like there was some depth to them.  The graphics feel already old. At every step, you feel the walls of the world. And it's ugly.  Every quest, even the main one, feel like uninsteresting fetch quests. Go here, get this, get that, go there, bla bla.  Gameplay is ok but really not that engaging. Just compare it to Styx, a humble yet rigorous stealth game with real challenge, wonderful level design and you'll understand what I miss here.  A good game may have good gameplay and a mediocre story. I can even accept an uninteresting gameplay with an excellent story. But a mediocre gameplay with a mediocre story make a mediocre game.  Sure, the stealth aspect of the game can be quite exciting. But DXHR is one of those games where everything is obvious. Air vents are just waiting for you everywhere. You can snipe anyone and carry their bodies at will. And if anything gets a bit difficult, you can save and reload endlessly.  It feels like work.  I was trying to play for quite a while but I stopped when the first side quest involving drug dealers came up. Drug dealers ? Isn't there anything else to say in a cyberpunk universe involving transhumans ? I agree that it is somehow linked to the theme.  But, man, it's so boring.",

After having completed the original with no issues I'm gettin lots of constant stutter and have so far had 9 crashes to desktop, most of them when loading a new area. As far as I've been able to figure out this is a port from the WiiU and that might be the reason it's so bad. And bad it is, from a technical standpoint.

I have never played the first game and really enjoyed this game, so I feel like they did well for any newcomers for this game series. It has an awesome stealth stylized gameplay (if you decide to play the game that way) and great head-to-head FPS combat. Most abilities and upgrades are very satisfying with little things like being able to take out too people at once to making it easier to hack when people are able to catch you on the spot. The only problem I had with this game (without spoiling it) is that no matter what all your actions add up to; you still get the same choice for several different endings with just cutscence that used film instead of the in-game cutscenes. Other than that, fantastic game! Definitely worth every dollar, especially if you buy this while it's on sale.",

World is real, plot is too-damn-real, you can see some parts of the game are already a reality.   Gameplay is well polished, difficulty is challenging, especially unforgiving if you go after some achievements. (Hardest difficulty) .

The graphics are great and even if you have the game on its lowest settings, It still looks better than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. And despite the great graphics, It is not that graphic intensive. Intel HD 4000 can run the game at about 50 FPS.   2. I liked the gunplay. It actually felt like I was in an actual firefight with the cover system.  3. The games dialogue was better than the original and Invisible War's and had emotion and emphasis in it.  4. Multiple ways to complete an objective.  5. Alternate routes to bypass security. You could go through air vents or simply just outsmart the guard and get by his patrol route.  6. The takedown system  7.

Additionally, it contains so much content that I played through the original game twice from start to finish just to be able to see everything.  And the Director's cut just makes it better. It has improvements with many of the issues that plagued the non-director's cut edition including bosses done right, better A.I. and placed the DLC in the middle of the game rather than having it a standalone game. I played it from start to finish again with the commentary on, and found that there were so many hidden/subtle things in the game that I never even noticed the first two times playing it, and that really make this a true triple-A experience.

No longer are you left doging bullets and grenades from everywhere scrambling to find a weapon and ammo becuase you decked yourself out for hacking, stealth, and/or non-leathal. If you are keen enough to go around the boss rooms, you'll find areas that can help you defeat the boss regardless of how you upgrade yourself or what weapons you have on you.  Gameplay wise, The Missing Link DLC was seamlessly integrated into the flow of the game. Story wise it kind of fit in very loosely.   Maybe what Quinn and Page(?) were talking about at the end alludes to a sequel?   It is sort of daughting to suddenly not have everything you collected (including praxis upgrades) at your disposal, but it does present a certain challenge. There's even an achievement for getting through the entire DLC portion with only your 'armour' and what you collect through out rhe level and use no praxis upgrades. But when you complete the Missing Link, you ultimately get everything you had before you were KO'd and strapped in plus what ever you collected in the level.   The New Game+ option after completeing the game once overall is probably my favorite addition. When playing though the story a second time through the vanilla Human Revolution, I kept wishing in the back of my mind I had more augements and how that would affect how I would approach a certain part of the game. Now I don't have to! New Game+ carries over all the augmentations you aquired through your first playthrough, eventually gaining enough Praxis to max out everything.

I liked the whole idea of the game. With a story that could draw you in if you pay attention not only to the main detail but the background info too. And settings that when you look over into the background where you can't go, you can just feel as if something is really going on back in that area. This game has done a great job at being immersive and fun.   The good things about this game are plentyful  Side quests (They tend to change how everything goes and gives you more information plus rewards.)  The voice acting is actually pretty good, it also echos when you're in an area that calls for it.  Immersive game (I basically already said it, the settings, sounds, and the way people act,)   Free roam in the settings you go to (Such as in Detroit you can go through out most of the downtown district and even   inside buildings and apartment complexes and such.)   Stealth (This is one of the games that allows you to choose if you want to be loud, or be a literal ghost,)  Take downs (You can choose to be lethal which is also noisy, or non-lethal and silent.)  Upgrading (Both weapons and your augments can be upgraded to help and make you more of a badass)  Personality (This is one that most people don't realize is that you can make Jensen's personality. you could be a caring soft guy that helps everyone, or a cold unattached ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that just wants to get work done, or even a sarcastic not-caring personality, or even a silver tounged cheat and everything inbetween. Though Jensen has some personality traits that define him that you can't change. Such as how he has a soft spot for women in distress.)  Things you do effect you (If you help or don't help a stranger, that effects the story or little side story in some way. And some have benefits, and some hurt you.)    I didn't ask for this. (Adam's explination for everything.)   The Bad  Voice acting syncing (Most of the time when someone's speaking they may not sync up. Like for example 'Some one is walking away or shaking their head while you're talking to them, then it just cuts to them doing something else in mid conversation.)   Cover (The cover isn't all really that good. When you aim, unless you have a sniper or tranq gun, you most of the time have to guess if you're aiming at the target, or next to him.)   Take down stealth (You could knock out someone right next to his buddy, and as long as he didn't look your way you're good.)   Glitches (This is the director's cut version, so all the patched glitches are back, such as one where an enemy is stuck above the roof so you can't finish the game.)  This game even with its flaws, is still really good. I beat it 4 times fully one the xbox 360 and i'm working on my first playthrough, i'm going for ghost and foxiest of hounds achievement. But I would recommend this game to anyone.   10/10 would augment again",

            "review_text": "This was my second playthrough of Deus Ex: HR. It was just as entertaining as the first one.  There's a lot of bad ratings for this game and I don't know why. Haven't encountered any bugs, crashes or anything like that to merit a negative rating.  What struck me most during my second playthrough is how actually average the game looks. I know graphics are not the only factor in a game but it always helps when it looks good. It's a game from 2011 and it hasn't aged well. I'm currently playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky and even though it's a game from 2008 it looks way better - higher resolution textures, better lighting effects and so on.  Story wise it's an ok game. If you like conspiracies and stuff, you'll like the plot of the game. If you don't, well it's still enjoyable and engaging.  The strength of the game lays in how it reacts to your choices. It's not just some key moments in the game like dialogs and stuff. The way you augment your character will have a huge impact on how you can approach/reach your goals. Same goes for your equipment and how you choose to upgrade it. Everything has a bigger or smaller impact on gameplay. Sure there are lots of games with skill trees, abilities, guns and such, but Deus Ex HR is designed in a way that makes you feel your choices leading you on a certain path. If you augment your hacking skills you'll be able to bypass security easily without detection. If you get cloak, you can sneak into heavily patroled areas. If you don't, you'll have to figure out another way or go guns blazing. With each decision the game locks some doors and opens others. That is why it has replay value as you can test different kinds of approaches, different augmentations etc.  It's a fun game worth trying. Even if you don't like the plot, there's still a solid FPS game in there. You can stealth it or go berserk. How you play is your choice.",

            "review_text": "For me, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a lot like Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, only aged much much better. A strong story, moral choices that really only matter to you, having to watch what you say and see how they affect others without an easy way out (i.e. Mass Effect Paragon/Renegade options/interrupts), and solid sneak/gun-and-gun gameplay. Though for whatever reason menus are bugged and will often have you making split second wrong choices because your cursor and the buttons don't play together well. Director's Cut adds the two DLC missions to the mix and incorporates it into the story, for better or for worse. Personally I strongly disliked The Missing Link (felt much more linear and repetitve) and having to be forced to play through it certainly was obnoxious, Tong's Mission is incredibly simple as well. Still, it's a damn fine game that you can spend 20+ hours getting though and it comes easily recommended, though I don't think New Game + will be that much fun sadly.  Also I got the Pacifist achievement, I know it doesn't show up so I didn't officially achieve it but I played way too damn hard to have some action I had no control over invalidate the run for me. I wish there was a stats count or something. But again, the game's noticibly buggy in places. So from one pacifist to another, MANUALLY SAVE before you start hoping around the last level and save often. Or just don't even bother with the damn achievement. It's a lot more fun to shotgun and blow things up anyways. Takedowns get a little boring after a while.",

            "review_text": "Very good game for mixed playthroughs, compared to the original game directors cut makes it a lot more smooth as in the dlc is implemented, instead of getting 10k credits and a sniper and shotgun you have to find them in the first level, and the missing link campaign is not a seperate playthrough or game it is actually inside the story. Depending on the way you think stealth is in real life, you could think its accurate or not, turning a corner into somebody instanly turns people to the third phase (hostile) and peeking out while not in cover instantly goes to the second state (alarmed.) And noises are very sensitive.   Of course augmentations can solve these problems such as silent running and cloak. Onto other things a recent glitch came out with white screen flashes, people say its nividias new drivers and turning down brightness makes it flash less, but that might just be nividia. Players also have problems with scene triggers SPOILERS for example sandovals scene depends if you convince taggart or you hack his computer, convince taggart, sandoval tries to suicide and if you dont he trys to kill you when you enter his office. The glitch is if you hack taggarts computer but then reload since you dont want to frame him you will still get a hostile sandoval to do this you have to completley reload before you entered the building. This glitch is game breaking as one of the best elements of the game is the persausive conversations and detailed cutscenes, intead of the in-depth trying to save a man from suicide you get 'GUNSHOTS SEND SOME HELP' and he attempts to kill you (Not In the cut scene).  PROS -great cutscenes and interactive speeches -great and rpg experience with skills (augmentations) and custimizable weapons -good balance between playstyles (stealth,loud, and others) -lots of unique uses of the game elements (cloaking threw laser systems, slow falling threw elevator shafts, and so on)  CONS -possibly more glitches (not to many ive seen) -ai can be sometimes clunky (not going threw doorways or broken walls) ",

You can even take on a real challenge and leave (almost) everyone still breathing. Conversations with NPCs take varying paths and the things you say can shape your next move. In all, a strong entry in the Deus Ex universe. If I have one complaint it's that the game can develop very bad lag in certain places. Deus Ex games always seems to have lag problems around fires and this one is no exception. As a final note, your best bet is to disable DirectX 11 right from the start.

The boss battles are not at all good, they are very uninteresting and quite easy. You just go and shoot the boss. None of the enemies seem different. They all really seem the same, except for the robots  The RPG elements are great. It has an interesting story that you just want to find more about. The world has some side missions that can be very fun and rewarding as you will get more XP, credits, and gun upgrades. It is fun to hack a robot or turrent with your hacking augmentation and set it against the enemy.  The world is filled with weapon upgrades to find and secreat areas. Each level can be fun because of the way you go through it. I really like the open world-ish places. Each place you can freely explore looking for more praxis kits and weapon upgrades. There are a good amount of weapons, but i found myself ignoring many of them, instead settling for a pistol, stun gun, and shotgun. Some of the coolest weapons have very little ammo and are only found in one place in the game. The game rewards exploration with more credits, weapon upgrades, and praxis kits.   The game lasts a long time as you slowly uncover a much larger story then what you originally expected. The cutscenes are amazing, and same with the voice acting. The loading screens are extremely long and boring. The multiple endings felt a bit too similar to eachother, and were a huge letdown.    I love the fact that there is no right way to go through a level, as you can do them how you want. The story is also very good. The cutscenes are amazing, and so is the voice acting. Each area was big and open and you are free to explore them. but the boss battles are not very creative and uninspired. And some of your decisions have no difference in the end.

Gameplay offered the choice of guns blazing or merciful saint, I often found myself trying not to spill blood...which ended in me unloading a hail of gunfire.

What I don't love about this game:  Boss fights...they've been cleaned up in the Director's Cut, but they're still not great. They feel like an afterthought to an otherwise immensely well thought-out game. Apparently the boss fights were outsourced to a different company, but that's just not a good excuse for a AAA title like Human Revolution.   Square Enix really hit the nail on the head with this game.

            "review_text": "This review may contain spoilerish stuff, though my goal is to be more general.  I started out with this game working its way into my head as one of my favorite games of all time. I also started with the Director's Cut version and I didn't know that there was a DLC pack stuck into the story halfway through. And honestly, it wasn't until researching it later that I realized that to be the case. The story integration of the DLC is flawless.   However, the gameplay integration nearly caused me to ragequit the game and seriously marred what was otherwise one of the best game experiences I've had in years. The hard reset of gear and upgrades until you're through with the DLC mission is, in a word, jarring. And the gameplay itself, while mildly entertaining, gets seriously repetitive (the level design had me going back and forth through the same long areas several times, dodging the same guards each time because I was playing with more of a focus on stealth at that point... plus it was harder to be combative at all due to the reset).  Finishing the DLC mission was similar to the feeling I get stepping inside my home after a long trip with even longer car rides. By that point, I was exhausted and just wanted to get back to the gameplay that I had grown to love and built upon with the upgrades I'd obtained in part through doing every side mission I could find.  I'm on my second playthrough of the game now, using New Game+, because the base game is that good. But I'm dreading the moment when I hit the DLC mission, especially having nearly every upgrade in the game this go around, due to the retention of New Game+. The jarring loss of every upgrade I've earned will hurt even more this time.   There isn't much critical I can say about the base game. If I rated it independent of the integrated DLC pack, I would give it a fanboy's joyful 10/10.   If I rate it with the DLC, it's closer to a 7/10.   And the DLC pack on its own, I'd rate as more like a 5/10. To reiterate, the story aspect of the DLC pack was very enjoyable for me. Just about everything else was trash, when stacked up to the quality of the base game. The only moments I particularly remember enjoying from the pack were A) the boss fight and B) the conversation at the end. And the boss fight I mainly enjoyed because it was refreshingly easy, after a painstaking gameplay experience during the rest of the DLC.  In summary: In the future, please reconsider shoving in DLC, if it means a jarring gameplay shift. The gameplay choices may have made for a cool story tool, but what shocked me was that in virtually every other aspect of the game, gameplay took priority over story. It makes more sense now, knowing that it was originally DLC. Please don't integrate in such a way in the next title. Or, if you do, at least place the retrieval of lost gear and upgrades near the beginning, rather than at the end. I think of KotOR back in the day; it had a mission where you lose your gear temporarily, but the period during which you don't have it is brief and you do most of the mission with your gear back. You can still have your story moment and be much nicer.",

My personal favorite touches include the fact that if you read through npc's emails you see that they recieve and react to spam mail, and that if you muck around in the womens toilets, you get called out for it by other characters. I mean, what? I never did that.  If you've played the other Deus Ex games, you'll notice some similarities in overall game layout and plot development, I took that as a nod to the old and appreciated it, however it in no way impeded my gaming experience. To reassure potential new players, no prior knowledge of the series is required.   The best thing about the gameplay is the stealth/cover mechanic. I wish that more games put as much effort into their stealth mechanic as the designers of DEHR did. With regard to system functionality; at first I encountered multiple bugs, in short, issues with functionality on Windows 8.1 (other 8.1 users, solution was a google search away, easy reg edit), but once they were fixed the game ran smoothly.

The integration of the DLC is all good, no problems here and I like that Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut toned down the yellow filter that was all over Deus Ex: Human Revolution, however, this is a matter of preference, some think that the yellow filter is what made the games graphics stand out and some just prefer the more natural lighting.  The problems start to arrive when experiencing the performance issues that plauge DE:HR DC, it simply does not run as well as the original release did, I get framerate drops on places that ran smooth as silk in DE:HR, most notably in Detroit and Hengsha. The game has gotten one patch that fixed some of the problems but there's obviously still a lot left to do, and there's no second patch in sight...  Despite this problem I still recommend the game because it's the only one in quite some time that has been able to draw me in like this, if you can live with some performance issues, get DE:HR DC, if you can't try finding a box version of the original release.",

            "review_text": "Deus Ex Human Revolution plays out in a cyberpunk future where humanity is conflicted by the ramifications of augmentation technology; integration of cybernetic hardware into the human body, capable of enhancing virtually anyone's abilities to superhuman levels. The scope and extent of such modifications, providing fuel for transhumanist aspirations, is contrasted with caution against its possible dangers raised by concerned parties. This sets the scene for the major conflicts in Deus Ex's world, and the game puts you in the middle of it as protagonist Adam Jensen, who gets involuntarily augmented, and thus must come to terms with augmentation technology both on the personal level, but also on his mission as an agent for one of the world's major augmentation technology developers to uncover a plot against them, which is gradually unraveled to be much grander in scope and threat. This approach however is somewhat liable to make the player biased in favor of augmentation, and I don't feel that anti-augmentation concerns are very believable or persuasively portrayed. The story begins well off, but soon looses steam and coherence, leaving you wanting for more convincing motivations for the game to direct you to the next goal. At one point Adam aptly (and unintentionally ironic) remarks “that doesn't make any sense”, which was just what I was thinking at that point, but you're not allowed to raise questions and must blindly rush towards the next plot point, sometimes making Adam feel a bit stupid as a character (his behavior during certain cut scenes is also highly questionable in that regard). The plot is compelling enough, but I just wished it had been better paced and accomplished a bit more before having to spill all the beans only just before the very end. The ending itself I felt was unsatisfactory, feeling vague and a bit rushed. The end level is also inappropriately easy compared to how powerful your character is likely to be at that point, and considering it's supposed have a horror feel to it (mentioned in commentary track) totally takes the air out of that balloon.  The dialogue is sharply written and well acted. The game has several so-called “social boss fights”, where you must choose the must appropriate responses in a semi-randomized dialogue to persuade your opponent. These are generally more interesting because how well-acted they are compared to the traditional boss fights, which have already been much criticized. The bulk of the gameplay consists of 3rd person stealth action and cover based shooting, but the player can choose between (or combine) many different approaches based on character customizations, specializing in stealth, hacking, shooting etc. by buying augmentation upgrades upon leveling up. You also choose between killing enemies, knocking them unconscious or completely avoiding them. Unfortunately the game incentivizes certain play-styles over others (favoring non-lethal, stealthy, hacking) by awarding different amount of XP. This can compel players to hack all computers and explore all air vents to maximize XP gain. The upgrades are also too widely varying in utility. The hacking minigame is fun enough, but I don't think the contents of the emails you can access through this is very interesting to read generally, and there's so much of it (but you don't have to go through them). The graphical fidelity is fairly mediocre but is much helped by excellent art direction and attention to detail, which I would almost always favor above more polygons and better FX and shaders.  The Director's Cut edition integrates the Missing Link DLC into the main story adding some 3-4 hours to the game. It's a good quality DLC but puts a bump in the game's difficulty curve – suddenly more difficulty and when you're back on the original track it's suddenly way too easy. The DLC content also has a different (higher) level of polish to it, which you feel when you finish it and return to the regular game content. Additionally the Director's Cut comes with a commentary track (not enabled by default btw) for those so interested. It provides insights into the iterative process of game design and is worth listening to if you already have played through the game. It also provides the bonus mission and extra weapons DLC. And for the record: I cannot compare it to the originals because I never played them.   Strong points  Cool cyberpunk universe with great atmosphere Offers multiple approaches to obstacles Great art direction with environments rich in detail Well acted dialogue Spans across multiple compelling themes   Weak points  Boss battles forces you into combat Plot could have been better paced and structured Some augmentations are basically worthless Endgame is too easy and story ends on a flat note Game rewards certain play-styles higher but promises “free choice”   Grade B+  Overall I found the game very enjoyable and fun, but there's several missed opportunities which drags it a bit down.",

            "review_text": "If I buy a game, I'll almost always complete it. So I'm thankful I jumped in and bought Deus Ex, otherwise I would never have seen the greatness it (eventually) has to offer. Had I been able to play the first hour or so, I would probably have resolved never to play the whole game, clunky as it was. The gameplay, graphics and writing seem very slipshod at first, but gradually more and more moments of greatness piled up until I realised the truth: I love this game.   Does it feel dated for a 2011 release? Yes it does, and mostly in good ways. Deus Ex reminded me of the feeling of playing games like Half Life and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory for the first time, and I realised how much I'd missed those games. It's not just a nostalgia trip either. There is sophistication here that I haven't seen performed so well anywhere else. There's a moment where your character, Adam, and another major character appear to part ways permanently, and in any other game that would simply be the way the story goes; no matter how hard you'd fight, [x] minutes into a major battle you'd get [event y] and nothing about how you fought it could change that. Not in Deus Ex, however; you really can alter that course. When a go-between tells you that you've got a hard choice between saving the scientist who'll be your star witness in a prosecution case or saving the lives of dozens of other people, but you can't save both... in any other game you'd assume that this is a strictly A or B situation. Deus Ex will surprise you when you discover there really is a third way. The results of your earlier actions carry really nicely from the past to the future, sometimes in small ways such as the script and sometimes to a much more significant degree. You will not see my game, and I did not see yours.  So, yes, it was 2011 and yet that low-res skybox does appear to be a 16-colour bitmap. Yeah, the animations often look like something from ten years ago. No, your enemies cannot climb ladders or follow you into the vents. But so what, when it does so many things brilliantly? I took 43 hours to beat this game ONCE, partly as a result of hunting all the little secrets and also because I found so many things to do that are fun but slow. The first time I unlocked the ability to hack security turrets to make them hunt guards, I carried that thing around with me for the rest of the mission. Later on, I'd be punching a hole through the wall of my enemies' HQ, dumping a hacked turret in their reception area, and walking out nonchalantly through the hole I'd made while bullets and screams echoed behind me and achievements for great marksmanship flashed up on the screen. Wonderful.",

            "review_text": "I have to recommend this for fans of the orignal; it really worked in terms of capturing the spirit the well-loved Deus Ex had... the multiple solutions to most given problems, be it smarts, stealth or brute force you decide to favour. I found the world to be an interesting one, feeling more lived-in and less sterile than the original, with characters that I empathised with and I thought 'yes, I care what happens to these people.'... which I think is something few games try and succeed in doing these days. The skill system and weapons upgrades give you many rewards to work towards alongside the actual mission golas- to me creating a drive to play more and never letting me get bored. Visually appealing areas, satisfying weapons and a cover system that is useful but by no means feels mandatory.  My only real gripe- and it is a small one- is the NPC's being highly judgemental about you using lethal force; the game already penalises you for this in terms of reduced XP for lethal takedowns and kills; it irked me somewhat that you also sometimes get 'told off' though that said, it makes them seem more human I suppose. I just felt in a game series that says here are porblems, solve as you like, it felt a little out of place.   That said? An incredible game, above and beyond any FPS I've played in a long time, a breath of fresh air among the bland CoD and MoH stuff we see trotted out yearly. A worthy prequel that rightly takes its place alongside one of the best PC titles of all time in my opinion.

With the Director's Cut, you get the Missing Link DLC integrated right into the game, and you also get NG+ which allows you to carry over your character with PRAXIS upgrades into a second playthrough. I found myself at numerous points quicksaving and trying something else just to see the different outcomes. If there's a downside here, I'd say that the story itself doesn't resolve itself in a way I found satisfactory, and I really felt that the ending(s) were forced.

The first time I did the mission, I sneaked into some sewers nearby and hacked a computer panel that opened a door into the station; the second time, I just walked in and did a persuasion mini-game to convince the security doorman to let me in. The level design's also pretty good and really rewards exploration. The missions are linear in the sense that you have to get from Point A to Point B, but there are multiple routes to Point B, each with computers to hack and rooms full of goodies like ammo and candy bars. However, the game does become really easy towards the end even on the highest difficulty setting, as you'll easily be able to obtain almost all the augmentation upgrades by the end of the game. As such, it starts to become less 'take the route that works for you' and more 'take one route, then go back to explore all the others for ammo and candy bars.' Overall, pretty fun game.

            "review_text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a combination of everything that is good about videogame storytelling. It displays extraordinary depth, meaningful choices, and most of all, only the bare minimum of exposition.  As a game, it's not perfect. It's severely held back by its engine, which looks dated even for 2011. Limitations in its mechanical capabilities often prevented the dev team from implementing their vision. The controls are every so slightly awkward, especially the cover system and item management controls. The game mechanics have their share of imperfections as well, such as the stamina system which is strangely divided between energy and breath, and the very limited opportunities that you will get to use the long-range weapons in the game.  Time and budget constraints caused major parts of the storyline and setting to be cut. We only got one of them back, in the form of the Missing Link DLC, now seamlessly integrated into this Director's Cut release.  But the juice of the game is in the setting, the backstory, the characters, the art style and the music. And now, with Director's Cut, you can add hours and hours of developer commentary to that list.  Much like the original 2011 release, the DX:HR Director's Cut release had issues on launch. Bugs related to performance, texturing, audio, and game crashes were widely reported across different PC configurations. These problems were patched by Eidos Montreal, and at least for me, the game now runs well. Terrible mouse lag was also present on Windows 8.1 machines, but Microsoft fixed this problem with the KB2908279 update, downloadable from their website.  The value of your Director's Cut purchase will be in the commentary track. The gameplay improvements are concentrated in very specific areas, not worth the purchase price. The graphical improvements are arguably a half-step backwards, since the new release tones down the distinctive yellow hue of the original, leaving the rest of the graphics engine largely untouched.  Nitpicks aside, make no mistake: the immersive nature of DX:HR makes it a must-have. It's so cheap there's no reason not to make the purchase.",

In addition to placing the Missing Link chapter in proper continuity, it makes improvements to the boss fights and smooths out a few rough edges in the graphics. And, for those of you who already own the original game and/or the Missing Link, you get a nice discount. I like seeing companies continuing to support their games and make them better, and offering a modest bargain for those who have already purchased the game is a nice gesture.  The Director's Cut retained everything I enjoyed, beefed up the overall game, and was at least partially successful at improving the notorious boss fights. It's worth it if you feel like giving the game another run, or want to pick it up for the first time.",

            "review_text": "I've been holding onto this one for about two years before I actually decided to sit down an play the darn thing. Holy cow, why did I delay?   While Bioshock Infinite still holds my place for the best story that I've gone through in a game this year, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, were it released this year, would be a very close second. And in terms of the actual gameplay, this one *blows* out Bioshock Infinite (and any other first-person shooters I've played recently).   The great thing about the gameplay is the multitude of choices on how to approach different scenarios. Want to punch through a wall to access a room? How about hacking a keypad to access it? Or maybe you want to access it via a hidden duct system? All can be done.   Or, how do you approach enemies? Want to do it guns ablazing? Check. Or silently sneak behind each one and take them down? Check.   How to get down a ladder? Climb down it? Okay, or you could enhance your abilities to just fall/jump down without taking any damage.   And yes, the story, as mentioned before, is great. If you've played any of the Mass Effect series, the conversations take place with the same type of interface and allow you to make choices that do affect the outcome. The variances in story, admitedly, aren't as wide as what Bioware might provide, for example, and you don't have the ability as much to affect your relationships with others. But nevertheless, you do get a sense that you are in control to some degree. And with a game like this, that's enough.  The graphics are solid but are nothing to write home about (compared to, say, Battlefield 3). Frame rates were smooth but I have a pretty beefy rig so I can't say how it will perform with a relatively older machine.  Voice acting is solid as well, although I confess that the actor that portrayed Jensen (the main character) sounded a little too much like Clint Eastwood. Also, it sounded as if he were recorded in a different studio than the other actors; you can notice a difference in overall 'volume/tone' between characters when conversations take place. Not a deal breaker, of course.  The music is fantastic; it's very much in the style of what you would hear with Daft Punk's score for Tron Legacy but even a little more nuanced. Very well done. In many games, I get tired of the tracks that repeat over and over again as you explore - *ahem Assassin's Creed Revelations ahem* - but I can't that say that for this game.   I have only one legitimate complaint - it's the inventory system. For OCD'ish people like me, the inability for the game to do an 'automatic rearranging' of your items in a way that *I* would like drove me nuts. You can manually rearrange the inventory but geez, it's a lot of work to get it just right. I guess this is more my problem than the games' problem. :-)  Anyway, 9/10 without question. A must play - get it ASAP if you haven't.     ",

When it came out, it looked great and I really wanted to play it, but now having beaten it, I can't help but leave a bit disappointed. This is an okay game, but I'm struggling to see what merits the crazy acclaim it has gotten. Don't get me wrong, this game is kind of solid and somwhat enjoyable at times, but, in my opinion, the metacritic is quite high for this game. Graphically, this game look dated, older than it really is. Models look pretty bad for the most part, and it does not look as sharp as I imagined this game would. Gameplay is alright throughout, although hacking is more of gimmick and doesn't always seem to reward you appropriately at times (some times you just get side information via the emails, which are time consuming to read and boring in my opinion). There's a bit of open worldedness to the game at parts which is nice, and there are a number of side quests to find that are generally not that interesting. Gunplay feels pretty lackluster but there are a number of choices of weapons (although your inventory will severely limit the number you can carry and ammo, so choose wisely). I thought that ammo was kind of scarce at times when it shouldn't have been, and the inclusion of ammo as a spot in the inventory really made managing the inventory space more difficult than it needed to be at times. The choice of some buttons for the gamepad is a bit odd, but no major qualms there. Storywise I did not find it captivating until the very end, and the use of the word captivating there is a bit of an overstatement. The message is clear: advancing technology too much is bad, to put it into plain terms. While I agree with this sentiment, it was fairly predicable that this would be the outcome and I probably would have enjoyed this more in my teen years, but I've seen the same thing done elsewhere and done better. Voice acting is nothing special, and Jensen isn't that fun to listen to since he's monotoned almost all game. Overall, while I didn't enjoy this game as much as the hype excited me, its not a terrible game by any means, but its just not worthy of the acclaim. Most people will probably enjoy this game, and I can't really say the same. 5/10",

I've heard a lot of good things about the series as a whole (or at least the original and this one, Invisible War was another story) so I figured I'd give it a shot. The developers did a good job setting the tone of the game between the established world, characters and style. The golden hue the game has (prior to the Director's Cut release) gave the game a strange sense of personality, I actually like that so when I started playing the Director's Cut I was a little saddened by this missing element.  The RPG elements found in Human Revolution primarily revolve around enhancing Jensen's augmentations, allow him to be stronger, faster, become invisible or even drop from the roof of a ten story building and land softly. Upgrading these augmentations come in two forms, through experience gained by doing quests, taking out enemies and by being as sneaky as possible. The second form is through Praxis kits, some of which can be found, others are rewards while some you can buy. How a player progresses through the game is up to them. The game doesn't force players into being a killing machine nor does it force stealth (however prior to the Director's Cut, the boss fights kind of pushed the straight up fight approach, but the stages were redesigned to allow more options), so you're free to choose how you want to go through the game. Players are also given the option between lethal and non-lethal. The non-lethal approach tends to be a bit more fun since just about every game out there already does lethal.  The Director's Cut (which is the only version Steam offers) has some issues though, last played (by the time you read this maybe it's changed) a few graphic options didn't work as they were suppose to, Smart Glass support wasn't functioning right and I even noticed some reflection's not have their textures come up, just random patterns that looked like bad data. The developers are suppose to be working on it, but still waiting for things to get sorted. On the plus side though, The Missing Link DLC is integrated into the game for a more seamless transition, revamped the boss stages, added in a few new gadgets as well as new game plus, which was a major complaint before since you always had to invest your points in a certain fashion if you want to take advantage of certain approaches.  If you were a huge fan of the original Deus Ex, you may have some complaints about Human Revolution as some aspects were removed, but that doesn't mean the game was bad, just a difference in generations, so it's still worth checking out.",

The game falls short in the tedious boss fights and unbalanced XP gaining system, but those are but minor quirks, like a faint cough from the audience in a Maria Callas recording.  The soundtrack is also one of the best in years, and I can't wait to see future soundtracks made by Michael McCann. Music is something that can fill in for lacking storytelling or gameplay, but in this game, it perfectly supplements the somewhat dystopian feeling of the world in the year 2027.",

However, after getting into the game and playing a few hours i started getting frustrated. The game seems to pretty much force stealth gameplay which I do not care for, not that i dont like stealth it has its place but not using stealth or even being seen seems to almost instantly result in death and if theres one thing that can turn me away from a game its forced stealth. I want to like this game but i just cant get into the playstyle its just too unforgiving (thats coming from a Hardcore Darksouls I and II player), i have many hours in Assassins creed and ive played games like dishonored and those give you options if your spotted or let you atleast try to escape or do something other than taking 1-2 hits resulting in death. Would I recommend this game? If you are a fan of mainly Stealth only combat and are willing to put up with a mistake often costing you to start over then yes.

I remember seeing something about Human Revolution ages ago but the first person/third person dynamic seemed weird to me so I never bothered.  Turns out this title went on sale with the announcement of Mankind Divided so I figured why not...  You know your money is well spent when you spend 7 hours playing a game and you haven't even beaten the second main mission. In terms of quests and content, this reminds me of the Witcher 3's system where most of the sidequests worth doing actually have some kind of impact on the narrative and stem directly from the main storyline. Granted, I didn't feel like there was a point behind doing any of the sidequests, the rewards are kind of skimpy, but they were actually interesting and fleshed out enough for me not to care about rewards.  This is a very stealth heavy game, unless you are able to max out your arm implants early on I don't particurlalry see the appeal in going loud the entire way through. I heard about the pacifist achievement, and up until the return to China with Malik I was doing pretty good...  So far I haven't beaten it, though Im pretty sure I am at endgame. I will probably end up at 20 hours by the end of it all, which for the less than $10 I spent for this is pretty stellar. Makes me quite hyped to see what Mankind Divided will be like.  If I had to pick one thing out of this entire game to gush at, oddly enough it would be the ragdoll physics. Games like Assassins Creed will have you brutally murder someone with 6 different movies and normally they should go flying or immediately fall off a ledge, but there is always a pause before they go out of the animation to then ragdoll. Human Revolution, you deck a guy in the face and he immediately flies into a wall. Really dont know why, but I just found it really appealing.  I would recommend. Conspiracy narrative, main character is a badass (good or bad pending on your jackhole whims), and the dialogue is pretty extensive to the point where what you say can drastically alter a situation from walking away or murdering everyone in the room.",

            "review_text": "It's a fun game with a well-developed storyline and packed with a dystopian, creepy atmosphere of crime and secrets. I played the first Deus Ex game and absolutely loved it, although by today's standards that game is kind of a lackluster game (crappy graphics, dumb NPCs and whatnot).  If you've never played a Deus Ex game before, they play similar to Metal Gear Solid but with a different atmosphere and different plots/locations (however from a primarily 1st-person perspective).  However, this game is really neat, but it's also full of bugs, and has a good deal of gameplay/design issues. However, most of these issues almost completely disappear from gameplay for some reason by the time you get about halfway done with the game, so that's a plus.  . 1) Sometimes your left-click ability will break for all menus in the game; this makes it impossible to save your progress any further and so you have to exit the entire game and restart it in order to fix it, until it happens again. . 2) You are limited to only 100 save file slots. This can be extremely annoying if you are someone like me who prefers to save frequently. For comparison, I have over 1,800 save files on Skyrim. I ran out of slots to save my game in by the time I got to the 1st boss fight (not gonna say what the boss is for those who havent played yet). . 3) Sometimes the HUD will be slid all the way across the screen from the corner, making it impossible to see any of your vital information you need to see. This is a huge graphical problem and can only be fixed by restarting the game. . 4) When you are visibly armed in public areas, most of the dialogue from people when they tell you 'please put the weapon away', etc. is severely muffled and low-quality, in contrast to all other dialogue in the game. Some sort of audio bug I guess. . 5) The brightness setting/slider in the video options is broken, it doesn't work and you can't change the brightness of the game as a result. I've confirmed that my friends who also play this game have the same problem. . 6) Some map parts are not designed well, and as a result, you can see wall parts that clip through each other, or wall parts that expose 'the void' (the empty space of nothingness outside the map). . 7) When dragging bodies around the corner of a room, half the time they will clip through the corner of the floor and disappear into nowhere. Some real half-♥♥♥♥♥ collision work there. . 8) Emitters/effects from explosions clip through cielings and can be seen from the floor above. . 9) Half the textures on objects and in the environment are very low-quality, almost same LoD as most textures were from the first Deus Ex game from (now) 15 years ago. The only difference is that the new textures in this game have normal maps applied to them. . 10) You cannot carry multiple guns of the same type (eg. carrying two combat rifles at the same time). This can be frustrating if you've got a lot of loot to grab and want to resell it, because if you try to pick up other guns of the same type if you've already picked up one, it just grabs the ammo from that extra gun and removes that extra gun entirely. . 11) The levels that take place in China and other non-American places have a lot of racial stereotypes forced into the portrayals of the people that live in these areas.  I'm not one to care much about political correction, but you'd think that the Deus Ex team would've figured out by now, after a decade, that it's not okay to portray entire races this way in video games. . 12) The game is quite easy to beat even on the highest difficulty. There is not much challenge involved, it's mostly just a matter of waiting for the NPCs to do something stupid so you can take them down with a quick shot in the head, hide the body, then repeat with all the other NPCs until there are no enemies between you and your objective. That's not my idea of a challenge. The boss fights are the only parts of the game that are actually difficult. . 13) The mouse cursor is offset upwards from what it's actually meaning to point at; this can be frustrating when trying to play the hacking minigames because you will frequently accidentally use a nuke virus when you just wanted to capture a node, forcing you to reload your save file if you want to recover that accidentally-used virus. . 14) The environments in the game are, for the most part, extremely 'cookie-cutter' style, as in lots of parts, room designs and props are CONSTANTLY reused, like how it is on MMO's or games with procedurally generated environments (eg. Star Trek Online or SCP Containment Breach). To me this kind of shows a bit of laziness and lack of effort on the game developer's part, and it also makes exploration a lot less rewarding, because you know you're gonna generally find the same exact stuff everywhere you go. . 15) When you go to exit the game to desktop, the game just freezes as soon as you click 'yes', and won't unfreeze unless you deliberately end the game's processes via the windows task manager, or else wait until it registers as having crashed/not responding. . 16) Early on into my playthrough of the game, the firing sounds for the combat rifle broke and so I have a totally silent rifle that's not silent at all. It never went back to the way it originally was again. I have googled this issue and apparently it's a bug that was in the original console versions, and was well-known, yet Eidos did not fix it when they ported the game to PC. Lazy ♥♥♥ devs. GG . 17) The 'Talion A.D.' sidequest is annoyingly difficult to complete due to a lack of a normal game feature: the map marker. Once you get to the part of the quest where you're supposed to read the dead guard's pocket secretary, you can read it but you will not be given any more map markers after reading it, so you have NO idea where to go to complete the mission. It took me two hours of combing around Lower Heng-Sha to finally discover that the next step of the sidequest took place in a remote sewer area on the very edge of the map. Utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. . 18) There is a serious bug where for most of the Hengsha Dock level, it is impossible to save the game, seriously hindering progress. The save feature started working again for me after I completed the level. . 19) It's interesting how a Detroit police station, an abandoned old Chinese noodle factory, a military cargo ship, and a top-secret Illuminati facility all have the exact same kind and look of air duct systems. In a nutshell, all the air vents in the game look EXACTLY the same.  That said, this game was hounded over and developed meticulously by the hardworking staff at Eidos Montreal (this was their first game that they have ever made, being a new game studio), and though Deus Ex HR still has all these bugs, it's still pretty good, and pretty fun to play.  However, similar to the first Deus Ex game, Human Revolution suffers from a ridiculous/overpowering ending game segment. I like to think of this as the 'Gunbuster' effect: Start out with a plot that's understandable, reasonable and small, then start exponentially ramping it up until the point where it's no longer believable or is just obnoxious in its scale/implications/complexity.   The same stupid plot ideas about the Illuminati and god-like transcendence crap that ruined the original Deus Ex's plot are back again in this game, only this time in a fortunately more believable/understandable way. The Deus Ex franchise's theme is all about the effects and consequences of advanced technology on mankind, and they definitely did a better job of showing that in this game than they did on the first.  All in all, this game is still really good despite its flaws, and you should definitely get it.   One last note: Some like Angry Joe have said it's only got 20 hours worth of gameplay, but I can testify that I got over 80 out of it.",

Liked: - The number of gameplay choices you have as a player is great, there are many different ways to approach a mission and the skills you choose can create different experiences which may vary from your friends. - Initially I didn't like the visual style from the promo shots, but once I started playing I started to really like it. - The story is well done and the main character Adam Jenson is very likeable. Good voice acting too. - The soundtrack by Michael McCann is outstanding. - Visually the game is pretty impressive, some locations are beautiful.  Disliked: - Not much to dislike really!

The story is truly great, and much like the original Deus Ex, the trip to China is an unforgettable sci-fi experience. I played it in German this time, and the voice acting is still top-notch. Cyberpunk. Conspiracy. Politics. Betrayal. Awesome.  Unfortunately, the boss battles still suck. They have expanded the options in this cut, and as long as you have good hacking abilities you can at least hide and let turrets or robots kill the boss for you, but it's still incredibly jarring to suddenly be forced into fighting a guy who takes a bucket of grenades to kill when both the protagonist and every other character in the game gets wiped out from just one or two well-placed bullets. I really hope the developers leave this kind of oldskool shooter baggage behind in future sequels. Still, a fantastic, fantastic game. In my opinion, one of the best of all time.",

So I'm somewhat in the upper middle of it, so I tend more to a 'Yes', even when the game has some major flaws.  First of all for the ones who like their dessert first: The presentation of the game is without any doubt not good, but great. They put an insane amount of effort in it. The story evolves, the intro / cutscenes are extremely well done and superbly integrated in the game. I like the badass looking protagonist and the fact that every other character (on the streets etc) has something to say and that there are tons of magazines, books, notes and stuff to read and discover.  Overall, it just looks great and the conversations are superb. Characters of the story are very varying (in therms of looks and voices) and the voice acting is awesome. Especially Barrets's voice, holy hell, how freakin' amazing! The menu is really tidied up and the overalll graphics are good - in case I'm able to tell, because I have everything on 'low' settings. The HUD just looks sexy as hell and the music of the game is absolute BEAST and as good as it can probably get nowadays. In conversations and after some upskilling, the HUD evolves and looks even better.  Even on my old machine this game runs smoother than a smoothie (on the lowest settings), with no framerate drops whatsoever. So it's extremely well optimized.   As a horrible gamer, I did like the health regeneration. I also did like the easy leveling system with spending praxis points, even when I had the feeling as a non-stealth player I was not rewareded very well. After finishing the game I wasn't even close to be fully upgraded. Nevertheless, it's a great step forward from DX1 that a pistol can be actually lethal. In DX1 you would've needed to completely level up your pistol until you could land some headshots. But here this is gone and you just have to level up yourself. GREAT, thanks to that, folks. The cover system? Superb and I never had so. much. fun. using a cover system. Probably becaus it just effin works flawlessly. It's so unbelievable much fun with just an upgraded pistol, hiding behind a corner and giving headshots. Yay! Thanks also for being able to camouflage WHILE shooting. Most games disable your cloaking when you shot. Not here. Yeha.  Wallbreakers, takedowns and the Icarus landing system are sweeeeeet and enjoyable every single time they happen. I will never get tired of this. Ever! You can pause/skip cutscenes, too. Developers of other games, TAKE NOTES. I did like the Level (spoiler ahead) where you get captured, loose your praxis points and eventually get them back. So here you can re-assign them to different skills, which is nice if you plan to re-do your character. Nice idea! Only downside is you can't reassign the points you spent for hacking skills. Weapon models are extremely well done and I did like the reloading animation of every single weapon. Just looks too awesome. After all, it's the littl things, aye?  The only and major problem with this game is the fact it has its downsides because of the following reasons I'd like to mention here:  So Sarif Industries spent probably millions to repair the protagonist, gave him two cyborg arms and whatnot, augmentations here and there, implants and stuff. And even after that he's weaker than the average human. After only two or three shots from the weakest enemy in the game and you're dead. Further, your energy meter only has (at the start) two bars, which deplete FAST. One bar is needed to takedown an enemy via QTE. While this takedowns look stylish, it's style over substance. Every stealthy thief with a butter knife in his hand would be more effective than this.  Oh, and this highly trained, Ex-Swat and half-cyborg Jensen can sprint for no longer than three whole seconds. Are you guys serious? Somehow the hacking stuff got harder instead of easier and eventually bored the hell out of me. I had the feeling this game didn't like us rambos who just want to go berzerk on a level.  The sounds are sometimes really, really boring. Like grenades. Every popping popcorn makes a louder bang than these. I missed the blood. Because there isn't any or at least waaay to less. What a shame... I not spillin my drink in excitement.  I thought the inventory is extremely laggy. Not in terms of performance, but everything seems delayed. Not as good as someone wants it in a game very you spend most of the time in your inventory. As a horder, I absolutely did NOT like the fact that ammunition takes ridiculously HUGE amount of space in your inventory and can't be collected as in DX1. Meaning if your space runs out, you have to drop ammunation. Also, ammo isn't stacked, so if you have for example 51 bullets, you need 2 slots for 50 bullets and another double-slot for the 1 bullet. NOT. GOOD. Why not make this an optional thing for 'Give me Deus Ex' skill level?  There are just like ten weapons in the game. I found only two double barreled shotguns, some ammunation for the crossbow, but no crossbow. :/  Now for the WORST: The boss battles are uninspired as it can get and the worst of the whole gaming industry. Even in the Director's Cut. The first one against Barett was ok I guess and let you at least choose several paths (like stealthy or rambo), but the second boss fight against Yelena is. Boring. As. Hell. And the others, bulletsponges at best. And I wasn't able to finish her for a long time (That's what she said), because I was more like the sneaky guy with no big weapons until then. But here? Thank you, developers. Just put the player in front of the boss and hope for the best, aye? What about sneaky players or the ones who love to solve a fight with tactic and not simple shoot-on-sight-tactic? Yeah, screw them. Problem is you need to have a very specific set of Upgrades and weapons to easily beat this boss. I don't have the Typhoon system, not PEPS or any other big weapon or upgrade. So if you plan to play the stealth type: You probably won't be able to beat the game or at least you will have a hard time.  Everything seems to be forced. Yes, I know that I can deactivate the option that interactive objects like switches, doors are being highlighted. But that doesn't change the fact this game has more senseless cardboard boxes lying around than every Mario game combined has coins. And I'm sick and tired of stapling all those boxes just to climb a letter (which I could easily reach by a single jump). There is also no melee attack to simply destroy a box / window and overall it seems that levels are made of 30 percent cardboard boxes, like they were THAT important, or important at all.  The marker system is awful at best and you will absolutely have NO orientation or clue where to go to reach your goal in huge areas / cities. The horrible city / level design isn't helping there at all. When you have a running quest which involves two places you have to visit, both markers have the same colour. Further, the maps are extremely confusing and there is little to no help to reach your goal (only a marker which indicates how many meters you're away). So it happens often that you're heading towards the wrong marker because somewhere in the middle you mixed them up somehow. And like every RPG you have so much back- and forthtracking, which can be such a pain in the ♥♥♥ because of the confusing level design and terrible marker system.  This and so many other things are just, well, unneccesary. Also, the game features a city you can explore. But somehow I didn't feel at all like I was discovering a city. To narrow, nothing interesting to explore. It just feels like an huge ok level, not like a city.  So in conclusion, a recommendation can be made. The game has some absolutely awesome upsides, but unfortunately some major downsides.",

            "review_text": "A fantastic game despite its many issues. The writing is rock solid aside from the rushed ending and the stealth mechanics are a load of fun. The biggest critism I have of it is that the exp system is biased towards stealth runs so I recommend saving run and gun playthroughs for NG+.  If you bought the vanilla version before it was pulled. The main differences are  -The boss fights have been tweaked to be tolerable, you can now beat them via hacking/stealth as opposed to raw power. They aren't great but its certainly an improvement. -New game plus is introduced. You don't keep your items unfortunately but running through the game at max power once you've learned it in and out is always a blast. -It waas built on beta code for some stupid reason so its not as well optimized. This was patched up but I still get the odd hiccup that wasn't there before. -The missing Link is now intergrated into the main campaign. I'm personally not fond of this change as forcing you to play it every time throws the pacing off.",

            "review_text": "Having just finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's cut i thought it would be the perfect time to write a review on it!   Deus Ex is a first person shooter with third person elements and a strong stealth vibe. Throughout the game you make your way through non-linear but more open-ended missions with multiple paths other than the standard 'Run n Gun' style of most first person shooters out there. The third person section of the game is stricly when using cover, doing a stealth takedown and during cutscenes.  The Gameplay is very fun and fairly streamlined. While not as polished to perfection like some other firstperson shooters, it still was very playable and the mix of stealth and action was very well done. I especially liked the takedown animations. Which ranged from very stylized martial arts, to a very blunt and powerful punch right to the face. I personaly never got tired of watching the spit go flying out an unsuspecting Bad-Guys face after my powerful augmented fist meet his jaw.   The Story implements RPG like chracter progression and story plot choices. Which also helps add to the feeling that this is no ordinary shooter. The story follows a newly augmented Adam Jenson whom after being involved in a brutal attack must start an investigation for his boss. Of course many things are going on the Adam dosn't know about and discovers through the games missions. There are around 16 story missions to go through and a handful or two of side missions. The side missions actually are quite interesting and feel like a standard story mission due to general relevency and interesting objectives. I would strongly suggest any player to play as many side missions as they can and make sure to explore for that ammo or praxis kits!  The graphics are slighlty dated but if you have a modern PC of normal quality than you should not have many problems running this on the max settings. I personaly liked the art style but not everyone may be so inclined. On my gaming rig i was running this game mostly 60FPS. Although i noticed when i transitioned from a loading screen into another area, for about 2 seconds my framerate would drop to the 40's range. But that is still better than those X-Box 360 and Playstation 3 versions that are out there.  I really would suggest this game to almost any gamer who likes these styles of games: Shooter, Stealth, Action, Story-Driven, Interesting, etc.  I thought this was a great experience and totaly worth the 3.98$ i payed for it. If it is on sale i would very much so recomend it. Even if its not buy it! Its very good.",

The biggest critism I have of it is that the exp system is biased towards stealth runs so I recommend saving run and gun playthroughs for NG+.  If you bought the vanilla version before it was pulled. The main differences are  -The boss fights have been tweaked to be tolerable, you can now beat them via hacking/stealth as opposed to raw power. They aren't great but its certainly an improvement. -New game plus is introduced. You don't keep your items unfortunately but running through the game at max power once you've learned it in and out is always a blast. -It waas built on beta code for some stupid reason so its not as well optimized. This was patched up but I still get the odd hiccup that wasn't there before. -The missing Link is now intergrated into the main campaign. I'm personally not fond of this change as forcing you to play it every time throws the pacing off.",

            "review_text": "First off, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to the acclaimed Deus Ex and its sequel: Deus Ex Invicible War. If you don't know about Human Revolution, it takes place in 2027 where technology is really on a high bar where human augmentations are rising and growing. you play as Ex-Swat Adam Jensen working as a security director in Sarif Industries where it's suddenly attacked by a group of augmented terrotist.  Adam is nearly killed and undergoing a great deal of augmentations. now, you as Adam needs to adapt to augmentations and at the sam time needs to track down the people who attacked Sarif Industries and kidnapped your best friend and ex-girlfriend, Megan Reed.  i must say i never play Deus Ex before i play HR. Actually, i play the original Deus Ex several days before i play HR and i got stuck at the beginning, i didn't know what to do so i stopped playing it. then i pick up HR and gave it a try. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a wonderful story driven RPG/FPS/Stealth filled with immersing story, great characters, deep choices and enormous atmosphere. it literally tells of a theme of Transhumanism and gives questions about 'What makes a human become a human?' Human Revolution succesfully makes me fall in love with the series. its deep story really connects me and the gameplay is fun to play. an aspect of grinding level is quite good too. its only flaw is the boss battle. HR provides DIY gameplay style which encourages players to just play as they like, but in boss battles, players are forced to fight them lethally, which is kind of a shame and feels like a bit different direction.  Deus Ex: Human Revolution is still a great game and will make you finished the game with a lot of thoughts. Go on and play it 9/10",

            "review_text": "TL:DR A really enjoyable semi-open stealth game that gives you lots of options to complete you goals. Let down only slightly by the terrible boss fights.  Full version: Deus Ex HR has you playing as Adam Jensen, an ex-cop turned security officer for the augment company Sarif industries, who's girlfriend Megan is killed in a terrorist attack on the Sarif building. Jensen himself is badly injured but saved by Sarif who also augments him. He returns to work a few months later and begins investigating the attack which draws him into a deeper plot.  The gameplay is semi-open stealth focused with a lot of flexibility in how you want to complete your objectives. You can hack terminals to acquire info or passwords, hack locks to open doors, discover vents and alternative routes through levels and you have a variety of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Though the game tries to steer you towards non-lethal stealth via more exp you can absolutely loud and violent if you want. Conversations and convincing other characters also play a part as well.  The Directors Cut adds the DLC Missing Link into the main story, slightly improved boss fights and a new game plus mode that carries over your unlocked augs.  Good points: - Great stealth gameplay  - The wide variety of options you have to go about your tasks is refreshing and its just as fun finding your own path to complete a mission. - Has some great level design to the open hubs of Detroit and Hengsha and the various other compunds and buidlings you have to infiltrate. -The upgrade system is fantastic as you can unlock new augments are improve or add stuff to the ones you have, which opens up more options for you when tackling a level.  Bad points: - While they have been improved to make stealth more viable the boss fights still suck. Playing a non-lethal stealth? Well the game throws you into a small room with a powerful gun toting bullet sponge. The DC edition has more options in the boss fights for a stealth build now but they still suck. - The Missing Link DLC feels a bit shoehorned into the main campaign. As it was initially a seperate chapter you played, you lose all your upgrades and weapons at the start. Given you play it late in the storyline this is kind of annoying. It also has a lot of backtracking though it has its good moments. You do get all your upgrades back at the end as well as keeping the ones you earned in Missing Link so thats a bonus at least.",

The 'merge' of the base game and the expansion is pretty messy though - All your augs are gone at the start of the expansion mission and most of them are only refunded to you at the end of the mission as praxis points. I guess that's the best they can do since Missing Link is a stand alone expansion when it first launched... But still, pretty shabby.  Also, the alternative ways to take down bosses are just new areas with additional terminals to hack so you can activate some defence mechanism ie. turrets to take down the bosses. There's still no way to avoid killing them.  Would I recommend this game? Yes, as a whole it's still an amazing game to play after all these years.  But if you already have the base game and Missing Link... The Director's Cut offers nothing much. It should have come as a free update to those already owning them.",

When I first heard about this game through a list of reccomended games I first had quite a few doubts about it, thinking that it would be another typical, overly-cliched, military-based first person shooter game, but boy was I wrong! To start off, this game's sub-stories aren't set in stone like most other RPG's, as when you're on a quest you're constantly given some choices you have to make, all of which affect what happens later on in the game, which adds quite a bit of mystery that makes you eager to explore the game. On a topic tangent to the storyline, you have a wide variety of skills to choose from as you earn XP's, in which the skills you choose have a consequence on your gameplay experience, so depending on you that may be good or bad, mainly depending on if you decide to be naive with your choices. Furthermore this game doesn't feel too constrained in terms of it setting, seeing as how you're constantly moving around the globe from mission-to-mission. Lastly, this game has quite some great music to it. So ultimately, do I reccommend this game? In my opinion I definitely would to those who have a great sense of exploration and action.",

I like the story, you know it's that mature conspiracy-filled type of story. Gameplay, oh yummy yummy yum. Game lets you play stealthy or loudly. But you don't have to specialize in anything aside from stealth or loud type of gameplay. You can hack your way to room, then get there by jumping 2 meters high and then by unblocking the way. But still the game is amazing.  If you go for achievements don't worry that you didn't get that 50 hours long achievement, game is bugged a bit. Whom the ♥♥♥♥ idea was to make the bosses.
