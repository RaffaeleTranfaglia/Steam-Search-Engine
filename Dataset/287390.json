            "review_text": "I   completely   recommend playing Metro: 2033 Redux before playing or knowing anything of this game, otherwise you might be confused and lose important advancements in the previous game.   This game, or shall I say experience, is truly an unknown Gem. It is remarkable, and it is sad that it is not too well known. I didn't even know of its existence until it was on sale and steam recommended it to me, and I bought it due to the fact it reminded me of the Fallout series. This game is brilliant, as well as its predecessor Metro: 2033 Redux. They both leave you with an eerie feeling that sticks with you, sort of indescribable. The overall tone of this game is of morality, it glimpses to the past and evaluates its crimes committed. Ultimately leading to a morbid journey through trials that is to undue the sins of the past.  ~Some Pros/cons I compiled. ~ Pros: + Morality has its role to play. + Its story progresses smoothly, and goes off soon after the ending of its previous game.  + Gorgeous, very atmospheric and it completely immerses you into this world of post-apocalyptic Russia. + It's combat system is very well laid out, you can choose to be stealthy or simply go full on into combat. + You get to choose from a nice array of weaponry, as well as possess some nice upgrades for them. +The story is affected by your actions. +They managed to include the antagonists of 'The Reds' (Communism), and 'The Reich' (Nazis) in such a way that it is not corny, but rather emphasizes the struggle not for only day to day survival in post-nuclear life but rather its political/social injustices as well.  +It includes supernatural/spiritual scenes as well, nice touch. Cons: - Some achievements are hard to get. - Very few minor graphical errors. -This game does not always hold your hand. - It ends.",

            "review_text": "tl:dr: The game is fantastic, needs a decent computer and runs solidly. You should play Metro 2033 first. 8.5/10.  You know when you read a book/movie/tv/game series and you get to the end and just want more? I'm replaying this for the third time and I still get that craving for more once I've finished. It's a very well made game for one, having many different mechanics at work often all at the same time. You'll need to manage your air supply when in toxic environments, represented as your gas mask filters which you will need to swap out every 5 minutes. You'll need to make sure your torch is topped up with energy, manually pumping the thing every now and again and you'll also need to make sure you're hidden from view, highlighted by the blue vial on your watch.   *This game requires a moderatly well equipped computer to run at reasonable framerates.* The framerate itself is fairly stable and doesn't stutter or dip, at least that I know of.  Explore the tunnels of the metro, the horrors of the destroyed Moscow city as you climb through the ruins of the city, dodging the shadows that flash every time lightning strikes. You'll then realise the shadows look noticeably human like. Enjoy the flashbacks to the last moments of the Russians' lives as they react to the explosion in the distance. You'll see many things in this game, you'll experience many different fear invoking reactions. If you hate spiders, you'll be scared. If you cannot stand small spaces, you'll be breathing hard. If the thought of the supernatural sends shivers down your spine you might consider putting on a jumper because being cold will be the new norm for you. This game should be played after you finish Metro 2033 (redux preferred) as playing this first will really not make any sense at all.   If you choose to play this game, you'll be choosing to experience a fantastic storyline, spread over the two games and several DLC levels alongside the amazingly well polished gameplay that comes from managing your gas mask filters, gas mask screen (It cracks, you start dying) and the dirt and blood that comes from shooting dirty/bloody objects, or being shot yourself. I would give this game a 8/10 if not a 9/10. The only reason I cannot give this game a 10/10 is because I personally find the ghost sections to be too uncomfortable for me to handle. And although I mention spiders being prominent I should mention one of the DLC's is literally just you being given a flamethrower and you burning down a spider nest. That was very enjoyable. Otherwise this game is flawless in my opinion and I'd recommend it to anyone, even those scared of the mentioned things because it's truly an experience that cannot be beaten.  Side note: Writing out this review which I spent the most time on out of any other review instantly gets downvoted into hell while one of my stupidest comments which I spend no time on got voted to the top of their respective review sections. Well played 10 year olds, well played.",

While not essential it will give you a far better feel for the story these games are telling. This game is an incredible blend of survival horror, deep story telling and (depending on how you want to play) stealth/run-and-gun. If you really want you can complete this game in ~6 hours. Or you can take your time and immerse yourself in 15-20 hours of phenomenal content. Including some great DLC that comes with Redux allowing missions that give insight into other characters present in the story.  4A Games have created something that will keep you on edge right the way through without letting you get bored. Yes there are some lengthy cutscenes but they are presented in such a way as to keep the story moving forwards. And any time spend scavenging is only of benefit to you it isn't a fruitless achievment grind.    Pros      Incredible story telling and second to none attention to detail (you can listen to hours worth of conversations to learn all about the Metro and the people that live there with you)     Emphasis on stealth and resource management     Visuals     A full 6 act Bolshoi theater show     Great DLC that gives insight into other characters met in the story    Cons      Voice acting falls off a little towards the end     Slight shift in focus from the Metro to something a bit more supernatural (not a bad thing, just not fully explained)     Predictable AI    Have fun, immerse yourself &amp; take your time.

            "review_text": "Metro: Last Light Redux is a sequel of the popular game Metro 2033. Note that the bad ending of the first game is considered cannon. So, if you got the good ending you have bad luck here. It makes sense story-wise though and it has a bigger impact this way.  + Like its predecessor it has a very immersive story + a lot of weapons to choose from + gunplay is satisfying and is a lot of fun + More human interactions than in Metro 2033, which is more interesting than fighting some more monsters imho. + It runs well and looks very nice on high settings. + Memorable scenes + Stealth actually works well  - The ending felt a bit rushed - Although the human colonies felt more alive than in the first game there is so much more what could have been done to make them more believable. Maybe let us stay longer in human colonies, let us do some missions there, speak with more people  - I still don't like the moral point system.  Metro: Last Light is faster and more action-packed than Metro 2033. I consider them to be classic games and they deservedly belong on every list of the best FPS ever made. If you are interested I recommend buying the Metro Redux Bundle.  Replay value: Average Rating: 8.5/10 Recommendation: Yes",

I checked in my video game bag.  If A: Don't bother. This is just a remaster for a year old game. It comes with some new features that aren't really going to affect your experience. As a matter of fact, it actually adds bugs. The intro movie bug struck again, which freezes my game until I have to replace the movie file with a blank renamed .txt. A couple of times I got caught in the Metro's geometry. The Metro ate me whole. Stick that in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing air mask and breathe it in.  If B: Yes, you should, because this is a complete edition, and Metro: Last Light is pretty good. This is the only Last Light related thing to buy for the complete experience.",

            "review_text": "An absolutely beautiful example of what a PC game can look like. The textures &amp; models are pretty good, however the lighting is just beautiful and environmental effects add a great deal to the world. This may easily well be the best looking game I have ever played. Perhaps finally besting Crysis.  You have to manually charge the battery that powers your light every now &amp; then, replace the filter on your mask, along with a whole bunch of other little things that make the game just that much more immersive. But none of these little things ever feel like they're in the way, if anything they add an element of immersion I wish other developers would bother to put in their games.  The guns feel great and there's not one to date that's felt as good to let off some rounds. Each has about 3-4 customization options from stocks and scopes to different barrel tips among other weapon specific components.  The human AI can be a bit janky at times and a bit stupid but mutants are intelligent and you'll spend plenty enough time fighting them to keep things interesting. At launch of the origional, I come across maybe 2-3 bugs through the whole game, one of them forced a checkpoint restart. Though checkpoints are hardly more than 10 minutes apart so it's not an issue at all, as there were barely any bugs in the first place.  The world is mostly linear but often allows for some exploration after about two to three hours into the game. If they were to make a Fallout-esq open world game in this world that wasn't so story driven it could easily be game of the decade worthy.  The story is alright, the world is interesting, and occasionally you'll encounter the game's horror element which does indeed go beyond creepy mutants crawling about. Though in the end, I have pretty much no issue with the game at all aside from it holding your hand too long at the start.  All in all, its certainly worth the $45 I paid and I encourage you to play ranger mode even if you're new.",

If you are a certain type that doesn't leave a stone unturned, this game will probably go up in your top 10.  The other thing which makes you love it is the WEAPON SYSTEM. Not only is it well-designed, with the options to buy/customize or simply save up money(in our case, golden bullets), you are left with a series of choices every time you visit a shop. Will you trade off your current weapon so that you gain the advantage of a 6-shot shotgun or will you stick with your trusty revolver and believe in yourself to pick off your enemies with precision.  Let's not forget this ground-breaking feature - the choice of going all out or simply playing it stealthily. Yes, every level, doesn't matter if your enemy is human or beast, you are left with an option to either engage it head-on or just skillfully sneak past and save up some ammo and filters. You are always provided with a hidden path which will serve you as an advantage.  The STORY is neither impressive or dull. It hits that sweet spot. You are neither tired of the development of the plot or eager to know what the hell is going to happen in the next station. Indeed, there are many plot-twists but I won't spoil any, for the sake of the best experience.  MORALITY CHOICES. Later on in-game, you will have to decide for yourself to either show revenge or forgiveness. Not only are those particular choices important for the ending but also murders and overseeing matter throught your entire playthrough - from beginning to ending.  CHARACTERS. Unique and interesting, all in their own ways. Each interaction with them reminds you how different their world is from yours and always leave something for your to remember about them. Although, they did dull-down Ulman. He was quite the monkey-man in 2033, especially in the final missions.  ADDITIONAL MISSIONS INCLUDED. Do not think you are finished with the Metro. More content awaits you in the CHAPTERS section. Simply go in and press 'Q' and experience totally new adventures from other points of view. Be a RED sniper securing a Nazi outpost, a hired gun to exterminate a Spider Nest, a Nazi heavy-weapons specialist, and finally my favourite, a fresh recruit, a ranger, who is supposed to manage his filters and ammo carefully, as there are no options to scavenge such outside your outpost - whatever you buy at the outpost, that will be your supplies for the oustide tread. In addition, the area which you are exploring is the Library from 2033.   Overall, a great experience.",

Others would have taken days if not weeks to fix this problem.

Certain moments gave a bit of chills down the spine - particularly, right before the narration jumps to Red Square campaign, and being much of a hoarder, I enjoyed exploring and getting into every corner. It adds to the atmosphere if you take time and read the writings on the walls and look into the skeletons that lie around the stations, or train wagons. Mutant bear was brilliant and its little ones were adorable, so that's an extra bonus. If you're trying to get the good ending, you may find it annoying to go around pretty much absolutely stealthy because even meanwhile you'll give money to the poor, etc, that won't grant you a great ending. Besides, I kinda felt like going totally stealthy removes a good element of a shooter game. But whatever, the game is perfect. I've seen people commenting on poor voice acting, but I believe that's just because the VA was in English. I've played the game in its native Russian, and I can assure the VA was very good.

The gameplay of the game is mostly unchanged, but it does feel noticeably tighter than the non Redux version of Metro: 2033.   This is a first person shooter that is not based around twitch shots and mlg 420 no scopes. Instead, it is a story driven game, with difficult gameplay, and has a noticeably slower pace than a lot of other current shooters. The story is well done and the voice acting is pretty well done, although, it is odd that a Russian base underground speaks English, but there is also a Russian Voice language, if you'd like to use it.  The game looks incredible if you have a system that allows it.   8/10 Would recommend to someone who wants a slow, methodical, story driven shooter set in a post apocalyptic land.

            "review_text": "Possibly my favourite game ever!  This game follows Metro 2033, based on the book (by Dmitri Glukhovsky), which I also strongly recommend. To make it short, you are Artyom, a young Moscovite man, who has lived in the metro system of Moscow for the past 20 years, since a nuclear war wiped out all life on the surface (or has it?). Some weird stuff is happening in the tunnels near your home station, and you have to report about it to the 'police' force of the subway, forcing your way through nazis, comunists, opportunists, bandits, mutant creatures and other scary stuff. (If it's still not clear for you : this is an allegory of post-comunist Russia). In this second volume of the game, you have become yourself one of these 'policemen' (rangers) and have to (again) save the day.  The graphics are beautiful, the sound is gorgeous, the story is convincing and enthralling, the gameplay on point. I love the shooting mechanics, the customization of your weapons, the choice of weapons, the variety of enemies.  Regarding the game itself, there are a few jumpscares here and there, but not too much, it's mostly a sort of psychological horror (apart from sheer blood and violence when fighting) that creeps on you. There are several game modes, which lead you to various playstyles. You can play it in the easy difficulties, where there's ammo everywhere, and you just plow your way through everything (or try to sneak, fail, and then have to shoot everyone). Or you can play in harder difficulties, where you are forced to stealth your way simply because there's no bullets to shoot anymore.   The only downsides of this game are the limited possibility of replaying (since it is fairly linear) and the impossibility to play in highest difficulty on the first time. Explanation : in highest difficulty mode, you have no UI, and no clues of what key to press to interact with objects, or how to select your different weapons. Meaning that you'll be stuck. So you have to play it once with the hints, telling you how to choose knife/mines/grenades, and then play it in harder, once you understand how it works. However, for this game, there are also several additional levels, where you are playing other characters, and they are great! There's some sneak missions of stealth sniping, there's some pure fighting as a nazi heavy machine gunner, there's some exploration of both underground and surface...   Overall, a great game with a great scenario! Take it!",

Story:- a year has past since you destroyed the Dark Ones hive, you hear there is a sole survivor of that attack and leads you to uncover dark plans by those in power.  Replayability:- after getting 100% on Metro 2033 and Redux version then doing Metro Last Light and this one you will want to complete it as soon as you can as hearing the same thing over n over can do your head in lol  Rating:- 9/10",

The story is very rich and has a core message (which I won't spoil) that is, in my opinion, beautiful.  I recommend playing both Metro games because they're wonderful experiences.

This game will immerse you in the Metro, and make you believe you are a part of their world, even though you're just some fat kid playing video gaemes. The tunnels are dark, and eerie and there's ambient noise everywhere, walking around kicked cans, lamps, and even people. Spooby. Playing this game on Ranger mode is a must if you want to be engrossed in the world, no HUD, no tool tips, just you, a lighter, and your favourite silent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gun. The tunnels are claustrophobic, the make you feel constricted you hear a noise at the other end you have no choice but you go find it and throw a knife at it. and those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bugs that you have to scare away with your light, pure nightmares. The surface is equally a scary, even scarier at some points, from little fish that spit green snot at you, to huge flying beasts that are sooooo hard to kill, and are even harder to get away from if you're out in the open. The surface is a marvel to look at, and had me stop and looking around for stuff. Running out of filters is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING nightmare on Ranger, run out of those and you are dead unless you can find some lying around.    Cons: Agh, this game is not easy, this is not a con for some people, but sometimes I just like going balls deep and firing all my weapons into the faces of my enemies, but this game is like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that. Walk around with a silenced EVERYTHING and spam throwing knifes, which at some times can be frustrating and difficult but not impossible. At some times the enemy AI can be completely brain dead at, other times they can hear you squeeze one out 20ft away from them. I did experiecne that bug that stopped me from finishing the game without wiping my save completely, so I have yet to finish Metro: Last Light, this is a HUGE problem and completely broke the immersion for me, and forced me to stop playing, on the other hand the time I did play was fantastic and a absolute treat. But this needs to be fixed ASAP, very big problem, and it seems to be quite popular simple search on the Internets proved that for me.  Conclusion: If you are like me and love being immersed inside a game than this is a MUST have you need to play this game. This game is easily one of my favourite single player experiences and is a big step in the right direction for 4A games, Metro 2033 was good, but this something that needs to be played for the majority of gamers. Unless you like running around and shooting stuff and not thinking about anything (but who doesn't every now and again). This is a 9/10 for me, the few things held it back but nothing too major apart from the game killing bug.",

Gun combat now feels more solid and authentic than last time, you get some new weapons to play with and the story takes different twists and turns throughout the game.

Even with the knowledge that it was a completely different game in the same storyline.  That said. This game was nothing but irritating for me. I was expecting a comparable continuance of the Metro storyline. What did I get for my hard earned money? Something that was far less. Lots of storyline, but not of the same quality. In fact, so much that it interfered with my gameplay. I'd have to estimate that at least 20 percent of the game is cutscenes that are not nearly as interesting as they should have been. In fact, at least half of those cutscenes were worthless drains of time that did nothing for the storyline.   Without spoiling the plot, I have to say that this game felt more like I was trying to watch Alien Resurrection and watch the child friendly favorite, E.T. at the same time. It was badly presented and did not do Metro 2033 justice.  So, how was the gameplay? Easy. Way easier than Metro 2033. You had everything you needed, conservation of resources was not ever an issue. And yea, I was playing on Ranger. On the most difficult setting you should feel a hell of a challenge. You should feel like every shot counts and that any mistake you do is punished with the most unpredictable of consequences. Maybe you should suffocate due to not packing enough filters. Maybe you should run out of all your best ammunition and be resorted to using some stray weapon you found on a corpse. No. None of that. I don't know about you, but I'm not really here for a walk in the friggin park.   Instead of difficult gameplay concepts, you know what we got? Resident Evil style bosses. 'Oh, superboss... just shoot it in the flashing red areas to do damage.' I'm sorry, wtf did you just say??? Did you just tell me IN GAME that I had to shoot a difficult adversary in the red flashy areas? You didn't expect that to be immersion breaking? Gtfo.  Nothing about this game lives up to Metro 2033. The only saving grace it had was a couple moments of intense gunfights. I cannot recommend this game.  I completed this game in less than 10 hours. It was a painful 10 hours.",

There was alot more focus on characters and characterization in this game that I enjoyed (I loved Pavel). The story also added more faction warfare that we did not see as much of in the first game. The Chronicles DLC was also a lot of fun but the other DLC were meh, you get them with this purchase anyway so you may as well try them out.

Graphics are still decent, but alot of high contrast effects etc that just hurts my eyes and look terrible. Combat becomes just a run and gun where you run around trying to figure out what your suppose to do while monsters keep spawning. Bosses that are just bullet soakers where you waste all your ammo just to progress to the next area. You can not sneak past them like other parts of the game.   Then you end up in frustrating parts where you ride trains and shoot at opposing trains, here you die if you dont kill the enemys fast enough, cover does not matter you just instantly die after about 3-4 sec. Other areas you are placed in a yard with tall buildings where enemys spawn and shoot down at you from all sides. All you get is some wood cover that they shoot thru, these areas and others you will have to just repeat untill you make it or find an exploit (was playing ranger mode).  I played the game with russian speach and english subtitles, and dialoge was pretty good most of the time, but that to just got worse and at the end i didnt even bother with the dialog, it was painfull. Russian sounds cool tho, i recomend it. The english speach is even worse.  To summerise, combat is fun in the first part of the game, sound is not great and the dialoge story is nothing to praise really. It mostly comes down to the atmosphere and graphics in the first 3 hours of the game maby. Then everything is just a pain. I would not recomend this game for anything less then 9 euro, maby even less. Might be worth it to just play the first bit of the game again.",

I picked Metro Last Light and Metro 2033 redux versions on a Steam sale for dirt cheap ($4.99 each) and actually didn't boot up Last Light for almost a year because I was preoccupied with other games. On the one hand, I could kick myself for not playing it earlier -- on the other, this game was a really pleasant surprise.  Simply put, Last Light is much, much better than I expected it would be. There are so many games set in dark, dystopian futures, with the same muted colors and razor-thin plots that, if you've come late to the Metro franchise as I have, it's easy to look at the gameplay vids and screens and wave them off as a jaded gamer.  But this isn't a game that takes its setting for granted, or uses a post-apocalyptic setting for shallow purposes. There's a real story here, real world-building, real lore. Everything you see and encounter is there for a reason -- including the Metro stations themselves, the radiated surface, the factions and the personalities.   Pros:  - Well-written characters with distinct and amusing personalities - Exceptional graphics: Metro Last Light looks better, as a 2014 redux, than many major 2016 titles - The combat and gunplay is fun, smooth and intuitive - Even in English, the dialog is peppered with interesting Russian slang and colloquialisms - Likewise, the voice acting is top notch  - The game guides you, but it never feels like it's pushing you. It's a nice balance - Last Light accommodates not only several difficulty levels, but also playstyles: You can play a more low-key, survival-style version with stealth mechanics, or you can play a more direct action-oriented shooter style which still gives you the option to be stealthy  Cons:  - The gun swapping and upgrading system isn't as intuitive as the rest of the game. Some of the guns don't behave the way you'd expect them to based on the type of weapons they are, and the store/purchasing system is a bit odd - I don't like it when games, especially shooters, hide items in obscure places and force you to stalk around every map, looking in every nook and cranny lest you miss something important. Last Light isn't as bad as some games in this respect, but it's an element of game design I dislike. - Lack of Vladimir Putin - No MetArt girls. This is Russia. There should be amazing MetArt girls!

            "review_text": "The game has great setting. The world and attention to detail in conveying the feel for the post-apolyptical Moskow is great. Fighting is generally enjoyable too. So why am I negative?  Here's why:  * Level design is uninspired and sometimes unneccisarily confusing. When for the third or forth time I have to push/pull/whatever and wait for a minute before elevator/boat/something comes while there's an onslaught of enemies, I get really frustrated. Also, at least one of these makes absolutely no sense whatsoever within the game universe. Who in their right mind would rig a line of bells ringing all around the place when enemies are attracted by noise?  * Player-style: The game kind of hints there are alternatives to how you play. Quiet or loud. But really, the way the game ramps up difficulty as the story progresses, it forces you to be non-sneaky (as mentioned above, this is at least sometimes against the game's own premise).  * Representation: There's nowhere near a reasonable female to male ratio and those few women that did survive the appoxolypse have insanly wobbly and large breasts. Further, the game thinks it is very smart and clever with this bright and never before seen use of women as sexualized objects.   * Story: The lack of representation and fully kills what does start out promising. It's not the only issue I have with it. It doesn't really bring anything new and interesting. Just go here, get caught or similar go somewhere else. Chase some bad people, oops fall down into a monster's den. You all know this story. I must admit I got so fed up with the whole game that I decided it ended about three quarters through where I decided my Artyom died. On the surface. Suffocating. The most suitable ending to a disappointing experience.",

The combat is a vast improvement to the first game with customisation of weapons and a less jerky/ clunky movement and aim system. The characters are interesting and there is plenty of side content in terms of story development which you can choose to ignore or not, you can even make certain decisions to follow how you would like to play.  Finally the atmosphere is perfect there is a direct contrast between the tunnels where you will be in claustrophobic conditions where you will be checking your back as much as you will check your front, the surface is a direct change where you dont look in front and behind you but you will look every direction possible whilst traversing terrain with the lowest risk and in the fastest time against the clock of your oxygen.  If you are not a fan of linear missions then i suggest you either get invested in the story and dont pay attention or you should not play this game however this game is something which is missing a lot today and that is that it is a CHALLENGE, you will die, a lot...

Valve really needs to institute sometype of refund policy - like refund within 4 hours, only 1 refund per game, etc.   Issues like this is why I tend to avoid games for quite awhile after launch.

The unique concept of the game, the mixture of both post-apocalyptic and supernatural atmosphere, same as its prequel, really differentiate the game, and make it the only game out there with its unique original vibe. What not to like about this game, fighting through a horde of mutants and humans, and also passing through a dungeon full of apparitions of those who died because of the nuclear explosion or other tormenting causes.  Most of the gameplay didn't change from Metro 2033 except some new weapons and monsters. The combat are ever intense and stealth options are always challenging. The graphic are beautiful same as Metro 2033 but in this second installment, there are more playthrough out on the ruined surface and the city, Moscow. In Moscow, you'll go through flashes of memories of the old world and encounter ghosts of the past which I think differentiate this game from its sequel. Of course in Metro 2033 have all this spirits stuffs but not as much and not as weird as those you'll get in this game.  As one of my favourite game series ever, of course I'll recommend you buy this game because it is worth every penny. This game deserve to be on everyone's favourites list.

The game feels very cookie cutter with each chapter picking a theme e.i (Stealth *Note: you can choose to just go guns blazing except fighting librarians*, Firefight, Mutant survival) with almost no mixing and the occasional rail shooter.

Solid 10-12 hours of gameplay, and even more if you really explore the world. In addition, the Redux version of this game comes with DLC that adds plenty of extra story building missions and a difficulty level.  The combat is not your average FPS game where you are invincible and basically cannot die. Far from it. Even if you choose the easiest difficulties, the monsters have smart AI, unforgiving damage output, and a startling amount of health.  Be warned however, you may need a fairly high end computer to play this game, as even with my gaming computer, the fps drops to 20 around intense scenes.

Survive the harsh world of the Metro when you battle a wide variety of combatants, which amazingly are not just the mutant creatures of the world above, but fight politically driven humans such as communists and Nazis. Which as a gamer myself whom has delved into other First person shooters, found aweing as the enemies you face add to the story and arnt cannon fodder.   Pros The game is beautiful, the story is incredibly well done, the gameplay leaves on the edge of your seat and the survival aspect is intense, rather than a chore in some other survival games. Also the political references really add well to the story and make you think rather than just you killing mindlessly.  Cons Writing this itself is hard as the cons are few in number, but I do have my concerns. Firstly being silent and avoiding fire can be really hard work and from some standpoints it could be considered a rage game. The main thing however that bothers me is that you cant change the brightness, so forget about playing during the day cause it anit gunna happen, also sometimes it does force one to squint which is a little annoying.  All in all this is an amazing game and was worth every cent I spent. 10/10      ",

While in Metro 2033 the occupants of the metro faced the threat of the Dark Ones, they now face a power struggle for control over a military bunker, called D6, which could provide food and shelter from the mutants for a long time. However, the imminent war could lead to the extinction of humanity and somehow, salvation lies in the hands of Artyom and his newfound friend.  While Last Light didn't have the scariest mutant 2033 offered, that being the Librarians, it still had some creepy levels and also moments such as the visions of the past seen in the Dead City. [The Librarians only appear in one of the many DLC levels and they still scared the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of me.] Like 2033, Last Light has 2 endings and the 'good ending' requires you to obtain enough 'moral points' as you progress through the entire campaign. This means doing charity/ good deeds, evesdropping on enemies and not killing unless you absolutely have to.  There were also additions that were not seen in the first game. For instance, there were 3 'boss fights' and while they were not too tough, I still had to blow most of my ammunition. Also, the Redux edition includes all DLCs released for Last Light, and while they didn't provide 10 hours of bonus content like they were supposed to, I still had a lot of fun playing as some of the most memorable characters from the campaign.  Lastly, Metro Last Light is one of the few games that I've gotten 100% steam achievements for. My gametime consists of 2 playthroughs (one for each ending), completing the DLC levels, and lastly replaying specific chapters for the no kills/ no alarm raised achievements.  9.5/10 would Russian again.",

I wasn't a fan when the original game came out but I can assure you that the Redux Versions of Last Light and the original Metro, are worth every penny.  It simply has the right doses of every aspect of a great shooter. There can be intense action on demand (just make a lot of noise), and the stealth mechanics is great (and forgiving at times). There are points in the game that you will get tempted to just shoot the place up to be done with it, as doing a stealthy (and usually the morally sound route) to be more tedious. Any way gets the job done. (if you aren't as obsessive with earning stealth achievements.)   What fascinated me the most is the setting and the sense of urgency and realism. The greatest challenge really was in conserving ammo (though the Spartan Mode is there to remedy that) and making every second on the surface count since you can die from the environment and asphyxiation. Non-combat portions of the game are as tense as those moments you face bandits, Commies, Nazis, and even mutant wildlife.  The additional missions were also quite entertaining. Bite-size in nature but also provides their own challenge and flavor, having to fill the shoes of different characters in the actual campaign. (among others) I did this however, in Normal Spartan mode so the experience may be quite different for you.   Worth a second playthrough, if you're the type that's into perfecting game achievements like me. This one is easily in the bag.",

(Much like Telltale's Walking Dead, where your choice affects the outcome of your survival and whether you will be respected as an indivisual) and you actually have to be stealthy, you can't run in willy nilly like in most games, even Half-Life you can run in some times without a plan, a lot of the time you have to scope out your enemy and every shot counts.

The combat is a vast improvement to the first game with customisation of weapons and a less jerky/ clunky movement and aim system. The characters are interesting and there is plenty of side content in terms of story development which you can choose to ignore or not, you can even make certain decisions to follow how you would like to play.  Finally the atmosphere is perfect there is a direct contrast between the tunnels where you will be in claustrophobic conditions where you will be checking your back as much as you will check your front, the surface is a direct change where you dont look in front and behind you but you will look every direction possible whilst traversing terrain with the lowest risk and in the fastest time against the clock of your oxygen.  If you are not a fan of linear missions then i suggest you either get invested in the story and dont pay attention or you should not play this game however this game is something which is missing a lot today and that is that it is a CHALLENGE, you will die, a lot...

Play hardcore or ranger difficulty! It makes the game feel more intense,  My suggestion? Take a handgun, rifle and shotgun most of the time. You wont have much oppoturnity to utilize the sniper rifle here. Pneumatic weapon require constand pumping so not doing so well in a fight. Speargun is great although the ammo is reusable but bear in mid that the ammo is very rare and expensive to buy  Play stealth! Just like what Bruce Lee said, BE WATER MY FRIEND!   Of course most of my suggestion wont matter if you are playing the easy mode.",

            "review_text": "One thing I love, is shooting games. FPS in particular. I like shooters even if it isn't very plot heavy. I just love to shoot things. However, this FPS action-adventure-survival taught me how to truly love and respect those people who can make shooters that, despite their many counterparts, can bring something new to the party. As of the date of this review, those people who brought this thing to the party of gaming, have officialy earned themeselves the title of making what is now my favorite game.  Developer and Developer History: You can read who the developer and publisher was on the steam page. So I will not bore you with something that can easily be looked up. However, it needs to be known that this game was originally adapted from a book series also called Metro by Dmitri Glukovsky. Not only that, but he actually took part in the development of the Metro game series which is cool because the man. the maker, the magnificent, has given the game version his stamp of approval unlike some other games and their authors (I'm looking at you, Witcher). Also, during development, A4 has never made any other games and this game was not incredibly known at the time of its release and did not receive much hype at the time. SO for a studio's first game to be a big hit and spark a huge cult following, is pretty impressive.  Plot: One thing that I sometimes hate about games, is their attempt to add too much depth to the plot to where it becomes too confusing (eg. finding out you were fighting for the bad guys, deux ex machina moments with rediculous explanations, etc). However, this game kept it simple. You are fighting for the good guys, and trying to defeat the bad and restore order and peace despite your calm life before your involvment with the different Metros. Also, I love how explicit important parts of the story were made. In many games, any piece of information is usually implicitly stated and 'represents' something. That is not a bad thing, but making details so ambiguous can cause hard-headed and naive people like me to have important details slip over their heads. So when this game reiterates an important piece of information via mission intro or diary entry in an obvious manner, it refreshes me on what has happened and what our goal is without confusing me. (As a side note, I personally love the addition of supernatural entities to add horror and supernatural elements to the mix as I have an interest in the Paranormal).  Characters: The variety of characters in this game, whew. You do not just fight mutants. You fight humans, your inner demons, ghosts. You do not just get along with humans, you get along with mutants and any mutant or person can become your worst enemy or your best friend in the blink of an eye. SO do, not, fully, trust, ANYONE. Eat or be eaten, kill or be killed.  Playability: I will admit, this was one of the downsides of the game. You cannot change computer volume in game so you have to use the volume slider built in the game. Also, if you're like me and change your controls often, you might want to leave defaults because certain combinations can make some aspects of the game unplayable (eg. Reloading BB gun air wont work without defaults). However, these aspects of the game can easily get used to within the first hour of playing.  Difficulty: One think I love about this game is it can satisfy those who love horror and survival games and who scavenge often, while also allowing the option to satisfy those who like to go all out Call of Duty style. These options are given in the Spartan and Survival options provided at the beginning of the game to make ammo more plentiful, equipment more abundant, etc. Also, after selecting your play style, you are then given the option to choose your difficulty which I see to be pretty balanced.  Mechanics: For the time that the game was made, these mechanics were not seen often amongst shooters. The gas masks, the guns, the movement, the agility, the endurance, the health systen, the guns' mechanisms, and how they performed were very new for its time and very unique which made me enjoy it even more when I shot somebody...or something. But you are also allowed to spare people's and mutants' lives from time to time aswell so there is that. However, one aspect I didn't like too much was the moral points system. Now I'm not saying that since on both games I was apparently a huge enough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to not be given the opportunity to pick any good ending but because I do not think your actions early on in the game should justify what actions you take in the ending of both games because to me, what ending I choose or want at the end of the game, does not and, imo, should not coincide with my actions earlier in the game.  Graphics: To put it simply, the graphics were quite stunning for being made in 2010 when compared to other games like Left 4 Dead 2 and CS GO and other FPS shooters. However, choosing your graphics settings are quite difficult to get used to in Metro because I have a Nvidia GTX 980 with a 144hz G-Sync monitor and I had to have SS off and graphics on medium for it to even run at 60fps. I don't know about you but I never had to do that with any other game.  Immersiveness: This is, without a doubt, the most immersive first person shooter I have ever played. I usually play campaigns in intervals. After about 30 minutes I get bored and have to take a break. However, I found myself playing Metro for 3 hours and not even 1/4 way through the campaign. This is by far the most immersive FPS i have played and I never felt more significant than I have in this game and never have I hated or loved a bunch of people made of binary code or notepad more than I have in this game.  Entertainment: Immersiveness is differnet to entertainment. Immersivness deeply involves and appeals to one's senses. Entertainment refers to how amusing something is when observed. This game, at first can be hard to get into as you are not quite sure what you are supposed to be doing in this game. However, the longer you play, the more the pieces to the puzzle start to come together and the more entertaining it becomes. So, this game is as entertaining as can be to me. Not in the sense of stimulating, but in the sense of appealing to your emotions and by the game almost asking you 'how would you deal with this situation, how would you react?, how much do you want to live?' I found the atmosphere, the missions, the people you fight with and alongside, and just the moments looking back on what happened to your homeland more entertaining sometimes than the actual shooting of mutants and people. I found this game more entertaining in a movie sense more than a game sense as I loved just looking around and thinking about all that has happened to my character and what made me want to fight for the people of the Metro, and why this, in the matter of two days playing this game, made it my favorite game as of today!",

But, while Stalker's open world allowed more freedom of movement, Metro's characters feel more real in a gritty, human kind of way. Because of the character depth and believable motives I feel like this game had more to say than just survival. I liked the choice you have of not killing enemies for some parts and yet the game gives you a good reason to destroy others.   The weapons are varied, the monsters are scary and the villains are evil. It gets a little repetitive sometimes when you figure out the patterns of enemies but there's enough variation for you to get distracted in the chaos and feel like you're being hunted and especially on harder difficulties, the ammo count makes you think twice before going in guns-a-blazin'. I felt like stealth and patience are rewarded here.   Anyhow, great game. Definitely recommend buying, especially with some sort of bundle with the first one as that's fantastic too.",

            "review_text": "*Note: since writing this, I've noticed that the 'horror' tag is no longer visible on this game; however, when I first checked this game out many months ago, it was there. So if you saw it way back when and, like me, were apprehensive about buying a horror game, please read my review.*  I'll be honest, I didn't really expect to enjoy this game. I loved the books, and I bought the game because I wanted to have a detailed visualization of Glukhovsky's world. However, I did not want to play a horror game, I don't like scary movies or Halloween or any of that stuff. So when people kept tagging or reffering to this game as a horror game, it turned me away from buying until eventually, I said 'Who cares I don't need to play anyway, I just want to see what it looks like.'  What happened after I bought the game? I opened the game early one Saturday, and I played for 14 hours almost non-stop. I love this game. It is amazing, the graphics are incredible, the story depth is incredible. This game can be a little frustrating at times because the task that you have to do is so complex and yet vaguely defined (using the objectives list as a reference is actually an incrediby dumb idea in this game as they rarely update and are never all that useful). However, while it was frustrating due to its complexity, I also want to say that I think that this ADDS to the game and adds to the story itself, because you're in a very deep, complex world. I didn't want to stop playing until I had beaten the campaign, and now that I've beaten it I am writing this review before probably playing this game again. Al in all, very good game.  It's really not horror game at all, I dont know why so many people called it a horror game it really wasn't that scary at all and I don't ike scary stuff. Honestly, it had scary moments, but they were rare and not that bad, no worse than what you'd get from a Modern Warfare or Black Ops campaign, and those aren't labelled horror games. Really, I consider this game a shooter: it's like a Call of Duty, but way better. More addicting, more realistic, more imaginative, a better story; I love this game, and you should buy the game and the books, too.",

The game is beautifully balanced in every aspect and while it may give you a scare from time to time, it's one of the best FPS I played. Go buy it.",

I CHOSE THE GOOD ENDING!' and also I did all the nice things and still got the suicide ending because apparently I didn't eavesdrop on enough people. Gameplay and game up until end 8/10, moral system and ending as a result 5/10.",
