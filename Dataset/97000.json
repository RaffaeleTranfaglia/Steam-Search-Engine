            "review_text": "Solar 2 is one of Steam's best-kept secrets. It's equal parts space physics simulator and arcade game.  I find it very relaxing and entertaining to zip around space, gobbling up asteroids into a giant star-katamari and evolving my planets.  It's not a perfect game. I wish that there was a better way to battle star-vs-star with the AI. The best strategy I've found for stealing planets is to knock them out of orbit with a shielded planet, then chase them down. This works, but it's very damaging to your suns and planets, and tends not to be worth the effort. The best strategy for growth is roaming about the galaxy looking for free planets and asteroids to grow your system.  No matter. Solar 2 is not really designed for long-term play. I find it works best to pop in for a while and just knock around a bit. See if you have the patience to develop an 8-star system, for instance.  The missions offer a nice break to the gameplay, but some are easy and some are very frustrating. It's a mixed bag.  A Multiplayer mode would have been welcome, too. Still, I find little to complain about in Solar 2. It's not perfect, but it is a light and fun sandbox game, which lets you decide how you want to have fun. Try the Demo.",

            "review_text": "Possibly the smallest game I own, but it packs a bigger punch than that.  Solar 2's main strength is that you can play at your own pace, with your own goals, and that leads to a good few hours that you can spend just bumbling around in space and figuring out what you fancy doing. Going from a tiny asteroid to a black hole? Staying as a solo planet and building up a small armada of ships? Just flying around like a lunatic smashing into stuff and dying repeatedly? All viable playstyles.  If you want more structure, the story and challenge missions offer a good balance between fun and difficulty, and add considerable longevity to the game. The general idea is to work your way up the planetary body hierarchy - from diminutive asteroid through to planets, stars, star systems and eventually nature's biggest vaccuum cleaner. There are individual missions for each stage of being, some of them simple, others very difficult. I have yet to witness another game that lets you play as the stage itself at a rock concert.  For a little indie title, there's a surprising amount to do, and while it could perhaps get a little samey after beating everything the game has to offer, there are physics options that you can use to craft a more creative playing experience - like mass space dogfights between hundreds of ships, for instance.  Or, you could just let the cool ambience of the game float you away on a paradoxical vaccuum breeze...",

It's short, the missions aren't that fun and the controls make them awkward, but just crashing around space and working your way up to a blackhole before ending the universe can be an amusing pass time. The art is beautiful, the ambient music is lovely and watching an alien civilisation build itself on your solar system is fun, before you blow them up for fun or use their planet as a bowling ball to blow up a star.  Despite what reviewers said about this being 'unique', it isn't. Such games have been floating around the internet for a long time, crash your rock into smaller rocks or be a fish and eat smaller fish to grow. I think there is one about being a virus or something as well. Most are free flash games or part of the larger arcade-style gaming packs that used to be distributed back in the XP/2000 era. Solar 2 just has decent graphics, unlike all those other ones.",

When you're a planet, your gravity draws asteroids in to become satellites. When you're a star, you draw in planets which draw in asteroids of their own. Bigger stars allow for bigger solar systems, and intelligent life can form on any number of your planets and protect you with spaceships.

One can simply gather enough mass to eventually engulf the universe, or take on one of the many challenges presented to them at varying stages of the game. While some of these challenges can prove to be quite difficult, most of them are quite fun and enjoyable, even the hard ones can be extremely fun once you get the hang of it. They are challenges after all, not simple, 'Move here, destroy stuff, achievement!' In the end, the missions are entirely optional, the player has no obligation to complete them what-so-ever, they are there for players who enjoy something a little more than simply getting bigger.  There are portions of the game that could use improvement. A warning for upcoming hazards other than black holes would be wonderful! I can't say how many times I've died due to zipping across space and then running straight into a star. The collecting of mass latter on also becomes somewhat of a chore due to the player needing to get asteroids or planets into an orbit first before absorbing rather than just smashing into them like similar games. It does somewhat prevent the player from going straight to the last stage with minimum effort, but it can still prove to be a pain when you are trying to mass up only to constantly crash into stuff instead.  However, these are minor issues, some of which are gameplay mechanics others just personal preference.   Solar 2 is visually stunning, seeing all the universe has to offer and all the things you can mess around with is truly magnificent. The controls for the asteroids, planets, and stars, all respond and feel like you are controlling them, asteroids just zip around effortlessly, while stars and solar systems are sluggish and take time to get going, giving that sense of just how truly massive you are.  Overall, I find Solar 2 a joy to play for brief periods of time, longer play sessions I would not recommend unless you are going soley for achievements or high scores, otherwise you might quickly burn yourself out. The gameplay, soundtrack, and visuals all make Solar 2 an out of this world experience for people who love messing around in cosmos.",

Gameplay revolves around smacking into things to grow (asteroid and black hole stages) or get things in your orbit so you can press some keys to grow (planet and star stages). Missions and challenges play around with these goals, mostly by telling you to avoid contact with most things and not grow.  Some people say that the game is relaxing, and it can be if you don't care about doing anything. If you want to see anything new in the game, you will have to fly through 2D space and hope that the strange physics doesn't impede your progress. I can accept being attacked by spaceships and having to avoid obstacles, but my biggest issue is that pulling an object into orbit has a bad habit of rubber-banding the object into you, reducing your mass. So the method of growing your planet or star can randomly decide to remove your progress just because the programming has clear-cut orbit paths with the first object being yanked to the closest orbit.  Even the black hole stage is underwhelming, HOW could they mess up something that should be total fun to let loose and eat everything! Once you reach black hole stage, other black holes begin to appear, although they never spawned in the previous stages of the game. These other black holes can take objects from you, and if you hit a larger black hole than your own, you are forced to restart the state with no progress. This restart is made more terrible as black holes have a nasty issue of failing to pick up many items. Apparently entire stars and systems can fly around a black hole and not actually be swallowed.  I remember liking this game originally, but I only played for about an hour. The game has definitely become dated and feels especially mediocre now. Controls are weak, physics are annoying, and the gameplay is a repetitious grind full of elements that impede your progress. I believe I got the game for cheap in a bundle, but I wouldn't really recommend it for even $2. It's a time consumer, but similar games could be found for free. I'd recommend just playing a game you know you like, as this won't last long for most players.",
