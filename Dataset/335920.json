This could well help calm and relax you after a stressful day, I love the classical rock music, the fireworks and the colours as well, you'll just have to buy the game and find out the rest for yourselfs. I dont want to spoil anything. ;D",

The graphics are well made, the story is beautiful and the music... this is probably the best and the most original rhythm game i have played so far. Get this game, you won't regret it ^^",

Just play it and you know! this was so far my best indie game experience i ever has in 4 YEARS!!  The Story contains Dragon/Butterfly Art like things.  you need various things to do and its such a cute and lovely and also adorable Story about helping and getting Help and find your Love after you lost it. the end is kind of sad but also so beautiful made. i loved the mix of 2D/3D in this game it fits perfect i think. well as i said EXPERIENCE IT YOURSELF, a MUST HAVE if you dont own already!  Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 10/10 (This Experience was quite amusing sad its such a shorty)  Graphics: 10/10 (adorable graphics between 2D/3D)  Support: ?/10 (never needed, i leve it out of impression since the game works fine!)  Price: 10/10 (totally worth also the full Price!)  Story: 10/10 (Butterfly/Dragon kind things and love &lt;3)  Sound: 10/10 (great, you also play the songs)  Performance: 10/10 (perfect no lags etc)  FAZIT: 10/10 (Best game ever would by this 10x in a row if there would be 10 games from it)",

My favorite part was the spider :)  Only beef I have with it is that the secret level difficulty is way off compared to whole game difficulty. I get that one wants to give a challenge but that level just is impossible, and I'm not even talking about the fast difficulty. So yeah..yet another game I can't get 100% achievements in. Other than that..great job devs.",

It only takes about an hour to complete (unless you hunt for more achievements or the secret level), but it uses this time well.  Well, except for the snow level, which is horrible even with apparently the latest patch making it easier (how horrid where controls before that)? But don't let that spoil this game, and definitely give it a try!",

The game play is really simple, although I didn't find any instructions about what you are supposed to do. If you love music, you may have some good time in this game. A bit disappointed with one thing: some music pieces are not compatible with the theme. Rather than pop or disco, I expected more New Age and classic genre.",

Usually I dislike fullscreen games because I mult task and tend to put them up right away when I start to play and realize what they are. This one had to glued to the monitor, well until a friend messaged me and messed me up closing the game by mistake. Long story short . . . it's a unique and magical experiance in my eyes. Worth every penny.",

And after 20 minutes I couldn't leave the poor mayfly alone, so I kept playing and playing... until suddenly I was reading the credits.   Good game for less than 2-3 bucks or a bundle.",

Even without text, the story came across clearly and I thought it was quite sweet.  I thought it ran smoothly and the music was spot-on!  Fit the mood each time and as the gameplay is rhythm-based, it's got good beat~  The difficulty is good and the secret level will provide some challenge.  I would pay more for the soundtrack and I'll definitely be playing it over again.",
