            "review_text": "As with all the King's Bounty games, this one is excellent, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be as well made as the others. Specifically the sound is very buggy, especially during battles and the ending is incredibly disappointing and short considering the source material and the length of the game itself. Some missions are also bugged, with locators randomly either not showing up or refusing to go away for the rest of the game.  Collision detection is nightmarish, and the maps often have some points(especially bridges) where the pathfinding simply collapses. You can use this to your advantage when being pursued by monsters(if you don't get stuck), but since you can FLY and monsters can't that's almost never a problem. Since you'll find the majority of the power-ups in the overworld maps anyway, it's entirely possible to avoid most of the combat until your leadership, spells and war chest are so inflated from kiting that you can seriously stomp the game regardless of difficulty.  This game more than any other in the series has way too many step and fetchit quests, which eat up time and money in game by making you run around all over the place for seemingly little more than to pad the gameplay. Seriously, often you're revisiting areas that you depopulated of all opposition forever ago. In it's favor though it does include a ready means of teleportation between the lands, which you're going to use and overuse a lot.  The plot is, like most of these games, insanely stupid and funny and not very serious.   Classes are the standard fare for the series, with a warrior, mage, and paladin archetype - except they're the orc, the vampire and the succubus. I went with the vamp for the first playthrough, the mage class is always good for being able to crush half the life out of an army before the first round even really gets underway. Crystals seem to be much rarer in this game, so choose to learn only the spells you know for a fact you will use a lot.  Second playthrough will be with the succubus, which I may or may not finish depending on if which character you choose changes the gameplay significantly. Past games in the series have avoided this, but since the classes are actually characters in this version one can hope...  At this point, the game engine needs a serious update. Navigation seems primitive now, it hasn't changed since the first game - right along with the ridiculously locked camera angles. The camera itself still seems to fight you even after almost a half-dozen games have been made.  This game should be able to be ported to tablets. No joke. The graphics are pretty badly dated at this point, it's time for an overhaul.  At least this game doesn't deprive you of your special abilities in boss fights, something that was always insanely pointless and unfair in previous entries, although the powers are significantly more limited.  All in all the series continues it's slow decline since Armored Princess. Some serious improvements need to be made and better production values need to be embraced. Still highly enjoyable and definitely worth the cash for all it's little flaws.",

Pros: - Good visuals - Nice level and character design - Funny and interesting quests - Ending plot twist (Yeah, this game has one) Cons: - Bugs that may force you to load a previous save - Repetative gameplay - Horrible quest tracking system  6/10, a game only fans of the series will like.",

Prepare your eyes, you will have a LOT of texts to read because there is no voice acting in the game.  In short: If you like Turn-Based Strategy games it's definitely worth a try.

I have played and finished all Kings Bounty games, but the previous ones felt a bit unispired, some islands were not really woven into the story. This one is different, you play the Dark side, the sory is build on capturing and ruining the best 3x3 good people on different island, and the quests are often intertwined. You have a better sense of achieving something, and so my 134h were great spent. I could complete all but 1 quests (bugged), so the game is in a good state. Playing the dark side, in my case a seductuve Demoness, was a nice change, you almost felt bad for ruining true love, making the most happy person cry and break the most loyal person :) Played on normal, and in contrast to earlier KB games, its almost a bit too easy, as with time, you have access to unlimied supply of troops (if you have enough money). Highly recommended, and looking for the next installment!",

            "review_text": "It's a good game overall. It really is, gives almost as much enjoyment as previous iterations. So why the thumb down? Because there are issues which I'm not willing to see in future releases of this game, nor in any other games for that matter.  There are reviews saying that the developers completly ignored the community. I personally don't care if devs are listening to community or not, as long as they're good enough to release a consistent product. Which this is not. In far too many places it looks like the devs (level designers mostly) were thinking 'ok, here's a draft of a level, I'll save it now and finish it some time closer to the deadline', and then never did. First catacombs are ridiculously lined with eggs along the corridors walls, just like someone would launch a level editor and made click, click, click, click to spray them in few minutes and voila! We have a level! On Whitehill there was not enough will to do even that, it's just a barren land with a couple of enemies and badly aligned textures. Aralan feels deserted even thought there's no reason for that in the story, it's an Elven mainland! Most other levels are ok, but from time to time you'll see things that strike you how someone couldn't be arsed to finish something on a decent level. You don't release something in such a merry state, they should rather cut such unfinished content alltogether. Now it's like a lovely pie with a ball of poo on top instead of a cherry.  Then there are bugs. Not game breaking ones (I haven't had even a single in-game crash), rather little or bigger annoyances. Like inability to have an aspect-ratio correct display with sharp graphics (everything gets soft-scaled with some blurry filter), unless you switch your monitor to game's native resolution (1680x1050) without scaling, which makes things look better (but still not perfect). Or crashes when you switch resolutions (had to edit the configuration file manually). Or crash on every exit. Or some badly working spells. Etc. The point is that it's not that the devs ignore the community. They outright abandoned the product - there were practically no meaningful patches, and probably never will be.  What annoys me most is that publisher is now probably sitting there scoffing 'we released a 20% unfinished product and look how it sells! lets make the next one 60% unfinished, straight in the customers face hahaha!' And they will charge it 30 euro, with 60% of levels being deserted whitehill lined with eggs, provided that you'll get out of washed-out main menu without a crash, to be fixed with the next patch, which will never come. And we'll buy it.  And that's why I thumb it down. To have the next King Bounty as well designed as The Legend, as bug-free as Crossworlds, and as rich as WotN.  As to what I liked: the overall story is fun, even though I don't empathise with evil scum (I'd rather be a hero). Some dialogues are ingenious, but some are childish (I guess there were several writers). There are no bosses (except the final enemy), which I never liked. There's some new beautifull music by Lind Erebros (he's a russian Paul Romero ;). And it's generally another King's Bounty, which is never enough.  Go get it, and then thumb it down to let the devs/publishers know that they can do better.",

            "review_text": "After having just completed this game on impossible, I really just cannot recommend it. I'm a huge fan of the King's Bounty series but I feel like 1C is just dicking us around at this point. They're releasing a bug-riddled, rehashed, mostly re-appropriated-content game. I don't mind paying for a new 'campaign' essentially since the engine is the same for the most part and they carry over most of the same units, but this is really just a case of relabeling a bunch of units and calling it a day.  If you're an absolute completist, the game isn't unplayable. You should prepare to spend most of your time running around trying to figure out where you're supposed to be going, though, since the quest log is almost useless and you have to guess most of the time where the quests or story wants you to go. Most of the land is pretty lazily designed and doesn't flow that well. There are re-used maps aplenty.  Ultimately, I just don't know if I can keep playing these half-baked games. They have such a solid engine to begin with, they could probably just let some users come up with new stuff for them and release that, but I guess they just really have no intention of caring about these releases. Such a sad fate for such a promising initial entry.",

There is still empty areas and bugs (just try to pick up all of the spider eggs at the beggining I dare you!!) The game is overly hard at the beggining but then it is too easy once you hit level 6 and can sneak into about 80% of the areas and collect everything you need. You can be at level 14 without killing one group after you make it to Portland. The randomness sucks as you pretty much get the same things everytime even in the same place. Replayability is a joke and don't bother playing any race except for Demons. They are the only ones that give you enough units early in the game and the only ones that can sacrifice so you NEVER have to purchase new troops again. I hate to say it but I liked Warriors of the North better. At least when you replayed you can more random items. BTW I am currently at level 21 Vampire I can kill ANYTHING with my Phoenix and Snow Storm combo. Gets reallly boring really fast. I would not recommend until they actually release a new game instead of just spinning out the BEta with no changes. They probably got enough money already and are working on the next release or a DLC for this one like they did for Warriors of The North. Come on guys my 12 year old could do better than this!!!!",

That sounds pretty fun to me. Which is why I keep trying to like this series of games, as the original King's Bounty was such a staple of my childhood. But sadly it is a deeply flawed series, so despite some positive features, just isn't recommendable.   In (literally) the first battle you fight, the opposing army uses abilities that causes your armies to act on their own accord instead of listening to your orders. While the fight itself is easy, this is a good indicator of how the game goes. Design decisions were made that may have sounded tactically interesting, but result in a poor user experience where you often find yourself watching things unfold on-screen with little to no meaningful input on your part.  The AI is also acutely aware that while it can throw limitless hordes at you, you have a very finite force. It often makes decisions that would make no tactical sense in terms of winning the battle, but pick aware at you. Again, this may seem tactically interesting, but the end result is a lot of reloading and long trips back to recruit more soldiers. ",
