Goals are fantastic, hard difficulty is exactly as it entails, Sure graphics are a tad. or very outdated but the game itself is fantastic. animals are very varied, there's many attractions to show, in comparison to vanilla zoo tycoon 2 marine park empire for me is just a tad more intuitive. I wish it had mod support like zoo tycoon though, would've became alot more popular if it did",
