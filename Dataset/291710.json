            "review_text": "One of the very best stories and atmosphere in any adventure game I've played, in a rarified group with Gabriel Knight 2 and 3 for the depth of the story. The ghost hunting adds interesting new gameplay elements to the traditional point and click adventures. The oddities throughout that things aren't what they seem is really well done. Puzzles are mostly logical and interesting and tied in with the great underlying mysteries of the story. The game definitely has some issues. Even with fast travel (I imagine it would have been all but unplayable when it was first released without that), getting around town is annoying. Voice acting is mostly good, but the main character frequently seems to put the stress on the wrong words in sentences as if the actor is reading the dialogue for the first time, which is bizarre since the creator of the game plays the main character. A few of the achievements seem to be broken. Some of the puzzles near the end are pretty terrible -- two (two!!) puzzles that require musical expertise and wandering around a maze trying to spot one elusive clue -- and there are a number of times where it can get frustrating trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done to trigger forward movement in the story. All the negative issues are comparatively minor, however, compared to the strong points. If you like adventure games, this is one of the best and a must play.",

            "review_text": "Notice how most of the neagtive reviews are left by people with less than an hour of gameplay?  This isn't one of those games that scares the crap out of you with jumpscares in the first 5 minutes. This game will give you nightmares if you let it. You will become involved with the story to the point where you feel emotionally tied to it. This game is not for an action junkie, its not for the average gamer either. YOU WILL EITHER LOVE OR HATE THIS GAME, theres no mediocre feeling about it.  The game is slow at times, you will easily sink 30 to 40 hours into it. The atmosphere and the clues tie so perfectly together you will never want to stop playing! Its not a simple point and click game, you'll need to use your clues and your wits to decide what happens next.  If you enjoy horror or mystery and you would like to enjoy a story that will leave you satisfied. You have to look no further.  A word of warning! Do not get bummed out if the first hour of the game isnt scary, listen and look for the clues and hang in there, it gets really interesting after you get to saxton.  P.s. Be careful playing if you are tense, or have anxiety like myself. This games sound and atmosphere will have you looking over your shoulder every 5 minutes.  Still can't play with the light off.... haha!    EDIT: I used a walkthrough, because you will get stuck in this game, events have to play out in order. Which means if you are smart enough to figure out what to do next, it still doesn't matter. Cause nigel has to go through the steps to come to his own conclusion.

I had to refer to the walkthrough on multiple occassions, to find things that i missed or 'duh that was right there' moments.   The game has a unique atmosphere that makes you want to finish it. Keep a notepad handy, you do backtrack to certain locations frequently. The author has been working on the sequel for a while now, and i am looking forward to it. If you like games such as Black Mirror, Dark Fall, Myst, etc. Give this a shot. $10 is a worthy price.",

Its atmosphere is a sort of noir (the large of the image are b&amp;w, only little details are coloured like flowers) that overcomes everything: is it past or present? Is it the now or the future? It's timeless. The plot is very interesting and lure you to know more and more about the story behind the 'lost crown' and ...the murdered! Oh yeah, there is also a misterious killer who track and stalk your protagonist or... maybe is a ghost from ancient past?! Play it and you'll find out!!  Beware to all gamers who don't like slow proceding and very long dialogue, because, maybe, this is the only contra aspect of the game (but on the other hand its slowness is functional to its atmosphere and the development of the story)",

The picture seems a little clearer, but that could be my newer computer. Anyways, onto my opinion of this game. There is definitely a creep factor involved, a few jump scares (that actually add to the story, and are part of it) that are semi effective. Several nightmare sequences that add to the creep factor. The monochromatic coloring with dashes of color thrown in here and there add a good depth without that trashy 'noire' feeling. The dialogue is a bit mundane at times, or maybe that's the likeable despite this main character. It's a bit educational as well, but in a fun, didn't know I was learning way. And if you give it a try, it just might open your mind up to the possibility of there beings things that we can't see or hear, but still very much existing.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, I'm stuck on whether or not to approve or disapprove this game. It's a decent game, whether I thumbs up or down this. Visuals are good, the splashes of color are a nice touch to the game, and the black and white scenarios are different and intriguing, The game itself has somewhat of a Syberia or Journey to the Center of the Earth aspect. (Both great games as well). The visuals are decent, not too appalling, but keeping in mind this is an older game, they're nice. The story is VERY interesting, makes you want to keep playing to know what is going on, even if the gameplay itself is pretty crappy.   Some negatives accompany this review though. The puzzles are...somewhat shotty. Clickable areas are sometimes hard to find, and it becomes a hassle to try and find specific objects, let's say that are lying on the beach. The gameplay itself isn't linear whatsoever, meaning it can stray off on different paths, or force you to do a very specific thing before you can progress at all. I wish I could give this a both thumbs up and a thumbs down, but I can't.  If you like paranormal, puzzler, Syberia-like games, then you might like this. 7/10",
