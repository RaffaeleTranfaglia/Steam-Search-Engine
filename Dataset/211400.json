            "review_text": "Deadlight is a 2.5D side-scrolling action-platformer survival horror zombie game. You and some fellow survivors have been searching for a place called “Safe Point” and also for your wife and daughter who went missing in the past. As Randall Wayne, you have at your disposal the standard free-running mechanics of running, jumping, wall-jumping, rolling, and climbing, all of which help you traverse post-apocalyptic Seattle.  While doing so, you will come across zombie hordes that have infested it, and so you will need to fight them with weapons like axe, revolver or shotgun.   Artistic design of the game consists of beautiful yet post-apocaliptic sceneries; abandoned traffic jams, rain-specked neon motel signs, dark fire escapes - never has a 2.5D world felt so believable. Deadlight's best moments are its intense chases: be that a gauntlet run through a street that's crowded with zombies, or a game of hide-and-seek with a military helicopter in deserted office blocks.  Overall rating: Highly recommended Similar games: Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback.",

            "review_text": "Deadlight is, for me, a perfect palate cleanser. It doesn't do anything 'perfectly' other than setting, but it does everything well. 2d platformer zombie narrative driven quasi puzzle adventure game. whew!. It NAILS its atmosphere. Everything is saturated in darkness. The zombies are almost never fully detailed but are shadows with glowing eyes. The world is a dulled and muted place and although my explanation of it is lacking, all I can say is that graphically they nailed the world and atmosphere. It's linear, no open world here and pretty short. My stats say a total of 4.5 hours for my one run through and I think that I spent 30 minutes on pause.   However, I tend to run two games at the same time and after completing a big one I feel somewhat drained? No, maybe just reluctant to start a new big endeavor....  That is where I found myself starting Deadlight. I had just completed a big open world shooter spending a ton of enjoyed time there and I'm still playing another large RPG and I needed some light fare before I started another big time investment or I knew I'd start something for an hour and never come back.   Deadlight was perfect. Challenging once in a while but never roadblocked. Always moving forward. The story, told in part through roughly drawn comic style cutscenes and partly through the diary of the main character was enough to make me question his sanity and the ulitmate conclusion.   Admittedly, I got this game through a humble bundle so I didn't pay full price but knowing my experience $15/3.5 hours=less than $5 an hour= same price as an itunes rental.....I can totally justify that purchase.  If its sitting in your library and you haven't played it I would totally remcommend it. If you see it on sale, I would totally recomend it. If you need a break from your more intense games, but are still looking to play a game....I would totally recomend it. It's a good experience. A burner. Use, enjoy, dispose.",

Developed by the Spanish Tequila Works, Deadlight is a survival horror platformer game taking place in the '80s during a zombie outbreak. I guess there were two reasons for picking mentioned era: best platformers we refer to as classics were made in those days and as there were no internet and mobile phones at that time the game can really grasp the atmosphere of isolation during the incident.  The game was criticised for its controls - I agree as there are stages where I needed to try and try again after dying many times as I was not able to carefully plan a jump. Also, while the game looks stunning you do not really have a lot of time to look around as the infected are approaching and quick reaction is necessary.   Overall, this is a very good game. Somewhat short and can be maddeningly difficult, Deadlight proves there can be a need for sidescrollers out there and these can be made by utilising modern day's technology.",

Another negative thing other than what I have just mentioned is the 'Nightmare Mode', where you play the game over and it only checkpoints at the end of chapters making it harder to complete. Could they not have made an extra playthrough rather than something that probably no one would even care about. There just needs to be more, there was way too little for such a good game.

You're playing Randall Wayne - a survivor of a zombie apocalypse. Trying to get his way through to Seattle, Randall is forced to be very physical with the world by climbing, jumping, shooting and slashing in order to get to safety. He will come face to face with people who are also trying to survive this mad world and some of these people are not exactly friendly.  The only negative aspect of this game is that it's a bit too short. I managed to finish it in 6 hours and I was not rushing it, I like to explore and check out every nooks and crannies.

As you progress throught the game you end up repeating numerous times puzzle sequences that require a timely use of specific actions/combinations of moves - if you fail, instakill and repeat. Story is somewhat average - 1/3 of the game is a boring episode disconnected from main plot that someone pushed inside the game storyline and glued the ends together to make it fit with entire story arc.

They do miss the mark for sidescrolling platformer quality in certain ways, but while the experience isn't entirely satisfying, Deadlight left me content.   Story was pretty run-of-the-mill as zombie apocalypse goes but certainly enough to keep me going. I liked the protagonist's character concept and also his found diary pages for the dark introspection they lent to the experience. The survival/combat mechanics are engaging since melee and ranged weapons are very obviously designed as tools for escape or progression rather than mass meat grinding as in other entries to the zombie genre. Every action should be considered and well timed.   I did not have enough interest to attempt the game on nightmare mode after the first completion, and my hours played reflect what I imagine is a typical run with additional minutes spent trying (and failing) to hunt down all of the secret extras. My handful of hours also include a couple of retries on one or two challenging areas.    Outside a tricky few encounters, gameplay on standard difficulty is more fun than frustrating. However, as with so many platformers (independents in particular) the control scheme is a bit too touchy here, not responsive enough there, and oh why does that dodge button just refuse to work out brilliantly no matter which key I bind it to? If you're unlucky, a (longstanding and well documented) audio bug might deprive you of the cutscene voice acting, which is actually quite good despite a few cheesy lines of dialogue. Don't worry, you can look them up online or troubleshoot it.    Story, gameplay, level design and overall 'production values' seem deliberately limited in scope, but what's there is mostly satisfying and an okay recommendation to any players seeking a slightly off the beaten path sidescroll platformer in the zombpocalypse setting.  TIP: Use a gamepad/controller if you can; this one punishes platforming on M+KB. TIP: Be prepared for zombies to present a greater challenge individually and in small groups than they would in other games.",

The backdrops in this sidescrolling platformer made me want to stop and look around more but we all know that is never a good idea when zombies are lurking about. I didn't find the puzzles overly complicated and I believe that may have been by design so the pacing of the story would not be interrupted by long delays solving them. I used an XBOX controller when playing, so I can't speak to how intuitive the keyboard controls feel, but this game was designed for the controller and it felt good to hold one in my hand again after so many hours at the keyboard and mouse. I had a few sound issues during the cell shaded cut scenes where my sound cut out completely, but I could usually infer what was being said by the graphic novel style presentation the designers used. All things considered, if your looking for a good atmospheric zombie tale without all the blood and gore that usually accompanies the genre, you'll like Deadlight and have fun playing it. I'd give it an 8/10 with the sound issues, 9/10 without them.",

All in all a nice game but with way some problems like trying to pause which for some reason freezes it for 20 seconds and clunky controls which can get in the way of traversing the levels.  Could be worse I guess, wait for a sale if you plan on getting it and hope that the devs learned from this and if they plan on making a second one.  Ps.

            "review_text": "I must admit that I have an unnatural attraction to play zombie apocalypse games, so I was quite eager to see what Deadlight had to offer.  At this point in time, I am quite sure that most people reading this review are familiar with the concept of zombie apocalypse. If not - here is the concept in broad strokes: Due to some mysterious reason (either virus outbreak, genetic mutations or just something strange in the water), the recently deceased start rising back as flesh eating zombies (which from now on will be referred as shadows, to be consistent with the game nomenclature), killing and infecting everyone they scratch or bite. Only a selected few manage to escape the outbreak, and this is where the struggle for survival begins - not only from the shadows, that are just looking for an healthy snack - but also from ruthless groups of survivors that prey from the weak.  So, it is in this setting that we find our character - Randall Wayne - traveling alongside a small group of survivors in hopes of finding a reported 'Safe Point' in Seattle. We meet the group when a member just got bitten (as invariably happens) and head shot by Randall for the greater good . It is common knowledge that gunfire will attract shadows to you as fire attracts moths, so soon enough the group is overrun by shadows and Randall is separated from all the others. I could continue telling the story, but all in all it is textbook generic and doesn't bring anything that we haven't seen before.  However, the story is not the big selling point of deadlight. For all old timers that kept on playing games from the 80's and 90's, this is a good opportunity to play a 2D platformer that has a similar feel to the original Prince of Persia.   The atmosphere of Deadlight is also a very strong point. The backgrounds on all sets are amazing, very detailed and bring a certain degree of dark realism when portraying a dying world. It is interesting to see that the opposite happens with the characters that bring life to Deadligth's universe - they are mostly dark outlines of them, shadows as it may - which makes the choice of denominating the zombies as 'Shadows' an intriguing creative decision, to say the least.  There is also a never ending supply of shadows. Stay too long fighting in one place, and more will come. Fire a couple of shots, and soon enough you will be be swarmed. Bullets will not settle the score - they will only buy you extra few seconds to escape. That being said - it is also quite possible to finish Deadlight without firing many shots, as long as you time your actions just right.  The controls are all you can expect: They are responsive and simple. However, they also bring a negative point that clearly indicates that this is a console port - they are mapped in such way that makes the combination of some actions (double jump or sprinting + crouching) an awkward task. Most people will find this as a perfect excuse to unleash their rage and justify their failures every time Randall dies...  ... and he will, that I can guarantee!!! Even though there aren't any particular difficulty spikes, there will be plenty of events that will catch you off-guard. From platforms falling, being swarmed by shadows, shot by humans, or situations that will require nimble fingers, there will be plenty of opportunities to get Randall killed. But not to worry, Deadlight auto-saves regularly, with checkpoints conveniently placed to let you retry as much as you like until you reach a state of perfection.    To simply sum it up in one sentence: the mechanics, the puzzles and level construction - all of those elements blend quite nicely with the dark environment and great visuals of Deadlight.  If you are feeling inspired, it is likely that you will be able to finish the main story in one sitting. Even in the hardest setting, it took me only a couple of hours to accomplish that. However, it also brings great replayability value. Each act / scene will record the time taken to complete, and you will be compelled to play them over and over again, just to find all the secrets or to improve your time. The plus side is that you can select the act / scene you want to play, as long as it was completed once. This is a great feature if you want to train the most difficult parts before tackling Nightmare mode. And what is 'Nightmare' mode, you ask? Upon finishing the first run, we are given the opportunity to play Deadlight in a mode where there are no check points - meaning that you only have one shot to complete it from start to finish. Die once, and you are back to square one. Personally, I haven't completed this one, but a little shadow told me that people who have will gain access to an alternative ending that may be rather enlightening.  So, if you have Deadlight lost in your steam library, just enjoy it, and let me know how it went.",

The game itself is fun as hell. It's a 2-D scroller with a 3-D background which looks really cool in a sort of Apocalyptic Noire fashion. The gameplay itself is fun. You get weapons sparingly and always need to make decision regarding how you are going to deal with the zombies (or Shadows as they are called in this game). You have a stamina bar which is drained when running or engaging in melee combat. You have a very limited amount of bullets for any guns you find. You are however quite acrobatic, and running, jumping, diving, and rolling are equally important from a tactical standpoint. There are also som cool trap sequences, and in many parts, you can use the environment to your advantage as well.  Finally, the story is also really quite interesting, and unlike most games, the 'secrets' (aka hidden objects) are very easy to find, although with the undead on your tail, you may not have time to grab them, lol  I think this is a definite must own.

            "review_text": "Deadlight is a sidescrolling survival horror/puzzle game with nice presentation value, mostly solid controls, and a tendency to take itself just a bit too seriously in the story department.  Let me clarify: for its price, this isn't a bad title by any means. The above strengths make up for the shortcomings well enough. It's just that when you have a game with a setup this relatively simple, you'd expect it to surprise you in at least a few ways. Portal did this with a pitch-black sense of humor that blended seamlessly with a frighteningly sterile, claustrophobic atmosphere. Unfortunately, while the atmosphere is certainly there, there are a few things that really hamper the experience its trying to create.   The Abe's Odysee style sidescrolling makes for some great visuals, as the interplay of the background and foreground does a lot to enhance the otherwise banal sight of zombies wandering around the broken urban landscape. Sadly this leads to a bit of frustration when you can't tell if a zombie is within axing range or just outside, and you'll burn up your stamina or bullets really fast swinging or shooting frantically at the so-called 'Shadow' only to find that he'll still get ahold of you. Furthermore, there is some highlighting of climbable surfaces, but its not terribly consistent, so often of times you'll die in the same space over and over only to find there was a wire or pipe you could have latched onto. It gets even worse when the game reflex-tests you by sliding down a hill or chasing you through the busy streets, all the while tripping over piles of cardboard boxes you had no idea were in your way to begin with and wondering why you couldn't just take the staircase instead of hopping from handrail to handrail like an Assassin's Creed character. A few times I walked by a zombie trapped in a car and was a little disapointed that he couldnt reach me from where he was, a missed opportunity for a trap mechanic for all those times you're in a hurry to take cover. Use of the sort-of 2D is excellent visually, but from a game mechanic standpoint I wish it had been developed more.  Melee combat is appropriately messy and hectic, though sometimes a bit too much as occasionally you'll whiff completely on a finishing blow you know should have connected. The stamina bar that depletes with everything from climbing and swinging to running and simply holding onto a ledge also gives you good cause to mind your limits, as running out makes your swings pitifully ineffective and slow. Ammo however should not have been so plentiful at times, and headshots get far too easy when you realize all the zombies are roughly the same height and typically come at you from the same angle, though some will duck a bit lower to charge. It gets the most intense when you start to see zombies pour in from the background and you know it just isnt worth the risk to clear all of them, forcing you to find a way to get out of reach double-quick. I especially like how hard they are to get past when they group up, and how fast you die if you just try to shove past them, which has the nice effect of making you pay attention to all the angles so you can avoid or go around them. The puzzles are bit basic and usually involved shooting a target to clear the way, moving a block to climb up, or in a few circumstances--I wish there were more-- baiting a zombie into a trap. They work fine as a way of breaking up the game's more frantic moments, but they could stand to be a bit more challenging.  I won't go too far into the soundtrack, except to say that it sets the tone wonderfully. The sound as a whole in this game presents itself adequately: the zombies sound like zombies, the guns sound like guns.  And then Randall opens his mouth.  This game's writing has what I like to call 'Hideo Kojima syndrome': the story isn't exactly bad, but the writing is horrendous to the point where the voice acting is hard to judge because you can't tell if they're phoning it in or speaking at the grade level they assume the audience to be. Every line from Randall or any of the characters sounds like something you'd hear in a middle school creative writing class: obvious, redundant, and surprising only in its capacity to convey only the vaguest impression of an emotion. And while this game's story goes through the motions of practically every zombie-themed game or movie--main character looking for his family which may or may not be dead, predatory military scavengers leeching off of survivors, one lone supporting character survivor at the end, etc--it could have easily been redeemed with some greatly improved writing to go with the honestly pretty damn good atmosphere this game already has. The concept-art cutscenes range from boring to unintentionally hilarious, especially at the end when the main character has a terrifying revelation that (insert the most obvious twist ever here) and his eyes go so wide I wanted to take a screenshot and use it as my steam icon, preferably with humorous text at the bottom.  'YER DEAD!' --stereotypical southern military dude, who was at least nice enough to let me turn around, draw, and kill him in spite of having me in his sights the whole time.  Wait a second, this game takes place in Canada! What are stereotypical southern military dudes doing in...nevermind.  So why am I recomending this game? Because I'm a sucker for it's spiritual predecessor, Abe's Odysee. BecauseI love the visuals that the 2D plane grants and the jumping, running, and climbing feel really good. Because I don't always feel in control of the combat. Because its a game that dares to do something new with a motif that's been done to death in other genres. and that alone makes it very hard for me to dislike this game. So go ahead, take a chance. At worst, you'll be giving a developer with considerable potential a shot at making a better game later.",

The graphics and artwork of a destroyed post apocalyptic Seattle were stunning and the character development and pacing are well done. My only beef was with the puzzle elements of the game, being rudimentary and annoying to the point where they just felt like they were holding up the real gameplay and story progression.(Ratman I'm looking at you) The nightmare mode as a reward for finishing doesn't offer much in the way of replayability but overall the game is worth picking up for the single playthrough.

Positive :  Music/sound effects Story (short but good) Simplicity  Negative : The Pc port is not as optimised as the console version as some parts it feels like im losing control when i was using my xbox controller on pc version.  Nightmare mode : Is my biggest issue, if you are not into 100% completion then ignore this but this achievment is silly, like i tried for an hour then gave up, i know few ppl done it but it does require lots of time and trial on top of the bugsthat still in game, just not going to bother.

The last of us is there too but it's not on steam so...)   let's strat with the Cons- Projection of the protagonist!  While all other characters are believable( thanks to good writing and voice-acting but the protagonist is the biggest misfit. He is always gruffy and way too macho. His actions on the screen and the dialogues are kinda mismatch most of the time. while on screen the character is running and dodging (even)from 2-3 zombies but the dialogues suggest that the protagonist will bring out his blades of chaos at any time soon and slaughter them once n for all.  no character backgrounds!  Even though the characters sound very interesting(they are scared but hopeful and   one is outright crazy  ) but there is little backstory provided. protagonist's diary and collectibles give some info about the npcs but there is no character developement during the story progression.  Story!  Continuing from the above points, the story leaves almost no impact because most of the characters and 'motives' of these characters are left unattended . The game is much more enjoyable if played with low expectations from the story. The story writer sets up the premise very nicely but by the end you'll be left with many questions. major spoiler   you spend a major time(even running from an effing attack chopper) in search of a 'son of the rat' and in the last act after the protagonists is captured, the captors asked about the same 'boy'. But there is no further information. It's probably the biggest loose end and leaves a bad taste in the mouth when you see the credits role.     Difficulty spike!  Most of the game is fairly simple. You will die regularly while exploring but it's a straightforward game till you reach the last act. Suddenly the game decides to spike the difficulty and the idea of spiking the difficulty is making the controls unresponsive. Now, I am  not  ♥♥♥♥♥ing here. In most of the game you can foresee what button presses you'll need to flawlessly traverse from ledges to ledges and you can press them quickly and see the animation of your character flowing through the section(even with a delay due to longer movement-animations) but during the last act i was consciously pressing the buttons hard and they would not register properly or with a delay. 80% of my deaths occurred in 2 sections of the last act.   Now on to the pros: ART STYLE! ART STYLE!   ART STYLE!    Art style is good enough reason to pick this game up and play it from the beginning to the end. The color pallet sets the mood of the game. There is death and destruction every where but more often than I expected, I found myself just walking slowing and taking in the scenery. It's mesmerizing!! I am sure I could have finished the game in about 4 hours but it took me just over 6 hours(and over 50 screenshots) to finish my first playthrough.  NPCs &amp; collectibles :  There are not many npcs but all of them are voice-acted well. They help setting up the mood. there are many collectibles in the game and some of them need you explore a bit. Many of them trigger additional remarks by the main character and they further reinforce the tone of post-apocalyptic world.  Music  for 90% of the game there is no music! lol, yes! then why is a pro? because whatever little music is there it is very apt and very strong. Sad music plays when the game's protagonist is in flash back or while thinking/talking about his family &amp; in the run n escape sequenes a fast paced music score adds to the sense of urgency.   BLACK MAGIC!!!!???  This game has some black magic going on for sure! Whole day long at work, all i could think of was 'what will happen next in deadlight?'. This has happened with me after a long time and i am sure this will happen with you too.  I am certainly recommending everyone to experience this game at least once but also hope this game gets a sequel and dev team share a deeper story in that.",

I think the controls were a little tricky at times but mostly they worked. The difficulty of the game was my biggest problem as it swung wildly from being moderately challenging most of the time to being almost impossible on some sections. I would play 30 minutes with very little problem and suddenly get stuck on a section for 15-20 minutes having to do it over and over just to get through. The last 15 minutes of the game contained a particularly bad section which almost made me give up.  If the game's difficulty had been tuned better or multiple difficulty levels had been offered I would consider it a success. As it stands I see it as an almost great game that fell a bit short.",

The game has a good feeling “darkness” to it. In certain situations, the best strategy was to run for your life as you simply can't blast your way through hordes of walking dead. I really enjoyed that. I felt this helped mix up the gameplay, analyze your surroundings and choose the best course of action. You felt like you were just trying to survive rather than destroy every last zombie on earth and save humanity.  The only complaints I would have is the game is a little short, (never the less, extremely entertaining) and the controls are not perfectly smooth at times. To clarify, the controls aren't by any means “bad”, just funky mechanics in some situations.  Overall, I very much enjoyed Deadlight. It was very refreshing to play through. 9/10",

While I don't regret the purchase, 2 more episodes would really have made it worth the money spent. 2. Controls can be a little finicky, like when when you hang from a window or on a fence and move to the other side, quite often Randall seems to move right back to the other side unless you really touch the movement control very lightly.

Deadlight is a zombie apocalypse game placed in Seattle.  Graphics/Art: The graphics are awesome! I like very much how everything works around. The enviroment has a ghrey color which set the mood of the game. What i liked most of all is when the cutscene goes off and it shows you the story though images that are like manga drawings. It just couldnt be better cause it gives you an other view of graphics and art instead of just having a lame cutscene. The graphics in general have a lot of dark element but they are detailed enough and the good thing about it is that this game is not overloaded with usless elements so it can play on older systems aswell. The soundtracks are very good setting you on the moody atmosphere. Another great thing is the voice acting, it really makes you feel that this is an awesome game and the actor really gave his best.  Gameplay: When i found out about this game it had been long time since i had played a platform game and i was really exited about it! The gameplay is easy in order to understand but it is kinda difficult to use as the controls feel kinda slow, meaning it has like half a second delay on the movement in order to make the character stop or move, at least thats what i felt. Dont expect high and mighty combat. Most times you are going to try avoiding conflict with the zombies if you play the game on hard difficulty. Of course the checkpoints allow you to do as much mistakes as you want and you can try anything. The game has a nightmare mode where you have to pass the whole game on one go. Dont even try that! Its impossible to achieve. At a general view the game is very challenging and you cannot call it easy. My playthough on normal mode was 4 hours but not rushing on i searched the whole game, it makes this a small game but definitely worth it. I just wish it was a little bigger than that. I also liked that you had to explore in detail in order to finish the game on 100%.   Plot: The story takes place in Seattle 1986, where the whole world devastated by a virus outbreak that makes people zombies and our main character is seperated from his wife Shannon and Daughter Lydia. So the game begins and our main character is with a group of people trying to survive on the total chaos. Randal (main character) came to Seattle after hearing some information that there was a safe point for people that survived. Some incidents make him seperate with the group and now he is on his own until he finds them. Now i'm not gonna spoil the rest of the story for you but all you have to know is that it is interesting enough to keep you going. It is definitely a story hard to be found on a platform game.",

The platforming and puzzles are nice and simple but can become complex if you don't see some of the small things. However, 'crouch-sliding' is almost an impossibility and the puzzle with it is very agrivating. Also, the main character cannot take many hits from zombies (which I can understand) but it is not that hard to swing a fireaxe and it shouldn't take 4-5 hits to kill a zombie. Maybe it is hard to kill a zombie, but the main character should be a bit more attuned to using weapons to deal with zombies. It's an okay game if you can get past the few mistakes.",

It's easy to pick up and doesn't get too repetitive at all. It combines puzzle elements with platformer traits and quick-reaction trap dodging. Obviously you also get to shoot zombies or smash their brains in with an axe, which is always enjoyable. I do wish the game was longer, however, since it seemed to end just as I felt I was in the thick of it. As well as this, there is some pretty irritating moments where the game mechanics seem to fail you, whether it's when you're trying to open a simple door or evade a trap at just the right moment. Prepare to die a lot of times before completing certain traps, since you have to get the timing exactly right, which is pretty frustrating. However, it was still a thoroughly entertaining game that I definitely recommend.   Pros     The graphics and lighting are beautifully done, creating a perfect atmosphere for the requried mood in every scene.    Is not repetitive at all due to the varying means of progressing through levels, whether it's with puzzles, intense chase sequences or blasting down some enemies.    The game doesn't hold your hand in telling you where to go. I certainly had to think hard about getting through certain parts of the game, which was good.    Very nice gameplay.    The story certainly gets better as the game goes on, with a very nice ending.    Cons     Some of the voice acting was quite weak, which took you out of the story sometimes.    I felt quite frustrated from time to time when your character would take about 50 trillion years to pick up an item or climb a wall when a horde of zombies were right behind you.    The game is a bit too short for my liking.

Story is ok, almost entirely told through protagonist's diary (as for what happened before the game's beginning), and some of the pages are lost and need to be found around the city (which is not really logical, but ok)... Gameplay is ok, nothing spectacular, but intense and fun...  The bad; So, the game is short... This is not the type of game that should last for 50 hours, but a few more would be fine... Although there are achievements and collectibles, I didn't feel like I wanted to play it again, just for few missed things...

It plays fluidly, difficulty ramps up gradually and the backstory is pretty enjoyable. The game itself is fairly short, clocking in at a couple of hours not including nightmare difficulty and secret levels and is generally worth playing. The post-outbreak atmosphere is captured well especially in the first few levels and generally throughout the game. Slightly more action-packed than the Walking Dead, but the setting and the overall feeling are very similar.  The big downside to the game (as other reviews point out) is the ending, which detracts from the experience quite a lot. The overall pacing is weirdly off as well, which throws the feeling of danger to the side every once in a while - for example finding pages of your diary all over the place does not help the suspension of disbelief - but if you don't concentrate on the poor pacing, overall the story is alright up until the last 30-ish minutes where pacing and difficulty start to be very glaringly off (there is a sudden and unexpected difficulty spike as well, that doesn't seem to serve any purpose towards the end - possibbly it's to extend game hours slightly). If it wasn't for the rest of the game being genuinely great, I'd probably not recommend it, but as it is, the gameplay is 9/10 and the narrative is a passable 5/10 mainly due to the pacing and the ending so all in all the game is a strong, enjoyable one.

Death restarts you at a checkpoint, but the checkpoints are close together.  The backgrounds are beautiful, and the animation of the humans is amazingly fluid.  The story will feel familiar to anyone who plays zombie games or watches The Walking Dead, and the game captures the atmosphere perfectly. The protagonist's back story, revealed gradually as the game progresses, is unusually dark.  The 'run!' sequences are exhilarating.

But if not, be prepared to repeat and repeat certain sections of the game, time and again. The crux of all these problems are the key combo presses. You can crouch. But to roll requires you to be running. When you're actually moving, stop for any reason and you loose momentum - meaning you cannot roll. Yep - roll through that little opening ahead of you. Oh look, you've just died again because a trap has impaled you.  Added to that is the fact that it appears the devs have lined up sequences where you can JUST about complete them before your imminent death. Trial and error get ultimately frustrating, but the overall quality of the game pulls you through.  Without a pad and/or patience - 5.5/10 With both, easily an 8/10  ",

It keeps you locked into the task at hand. Graphics are very nice - the beautiful backdrops really evoke a world in decay. The controls require you to be quite precise with your movements, ala the original Prince of Persia or Out of This World, but sometimes they are quite clunky. Combat is pretty iffy too, but I think it's all in keeping with the idea that you're not a tank, but just a regular survivor trying to make his way through. Avoiding conflict keeps you moving along more than anything.  I'm glad it went on sale during the holidays though, as $15 is quite steep for the length of the gameplay.  TL;DR - 7/10.

It's probably 3-4 hours if you just play straight through the normal campaign; 8 if you look for a 100% completion to get the secret items. The 80's retro items are amusing. I really like that the game doesn't try to explain every little detail; it makes some dark implications. Alternatively, some of the story bits seem a bit forced and like they didn't develop as much as was scripted. Pros and cons... Overall, I was pleased with the game. It's worth picking up for $5 and spending an evening on. I'm not going to bother with Nightmare mode though.",

If you don't know Out of This World, it goes like this: you must make your way through the levels, jumping on platforms and solving environmental puzzles, rarely attacking enemies, because you are weak, and get tired easily. So you must use your brain and reflexes to survive. Amazing graphics, too. Fully recommended!",

Of all zombie settings, film or game, it really makes you feel L4D, without the humour mind you.  Gameplay itself is great. Well thought out interactions, movement and puzzles didn't feel like puzzles for the sake of puzzles (most of them anyway), though there are some response issues near the end where precision in traversing sections are somewhat harder. Issues that come from the translation from console to keyboard which are not as crisp, code wise, as they should be to handle true precision input. In those moments it felt laggy. and death/failure due to the inability for the game to acknowledge (as in 'at all', not just late) at times just because of a split second difference that was disagreeable to the ported code. That and the fact that this is yet another game that will only support official XBox controllers and not respond at all with other 3rd party pads... a real shame because those are the two things that pushed me over the line to choose not to replay this in nightmare mode, or again in the future.",

I think the controls were a little tricky at times but mostly they worked. The difficulty of the game was my biggest problem as it swung wildly from being moderately challenging most of the time to being almost impossible on some sections. I would play 30 minutes with very little problem and suddenly get stuck on a section for 15-20 minutes having to do it over and over just to get through. The last 15 minutes of the game contained a particularly bad section which almost made me give up.  If the game's difficulty had been tuned better or multiple difficulty levels had been offered I would consider it a success. As it stands I see it as an almost great game that fell a bit short.",

Most of the game is comprised of parkour style running, trial and error puzzles, and zombie encounters(that for the most part you're better off trying to outsmart and avoid). If you want a zombie-slaying game, this won't be it. You spend a lot of time without a weapon and during these times, the game teaches you that you don't a;ways have to fight the dead to beat them.

The storyline follows a straightforward formula, but it's well told so that doesn't go against it.  However, rather than the plot, music, or mechanics, the one thing I'll remember the most about this game is the cheap deaths. I put 8 hours into playing this game (according to the in-game timer), and I'd estimate that about 2 of those hours were spent repeating levels where the NPCs kill you before you can react, or when the environment decides it's going to kill you when you think you're past the danger zone. For example, in one chapter, you run through a collapsing tunnel and get onto a ladder at the end of it. The music calms, the screen stops shaking, you jump to another ladder and part of the ceiling falls off to kill you. Or another scene where you're running from armed NPCs behind you when two suddenly appear in front of you to kill you before you can shoot them.

The main character isn't trying to solve the zombie infestation or save humanity. Hell, he isn't even trying to find out how to cure it or what caused it. And I have to say thank god for that! I'm sick of seeing games where 'only you can save us all'. It's nice to play a story set inside a world where the characters must react to the environment rather than try to change it.  Ok, now that that's said let's get to the nitty gritty. As a platformer this game is passable, it's not great but it's not terrible either. There are some moments where it seems the controls a unresponsive or laggy but that may have been my system. Combat is basic and is something of a last resort, you won't exactly be killing the undead hordes. For the most part this game is a puzzle platformer, working out what what bit to shoot with your pistol or slingshot to collapse thing x or extended platform y. The art style is nice, although I can't help but feel that it could've been made clearer what is part of the background and what is a climbable surface. Yes, there are hint 'lights' to show you what is climbable but when your in one of the 'running' scenes I found little time to actually go looking for them. It's a short game with not much replay value. If you complete the game on easy or normal it unlocks a harder setting but beyond making the enemies harder to kill there's no noticeable change. The levels have some collectibles that reveal your characters past in more depth as well as give background on world around you.  So overall, yes, it's a good game and you should play it but don't expect a long experience or anything too revolutionary with the control system. I would recommend for the price to drop from its current £9.99 pricepoint though.",

Very similar in style to Limbo, Randy makes his way through the wasteland that has become Seattle in search of his friends and his family. The plot isn't terribly original and has a predictable ending. The controls don't always want to do what I want them to, which at one point was particularly frustrating, what with a building falling around and on top of me, and the cutscenes randomly drop their audio due to a bug in the Bink codec that comes with the game. I did enjoy the game overall, but I don't think I'll be taking on the Nightmare mode (game is exactly the same, but if you die you go back to the beginning of the chapter, which is pretty hardcore).

This is a really cool title marred by a lack of needed quality control during the port to PC.  Pros: GREAT visuals  Mostly good voice acting, especially from the main character. Female voice acting is oddly not as up to par as the men's voicing for some reason, however.  Good moody soundtrack.  When this game flows, it flows very well.  Decent if unremarkable plot.  Cons: Complete inability to remap controls and existing controls are pretty bad (notably the location of crouch)  Game completely falls off by the end, leaving you constantly repeating trial and error scenarios. This is where the flow of the game breaks hard. Whereas early on it is fairly intuitive, expect a lot of 'bs' deaths by the end due to bad pacing.  Sound refuses to work on some cut scenes. This is a problem other Deadlight players have had, as well.  Lack of logic interferes with the game. Example: Bullets magically can't shoot through glass when that's what the design wants. Main character is a forest ranger who can for whatever reason parkor like a god, but can't swim- no explanation given for this. Gets disarmed of his weapons and despite being right next to an assault rifle, he ignores it.   Controls are weirdly unresponsive at times. This is critical in a tension paced platformer.   Utter lack of direction of what/where you're supposed to do or where to go. This is a hassle in a game where it is very difficult to determine what platforms you can walk on and what is background. Some environmental targets have context based highlighting, but only when you're particularly near them instead of being readily available. Considering you 'interact' with these at range, that's a nuisance.  No real care taken in the port to PC. You will see gamepad directions everywhere. There's a general lack of polish here.  Basically, I don't regret playing the game but this is unachieved potential- it could have been sooo much better with just a little more care put into the port.",

            "review_text": "Another great indie game (set in Canada and developped by a Spanish team lol) with fantastic visuals despite it being a 2D side-scrawling game. The game manages to create a believable post-apocalyptic universe where 'shadows' (aka zombies with red glowing eyes) have taken over the world and people are just trying to survive amidst the chaos and fear. The story is compelling and well-narrated by the main character as you progress through the environments and his journal and other collectibles you find along the way help to fully flesh out his character and the situation that he finds himself in. If you pay close attention you may realize that all is not as it seems and that the alternate ending is the 'real' ending. The combat is refreshingly different as it's in your best interest to avoid the infected as much as possible and cleverly lure them into specific positions so as to better circumvent them or gleefully watch them stupidly plummet to their deaths (second deaths? True deaths? bah, damn zombies screwing things up again!) as you taunt them into following you into deadly pitfalls. You will shimmy across telephones lines while below dozens of undead reach towards you only to have the cable snap and have you rushing like a madman away from the monstrous horde. At other times you'll be tasked with using elements of the environment to help you navigate safely through roaming zombies or fleeing from an attacking helicopter intent on turning you into ground beef across the rooftops of a ruined city. You do get access to powerful guns (and melee weapons) at various points in the game but these sections are rare and never last very long, forcing you to never get too comfortable or feel too safe :P  Can be completed in 5 hours or so, a bit longer if you're a completionist.

The game's backgrounds are amazing. It is obvious that a lot of work went into the aesthetics of the game. I really liked the story too; I've read that others thought it was weak but I disagree. The overall plot line was very good; although there were probably things in the story that could have been improved with better editing. I thought it was very cool that the main character would find various things that helped bring some humanity to the game. Things like findiing I.D.s, audio tapes, pictures and a diary of the main character really helped add immersion to the story. I thought that part was excellent.  My dislikes of the game included the occassional difficulty of getting all of the jumps, rolls, etc. perfect in order to pass to the next scene. There were a couple of areas that took multiple tries to get through. The worst offender was a helicopter chase scene that must have taken about 15 tries; really? That was very frustrating. There was also a big defect that I ran into where the main character fell through the bottom of the world and didn't die; he just kept screaming and falling. A reload of the checkpoint got past that problem.  My overall impressions: I think that this was a touching and immersive game with some very cool artistic backdrops. I loved the artistic details and attention to little things that helped make the world seem more real. I recommend the game but warn others that it isn't a total masterpiece and has some technical problems. I felt that this should have been an immersion game with story and beauty first. If the incredibly restrictive timed button mashing sequences had been removed, the game would have been improved. Going through these difficult to master sequences of button mashing broke that immersion to some extent; however, never totally ruining the experience.",

Aesthetically, the game is solid - the Unreal Engine still looks nice. In between 'stages' the world is played out in almost a sketched- comic book fashion.   Controls: The big thing that holds this game back from being great are the controls and the 'gotcha' moments - read - unfair deaths. There were many times when I would be playing and would want my character to one thing, but instead he did another which caused me to fall to my death, or be killed by a trap.   Mechanics Speaking of traps, there is a portion of this game that you must navigate that is filled with them, and this is the 'gotcha' moments. You don't die because of lack of skill, or understanding the controls, you die because the games does not make it clear enough what is going to cause your death. There were even a few parts where I wanted to jump from one part to another, but it wasn't explicit as to what was the background and what was in the foreground - that was a bit frutstrating.

There is no punishment for this as you start over at the last checkpoint which is usually a few seconds from where you died, but for a game who’s art style and audio went to a lot of trouble to create a sense of immersion constantly retrying a check point because I didn’t understand what to do and got swarmed by the undead really takes you out of the story. There are three chapters to this relatively short game. I started in on chapter 3 and after dying a handful of times decided to move on to other things, not so much because the game was too hard to complete, I could have forced my way through, but I totally lost interest in the world the game was trying to create.",

Hands down the best looking platformer ever made.  That said...the gameplay and story bite.   The writing is atrocious, and they cram tons of it down your throat with cutscenes and diary entries galore. Do yourself a big favor and don't waste time on reading the diary.  The gameplay seems at first to be a tense affair as you parkour to avoid hordes of zombies. The game is at its best when you're trying to stay one step ahead of pursuing zombie packs as you vault from roof to roof. Sadly, this doesn't last long. While the game is gorgeous, it does a poor job of highlighting what you can interact with. The majority of your deaths are going to come not from challenges, but from trying to jump to a ledge, only to find that it was part of the background and not something you could grab on to.  I could stil forgive that if the game was all tense zombie chases, but the entire middle third of the game shifts to an awful sewer level that serves as a literal obstacle course. Some hermit wants to see how agile you are, so he has you run through courses with wooden targets and zero zombies. You carry around a slingshot going PLINK PLINK PLINK against wooden targets that release ramps. This section lasts a good hour or more. WHO IN THE WORLD THOUGHT THIS WAS MORE FUN THAN THE ZOMBIE HORDE LEVELS? The sewers have the same amount of insane background detail as the rest of the game, so it's not even like they rushed it to lengthen the game; the same amount of effort went into creating that snoozefest portion of the game.  So, that's two-thirds of the game with tense zombie chases dragged down by falling through illusionary platforms, and one-third of the game an unredeemable boring obstacle course. The whole time you get carpal tunnel from hammerin gthe mouse button to skip the diary and story scenes. It's a darn shame because words cannot describe how gorgeous this game is. Even though Mark of the Ninja's gameplay is infinitely better, I had trouble enjoying it after this because now I expect every platformer to be this visually breathtaking.",

Here's why:  It hardly does anything to innovate, the gameplay mechanics are way too simple, you can walk, jump and every so often use a weapon which is extremely ineffective. Other than that, they don't do anything original whatsoever. The game is based around a double-clichéd story. A world invested with zombies after a catastrophic event and a man trying to find his family in the chaos. Unfortunately, they don't give propper background for the story which makes it confusing at best. As for the protagonist, you can hardly make an emotional connection, the voice acting is great but the writing is poor. The controls are quite clumsy too, although I didn't try a controller, the mouse and keyboard controls are uneasy. This often leads to very frustrating deaths. The game is packed with puzzles, but often they don't give any hints on how to solve them, or the hints are too obvious removing any form of challenge. The puzzles are not very innovative either, just boring find a way to get to the other side of 'object X'. It runs pretty smoothly and the visuals are not bad, especially the shadows look quite nice, but then again, it's just a 2D game. The maps are pretty simple too and you're never in the same place for very long in order to enjoy the view. Then lastly, the game is really short, so you can't really connect to it and by the time you get familiar with the game you're alreay halfway trough. You can beat it in under 5 hours. And there are no optional objectives or any collectibles interesting enough to strech your game length. Just the linear stroyline. Perhaps, had it been a bit more interesting, or had there been a co-op mode I could have recommended this game. But, as it is, this game is so incredibly mediocre it's actually bad. I'm not just bashing on this game because I hate it. I tried to enjoy it multiple times, and at first it was really charming, but eventually it gets so dull you don't have the motivation to keep on playing.

Ill give you a hint; it rhymes with IT SUCKS MY R3CTUM. Jesus Christ where do I even begin? We could start at the clunky, sticky controls that don't let you react in real time to anything.

Then I could talk about the enemies that are never consistent with their appearances from the background into the foreground that ultimately catch you when you try to run around then, no matter what angle you take. Oh! Oh! Oh, then I could talk about the puzzles! Oh boy!  If you would deem to even give them such an undignified association with something that usually has a little tiny bit of self-esteem written into it, you could appreciate the sections of game where you have you run through a collapsing building before it completely collapses, timing your jumps, your sprints, your crouching from sprints, your falls from crouching, your jumps from rolling, your slides from rolling, your jumps from slides, your smashing of planks from full sprint after coming to a very, meticulously timing full stop from sprint (and make sure you time it down to the g0dd4mn nanosecond, there, reader, cause if you don’t - boy, oh boy, are you in for just a wonderful crushing heap of debris from the ceiling above you!

Megaman was challenging. Contra was challenging.  Deadlight, hence force the game that shall not be named for the rest of waking eternity, is a dive into insanity and the deep, unlit places of the universe where madness reigns and chaos is law. 'Challenging” is too much a beautiful and eloquent adoration of this 'game'.

The gameplay is a rather tired form of puzzle platformer that's been done time and time again by games like Limbo and the original Prince of Persia. However, the 'Puzzles' are mediocre, usually involving activating whatever highlighted item happens to be in the room with you. Similarly, the 'Platformer' is just frustrating, due to sloppy controls, and frankly bad design. 'Trial and error' gameplay is particularly heavy In the later levels, often times with the character dying for no particular reason.  Then there's the 'story.' The plot is yet another cookie-cutter zombie-apocalypse story, a genre which is so played out by now that I almost expected this game to be a parody. Deadlight adds nothing new to the genre whatsoever. It's full of a million tired tropes, the voiceacting is subpar, the script is bad, and it's not even fun to play.",

While the backgrounds aren't as amazing as in Trine 1&amp;2 they are masterfully lit and really look great all the time. Those with an artistic interest would probably enjoy it a lot because of the environments.  The gameplay is similar to Another World and Prince of Persia, two very old games. This isnt a problem and works quite well most of the time, the biggest gripe I have is that sometimes jumping works fine to get past, other times you get stuck and die, melee doesnt connect, they manage to grab you in the middle of a swing or sometimes they just dont wanna fall down, its somewhat inconsistent and feels unfair rather than challenging.  This is the same through the whole game, some jumps are somewhat hard to see, some things are trial and error until you get it right. Most of the checkpoints are close so you wont have to replay much when you die, but the last section of the game is long and if you make a mistake you die and have to replay it all. Its not hard, but trial and error until you memorize that ♥♥♥♥.  The story could be better, the biggest flaw is in the writing and it suffers somewhat of the 'your father the king' syndrome. It could be so much better with some work, but I didnt really get any emotional attachment to anyone in the world. The ending really didnt make any sense, him holding a speech about something and then not doing the very same thing he talked about, sure, closure and all, but damn, don't be a hypocrite.  Technically the game didnt crash any, but a couple times the physics engine bugged out and either instakilled me or didn't kill me. The biggest bug is when the main menu doesnt load and the game just sits there for 1-3minutes until it finally comes up. At least the checkpoint loading is instant.

I have to actually walk out into the open space slightly first.  This guy is pretty impressive with parkour,what with his ability to create great horizontal acceleration into a leap from a complete standstill. But then he instantly drowns the moment he enters water above his shoulders. Cool. I'm not even a confident swimmer myself and that's just ridiculous. C'mon devs, you can't be using a 6' deep water hazard for an exceptionally able-bodied man in a gritty, 'realistic' game. Figure out another mechanic. Or just make all the water filled with electric zombie eels, I don't care.   Despite possessing the stamina to run, jump, and climb all over the place, he gets severely winded by swinging an axe three times.  It's like Limbo in that you experience a lot of trial and error with sudden hazards curb stomping your entire body or bisecting you via sawblade. But that was entertaining in Limbo, and fit the narrative of endlessly repeating a cycle. In Deadlight, it's hard to distinguish background objects from foreground ones, resulting in lots of death. Even certain beams in the same plane as the player are apparently ethereal objects and inexplicably cannot be grasped.   Every spoken word of dialogue makes me wince at how embarrassingly it is written, and delivered by the 'actors.' Some of it I can drown out, but the audio mixing is a bit retardulated, and some of it is louder than anything else.  Early in the game (or maybe it's just that short, perhaps mercifiully) your axe and pistol are taken away in exchange for a totally sweet slingshot good for killing zombies with well-placed rocks in the grape--err...actually no, it just activates buttons from a distance. It doesn't so much as fling rocks at high velocity, but lobs them up softly in a seemingly exaggerated ballistic arc. Maybe he only has access to excessively large rocks for the given power of his slingshot; I don't know, but it doesn't bode well for what's his name's survival. Hey dumb@ss, try smaller rocks.  Sometimes the pause menu takes several seconds to pop up, and several times has even failed to appear at all, making the game hang and forcing me to ctrl+alt+del (alt+tab does nada in this situation) in order to bouce in and out of the game.

Deadlight is a 3D side-scrolling platformer with the same precise yet tanky controls from two decades ago. There's running and jumping and turning in place and stopping on a dime, and God help you if you flub a jump. You play Randall, a gravelly survivor of the zombie apocalypse who wishes he had half the gravitas as Bill. You must guide him as he mantles up and over the thousand fences, crates, and fire escapes of Seattle in search of his three survivor buddies and maybe his family? I dunno, I was too busy wrestling the terrible combat controls.  Melee in this game is awful, as it only functions a certain distance from your character. Any closer and you harmlessly shove enemies away instead of whacking them. It makes mobs of zombies a proper death sentence, but in a game like this where it's easy to miss one running jump and land in a pit of undead, it can get frustrating fast. The gun is more effective but your ammo is rather limited and headshots are a must. I tended to do a lot more running from fights, which the game seems to support and often expects anyway.  Do not buy into this one for the story, for it is terrible. The characters are incredibly one-dimensional and the writing is bad to the point of nonsense in some places. It is a pretty game however, in that lovingly-rendered hellscape sort of way. There's a lot of detail in the environments (so much so that it can obscure your path at times), and plenty of little collectibles hidden in out-of-the-way spots or obvious deathtraps. Looks to be about a 5-6 hour game, quicker if you don't bother looking for goodies. Decent playtime for the price, but the rough edges lead me to suggest a sale purchase if at all.  If you thought Prince of Persia needed a modern reboot with zombies and bad combat, by all means give it a try.",

Expect to cringe many times, as the main character talks and talks about obvious things. It's dialog like a grade-schooler might come up with.  The controls are TERRIBLE.

            "review_text": "Deadlight held a lot of promise for me. I love platformers and a decent amount of infection-driven post-apocalyptic fiction, and visually, it looked great. I was hoping it would give me a nice solid gameplay experience with an interesting story, but unfortunately, that's not what it held.  While Deadlight is visually appealing, and has a pretty good soundtrack, I was pretty disappointed in it overall. This disappointment ultimately comes down to two simple but pretty massive faults: the controls were unreliable, even with an Xinput controller, leading to the player character behaving unpredictably and getting killed; and the story was lackluster, derivative, predictable, and uninspiring.  While quite a bit of the game can be enjoyable thanks to its atmosphere, I found much of the game frustrating. I should preface this by saying that I am a very big fan of punishingly difficult games, including platformers, so long as they are well-designed and far. The trouble I found, however, is that this game did not feel intentionally difficult, but rather became frustratingly difficult through design oversights and poor controls. It felt like almost every time I died, it was something beyond my control or something without any warning. As an example, there are some pretty infuriating sequences in this game where you have to run away from things that kill you instantly, and they put up obstacles that your character climbs over really slowly no matter what you do. This doesn't appear to be used to build the tension in any way, and appears to be completely unintentional, but it results in the player dying even when they've been doing very well in maintaining their stride up until that point. It makes it feel like the game is killing you because it's not well designed, not because you made a mistake, which really kills the experience.   If the story was worth it, then I'd be a bit more forgiving of control issues. Unfortunately, the story isn't anything memorable, and the big twists are very predictable right from the beginning. There's not much character development, which is probably a byproduct of having a short game that tries to do too much. It's an okay story, but it feels more akin to reading mass market fiction, giving a fleeting sense of enjoyment that you won't really care too much about upon reaching its conclusion.",

It took me less than 3 hours to beat this ! Back then I bought the game for 2 euros, it's like I payed almost a euro for an hour of a not fun game !  #3 : the progression is linear : and by that I mean if you don't do certain things the way the devs wants you to, you'll be rewarded with an instant kill !  #4 : controls are dodgy and not explained well, for instance, when climbing a wall or a fence, you can jump away from it by pressing the jump button ; seems logic, right ? Now if I tell you that if you want to go on the other side of that wall or fence once on top of the damn thing, you have to press both up and jump buttons, resulting in some infuriating moments when you thought you could jump over a wall but instead jump away from it and die an horrible death.  #5 : the storyline makes no sense whatsoever, especially the second half of the game,   from when you meet The Rat, which seems to be hated all over the steam reviews.   from here, the game becomes more of a trap-dodging, die and retry platformer which ruins the entire universe it was trying to build up before.   Also, it has one of the worst ending I ever faced in a video game, ever ! Even RAGE's one was better in every aspect !     #6 : the way you fight in this game SUCKS. I know you're not supposed to be a one-man-army, but still; I expect to be able to kill someone with a single powerful blow with a Firefighter's axe but NOPE. The aiming with firearms is innacurate, damages you seem to do to enemies are completely random with those as well   especially with the shotgun, even CS:GO's ones are more reliable !    #7 : It has this game mode (which is unlocked only after beating the game once) which is pretty much a perma-death mode : if you die, you go back to the begining of the game ... I personnaly don't even know why this mode is here. This game has no replay value whatsoever and this kind of mode only fits on short, partialy or entirely proceduraly generated games (The Binding of Isaac, Minecraft, and pretty much every damn 'rogue-like'). IT'S NOT GOOD FOR LINEAR PLATFORMERS, ESPECIALLY IF IT HAS BAD CONTROLS. I forgot to mention that this mode does not save at any point : you have to beat the game in one shot.    I wonder if someone can pass the whole f*ckin' labyrinth without having a walkthrough running at the same time !    #8 : This game has poor performances, I can run games such as Counter Strike Global Offensive with some very good gaphical options with no problems but this game is pretty damn bad, I had to turn the options all the way down to be able to play the thing.  #9 : There are some MUCH BETTER PLATFORMERS YOU CAN BUY ON STEAM !

People heroically sacrifice themselves, or alternately, beg you to kill them so they don't become a zombie....etc, etc. All of this stuff is kind of becoming a bit cliché, especially since it's all been done so well elsewhere before this (again, 'The Walking Dead'). The ending manages its own twist which is kind of nice, but most of the game up to that point is pretty underwhelming.  Gameplay wise it's basically 'Prince of Persia' with zombies, but it also doesn't do much that's original with that concept.

Some of the sets are visually impressive, but the story is rather underwhelming, the dialog is unnatural, the voice acting is bad, and there is a segment in the middle ('The Rat') that doesn't quite mesh with the setting and strains suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. The first third of the game is ridiculously easy even after the part where they teach you the controls, and after that, the challenge is more in the controls than it solving puzzles. Indeed, many of the scenes aren't something you can think through in advance; it's try-and-error. This is made more frustrating by the fact that when the premise isn't, 'What would make sense here?', but 'What moves does the game want from me this time?', the environment should at least behave exactly the same each time -- which of course doesn't seem to be the case. It also doesn't help that the backstory comes as a 60 page diary, so your choices are starting your new game without knowing your character's personal backstory, or reading 60 pages of badly written diary entries. At least of course, they are small pages with not a lot of text on them, and some are missing -- oh yeah, didn't I mention that? Some of the pages are missing, and you'll find them as you traverse places you've never been before. Um, yeah.  The studio also talked up the fact that the game is set in the '80s (See what they did there? Two things with a following, '80s, and zombies, it must have seemed like a sure hit and/or license to print money.), but in the game, that makes practically no difference at all. Your load animation is a tape deck, there are three vintage video games you can find, and 'commies' are mentioned, that's about it, and none of it makes a difference. Sure, the studio are right when pointing out that there are 'no cell phones, no computers', but six month into a zombocalypse, I wouldn't expect to get much mileage out of either, anyway, so that doesn't have much of an impact. Heck, even if computers were common and worked, I wouldn't expect deranged mountain man Randy to bother with them.  On balance, Limbo, a game that doesn't even attempt to do include many of these things (voice acting, anything worth being called a story, etc.) ends up being the better game for it -- of course, having a spectacular, distinct look and somewhat better controls helps, too.",

But the experience is hampered by a shallow story and a steep difficulty spike mid game that is worsened by spotty controls.  Even the story had a good premise: in an alternate history of the USA, the cold war ended when a zombie uprising led to a little bit of nuclear war. Zombies and nuclear winter in a 1980's America? I can work with that, even if zombies (called 'Shadows' in this game) are overused nowadays.   Instead of expanding on this setting, Deadlight chooses to make a character driven story. The main character is a Canadian park ranger trying to find his friends and family in Seattle. The problem with Deadlight is that if it wanted to make a character driven story, it should have made its characters interesting or at least consistent. The story presents it's characters as somewhat naive of their surroundings at best and bipolar at worse. The voice acting, often delivered dead-panned, doesn't help.  The platforming is the star of the game. It plays somewhat like the original 2D Prince of Persia. You have your wall jumping and a bunch of climbing and running. You have a stamina that dictates how long you can hang off a ledge, sprint and use your melee weapon. The game haves you jumping on top of air conditioners on high rise buildings, running through crumbling buildings and evanding traps. Ignoring the fact that this park ranger knows parkour, it's satifying to finish one of these puzzles.   Making it harder to accomplish this endeavor are the controls, which are somewhat spotty and lag sometimes during inputs. This can make your life miserable on some sections of the game where the difficulty spikes. The game sometimes puts too many obstacles during sections where you're asked to run to your goal. With no room for error, having unresposive controls can lead to you dying dozens of times.   I wouldn't recommend getting Deadlight unless you have a steep discount. When you ignore the story and the game works, it's fun. But it's so short that I feel it wasn't worth it to suffer through the frustrations and get to the good parts.",

Pros:  - Beautiful Art  (I cannot argue with that fact that this game looks great. The rain, the sewer water, the decrepit buildings of a ruined Seattle. It all came together to paint a nice picture.) - Story is decent, albeit a bit predictable    Cons:  - Poor, floaty character control  (Any tiny bump, any attempt to 180, ANYTHING made you pretty much lose all momentum. This is particularly annoying when you're running from a certain death situation and you bump into a tiny cardboard box and go tumbling to the ground. On top of that he is just unresponsive. I jump, he waits a couple seconds; I spam to climb away from the zombies, he bashes his face into the wall before eventually deciding 'oh hey, I should get away from these zombies'. Some people might say 'It's a more realistic movement system. If you bump into something you'd trip'. To that I'd say 'Well that's fine and dandy but it has to be fun. This is a game, all of the mechanics in the game should help the game overall be more fun. This system only frustrates the players.') - Unintuitive or Rinse-and-repeat puzzles  (What I mean by Rinse-and-repeat is that sometimes it just comes down to memorization. Jump here? Dodge that? Shoot that? Miss one of those steps and you die, then get sent back to the start of the puzzle and have to do it all over. The game never gives you long enough to analyze and attempt the what you think is the correct solution. It's just like 'Puzzle! GO! Brute force it! GOGOGOGO!' Some puzzles also just don't seem like the proper way to progress. Some puzzles are nice, you can kind of understand them and proceed naturally. But those few puzzles are shadowed by bad ones.) - Quick Gameplay with Minimal Replayability  At the time of writing this review I have 3.1 hours invested into this game. That is from playing the ENTIRE game, start to finish. I didn't even try to speed run it, it was just kinda short. I even got somewhere around 85-90% of the collectables. Other than going back and collecting the rest of the stuff you missed and playing the Nightmare Mode, there isn't really a point in playing through the game a second time. Honestly, the only reason I'll play more of this game is to get the rest of the collectables and finish off a couple more achievements, which I expect will take my another 1-2 hours. So in all, only a 5-6 hour game. Pretty meh.) - Main Character is unlikeable  (Last, but not least, I just couldn't come to like or enjoy the main character. He's kinda a d*ck. 'They're dead, get over it.' 'Man up.' 'Stop crying.' &lt;- That kind of stuff. He also never seems fazed by, well... anything. Death? Nah. Zombies? Nah. Drowning? Blub blub. Then at the very end his personality changes but it just doesn't feel right. Artificial and forced to kind of give the story a satisfyable ending.)  TL;DR: Controls Suck, MC is meh, Puzzles are sometimes fun but most often frustrating, very short game.",

Right, I have played a good enough portion of this game to give an opinion. This game is terrible. It's as simple as that. Your playing as this old dude named randall, who is looking for is family because they got seperated.   That's Original.   The controls i'd say are horrendously inaccurate at best, Im pretty sure, everytime i've come up to a wall too thin to stand ontop of but can hang off of it, i fight the controls as my character swaps back and forth on both sides of the wall. Infact, I've stopped playing the game because thats exactly what killed me several times in one stop. I legitimately cannot think of anything positive to say about this game that is genuine. Its a crappy Xbox 360 port, under the evidence of the main title has a 'help and options' tab, Like every xbox 360 game, Ever. I'd say the cutscenes are nice, but i'd be lying. I don't like the comic style art, but i'd bare through that if the cutscenes weren't just a series of pictures.  The game itself has a 2 and a half D feel, so its very easy to mistake something for being on another plain entirely. Oh, you know what, I Do have something nice to say, The voice acting isn't terrible. It isn't best either, I mean the characters kind of talk like they have to point things out. For example, during every cutscene so far, Randall, whether talking to someone he knows, someone he doesn't know, or just lost in thought, he states 'I have to find my wife and child'. More or less, it gets a bit irritating. The zombies, or the 'shadows' are pretty accurate to the slow zombie you'd normally perceive as, they swarm, they kill you, yadda yadda, The ragdoll has had several bugs, as well as the poor excuse they call combat. My, how many times i've cut into 'shadows' only for it to not contact AT ALL. Not only that, expect floating corpses.  Phew, that felt good to get that off my chest. Uhhh, Yeah, pretty bad, I'd recommend saving your money on a packet of candy or something, you'd get more enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, If you really don't believe me, Atleast wait until its under $5. I mean they had it for free on Xbox 360 for a fortnight and friends of mine still said it was terrible so, Avoid it, It's just a bad game.  Now if you don't mind, Im going to uninstall this so i have less chance of accidentally launching the game.  2/10",

TL;DR a game with good graphics and performace but its a shame that gameplay and story, what matters most of all, is a clunky mess. Frustration hit detection, collision and platforming made harder with bad controls. No thanks. The demo drew me in but playing this through me out. By the end of the game I wanted to finish it as quick as possible so I would not have to play it ever.  In depth: Well the game has a nice art style. And thats it. Story is generic but no characters even have character at all. I dont care about any of them. The protangist is just boring. He feels vunerable and clunky which is survival games is good. He controls like your average joe but does not act like one. Combat is also clunky and not encouraged. I dont mind if its clunky but its bad. Basically zombiezs have more range even though you weild a fire axe. The 2.5D background was good at first alerting zombies in the background to you HOWEVER you can tell if they are in your way so when you swing they are a pixel out of place and they hit you.   The health system is a joke. For one you cant carry health kits even though your meant to be surviving. And whats worse you may ask? Well if you get hit then it goes into a QTE which if you fail you insta killed regardless if you still have another health cube left. Whats the point of health then? Horrible hit boxes and the range is incostistent. Not to mention no way of barging a zombie out the way? The rat bit is just plain out dumb. It took me the longest time as every trap is a one hit kill regardless of health. The game is meant for a realistic survival story, as genric as that is, and their is a hobo that has built all these traps just for you to go throw them even though he helped you? WTF? In fact it happens just as you get all your gear takes up most of the game with irratation one hit traps and then drops you back off almost near the end of the game.   Ending......So bad. It was so obvious from the very start not to mention he could of easily avoided what happend...BUT...NO...for drama it happens and makes no real sense.  Fair enough its not focused on combat but where is the scavenging? Crafting? Distrractions? Replaced with annoying and sometimes unfair platforming? Great trade off. Due to the 2.5D some bits dont even look like you can jump onto which of course you can. The their is areas where you may replay it 10 times jumping on a object which looks like you can and would make sense and then it suddly works after the 9 times if dident. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!  This game could of been great but its a irritating due tp clunky controls poor atmosphere, no survival elements and is flat out not worth it.

The constant use of instant, unavoidable death from the environment only added to the irritation.  What kept me going, though, was the superb animation, lighting, and level building. The sense of decay in a crushed out Seattle was beautiful in a eerie sort of way. The sound and score are also first-rate, but the story suffers from zombie cliches.

            "review_text": "In the wake of what seems to be endless hordes of zombie games I saw what seemed like a cool little platformer called Deadlight. There aren't many platform zombie games (that I know of) so this is already unique in it's own right but what captured me from the start about this game is it's gritty visual style.   I'm not a big fan of the platform genre but the zombie apocalypse setting convinced me to give this a try. There are a few interesting features about this game that I particularly enjoyed. I liked how Randall, the main character, was always in one dimension while at the same time the game gave the impression of depth through such devices as the zombies coming out of the background. A lot of the stark atmosphere of the game came from the relatively spartan graphics and the simple interactions with the environment. It was easy to learn new actions and distinguish Randal from the enemies or other things in the game except during the few times where the visual background cues were way too subtle making it hard to see where you were supposed to jump and it took a few tries to figure out where to go next.  The complaints that I have about this game boil down to mainly the voice acting which destroyed the illusion somewhat, buggy interaction glitches and the simplistic story. In the cut scenes it always felt like the characters, other than Randall, were talking in a void. Perhaps the voice actors were given a script to read without knowing what was actually happening in the current scene but it felt terribly overacted. In particular the Rat's voice was so much lower than Randall's that it was nearly impossible to hear and understand what he was saying half of the time. All this made the game feel unpolished.  As for bugs I would say that at times the character wouldn't respond to the commands that you issued him. I'm not sure if that had to do with my timing or the lag between the controller and game but it was incredibly frustrating. At one point it got so bad that I began questioning my sanity. Having to redo a scene multiple times in a row and subsequently dying in the same way over and over again caused me to swear and argue with my computer to prove to it that I did indeed press the correct button at the correct time. I started to wonder if this is what people mean when they say that videogames cause violence. I certainly felt the rising of a murderous rage within me.  Can't say I am a big fan of the axe combat either. It felt extremely inexact and was very difficult to get Randall to finish off the zombie enemies on the ground. He just wouldn't respond to finish them off and continue hacking at the air space above their bodies. The controls could have been made much better and in return the game would have been that much more enjoyable.  Overall I would give this game a 60/100. The story is rather simplistic even though it had a couple of original elements. Many things in the game made absolutely no sense like the Rat and his nonsensical motivations, for example. It's still playable but just barely.  On a side note: I tried to get all the achievements (except Nightmare Mode) in the game and found out that the game doesn't record one particular secret until I found all the other secrets first. I had to redo that scene 3 times before it recognized my achievement in the end unlocking 3 achievements in a row.",

Pros:  - Beautiful Art  (I cannot argue with that fact that this game looks great. The rain, the sewer water, the decrepit buildings of a ruined Seattle. It all came together to paint a nice picture.) - Story is decent, albeit a bit predictable    Cons:  - Poor, floaty character control  (Any tiny bump, any attempt to 180, ANYTHING made you pretty much lose all momentum. This is particularly annoying when you're running from a certain death situation and you bump into a tiny cardboard box and go tumbling to the ground. On top of that he is just unresponsive. I jump, he waits a couple seconds; I spam to climb away from the zombies, he bashes his face into the wall before eventually deciding 'oh hey, I should get away from these zombies'. Some people might say 'It's a more realistic movement system. If you bump into something you'd trip'. To that I'd say 'Well that's fine and dandy but it has to be fun. This is a game, all of the mechanics in the game should help the game overall be more fun. This system only frustrates the players.') - Unintuitive or Rinse-and-repeat puzzles  (What I mean by Rinse-and-repeat is that sometimes it just comes down to memorization. Jump here? Dodge that? Shoot that? Miss one of those steps and you die, then get sent back to the start of the puzzle and have to do it all over. The game never gives you long enough to analyze and attempt the what you think is the correct solution. It's just like 'Puzzle! GO! Brute force it! GOGOGOGO!' Some puzzles also just don't seem like the proper way to progress. Some puzzles are nice, you can kind of understand them and proceed naturally. But those few puzzles are shadowed by bad ones.) - Quick Gameplay with Minimal Replayability  At the time of writing this review I have 3.1 hours invested into this game. That is from playing the ENTIRE game, start to finish. I didn't even try to speed run it, it was just kinda short. I even got somewhere around 85-90% of the collectables. Other than going back and collecting the rest of the stuff you missed and playing the Nightmare Mode, there isn't really a point in playing through the game a second time. Honestly, the only reason I'll play more of this game is to get the rest of the collectables and finish off a couple more achievements, which I expect will take my another 1-2 hours. So in all, only a 5-6 hour game. Pretty meh.) - Main Character is unlikeable  (Last, but not least, I just couldn't come to like or enjoy the main character. He's kinda a d*ck. 'They're dead, get over it.' 'Man up.' 'Stop crying.' &lt;- That kind of stuff. He also never seems fazed by, well... anything. Death? Nah. Zombies? Nah. Drowning? Blub blub. Then at the very end his personality changes but it just doesn't feel right. Artificial and forced to kind of give the story a satisfyable ending.)  TL;DR: Controls Suck, MC is meh, Puzzles are sometimes fun but most often frustrating, very short game.",

I think if you actually quit the game and resume later it puts you even further back then the checkpionts in the game. 5. In genral to much tail and error, to much dieing untill you get what you actually need to do. 6. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this scene when you get into the 'save point'. Story wise it makes no sense because he knows its a trap but he goes right in anyway, and I don't know how many ♥♥♥♥ing ties i needed for this ♥♥♥♥ but hell like 25? For that reason alone I cant recomment this unneeded frustration. I mean I played dark souls and its not that I don't like hard games but when you just hard to complete stupid sequences in perfectly in game like this its something else. It just feels annoying. 7. At the start it says 'Randal can't swim' at this point I thought I will be playing other characters with different handycaps/skills. I was wrong. 8. When the boy and the rat run from you they always leave the screen and then you need to go alone after then. I thing it would be nice to see them. (not nessasary showing you the clues but the end shows that they can do it differently. 9. And how seeing that others finished this in 3 hours and I took 5 tells me the game is actually pretty short. Given the furustration is over now I could see this as positive ;). But its a Game and not a Movie so ... And its probably not my kind of thing if others don't die that often.   And now that I finally have completed it, it gives me nightmare mode, yeah right like I am gonna play that thing again.  Now this sounds very bad, like I said in the beginning I would give it a neutral. Its actually quite a nice game but to frustrating at times.",

For the general price, I cannot recommend it.",
