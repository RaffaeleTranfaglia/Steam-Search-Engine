            "review_text": "Sorry, in the current state I really can't recommend it. Honestly, I wanted to, I supported this on Kickstarter for a pretty high amount as I love the genre, however, the execution simply leaves too much to be desired. There is no such thing as a manual that even explains the most basic functions or displays. The tutorial is bad and doesn't help much either. All menus are confusing and *extremely* clunky. Total facepalms during the first few hours of gameplay: the bloody keys for rolling left and rolling right are interchanged and there is no way to reassign them; Missiles target acquisition either doesn't work or there's something about it that the tutorial or menus aren't telling me. Moving around the carrier is ship is a nice idea, but so poorly done (the controls, ouch, the controls!) and pointless (there's nothing interactive as far as I've seen) it looks like there's something planned and never implemented here. Mission design on some missions is extremely poor (waypoints keep pointing you through solid objects, pathfinding is extremely hard, waypoint triggers are like a built-in exploit) and unfair in some, when for instance a required, completely arbitrary waypoint, you need to reach, triggers enemies, that you are then too far away from to stop from destroying your mission goal in time. Just one example. Silly, pointless, frustrating. The space combat itself is not very fun, you can play entire missions without ever seeing an enemy ship, as the enemies basically become large enough to see at 100 meters distance. That might be realistic, but it kills all dogfight feeling when you shoot almost exclusively at the center of a targeting rectangle. Targeting itself is absolutely terrible and clunky (as are most controls), as there's no way to target the nearest enemy, the nearest friendly, the nearest mission objective or your nearest attacker - as has been pretty much standard in such games 15 years ago. No, here you have to click through 37 enemies, while an unseen missile turrets keeps pounding you... Joystick support is terrible, i found no way to reasonably use my Saitek X52, but that's just a minor thing as mouse control is totally superior anyway. makes targeting so easy, it sometimes feels like a cheat in fact. I'll shelve this for now and wait for a patch or three, and may give it another go then. As it's now, extremely disappointing.",

            "review_text": "At the time of this review I seem to have the most hours playing this game. I will recommend this game but there are caveats to this. 1) This game is awkward in play. The eating dinner over your best friend's house, after you have just been caught making out with his sister awkward. I absolutely hate the FPS movement through the ships. It's slow and when your alerted to report to the ready room you just mosey along to get there. The tutorial flight needs to more indepth. I 'accidently' found out how to allocate power and command wingmen 3 missions in. 2) The flight mechanics are disturbing at times as you find yourself struggling to get the ship to right itself on a trajectory. I like being able to fly near the surface of a planet just not in one. One mission requires you to go underground killing bad guys and finding a scientist. You take damage hitting walls but the enemy ships ping pong ball of the sides making it impossible to hit them and they take NO damage. Loose this mission or change the scientist to a surface station. 3) Voice acting poor. The briefer for the first few missions looks like his is in his fifties but the voice is of a later teens to early twenties young man. Same akwardness with the stories one pilot who liked he was straight out of high school had 10yrs of experience. 4) The credit system isn't consistent. I completed a round and saw all sorts of bonuses flash up and completed bonus missions and recived nothing after the brief. All the work for nothing. Prestige points? Really? I have to earn a certain amount of points to get descent equipment? I would understand completeing some missions and getting extra stuff in mission to have new equipment to be researched then availible after a period of time.   Now after all this I really do like the game, I hate the fact it's VERY Crossfire unfriendly. I had to disable it all together. The game has promise but it needs alot of work. I do recommend this, just be prepared to be annoyed a little bit.",

            "review_text": "This game still needs alot of work, sadly.. the story is bland and sometimes horific to even know what the hell ur doing, walking around the ship awsome cool feature is kinda like taking a trip back to the mid 2000's with textures that kinda reminds you of the old 3dmax software, I would love to actully love this game when it comes to some features but hell the motherships or whatever the fleet looks pasted in space battles and yea i dont know what to say really.  Npc interaction with the crew is the worst part for me, remember the first X game with the stiff npc's and odd ways of looking all over the place with no sence of being there?? yepp its here and its worse, first npc i ran into did nothing then to stare right into the wall, mumbeling something I dont even remember cause i laughed to hard.  After i played a few missions and so on the game patched out some bugs and the save'd game files got currupted.. I havent even botherted to launch the game again.  Im sorry ladies and gentlemen this game is not worth 19€ asking price I would recommend this game if it was like under 5€ but in this state and what looks like(Please by god fix what you started) final version I just whanna say No.  And if i had the choice to press a refund button i would have done so.

            "review_text": "Don't buy this game. For the love of god, buy Freespace or Wing Commander or Strike Suit Zero or X3 or even DarkStar One before you buy this. This game is not good. It feels like a game designed by people who only had the faintest idea of how video games worked, and set out to reinvent everything from scratch because they didn't know any better. The first-person walking segments are incredibly slow and the mouse/keyboard controls work like no PC first-person shooter ever. The targeting options are abysmal. Basic functions that Freespace had almost two decades ago, like 'target closest enemy' or 'target ship under reticule,' simply do not exist in the game (though there's some loopy auto-targeting system that doesn't work nearly as well as you'd want it to). The game doesn't automatically switch missile bays when you run out of missiles.   You often don't know about escort objectives you may have until you fail them for the first time out of the blue (the ships you're escorting never cry for help and you can't see an indicator of how damaged they are unless you target them directly). This causes you to fail the entire mission, throwing you back to the last checkpoint. CHECKPOINTS ARE AWFUL IN THIS GAME. They often throw you back two or three encounters, even when it seems like you should be able to save at a clear waypoint in between.   Controls are so screwed up that I can't actually access the Controls menu in game because before I can move the menu cursor down to Controls, I get kicked into the Sound menu and can't find my way out with either the controller or the keyboard. Hitting Shift-F12 to take a screenshot snaps control of the game to the keyboard immediately, requiring you to kick back out to the pause menu to reset back to the controller. Also, I have to resort to a controller because using my joystick is out of the question because the button configuration is hardcoded, meaning basic functions are set on joystick buttons that are harder to reach. And since doing anything with the keyboard immediately locks the joystick out, playing this game like ANY OTHER SPACE SIM OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS by using both the keyboard and joystick is impossible.  I can go on: about the cutscenes with people who don't move at all except for their mouths (they're like bizarre talking statues), about the fact that the bad guys all seem to be random Arab and Asian countries, about the incoherent narrative, about how your guns run out of juice after ten seconds of sustained fire (if that), about how you can't even charge your guns while firing your afterburners, about how locking upgrades behind CPs are a baffling way to run a military (seriously, I have to UNLOCK good fighters?), about how it would take something like twenty or thirty playthroughs to come close to unlocking everything, etc., etc., etc. Just, no. Don't spend your time on this.  I do wish Escape Hatch the best; clearly they've got heart and ambition. But it might be better to start with a basic game genre that's easier to iterate on and perfect, rather than dive headlong into a genre known for complexity (even though really it's not that complex) and getting so many things wrong.",

            "review_text": "This game has a huge amount of potential, but I still can't recomend it. Why? I mean, yes, walking around the ship so slow (and pointless, really) that it's more of a chore than a perk, and the voice acting is distractingly bad, but I could look past such things.  What really grinds my gears is what happens when you try to fly the ship. Just getting the thing pointed in the direction you want it to go is more of a battle than the actual fighting. Not only is the steering about as smooth as Paul Bunyan's beard, it's totally unpredictable. It's like your ship is saying, 'Now, I know you SAID you wanted to pull straight up to put your target right in your crosshairs, buuuuut I think what you really want is for me to pull up, go slightly to the right, then instead of stopping on the target I'll jerk hard left. And up a little. And then left a little more. Soooo, I'm gonna do that instead. Myea.'  Even if your ship didn't follow directions with the obedience of a 2 year old or a cat, the ships turn so slow to begin with that even what should be the most maneuverable ones just feel dull and lifeless.   I hope they patch some of this stuff up, because if the flight controls felt more like they do in the games SI is trying to emulate (Freespace, X-Wing, Wing Commender, Tachyon) it would be fantastic. Till then, it's no more than a bunch of pretty lights and cool ideas that just aren't any fun.",
