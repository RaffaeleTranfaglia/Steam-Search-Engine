            "review_text": "Ironstorm is one of these games that really annoys me.  Mostly because of how it's just a lot of wasted potential. It's a game with an extremely original premise, and it's bogged down by convoluted objectives and forced stealth missions.  Ironstorm takes place in an alternate history 1964, where World War 1 never ended. So you have things like trenches and mustard gas, but you also have automatic weapons and nukes. This premise is very good and I've never seen a game attempt something like this. Indeed the action segments of the game are passable and remind you a great deal of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  Unfortunately the designers ruined this by having convoluted objectives like forced stealth segments. Ones where you require a strategy guide to get past. Or nearly impossible objectives like luring a tank to a prior area without getting instantly killed by it's gun.  The game is okay if you're particularly masochistic and don't mind looking a lot of the solutions up. But if you're looking for a quality fps experience that feels tested and polished look elsewhere.  Also note the screenshots for this game on the Steam store are misleading. They're screenshots from the later PS2 port. If you wish more accurate screenshots check out the Gog version.",
