            "review_text": "It's a pretty generic horror game, but that isn't a bad thing. However there are many bad things about this game. I even made you a list! -The tutorial level is unbelievably laggy compared to the rest of the game, maybe because the entire level loaded at once. -Walk in the dark, pick up a thing, rinse and repeat. We're getting GOTY with these revolutionary mechanics. -Jump scares are substituted for things that could actually be scary, you know, like a story. -When the level loads a different area, there is no loading screen, the game cuts to black and fades back. It feels jagged. -Some parts are just way too dark. Even with the gamma turned up, you won't be able to discern different symbols in front of you, symbols which will determine if you live or become a giant shishkabob.  But don't add this to your cart and delete it from your cart yet! This game has some redeeming factors! -The setting is great, really. The maps aren't the most creative, but they serve their purpose well when they aren't dark. -The sound is fun. It will make you feel as if there's someone around you or even BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW! AAAHH!! -Because it's a standard horror game, they don't waste time introducing quirky mechanics you'll use once and then never again. It takes 5 minutes for hem to teach you what you need to know and you're off. -The first 'monster' you come across (and the only one I've seen so far) has a pretty basic design, but still manages to be freaky after seeing it 500 times.  I'd only recommend this game to people who like horror games and only if they want something a little lighter. The story won't give you existential depression, the monsters won't give you nightmares, you won't have to sleep between mommy and daddy when you finish Chapter 1, it's a very relaxed horror game.",

            "review_text": "I was hesitant with Chapter 1 as I wasn't quite sure what to expect... which turned out to be a lot of fumbling in the pitch dark in a few 'Penumbra-esque' environments. Once I got the hang of what was going on I found myself entertained, but not necessarily thrilled. I was concerned that the next chapter, not to mention the following 3 and 4 were going to be just the same, but maybe with some skins swapping and cookie-cutter levels/puzzles.  Then I got to chapter 2 and was blown away. This isn't 'in your face' horror, this is subtle. The game isn't in it to make you jump out of your seat, but to let you plod along then suddenly make you sit rigid and let out a panicked '#$@!'. Chapter 2 was magnificent at its pacing, letting me get just confident enough to be speeding around right before slapping me in the face with a big horrible surprise.  After completing the first two chapters I'm super happy with the game. These chapters are not just copy/paste jobs, but offer full changes in environment, puzzles, interactions, and 'enemies'. From what I can see the last two chapters will also differ greatly from the first two, making each chapter a unique play experience, and horribly eerie in its own way.  However, as for the bad (or atleast the not-so-good) the game offers the ability to change keyboard controls, but not for all functions; so when I bind the horrid WASD to the more preferred ESDF I couldn't understand why my torch kept going out so fast - Oh... F is bound to pull-out/put-away torch, but there's no option of that in controls, and is a forced keybind... gotcha.  On top of that, the story is a little too vague. I do appreciate the fact that the story is just subtle and vague enough to not be an 'insult to the gamer's intellegence' by being spelled out and shoved down your throat (and actually works very well to let you figure it out in your own interpretation), but it's so vague that I found the continuity confusing, and most specifically for Chapter 1, that there was no successful completion to my mission (that made any sense to me at least).  The last negative is the price point. While the game was a worthy purchase for me, I bought it on a sale for pretty cheap. Had I of spent $10 on this I might've felt a little ripped off - why? I don't know... $10 isn't much and I certaintly got a few hours of fun out of this, but the game feels 'simple' compared to the other games available in the same vein (that are also available for quite cheap).  Still, despite some minor flaws, the game is short enough to not get repetative and interesting enough to hold your attention. While it may not be for everyone, fans of the horror-puzzle games (and most specifically, the third Penumbra game) will have a grand time with it... but maybe just wait for a sale.",

I completed chapter 1 with keyboard/mouse then moved to 360 controller to try it out at start of chapter 2 and continued with that so could play on my TV for a bigger screen.  Graphics are very nice and create a creepy look and feel for the game. The sound does a great job of providing a very atmospheric and scary gaming experience. I hope further chapters appear soon as I really enjoyed the game.  If you liked the Amnesia games or Outlast then you will totally enjoy this, great price too.",

You can finish it in a couple of hours but if you can buy the game for under €2, like I did, it is definitely worth the money.  Also the game does not work with Ubuntu 13.10. As soon as the game starts it stops responding to the mouse and keyboard. ",

Sure, the gfx are a bit dated, but they did the trick.  It was an eerie fun experience with a little diversity in the type puzzles and a macabre background story including some very disturbing visuals. Loved it.  Had to adjust the darkness a little though. Even with all lights out, it was just a bit too much by default. Luckely there's an option for that in the menus.  One minor issue. The game doesn't seem to like my HOTAS. Had to unplug it in order to regain normal keyboard control. Best played with keyboard and mouse anyway (imo).",

There are relics to be found in each chapter. I have searched many corners and only found one, kind of a let down.  The only real redeeming factor of this game is the voice actor that reads these weird notes that sometimes talk about the most obvious things ever or it speaks of things that are too 'deep' for the game to handle.  In the end i didn't have a good experience, i know there wil be more chapters and i wil play them just for the sake of finishing the game. But i hope they wil be longer if not more interesting because halfway through i just wanted the game to end.  If you really REALLY want to play/try this game buy it on sale if you want to have your money spent equal to the amount of entertainment you get, 10 euro's is really too much to ask for a game like this",

The forest level is very boring to explore, it's supposed to be dark, but that's all it is. There is a lack of atmosphere and it seems very bland. I enjoyed the room with the torture devices and piecing together a story of some kind, but it failed to deliver, almost like an unfinished book that has no form of a 'cliff-hanger' to keep you interested. Chapter 2 however was a completey different story, it has potential here, i felt the environment created a unique atmosphere (especially with the boss fight at the end, that was brilliant).   I personally enjoyed parts of it, but it happened too fast, and gives you a feeling of being 'rushed', almost like you would be expecting something more but it doesn't follow through.  For now i don't reccomend it. The length of the game and the forest level is why i think this. Hopefully the chapters 3 &amp; 4 will compensate that, but i'm in no rush to buy it when it arrives.

The list of problems: relies on darkness way too much to create 'challenge' (i.e. blundering about) and to scare. The actual scares are either laughably easily avoided or are merely a 'don't go in the darkness.' First person perspective, but plenty of platforming. Darkness abounds but you're meant to find clues. Environments that are confusing primarily because the are so repetitive/uninteresting.  The biggest challenges usually consist of 'did I go the right way, since it was so damn dark and everything looks the same' and 'can I jump well without seeing my feet?'  A definite pass, in my opinion.",

I mean, there were points where I carefully moved around after hearing something, but it was forgotten as soon as it looped twice.  To continue, I feel that the torch doesn't burn long enough. How does a torch burn for aprox. 5 second, go out, and is then imediatly able to burn again? I also noticed at the begining of the game, that an object being pulled moves faster than the player themselves, allowing you to 'ride' the small rocks and even have them conitue to be 'pulled' when it finally clears you.  Moving with other complaints, the game at sertain points, is too dark. While turning up the brightness does help some, there are sections of the game where it doesn't help. Early on in the game, it is clearly stated that you cannot be in the darkness too long or else you die. However, when you're in   the professor's torture chambers  , this rule is sort of broken. When you complete the main room, it is just about pitch black and is possible to get lost for short periods of time.  Speaking of threats [of enemies], there are very few. In chapter 1, just stay out of the pitch dark and don't touch the specters. In chapter 2, just watch out for the wrong statues. Durring my play through, I realised quickly that enemies were few and predictable. Having such large spaces of safety really turns the scare fact or down.  Over all, the game wasn't scary, it was a little too dark, a tiny bit buggy, but an alright starter game for anyone easing themselves into horror games, as long as it isn't full price.",
