            "review_text": "It's a 2D puzzle platformer. With Limbo sort of gameplay but equally as nice. Was quite surprised by this game as i wasn't expecting it to be this good. The game is very simple yet can be challenging at times. A stick figure in the land of road signs and must keep going. I liked the puzzles and sound is very relaxing. The graphics are as you would expect a 2D sidescroller to be like.  It's not that long, took me 2 hours to beat the game and get all the achievements.   Nice pricetag of $10 and probably will be cheaper during sales too. Get it if you like puzzle platformers.",

            "review_text": "Impressive and unique game made by a single person - respect. It's the story of the kid who escaped from the school crossing sign.You can choose if you want to play as a girl or a boy - I would suggest a girl - you can use the ponytail to tell what direction your character is facing. The music flows with the game and really completes the immersive experience. The character design reminds me of Limbo and Deadlight - you're a shadow in a moderately colorful surroundings. The whole world of this game is composed out of all kinds of street signs - and when in doubt what to do - always check the signs in the background - is the way the game gives you hints. The game mechanics are pretty simple - run around, you have a jump that's heavily influenced by momentum, and you can pull/push things around. The physics of the game can get frustrating at the time (or maybe that's just me), but produce a very unique gameplay in comparison to other puzzle platformers.  The game progression is separated in street signs, that represent the different levels and, as long as I can count correctly (as you can choose your starting point in the menu), there are 32 levels in the game. The level length is very different (as your street lengths are very different :) and as far as I can tell (my progress is 18/32) there are no checkpoints, so failing can get somewhat frustrating in the longer levels. The game introduces new mechanics every now and then and keeps the gameplay interesting - from tough jumps to driving a motorcycle, gliding in the air or getting chased by a poisonous fog - and those are just the ones I've experienced, who knows what the future levels hold.  I'm not sure how I feel about the price tag, maybe wait for it to go on sale. TL:DR or want to see some gameplay - check out my first impressions video        Casually Slacking with Sign Motion&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "The game is good for what it was designed to be; a puzzle platformer.  Don't expect to play through the game in one sitting, you will play it and sometimes you will be frustrated and hate it. You will close the game, and go do something else...but your mind will continue to work on whatever it is that you were stuck on. A day later you'll be in the shower and suddenly you'll go 'AH HAH!' then rush back to your computer and play with the solution you thought of and BAM you'll be past that part and feeling like a freaking king. Then you will continue until you hit another brick wall...rinse and repeat. That is what this game is, and if you're the type that enjoys that kind of experience, I'd highly recommend this to you.
