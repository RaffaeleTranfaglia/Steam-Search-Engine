        {
            "review_text": "Mediocre puzzle game with a nice graphics theme, but unfortunately things blend together too well at times, so you can't always see what the interactive components are. I liked the puzzles that reminded me of the board game, Downfall, with rotating cogs that you drop the ball into, but there were only a couple of those. The puzzles are a mix of skill, timing, and luck... mostly luck. A few of them are fun and well designed, some are okay, and the rest rely too much on luck and involve too much waiting between attempts. Overall, it feels like a good start, but it needs refining before I'd recommend spending time with it.",

            "review_text": "A too-simplistic physics puzzle which is short and often relies on chance (someone compared some of the levels to a pachinko machine - which is a fair description)  It looks and sounds nice enough and there's some interesting ideas, but the lack of content and annoyance of 'take your chances' elements killed it for me.  Note: The game has a 'star' system for first-time solutions but that only applies to SOME of the levels - I assume the others are so random it makes no sense to offer that?  It's hard to recommend on that basis - I found it more frustrating than anything else  p.s. I did 12 of the 50 puzzles and I'd not played long enough to leave a review at that point (less than 5 mins) - so there's well under an hour of content here...",
