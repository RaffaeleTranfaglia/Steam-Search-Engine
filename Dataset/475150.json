            "review_text": "Rating 9/10 Overview: Action RPG  The Good:  + 9 Skill trees to choose from, you select 2. Each skill tree is varied and unique offering multiple ways of building your character. Mixing and matching different skill trees together to see what fits your playstyle is part of the fun.   + For a 10-year-old game, this game looks fantastic. It easily holds up by todays standards, a great example of how good art direction and style can make a long lasting impression.   + The game takes place across 5 Acts, each act focusing on a different mythology; Greek, Egypt, China etc. Every Act is varied with multiple locations, numerous side quests, unique enemies etc.   + Multiplayer is back. Never did I expect to play Titan Quest with other people. Full credit to the developers for updating the game and making multiplayer work again.   + Updated UI for a more modern feel.   + Tons of bug fixes, improvements and balance changes   + Tons of great loot  + Optional bosses in the harder difficulty levels.   + Workshop mods to further extend replay value.   The Average:  Every Act features its own variety of enemies yet most of them are just variants from previous enemies. Most enemies behave in two ways, they either rush you or stay back and fire arrows/magical spells at you.   Majority of side quests involved killing a group of monsters. However, the last act (the expansion) seems to have more well thought out and diverse side quests.    Conclusion:  Titan's Quest is arguably one of the best action rpgs to be released in the last 10 years other than Diablo. It is one of my favorite action Rpgs based on the sheer number of ways you can build your character, the variety of locations  and the great loot. Every action rpg lover should have this game in their library. ",

For a low price, (or kindly free for previous Titan Quest owners) this remastered edition of a fantastic experience can be enjoyed once more.   With upgraded visuals, mechanics, utilities and content, Titan Quest still manages to encapsulate the original's atmosphere and overall quality without obtrusively changing the core experience. Updated anti-cheat mechanics and 'quality of life' changes fix some past issues, while the remastered visuals and audio are as wonderful and on point as before. Multiplayer receives an essential touch up, as well as outdated resolution and scaling fixes. Included in this update is Steam functionality and achievements, and the ever present trading cards...   Titan Quest: Anniversay Edition is a wonderful upgrade to an already fantastic title, and will demand a future playthrough. I highly recommend picking up this classic experience, and one that has definitely aged well throughout the years.",

Handcrafted levels in a diablolike/arpg set in ancient Greece/Egypt. Quite fun but the progression style of having to devote points into individual skills (which could get you screwed with some of the class/skill combinations) is pretty annoying (then again, I did like the flexibility added by diablo 3 where you unlock the skills, the modifiers, and pick and choose whatever skills you want to use, and see if they synergize with your gear and each other), but it is still a damn fun game.  On the other hand I never did finish Titan Quest even in its original form, not a single difficulty, while I got hooked on Grim Dawn (though I will probably not go farther than the first difficulty there until there is an expansion).

There's tons of loot with interesting modifiers, relics &amp; charms to upgrade said gear, epic and varied locations to explore, countless monsters and bosses to slaughter and an amazing class / talent system (play as a Paladin, Druid, Juggernaut, Thane, Oracle, Soothsayer and a dozen or so more).

Piercing damage is not affected by armor but instead a resistance percentage that caps out at 80%, this resistance is not commonplace to find, pets also have no resistances unless effected by an arua. To make matters worse, later enemies almost entitrely replace their physical damage with piercing damage, making armor practically useless.

What set this aside is of course the fact that it takes place in Roman/Greek mythology.   I am pleasantly surprised that the game has held up with the test of time, I played a few hours and had some fun. The graphics are OK, and they have updated the video to allow play on the wide screen monitors at the 1920x1080 resolution which gives you since not bad looking graphics, it is a bit outdated, but the retro look is fine and after all the proof is in the game play as much as the graphics.  Game play is typical ARPG, smack monsters finish quests level up, pick a profession or two continue on the journey. If you have not played this game, but have played the recent release of Grim Dawn, the leveling mechanics will be familiar. Through unlike grim dawn I have yet to find something that will allow me to refund points for a more focused build which later on I assume can come back and haunt you.   While I don't think this will be a goto game for me, a play through will certainly be worth it just to see the story line. There are far more polished games on the market POE and Grim Dawn but none set in a unique time frame like TQ.   For the RETRO feel, game play and fun this is a 7.5/10, I would rate this higher but I don't know if it has the repeat appeal that POE or even D3 has. But I will acknowledge that Grim Dawn took some mechanics from this game. and this is worth a play.",

            "review_text": "Its strange how much things have changed in the gaming world in ten years. Ive been playing games longer than most people on steam have been alive probably and I remember a time when there were several good releases in every genre every year. Despite there being more choice now than ever most genres dont even exist outside of the occasional kickstarter or remake. I remember when a good RTS was released every 8 months, an isometric turn-based strategy game was a genre not just an 'X-com' rip off and you would get a good one every year at least. Go 'Commandos'. That was when ARPG's were not games that really were compared to each other except by hardcore battlenet players and there werent as many of those. Most people lanned Diablo 2 with their buddies and were open to mixing it up anytime a good ARPG came out. Titan Quest was one of those, a really solid game that I think gets better with age because it wasnt so succesful its been heavily copied. The cross classing is still pretty unique for an ARPG, as well as its decision to have a colorful simple yet tasteful palette visually, along with npcs that actually have interesting dialogue; the storytellers come to mind. Most people actually bought a game to beat it and the amount of content in it did not disappoint.   I really only bought this game the day it came to hopefully help convince whoever controls the property to make a sequel. But I will say its held up so well I played it for hours when I finally got around to firing it up. Now I have plans on running through it at least once more.  If you beat this and really enjoy it check out Grim Dawn. A game made by some of the developers of this. Uses the same engine, has cross classing, relics and level design that higlights changes in altitude.",

Less a polished special edition then the equivalent of George Lucas adding unnecessary garbage to the Star Wars Trilogy.  So here's the deal. I liked the original Titan Quest, I played through both the base game and the DLC. I was kind of excited to see this version come out and was looking forward to checking it out. And then I played it and the crushing disappointment set in.  For me at least, the difficulty level of the game was jacked up to sky high levels. I was doing next to no damage to enemies, having to desperately kite them around and chip away at their health in a way that I can only describe as completely unfun.  There are clearly many people that enjoy this playstyle, I've asked in the forums about the difficulty change and some people don't even think it changed. All I can say is that for me, it changed so much that I no longer care to play it. I'd rather play the originals then this one.  A pattern has emerged. The fans of the game will always respond with suggestions about how you just have to tailor your character to a few specific build types, and pick resistances and attacks that correspond with the specific enemy you're attacking. The thing is I don't really care to play that way, and I didn't have to before. I was able to play it for fun without having to worry about making the optimal skill tree choices and knowing that a single bad choice could doom my character.  If you enjoy the prospect of spending ten or more hours building up a character only to find that they're too weak to progress any further and having to start over, then this is the game for you. I'm honestly surprised that anyone finds that to be a good thing, but I've seen fans on the forums saying that they enjoy it for just that reason.  But for me, merely progressing is such a painful, tedious grind that I see no point in even getting to that point.",

            "review_text": "  I played this when it originally came out and still have the box and disc to prove it! When released it filled the gap that had been left open by diablo / diablo II that somehow Sacred, although it was good didn't manage to fill.  The thing that immediately set Titan Quest apart from others of its ilk was the fact it was set in history using Greek, Egyptian and Chinese mythology rather than being a full blown fantasy setting.   It did have it's bugs though and unfortunately these have carried through to the anniversary addition. I have a machine that can handle this whilst asleep but the stuttering is still there which can literally mean death sometimes as you accidentally run into an enemy hero and his minions through no fault of you own. There are also a couple of multiplayer bugs and the looting system shows its age with loot ninjas having a field day.  Putting the bugs aside this game is still only the original that has been given a few upgrades to make it run on newer systems, graphics are pretty but slightly dated, skill trees have been fixed as best they could and are more balanced than they were and multiplayer is a better experience. The only thing I have noticed is the single player didn't last as long as I remember it and replayability wise its very samey.  If you like ARPG's and liked Grim Dawn, made by the same people who made Titan Quest, then for the price this is a must buy as in my opinion they are as good as each other gameplay wise. If new to the arpg gameplay due to the price it is a good place to start.  Not perfect by any means but full of nostalgia, for me at any rate 7/10",

I do have some negatives though:  * At level 32 I got a blue weapon, which I thought would be awesome... but it was a level 22 weapon, making it almost no better than the yellow weapon I had. * At level 34 I killed a boss mob and he dropped a yellow level 15 weapon and a yellow level 18 chest piece. It's nigh on impossible to get gear that matches your level or even comes close to it. * I'm playing as a Thane - Warfare and Storm masteries - I would estimate more than 90% of green gear or above that drops is 100% int based. I'm after strength, some dex, and a little int. Any int gear that drops requires far more int than I have and therefore is useless to me.  Basically the gear system needs some work.  Other than that, though, I've completed the original game and expansion several times and I've had a lot of fun in it. Still do, in fact. I recommend the game, with a little caution that the gear system can be frustrating,",
