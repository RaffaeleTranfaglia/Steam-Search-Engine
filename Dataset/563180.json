            "review_text": "  I want to point out that I'm probably bias since I'm knowing the developer and help maintain the C++ library that was used to build this game.  I have quite a passion for platformer games, yet I'm not the best at it and rather enjoy some more casual platformers. Dispersio falls for me a bit in the middle of both casual and precision platformers. If the game were too 'hardcore' I would have never gotten as far, yet I had struggled in quite a few rooms, because the timing has to be extremly precise.  But honestly if you like retro looking games or just like platformers this game with the given price is a no brainer. You get multiple hours of entertainment for just one buck!",
