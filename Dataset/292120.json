            "review_text": "It's really hard to talk about this game. I've finally beaten Final Fantasy XIII and the first thing that comes to mind is, it really is a unique experience. So, is it good? Well, I can't say I liked it, but I can see why others would enjoy it or even love it. That's why you'll find so many different opinions about this game. I'm not recommending it because buying it is a risky move anyway. But let me tell you, if you think you're going to like it, you probably will, so go ahead and buy it if that's the case.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. The game is extremely linear. No excuses. The problem isn't that you go from point A to point B and you can't do side quests or something else, that's something to be expected in some RPGs to be honest. But here, it's not just side quests that you can't do. You can't do anything. 90% of the game is a hallway. You can't find hidden stuff. You can't pick a different path to get to point B. You can't even *talk* to NPCs (well, you can, but you just have to stand in front of them and that's it). The interaction with the environment does not exist. I honestly can't feel attached to a world that seems to be static and unalterable. But of course, maybe you don't mind playing a game like this.  Once you get to Gran Pulse you are allowed to do a bunch of sidequests, mount chocobos and find treasures, yes, but that doesn't change the fact that the worlds feels... dead. You can't do much, you still can't explore and meet people, explore towns, or at least know a bit more about the main characters. It doesn't feel like an open world game just because you're free to move around.  The story is rather confusing, but that doesn't mean it's bad (especially if that's the kind of stuff you like). And I hope you like it because it's the most important thing that this game has to offer, and if you don't, you're screwed. Same with the main characters, they play a big role in the game, and they're not your typical heroes. Instead, they seem to be taken straight from a shonen anime, with extremely pronounced personalities. That's been done before (remember Palom and Porom? Locke? Zidane?) so keep that in mind.  I think this Final Fantasy has a way better battle system than the previous ones, and most people seem to agree. It's dynamic and relatively fast-paced, and probably my favorite aspect of this game. But since you don't have much to do in the game, you're going to see it a lot.  In short, you have to like the story, the style, and maybe the battle system. That's pretty much what Final Fantasy XIII is. An on-rails RPG with no interactivity, with a long story and lots of battles.",

            "review_text": "Have you ever encountered a tedious/annoying sidequest in a Final Fantasy game? And even though you didn't really ENJOY that portion of the game, you finished it anyway, because you wanted 100% completion. And besides, the music is nice, and it's better than going outside?  FF XIII.... is that.  I'm not sure that I really had fun playing this game at any point. It's the most experimental gameplay since FF2j. It's not like other FF games where you can overlevel through grinding and sidequests and then faceroll everything. Instead, combat is strategic: buffs and debuffs and paradigms matter, because 90% of the game is a low-level challenge playthrough. This is cool in concept, but makes even trash mob battles take forever. Also, the game is incredibly linear up until the end. Once they finally set you loose, you're stuck with a frustrating rotating map.  Honestly, if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan, just buy it and play it.   Seriously... in your life you've probably fought 256 battles to un-curse the Cursed Shield, Mastered Knights of the Round, won the Excalibur II, and dodged 200 lightning bolts on the Thunder Plains. If you did all that for Final Fantasy, then you can slog through this Hallway Simulator to hear some of the best FF music in years and watch beautiful cutscenes that will get your Pulse racing. So just play the game and l'Cie for yourself.",

            "review_text": "Unless you've somehow never heard of Final Fantasy before, chances are you've seen or heard about those immature rage-filled arguments between fans of the series over which game is the best, which is the worst, and the torrent of insults, allegations, and assumptions made about each person who disagrees with which of the Final Fantasy games are good or bad. I've seen -less- attempts to undermine someone's character and credibility in political campaigns. Too many fans have been jackasses to one another about these games, often claiming certain entries in the series do nothing right, or that they have no flaws.   It is my intention to inform users about FFXIII without ignoring its problems or overstating them, and to give my personal opinion on the game, which is not 'right' or 'wrong' because what makes each gamer enjoy a game or dislike a game differs from person to person. For example, John might prefer FFIV because the game has pre-determined character classes for each playable character, while another player named Greg might prefer FFI because you choose your character classes on your own. There are multiple legitimate arguments for -both- of these systems, and being completely put off by either of these games simply due to these systems is legitimate as well. However, neither of these two hypothetical players are 'wrong' or deserving of being on the receiving end of jackassery.  Space is really tight, so I've shortened the above as best I can while keeping its meaning, and will be presenting it in a Q&amp;A fashion with common negatives brought up about the game as the questions. So, without further ado~  Q. PC Port, good or bad? I've been hearing bad things... A. I'm naive when it comes to framerates. It looked and played great on my PC, which was close to the top of the line when Wolfenstein The New Order launched. Mouse/keyboard controls worked great, too, and can be freely remapped! You may want to read into reviews of gamers who are more tuned into framerates if that's really important to you. =)  Q. I hear this game is like one big curving hall? That's just people exaggerating, right? A. It's not a bad descriptor. I want to be fair to this game, but you are funneled toward your objective the entire time except for one very large map 20-32 hours into the game. A couple of turns will briefly take you away from your objective to go grab an item, but you will be right back in the 'hall' again soon enough. Also, there are no traditional towns/cities to visit and NPCs are rare. Items are all bought at save points from online shops, and I didn't buy -anything- until I was maybe 50 hours into the game. You could forget shops are even in the game because they're not necessary until post-game. However, despite the hallway issue, almost every environment is insanely gorgeous, with lots of soft electronic music featuring female vocals, violin, and piano. I loved it, and my senses were blissfully deceived into not caring about the 'hall'/shops/NPCs decision.  Q. This is a JRPG. How much grinding do I have to do?  A. There are no random battles. Enemies can all be seen in the distance. If you're just going to complete the storyline, kill almost every enemy encounter you spot, and you'll likely be maxed out much of the time. The leveling system is like FFX's sphere grid, except more is unlocked when you beat certain bosses, and it lacks much choice until about the time you finish the storyline. It didn't ruin the game for me or anything, but manually choosing upgrades seemed to lack purpose for most of the game. Back on topic of grinding, though, if you want to do the optional post-game stuff, you could spend far more time getting your stats maxed and getting rare drops. Trapezohedrons are necessary to start getting the best weapons, and despite spending hours trying to get just one, I never did. The post-game is many players' favorite part of FFXIII, but for me, it was a massive time suck without any pay-off because I was just unlucky with item drops despite following the advice of multiple walkthroughs on item farming. I'm glad I did it because I wanted to be thorough in my review, but I don't believe I will ever bother to do the post-game stuff again if I play through the game another time as it was a miserable experience for me that made me look back on the game less fondly. To get through the mind-numbing grind boredom, I had to Youtube and read to keep from quitting.  Q. How are the characters? A. I liked most of them. A character named Hope is angry during the first 15 or so hours of the game, and he can make you hate him a -lot-. Unfortunately, his Magic stat is the best in the game, and he's the best Medic, so he'll probably end up on your team. =( A character named Vanille is the stereotypical Japanese entertainment 'cute young girl,' but I didn't really find her annoying most of the time. However, in combat, she makes sounds like she's having whiny intercourse, which may be a plus for some people, but it gets pretty old in my opinion. Each character is best at one particular role, and decent in others. Although you'll probably have a favorite all-purpose team, there are situations where it is advantageous to temporarily use different characters, so I liked that.  Q. Some people say the storyline is amazing and some say it's the worst one ever written for a FF game. Which is it? A. If you don't overthink the plot, it's entertaining. However, if you start asking questions and applying logic to much of it, the storyline unravels quickly. A fellow on Youtube named Noah who goes by 'Spoony' does a very hateful review of FFXIII, which I find to be excessively harsh, but he makes -some- valid points about the storyline which I can't argue with. The plot has some major issues, but I wouldn't call it terrible.  Q. I hear the summons in this game aren't very useful? Really? They're amazing in virtually all the other FF games! A. The summons have incredibly specific uses to exploit certain things in the game, like knocking Adamantoises over for easy kills and preventing one enemy from curing itself of poison. I found summons useless for about 95% of fights. Each character gets exactly one summon (called an Eidolon). They are Transformers. No kidding. They look like robots or weird humanoids and transform with folding/sliding/rotating parts into a car, horse, etc. It's kinda awesome. That said, they really are useless most of the game, to the point that I feel they should have been left out in their current state, and better alternatives to the aforementioned exploits should have been offered instead.  Q. I heard the game plays itself and you don't pick your attacks. Is that true? A. You control one character in your 3-person party, and can choose auto-battle for that character, or specific abilities, and can then manually pick each attack. Auto-battle basically tells the character to do the obvious thing the character should do. I'm fighting an ice monster. I've used a spell to ID it so my characters know it's weak to fire. If I switch my character to an attack magic job (ravager), of -course- I want to attack with fire, and that's what the game does. The game knows what my intentions are by clicking auto-battle. Making me select fire is pointless. If I want to inflict negative status effects, I'll manually change jobs to do so. I do not see any loss of agency, but I can understand that some players may feel deprived of that agency due to older entries making you manually choose everything. Also, prideful players might feel that playing a game with a button labeled 'auto-battle' makes them look weak or won't enable them to brag about their victories, so if either of those are an issue for you, you may wish to pass on FFXIII.  I have issues with FFXIII, but it's a feast for my eyes and ears which I had a blast with prior to the post-game, and would recommend it to fans of JRPGs who aren't put off by the issues I discussed.",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII. Admittedly, being a PC-exclusive gamer for the last decade or so, I haven't played too many JRPGs lately, and I was frankly thrilled to finally be able to play a modern Final Fantasy game on PC. Final Fantasy VI (SNES) is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've briefly played but never beat (rented back in the day) FF 7, 8 and 9.   The game is as linear as they say, but I didn't really have a problem with it. I play Final Fantasy games primarily for the story and spectacle, and then the battles, and then very distantly the out-of-battle gameplay sections. FF13 performs strongly in the first two, so being pretty much completely linear for most of the game isn't really that big of a deal. I really enjoyed the story, and though some have complained that it's confusing or hard to follow, I found it easy enough to understand (though I did read all of the datalogs religiously, which definitely helps).   Some stuff I really enjoyed are some new 'convenience features' that basically remove most of the things I find annoying about JRPGs. Namely: -No random battles! You can see (and usually avoid) any enemy on the world map.  -Your party is automatically healed and cured at the end of every battle (so you don't have to micromanage all that stuff yourself all the time) -If you die in battle, you can restart the battle immediately to try again, and it even starts you outside of battle so you can change your party/upgrades/paradigms or just run away. This even applies to boss battles! -No grinding - the game is somewhat challenging (though there's also an easy mode you can switch to at any time), but I never felt the need to stay in one area and grind experience before moving on. Grinding is boring and it's exclusion will not be missed.  The battle system is really novel. You only control one character, and you have an 'auto-attack' option (though you can still individually choose your attacks if you want). There are 6 different roles, and a combination of these roles is a paradigm. The main focus of battle is switching up your paradigms for the situation, sort of macro-managing the battle rather than micromanaging every single move. I found this quite an enjoyable change of pace from the same battle system that's been in FF for years.  As an aside: yes, the port is horrible, and it's absolutely shameful that they'd lock such a beautiful game to 720p. Fortunately this is easily fixed with the program 'GeDoSaTo' (created by legendary modder Durante, who also fixed Dark Souls 1). The framerate is weirdly inconsistent during battles (bouncing between 30 and 60, despite sitting at like 30% GPU load, and 10% CPU load) but it wasn't enough to put me off from playing the game.  Overall I enjoyed my time spent with FF13. The game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at 1080p (I've taken several hundred screenshots during my playthrough), the story and characters are interesting (except Snow, ♥♥♥♥ that guy), and the battle system is fun and novel. My JRPG experience is admittedly a bit lacking, but I loved them back in the SNES days, and if FF13 is anything to go by, I still love them now.",

Maybe I have a rather different view not being a Final Fantasy person (not played any others, though I have been exposed to bits and pieces over the years) and the game certainly doesn't try to hide its linearity like most RPGs do. But from a game design point of view it really isn't that much more linear than a lot of western heavy story focused RPGs (I'm looking at most BioWare RPGs here). I'd have preferred they at least *tried* to hide the fact and made it a bit more open but for the story they were telling it fits.  Perhaps the FF tropes of characters (I hear that there has been an infestation of broody, aloof, emo protags) has gotten to the point that people are tired but, coming from a new persepctive, I didn't find Lightning grating. While the rest of the cast varied none struck me as awful (by the end, after characters arcs) as people like to rant about.  Worth giving it a go if you like RPGs, especially if you aren't a hardcore FF / JRPG type.",

Whenever I get into a battle it drops frames and it's a lot more enjoyable with a controller. Though you could just connect a controller to your computer to play it. The story is really enjoyable although it is really linear which you just have to get used to. The next two Final Fantasy XIII's are not as linear as this one. The music is also really enjoyable with most other Final Fantasy Games. If you are going to finish this I would highly reccomend finishing the next two titles in the XIII Series.

            "review_text": "THE GAME: What I once regarded as my least favorite Final Fantasy game by far, and one of my least favorite games ever, has somehow grown on me quite a bit given a lot more time. To get the negatives out of the way, the bulk of the game, especially the critical path, is extremely linear, sometimes even resembling series of interconnected hallways with battles scattered along the way. That said, there is a very rewarding wealth of late-game content awaiting those who can persevere. A huge number of optional side quests and expansive, wide-open areas, in stark contrast to the former half to two thirds of the game. However, as I found out, it is very much worth the wait.   And the real core of the experience, and what drove me to keep going to the end (and then some), is the excellent combat system. The battle system is fairly unconventional for a FF game, while still drawing a lot of inspiration from the previous entries, giving a sense of familiarity to series fans, while also making it feel very fresh and different. This difference is something that you may love or hate. Yes, there is a lot of 'mash A to win' in the combat here, but once the game finally allows you to experience all of what the combat system has to offer, you'll understand that the addition of an 'auto battle' menu option in battle doesn't actually dumb down or simplify the tried and true Final Fantasy combat, but instead shifts the tactical focus to clever use of the 'paradigm shift' mechanic at the right times to dole out the damage, buff/debuff, heal, etc. What this ultimately means is FFXIII offers as much tactical potential in its combat as the previous games in the series, while making it feel much faster-paced and intense. It is extremely unfortunate that the game forcibly holds your hand for nearly 10 hours before finally letting you really get an idea of what this combat can offer, and another 15-20 hours on top of that to really let you go nuts with it, but if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded greatly.  Visually, the game is still incredible looking, regardless of the fact that it came out nearly 5 years ago. The music is excellent as well, almost across the board, as is usually the case with the Final Fantasy series. As for the story and characters, it's a mixed bag, and definitely something that will differ based on personal tastes. For me, I didn't find much substance in either. There are certainly some flashy moments here and there, but I mainly looked forward to getting back to combat any time a cutscene popped up.  THE PORT: Now, just like the game is a bit of a mixed bag, the same goes for this PC port. It's pretty obvious that there wasn't a ton of effert put into sprucing the game up for it's PC debut: a complete lack of graphical options, resolution that is locked to 1280x720, plenty of performance issues varying from user to user, and a MASSIVE download size weighing in at about 50 gigabytes. It's far from a polished release, for sure. That being said, it's also a relatively inexpensive release, at a regular $15 at the time of this writing, and for that price and the amount of time I've been able to put into it so far, I can look past the few crashes and occasional framerate hiccups (or chokes, at times), and be pretty happy with the purchase. And if they manage to patch the game up and improve performance, then all the better.  TLDR: The game has an amazing combat system hidden under a soso story and HOURS of linear, handholding gameplay, but the wait is well worth it. The PC port is also pretty iffy, but if you can look past the performance flaws, you'll have a good time with it for the price.",

Whilst people would argue differently over the characters, they often fail to realise that a character you hate is just as good as a character you love in terms of, well, their CHARACTER. It is the reason we all wanted Geoffrey dead in Game of Thrones, because he was such a good CHARACTER.  If you have not played any Final Fantasy game before this is a fantastic game to begin with. The best, I would argue. Not that this is the games only redeeming factor, nor is it diminished by any of the other games. If you are someone who is looking to step into this series and see what all the commotion is about, then this is the game for you. Should you like it, continue on through to play the coming sequels to this Trilogy that will be released over the next year or so. Should you not, put the game down and walk away, you lose nothing but a few hours of your time, if that. You are only denying yourself the chance to experience what I think to be an absolutely outstanding game if you shape your decisions off of the vocal hatred witnessed often for this title.  This review is made for the people looking to test the water in our critically acclaimed Final Fantasy but are unsure of where to start. Do not look to this game and be discouraged by a vocal minority that spout various criticisms and compare it to their beloved Final Fantasy '#'. This game has a much larger fanbase that love the game than the ones who adamantly put it down at every turn. The fact that they do so in both the reviews and forums of a game they don't own speaks volumes as I'm sure you can imagine.  Okay, opinions aside now I'll list you a couple of quickfire Pros and Cons.  PROS: .Story Rich .Beautiful Soundtrack .Beautiful Graphics .Beautiful and Varied Scenery .Constant Character Development .Wide variety of Character customization in the forms of Weapons and Equipment and a unique levelling system. .Plethora of challenging Endgame content  CONS: .Considered linear initially .Characters can be unrelatable at times, if you don't take the time to read the Data Logs. .Starts off slowly .Difficult, though this can be made considerably easier by grinding",

Locked at 1280x720 resolution, no graphics settings, absolutely gigantic download (60 GB + 120 GB required for install), and badly optimized so framerate jumps all over the place and stutters a lot. The FMV cutscenes and audio are also supposedly lower quality than the PS3 version.  I know it's not right to judge the game entirely technically, but since this is a port of an old game released YEARS AGO and the only selling point was for people to play it on PC with enhanced graphics and all, well...it does not deliver that at all. You might as well play the console version for a better experience.  Thank god there's at least a way to mod higher resolutions in, but really, Square should've fixed that themselves. It's outrageous to release any kind of PC game without offering any graphics options whatsoever and it just shows that they paid no attention whatsoever into this port. Even the instant esc-button closing the game feels super cheap like this was a test build and they couldn't be bothered to create a proper menu for it.  I'm all for more games being ported to PC but this minimum effort kind of release is not the right way to do it at all. I can't support it. I'm only playing it because I missed the PS3 release which I might as well have played instead.",

FFXIII is a solid game with a great cast of voice actors, characters, and phenomenal gameplay with a really interesting plot that's reminiscent of FFX.  Having said that, locking the graphics at 720p was plain stupid and I can only hope with the next Final Fantasy on Steam they will realize exactly what the consumer base of PC gaming actually wants in a game.

There's no quit option, you basically just save your game and then press ESC which just closes the game without asking or anything.   Resolution is locked to 720p, which would have been fine 10 years ago. Nothing like basically losing half the screen on my 16:10 monitor to giant black bars on the top and bottom. There is a 3rd party fix for it (just like there was for FFXI), but unfortunately it makes the menus unreadable for me. Maybe I'll be able to get them to work properly with the 3rd party tool, maybe not. In the unlikely event that Squenix gets their head out of the ground and fixes these issues, I would more than likely change this to a recommended game, but as it is you should avoid it.  As somebody who hasn't owned a console since the PS2, I was actually looking forward to finally getting to play this game. I guess from now on the takeaway is going to be wait and see and not pre-order older but well recieved games - especially from Squenix.  edit: Looks like they've heard our complaints and will be adding custom resolutions shortly in December.

Kb/m controls are glitchy. We had to make threads on steam and wait months just to get above 720p resolution and graphical options, which are still very limited. That's how bad a port this is.  Now, the game itself. It looks very good. The cutscenes look amazing, the story is kind of interesting, and, if it's the sort of thing you look for in a game, the female characters are done very well imo, except for Vanille, she's kind of annoying. The battle system takes a while to get the hang of but when you do, it's quite good. Until then, you will be just spamming the A button. The story focuses on a group of unlucky individuals who have been cursed - 'l'cie' (some of the names in this game are silly, and it throws a bunch of nouns at you immediately which you won't understand) They struggle with their fate - which for me is one of the more interesting parts of the story. A good part of the game is just them coming together as a group, and figuring out their destiny, which makes the dynamic of the group strong and interesting.  The game is very linear. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't so repetitive. There is nothing to do besides walk forwards, fight, cutscene. The game desperately needed some variation, some more puzzle solving, or something. It's too long, too. Be prepared to walk, battle, cutscene for 100 hours+. There are no towns, and very little people to actually interact with in the world, which makes me question why this is even a game at all, and not a film/tv series/ anime. When the game finally opens up all you get are quests, go here kill this monster, but at this point the thought of doing any more battles felt like such a chore I skipped most of them. The upgrade system is a complete gamble and you end up wasting so much money through being inefficient at what's essentially a guessing game. The crystarium levelling system is a perfect metaphor for the game: looks flashy, but in fact is very linear with few branching paths. I am seriously failing to understand what the logic behind some of these design decisions were, unless they thought 'It's final fantasy, we can do no wrong.' Well, they did wrong. I remember the devs talking about streamlining the game to make it more accessible. Well, that was a bad idea, because nobody who doesn't already play total grindfests will want to spend more than a few hours playing this.  I tried to enjoy this game, I really did. I tried to persevere through the repetition to find out what happens in the end. But it's just too much. They should have made this game 15-20 hours, cut most of the flashy yet ultimately linear and boring levels and told a much tighter, more varied story through more than just the cutscenes. It feels like a bunch of grinding attached to an admittedly very stylish and good looking collection of cut-scenes which tell an interesting story. It's just a shame that the actual game couldn't have been better.",

That's it. That's the short review: skip to XIII-2 and never look back, the story doesn't mean a damn. If you absolutely, positively must catch up prior to XIII-2, watch the video Square released prior to Lightning Returns that summed up the entire plot to date in a 16-bit style in about 6 minutes. It's more coherent than this entire game.  Alright, let's just break this down some, because that deserves explanation.  The battle engine is DECENT, but you're going to be stuck with a highly-gimped version of the combat system for HALF THE GAME. I mean, I know the early chapters are shorter than the later ones? But you don't unlock 'everyone has all their job roles' (and no, this isn't FFV-style jobs, it's 'you fit into this style of skill when in that class', no variance, no ability carryover, only stat gains) until CHAPTER TEN OF THIRTEEN. Even with my lopsided playtime, that's still over a third through the game before you can finally use all of its functions.  The port's got issues. I just upgraded this machine under half a year ago from scratch, a solid setup, and even then there's still weird frame chugging. God willing they'll patch that up some when Lightning Returns drops (there was an engine update on XIII-2's release that was... questionably helpful), but expect hitching. More than a few areas still look gorgeous, though, props there.  Yes, it is about as linear as you've heard. There is basically a single chunk of game where you aren't on one-way-briefly-branching paths, and that one is just a huge open field, which is a middle-finger in that there's kiiiiiind of fast-travel, but you have to complete a sidequest to open each point. And go to one of them to warp to the others. And you can only hold one sidequest at once. So it's miserable to get around is what I'm saying. I guess there's post-game stuff to do there too, but heck if I really want to do more of this for completion's sake now that I'm done when I have XIII-2 in my library to actually enjoy.  Finally, there's the story. This story is hot trash. The finale is unquestionably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in JRPGs, and I want you to really,  really  ponder what that implies. It's not even funny dumb, either, because I'd be marking this as a positive if so. It's 'none of this makes any sense and it's all random BS at this point'. The tale goes that this game's development was such a trainwreck that all the cutscenes were done far before the game, meaning that rather than scrap those scenes, they had to write around already-animated footage? I can believe it. Characters 'die' only to reappear an hour later nonsensically, people flip personalities on a dime all the way to endgame, and I still can't quite understand what the relationship between a few characters was because it's ENTIRELY ALIEN AND UNIQUE TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME.  I am literally telling you to skip this and play its sequels if you want anything to do with this story, and you will be better off for it. 100% sincere here. The soundtrack is decent (and I mean DECENT, not amazing or anything), and that's about the best praise I can give this that doesn't have the qualifier '...but the sequels did it better so you don't need to stick your hand into the rough edges of this title'.",

While it's perfectly playable (controls are decent on either joypad or keyboard and mouse, despite their respective lack of rumble and sensitivity settings; it's also more fun than the naysayers will have you believe), it's full of audio/visual stuttering, takes up a massive amount of hard drive space, and is locked to 720p by default.

Most of the time i wished they would shut up or just disappear. Especially the youngest member of the cast.  The Story is ok, but for me it isnt something much to remember. Same with FF 12. I played through it, but cant really remember what happened at the end.  As a summary: If you see this game on sale and you like RPGs give it a try by all means, but dont expect it to reach the level of a FF 6 or 7. Even FF 10 was way better then this.",

            "review_text": "This is my first FF game, i never saw any, read about any, i actually not even known much about it, all i known was this game from japan, this is some kind of rpg, and this game for consoles, thats all. After i have finished the story and almost all side quests i started to search about FF universe and another games, i also tryed some more FF games, not so many so far, FF13-2 FF13-3 Type 0 and FF4, just to compare this game with others, because lot of true FF fans just hate this game, so i was just wondered why. Well i saw lot of bad reviews with one main 'problem' like they said, this game is too far different from FF universe, well i can say nothing about it, i repeat this is my first experience in FF, but i can say a lot of good things about this game.  1. First of all graphic, i was really shocked, its just amasing, i didnt skip any cutscenes (about 8-10h ^^ even when i killed last bost and watched final cutscene, was another last boss after that and like 4-5 last scenes more, and then true final boss with true final cutscene), it looks very colorful and beaty, this game was originaly released in 2009-2010, and i tryed it in 2016. Graphic not main plus of this game, it just first thing i noticed  2. Story. well first 5h i think i just didnt get any ♥♥♥♥ing minds about story, it was not even hard to understand, it just was like im playing it on japan, all i could say about story was 2 words: l'cie and Fal'cie. But after some time i realised whats going on (tnx to database) and was really inspired, its not that unique, it has same 'rules' with same words like 'love' 'never' 'together' 'forever' and so on, whatever i liked it much, and one of reason because of music.  3. Soundtrack. i already have favorites songs like 'dust to dust', or 'snow theme' or 'Archylte Steppe theme'. but most excited thing about music in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing right track in ♥♥♥♥ing right moment, really sometimes smiley sometimes lonely, but alwasy in right time and right place. for me one of this moment was when u first visited oerba and dust to dust song was playing, wet eyes  4. Characters, and ofc perfect woman - beatch LIGHTNING, first i hated Snow much and ofc always crying Hope, but later in game i just couldnt imagine someone instead of anyone of the group, again was just perfect summ from both procs and cons, all chars will say typical ♥♥♥♥ in their dialogs, bla bla bla forever ever never whatever, but its just nice gang, at least i was enjoed while was with them, and btw for me vanille just a little bit high, not autism like all haters saying, and high woman its just fun. oneworddescribe Lightning - beatch/(or perfect, just same to me). Snow - 'hero', Hope - woman/child, Sazh - black (no offence, no rasism, just one always must be black, because of rules, i repeat for me no matter even if they all were black, jsut fun to watch another game or movie where everyone white, but at least one must be for sure black, god tnx his son at least black too) Vanille - high, Fang - vanille's friend (show me you friends and i will tell about you, right?)  5. Gameplay, talking about battle mechaincs now - so im not really that good in any strateges rts or turn based, not only i hate strateges, but it seems they hate me too, so i was really afraid of this here. Well for my pleasure gameplay is weird, i mean its not true turn based, and not true real time, i dont even know how to call it correct, just google it ^^. And when u not in battle u just moving straight forward from battle to battle. there is some kind of open world in post game, but whole game yes its linear, just regular walk from battle to battle through stroy cutscenes, but i cant say its bad, at least in this game. And also u will use 1 button always, yes its true this game is onebutton but only before first mob which kill you, well and even after u will still almost always use one button - auto attack, yes mob it wont be boss who KOed you first. But its not slasher with combos and etc, all u will need to do is figure out paradigms and equipment for this battle and correctly switch it during battle. For me at end it really remind just puzzle.  6. Leveling system, ♥♥♥♥ yes i love it, its simple u cant screw it and then create new game just because of your inta was not enough for casting golems.... for me its perfect, u dont need at least read freaking guides about BEWARE ABOUT STAT POINTS SON  7. I said at the begining not graphic main plus of this game, what is main u ask, i think all, i mean its not just graphic with some sountrack and so on in my list, i think all these things are just common but all they made this game perfect TOGETHER FOREVER WHATEVER   PS: if u need cons feel free to just find red review in store page",

            "review_text": "This game got a lot of hate when it first came out thanks to the serious issues it had with player freedom. The first 15-20 hours are spent in a series of extremely linear areas where you can't even choose your party members. First impressions aren't great.  But after the questionable opening chapters the game really opens up. It gives you lots of places to explore and vicious monsters to fight(or run away from while shouting NOPE!). The combat system is interesting as it's a combination of turn based and real time mechanics and works very well.  One advantage of the linear opening chapters is that it gives the game a chance to develop a very good story. It revolves around beings known as Fal'Cie. Imagine if the Reapers from Mass Effect were powered by magic and you're kinda on the right track. Won't go further as I'll probably cross into spoiler territory. Since this is Final Fantasy you've still got melodrama, cheesy dialogue and annoying characters but nothing unbearable. They probably could've found a better way to introduce the world and the story that didn't involve drip feeding it to you for 20 hours but there we go.  The many hours you'll have to spend to get to the 'real' game will probably put a lot of people off. But if you can push through it you'll find a very entertaining game",

Like most FF games, it is massive in scope and require many hours of playing to complete, I will start with a list of pros &amp; cons.   Pros:  Massive Game, lots of playing hours Great Characters Great Voice Acting Good Story Extensive &amp; Quite easy to use level-up system Amazing Graphics Overall a very fan game to play   Cons:  You can only control one character during battles Lack of control over Eidolons levels &amp; customization Lack of Eidolons variety Some characters are imbalanced in my opinion Some minor camera bugs Bad Keyboard controls  OK, first thing first, the PC version looks amazingly better than the Xbox 360 version of the game, if you're going to play the game I suggest using a game controller like the X360 wireless controller, it makes the game much easier to navigate and control, and much more enjoyable.  The characters in FF XIII are very well written &amp; the voice acting is absolutely superb, I found many instances in which I could relate to the characters emotions.  The battle system is extensive and elaborate, without the tutorials FF XIII controls will be very difficult to understand for those who play the game for the first time, nevertheless, once you get the hang of it you'll find it to be very fluent, the level system in this game is called  Crystalium  and is basically composed of spherical levels of crystals on a grid with each crystal costing a certain amount of point called CP, it is very extensive and quite easy to understand, it also makes battling enemies more important as that is the only way to gather the points for the level-up system.  Overall, it is a well built system that could have been a little better if it included the ability to level up your characters Eidolons as well.  The few things I was disapointed with in FF XIII was the ability to control only your party leader in battles, while it makes the battles a little more fluent it removes a lot of the controls and the versatility that existed in many past Final Fantasy games, also, the lack of control over the level &amp; customization of the Eidolons and the limited number of Eidolons in the game are a little disappointing.  The game also have some minor camera bugs, mostly at the end of battles when the camera just shakes, it resets as soon as the battle summary screen is shown so it's not a big deal.  Overall, Final Fantasy XIII is a very enjoyable and a very good installment to the series and I very much recommend it to Final Fantasy fans.",

The game doesn't run smooth at 60 FPS capped for me when I have a decent rig, I guess maybe because it's a porting problem, not big of a deal since you see I've play more than 65 hours as of the time I'm reviewing this.  The story, the gameplay is amazing. The waifu, no wait there's no waifu, but I want Lighting to have a bf though, guess I'll have to see what happens in FF XIII-2 that's already in my inventory, bought it right after playing 2 hours of FF XIII with at a very nice price, yay to steam holiday sale :D  If you like JRPG, or just RPG, you gotta play this game, it's amazing I can guarantee you that, ortherwise steam refund is always waiting for you but I dont recommend that.  Don't feel like writing anymore since I've gotta level up all my roles now, and off to FF XIII-2 I go.

Not recommending this game at the moment. Probably later when they patch or someone else come up with something to cope with this problem.

It does some things well, some things are okay and a bunch of'em very bad, which leaves a taste sweet and sour at the time.  The story starts slow, not knowing what's happening besides there are baddies out there and they wanna kill you. As you progress the history, everything starts unravelling in two timelines, the days before the first one (when you start playing) and in the present (by moving the story forward). It gets quite chaotic sometimes but nothing a quick read on the Datalog cannot repair. As boring and bad was the beginning, I think it changed up to good. From 'we bad you good' it changed more into a grey-ish tone at the end, were you cannot feel but think 'Damn. He had a point.'.  The visuals are stunning, but I've a hard-one for this kind of art, so take that with a pinch of salt. The game suffers for some low level textures that don't mesh well with some of the high res one. For example, in some upclose scenes of Ligthning, everything is detailed but the grip from her gunblade isn't. Maybe it was a problem with my own system but damn.  The music delivers, as expected from a FF title even though it wasn't composed by our dear Nobuo Uematsu. If you're curious to hear some of the best tracks of the title. you can google 'Born Anew' (Watch out for the spoilers!) 'Blinded by Light' or the heavier 'Snow's Theme'.  Aaaand the gameplay department. The most controversial of things. In this game, you can only control your main character (that you can change and it's useful to do it due to special skills of each character) and the other ones will act accord a role you have set up (Damage dealer, debuffer, healer, tank...). It starts slow due to not having too much options/party members, but boy it does well later on! You have to constantly switch paradigms to react and adapt or fail on your quest.  Finally, as a port? It sucks so hard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s could do a series with it. I mean, pressing ESC in fullscreen closes the game without a warning! WTF SE? Get Durante's GeDoSaTo and fix it by downsampling (game's locked at 720p in vanilla) and having 60FPS.  In the end? Worth the 10 euros. I beat it on 35 hours (story) and farmed a bunch outside of Steam and started doing sidequests. Game clocks at 90 right now and have to still beat the hardest optional bosses.  Already had beaten it on X360 so had an advantage on some encounters and what-to-do. Even if it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, the PC community always stands up.  Pros:  ·Stunning visuals and music ·Interesting gameplay and difficulty  Cons:  ·Longass tutorial (Pretty much 10 hour long) ·Doesn't feel like the old FF games without a big space to travel around besides an area you unlock later in the game. No overworld map, city visit... ·Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. God bless Durante for fixing it!",

And I sure hope I would have read any reviews before purchasing it... Because what I was stuck with was a extremely poorly optimized game which ran in 720p with no graphics options whatsoever. However, there was still hope for me, within just A DAY the work of ONE man was enough to give me what I craved for. Full HD resolution... Something that should be the absolutely minimum to be supported. Then when I today saw that Square Enix had released an update I got quite excited, so I rushed to the news feed to see what they had updated and this is what I saw...  'Hello,   The FINAL FANTASY XIII team have been working hard to improve your experience on Steam and we're happy to announce the following changes will be rolled out.   ■ All versions  A request-to-confirm notification, will now appear when you try to quit from the full-screen mode. '  Is it not enough that they have yet to be able to do what a single man was able to do within a fraction of the time they had to develop this game, but then they go out and post that they have been working HARD! This makes me rather upset, I would never in my life recommend this game to anyone and it's a shame, it's most likely a pretty decent game which have rather stunning graphics when you are able to play it in 60fps 1080p... However, I can't recommend a game where it takes the developers over a month to put out a fix for something as mundane as the fact that the ESC-button simply shuts down the whole game. A fix like that shouldn't just take less than a day to fix, it shouldn't even have been there from the start.   Square Enix have made great games and I really mean great games.

Battle system is fun for a couple of hours, then became mindlessly routine. kind of Buff &gt; attack &gt; heal &gt; attack &gt; heal &gt; attack &gt; heal &gt; buff. why ? because weapons and items upgrade system that you'll need to upgrade them BUT at least for the first 10 chapter(out of 13) you can't afford it. Result in your attack became relatively weak and those 3M+ hp recycle boss(yeah you'll have to fight the same old boss about 3 time which nothing more than hp add in each time) and your attack around 3k each. it will be painfully LONG battle.   Don't get me wrong, I think item upgrade system is good idea, but they didn't do it right. it worst matching them with Linear gameplay. unless you know what you're doing you'll mess up upgrade weapon with your very limited resource. For accessory it was far worse. You'll get a better one along the way so why upgrade them ? These thing need trial and error but you don't get to do it untill you get to ch. 11 so hang in there, don't lose Hope(he's pretty good dps btw)  The story ... hoo boy ... let's talk about story ( spoiler free ) The plot is cliché, shallow and well ... weak. You got power fight the mumbo jumbo name bad guy and save the world in the process. That's about sum it up. You won't get any sentimental moment like Saphy jump down and slash, dancing in the ballroom or save the princess from the mad queen. since It's action based RPG so don't expect much out of it.

I've spent over 100 hours+ each on Final fantasy series title ( mainly 7 and 9 which I love it. the rest is about half of that time. It make me sad and want to rant it out each time Square relese a new game that manage to get lower and lower. Somehow they spent most of the time on graphic and less on story or gameplay mechanics which is sadden me a lot.  tl;dr If you looking for a game to play over a long holiday that can be left unfinish without so much regret. This is about right to pick it up. Not recommend unless on sale, it's still worth at least that much.

This game consists of about 50 hours worth of hallways with a meaningless throwaway battle every ten steps.  It briefly breaks out of the hallways around the 25-hour mark, opening up the game a bunch and giving you an opportunity to do more meaningless combat until you've leveled up enough to continue. Once you've done a sufficient amount of grinding, it's back to the hallways.  The characters weren't interesting. Out of six characters, only two of them were even believable as human beings. The rest were hamfisted caricatures that seemed to be written by a checklist. The two person-esque characters still weren't anything special.   One of the characters is a scantily-clad 14-year-old girl who moans, sighs, and grunts sexually, nonstop, in every single cutscene. If you weren't watching the cutscenes, it would have you convinced that someone was having sex in the background of every single cutscene she's in.  The story is nonsensical. It meanders tediously, relying entirely on the characters inexplicably wandering to places they have no reason to go to. Over and over and over. Repeat until, all in one cutscene, each and every major plot point gets abruptly and miraculously tied up without any explanations for how these miracles happened.  Deeply unsatisfying.",

It took me about 73ish hours to finish this game which I did not enjoy. Frankly it was too long for me. I don't understand why people would describe this game as 'linear.' When I played it, it did not feel very linear. They're a lot of side quests, lots of stuff you can find if you want, and lots of challenges that you can face if you want and of course there was a lot of grinding. I even got lost a few times wondering 'ok, what am I suppose to be doing now?' The crysterium system (or however it's spelled) was probably one of the most infurating things I've encountered. I would constantly grind to max it out only to find out a few scenes later it would grow even bigger. I've had many moments while playing this game where I've said to myself 'ok this has got to be the end or I'm really close to finishing this game' and I was way off. Let me give you a tip, when you're leveling the crysterium don't put any points in any other roles except the default ones given to the characters from the very begining. Save your points so once you reach level 5 (which is after you finish the game) and max out their main roles then you can start grinding for points in the other roles which aren't really neccessary and you'll probably won't use for some steam achievement or something. Oh and if you stuck on a mission that seems impossible, chances are it is. There are acouple of missions that are almost impossible to beat until after you finish the game so don't think it's because you didn't max the other not main roles, the game was simply made that way. I also found out while playing the game that the upgrading system is useless. You can finish this game without leveling your equipment at all. Save everything until after you finish the game then you can upgrade your equipment and try to unlock all of the things for a steam achievement or something. One last thing, this game is very buggy. It microstudders for me unless I use a 360 controller (or just a game controller) which is weird. This game is really poorly optimized for the PC. The FPS drops many times throughout the game. Even with the buggy FPS I still played this game and found some enjoyment out of it but it sucks that this game is optimized so poorly on the PC. I'm not going to recommend this game but I'm also not -not going to recommend this game, I leave that up to you. Since steam doesn't have a button other than yes or no I'll put a yes on it.",

            "review_text": "I said I would repost after playing the game. I can't comment on the patches because my system (stats follow) handled the game beautifully. The only times I missed 1080p (versus the 720p fullscreen) on a decent 42' screen was when I missed antialiasing/anistropic filtering settings. Basically if you pay too much attention to other characters on the map, you may see edges that aren't exactly smooth.  MY RATING: That said, I give this game 9/10, considering it's an FF jRPG classic and the graphics are amazing and the port is really good.  DISMISSAL OF GRAPHICS WHINERS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE HARDWARE: As I said before, I'm a software developer, and, using my knowledge of code and now experience with the game, I don't think the character models, textures, etc. need any updating to 1080p. Instead, let folks add AA and such, if they can't already get that through their graphics driver. It would ruin the original graphics, imho! I heard someone complain that the computer got the lesser quality cutscenes, but 50GB is enough for a game, imho, and, again, this is the definitive modern jRPG non-MMO graphically and otherwise as far as I'm concerned.  SUMMARY: So, that done, on to the summary of the game: be prepared to not understand the story or how combat works completely for 4-8 hours, depending on the speed you play jRPGs. But this game delivers in length- not quite as long as I'd wish in a perfect world, but, being completionist, it took me at least 120hrs to get through. You can handle that, as the crazy FF fan who can't choose between FF, FFIII, FFIV, and FFVI for the best FF, right? FFVII was great, no question, but not in the running... kind of like FFX.  STORY: actually not bad, after you understand what le'cie are... the voice acting is very good, including the annoying teenage female character who later develops. The story draws various types of relationships between the characters, drawing you into the necessity of the quest. Altogether, it's somewhat contrived, but, hey, go retrieve four crystals and no further explanation!  GAME MECHANICS: The most annoying thing is the lack of a world-map like most final fantasy series games... a lot of the fun/sense of accomplishment of other FFs is when you gain a vehicle that allows you to visit those 'secret' places you couldn't go to before. So, I think this is where the 'linear' criticism comes from. You will see a multi-level large world environment. And there is an elementary 'side-quest' system, and you can still go through areas again and again (it sometimes gets old, but seldom, since the wonderful music and varied environments keep you in it) to chase after the ultimate badassdom.  The class system/grouped-combat feels confining for about 4-8 hours until you realize the variety of skills each character specializes in and that the system makes 'formation' of front/back seem like 'Goodnight, Moon.' Though I love that book. You can play the combat in so many ways- I recommend ignoring the timer-based results of combat... just try all sorts of techniques out... you can speed-kill later.  COMBAT: There are people who hate the fact that a jRPG is not Truly turn-based, and vice-versa. I like both, especially that correct blend that gives me time to decide strategy and 'units of time' to work with, while reasonably limiting the decision as to sometimes influence my decisions. Hence, the 'auto-battle' technique you're familiar with so far. Guess what? 'Auto-battle' is surprisingly often what you want to do - healing) auto-heal will pick the person who needs healz the most tank) well, depends how you like to tank, but it spams some sort of guard skill, which you'd usually do anyway. Taunting skills are used too much, but you can always stop the queue after you successfully taunt, giving the skill added value since it auto-picks non-taunted targets.  The bosses are challenging to a mid-aged gamer who played each FF. Most teach you to use new game-mechanics, and there are definite tough-fights if you go seeking them. And the bosses are like 'wait, whoa- look twice.'  Anyway, the combat system has true depth, give it some time, and once you have some good commands, you're only badass if you set the default command to 'abilities' instead of 'auto-battle.'  END: In the end, FFXIII really delivers what you'd expect of Square *coughSOFT* Enix. The port is pretty well done considering some annoying FF ports in the past, that felt half-♥♥♥♥♥. FFXIII is ftw once you realize that it's a post-MMO jRPG that chose a lot of the good parts of an MMO without being online. But don't think it's dumbed-down, because it has worthy challenges. This is truly the definitive jRPG of the post-MMO world, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect, imho. Not that I don't log in to FFXIV now and again ;)",

Because it FEELS like a Final Fantasy; there's great character development, pacing, storyline, battles and of course outstanding music. This is a perfect starting point for those new to the franchise. Although it may be confusing and overwhelming at first, I strongly suggest for those who are confused by the opening (which I will admit explains nothing) is to check the datalog entries on L'cie and Fal'cie etc. Now. Onto the meat of the game. Like previous FFs, progress is largely done by exploration and battles. Sadly, exploration is where the game falls short. No doubt you've heard of the lineraty of the game, and its true. You will be walking in a hallway-like fashion most of the time. However, the game does open up at a late stage in the game which is great for those yearning for side-quests and exploration - that they are plenty. Instead of following the traditional method of Turn-Based battles, all battles will be in real time which makes the game far more interesting and difficult at parts. On the whole, this was my first FF and I loved it. Where it falls short is on-the-rails exploration and the game holding your hand most of the time. However, this will be undoubtedly be overpowered by the sheer production values and experience this game possess.",

There are no towns, no safe areas, no shops, or anything like that. Just the characters running pretty much down a hallway. The only 'stops' are save points along the path that also serves as a shop.

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy XIII is not a good Final Fantasy, but it's a really fun and gorgeous JRPG.  The story follows two different worlds: Pulse and Cacoon, each so afraid of the others that even contact with someone from the other planet will cause friends and family to turn against each other in order to rid themselves of those affected. Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.  The combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.  Perhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.  However, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply 'Go From Point A to Point B' to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.  It helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.  I highly recommend this game if players can put the 'Final Fantasy' name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.",

I suppose so, but if you compare it to the other FF games, they were pretty linear themselves. I think they presented FF13 well enough to make it into the FF series though I didn't really feel an ounce of emotion while playing the game. Sure there were some cliche scenes and dialogue that makes you want to tear your eyes out, but what's an FF game without some cliche scenes and cheezy lines?   The story itself wasn't good or bad. It was pretty much your average save the world story and the ONLY thing I was looking forward to was Serah and Snow getting married. When I finished the game, I was like WHERE WAS THE WEDDING? It was half the reason why I finished the game. The other half was to see whether Fang and Vanille were either in a family-sister relationship or a romantic relationship with each other. I had a feeling that Square Enix was sort of in the middle between the two types of relationships since after all they are a world known company and game developer.  The battle system in my opinion was actually a nice change of pace compared to some of the older FF games. The old turn based battle is okay and all since it gives you all the time in the world to make a strategy or eat a snack! The introduction of the paradigm system made the game refreshing and new, though IMHO it isn't exactly hard to learn or master. You just need to know the weaknesses of your enemies and adapt your paradigm decks to them.   Honestly, the only BIG flaw I cared about in this game was the travelling system, especially if you hadn't completed any missions yet. It's such a pain in the ♥♥♥ to move through Gran Pulse when you have no way to teleport or travel once you hit chapter 11 in the game. Even post-game, it's still a hassle to move around and that sort of turned me off from actually completing all the achievements in the game.  It took me around 38 hours to beat the game itself. I don't regret wasting 38 hours exploring the breathtaking scenery they created in this game or listening to the beautiful music they implemented for each area. For example, the bgm in Oerba - the home of Fang and Vanille. In my opinion, Oerba had the best bgm out of all the areas because it really made you understand the feeling of losing a home and never able to return to it. The ending song, no not 'My Hands' by Leona Lewis (totally ruined the English version of the game), but 'Kimi Ga Iru Kara' (Because You Are Here) by Sayuri Sugawara made me feel satisfied with the game.   Are you hesitant to play this game? Just buy it and try it out yourself. You won't regret spending $15 - even though this was gifted to me.",

Still recommand the game, there's a lot of third party solutions to fix the problems not fixed yet anyway. ",

            "review_text": "This game was torture to play, but I had to see it through to the end to really understand. The most frustrating thing about it is, all of the necessary parts to have made a very passable and enjoyable Final Fantasy game are here, but any gems were sunk deep into an ocean of bad design decisions and poor storytelling. The gameplay is a complete mess driven primarily by random luck and twitch reflexes, and the game primarily plays itself. Battles are needlessly and frustratingly long, and because the vast majority of control and configuration are taken OUT of your hands, you don't even feel like victories are the result of your actions. Yes, Final Fantasy games have always had battle systems where you did the same thing over and over again and very rarely needed to change your strategy up, but once you've removed even THAT gameplay, you're left with nothing. But in 'streamlining' away the actual gameplay, Square-Enix didn't bother to REDUCE the amount of it. In fact, they doubled down on making all of the post-game content entirely combat based. Well, scratch that... half combat, half WALKING. Out of my 40+ hour save file, easily 5 hours was spent watching Lightning's butt run across meadows. And none of that was 'exploration', it was needless backtracking. There's a point in the game where there's a circle of stones that give you quests. It is a 3 minute run across an open field away from the closest fast travel point, every single one of the missions it gives you is a 20 minute run away (or 6-8 minutes with fast travel you need to run ALL the way back to), and you can only accept one of the missions at at time, and they HAVE to be set from the stones. They'll get added to your list of missions alright, but if you want to change your active one, you have to WALK to the stone you got it from. This game has more senseless padding than a dozen freshman term papers. If they'd pared down the crappy gameplay and tightened this to a 20-30 hour experience, spread out the exploration instead of trying to cram an unimpressive Monster Hunter clone into the middle, and fleshed out the story and characterization more with writers instead of character designers, they could've had something to be proud of. Instead it's an incoherent padded mess that just frustrates you with squandered potential.",

You're supposed to switch between them depending on the flow of battle. Wel I'm sorry this adds no strategy to the battles.

You get a 10 minutes cutscene and then get to control your character, run straight forward, and fight a few battles and then another 10 minutes cutscene. The combat, which FF is known for some strategy, has turned into fast paced button mashing where you don't even have to think, but can just hit auto-battle and the computer does it all for you. The camera is also horrible, but you do get used to it. I tried and tried to give it a chance, but after putting a good 4 hrs in and then looking at some other reviews which revealed that it doesn't get any better until the end of the game, I decided to shelf it. It was a chore to play, not fun at all. Based on this game, I would not support the other two in the trilogy. I would only recommend this for the most die hard FF fan. I would not recommend this for a normal fan of the series or someone who enjoys the genre. I felt like I was watching a really bad movie where I got to push go every once in a while.",

Thought it suits a complex story that might unravel if I roam and deviate often. 1 or 2 maps were unfinished with a lot of secondary paths with no treasures or monsters.  The battles are much simplified now. Some battles are over with just pushing the  X  button 6 times or so, no joke! The hard battles are more fun and involving.  Story - 1/10 A lot of 'deus ex machina' especially in the ending.   No, you're NOT supposed to know why the the chars turned back from l'cieth into humans at the end. They haven't fulfilled any focus then (either destroying Orphan / saving Cocoon). Another example is Cid Raines helping &amp; training the chars under the order of Barthandelus (main antagonist) to make them stronger ... as a team!! Defeats the purpose of having a SINGLE ragnarok.  At the end, I still don't know if the  'focus'  was to destroy Cocoon (completely covered with magma, before turned into ice) or save Cocoon (humans and creatures were evac'ed into the much larger Pulse world).     Conclusion - 5/10 This is a game like the Transformation movies. Top-notch visuals &amp; slick presentation, but cheesy emotions (cringe-worthy in the final against the story bosses). Coupled with a bland pop song 'My Hands' by Leona Whois.  Huge budget and talents poured into FF13, yet soulless. Especially compared with the giants in the Final Fantasy series.",

            "review_text": "An impressive and lenghty fantasy-dystopian semi-realtime JRPG with an interesting story, some nice characters and great lore.  The (up until halfway through and near the end) lack of free exploration is criticized by some, but that's actually one of the strengths of this game. The story, drama and lore is rather strong for guiding down the player an often narrow path. More open RPGs would lose themselves in trivialities instead. Those who feel dulled and aimless in let's say Skyrim will feel much better with a game such as FFXIII. People who may have been used to different ways in previous FF installments could see this as a disappointment, but those who understand the value of this design will know to appreciate it.  Sometimes things get very cheesy though with the characters more often than once - despite being in a hurry to merely save an entire planet - babbling (after overcoming initial conflicts and misunderstandings) about their wonderful friendships and lecturing the player on equally cheesy life themes like to take responsibility and to trust others and yourself and whatnot. I read some compare the characters to Shonen fighting anime which is funny but has some truth to it: They have their interesting sides but also some looks, habits or thoughts which can feel artificial or forced for the sake of drama or conflict or to highlight certain points they make for those players who perhaps wouldn't get it if it were more subtle. I couldn't resist rolling my eyes at times or thinking 'Yeah, yeah, I know, get on with it.'  The fighting system is interesting. I think I still prefer traditional round-based JRPGs over this semi-realtime thing but it's fun nevertheless. On my difficulty setting - 'Easy' - I could for many parts basically keep pushing the 'auto-attack' button and let the A.I. decide what attacks to use while certain other enemies and bosses fell out of line and actually required me to use my own brains. Shifting the paradigms back and forth - skill presets used by the A.I. defining the role of your three combatants in the field (like tank, healer, buffer, damage-dealer), pounding the enemies with magic to 'stagger' them (putting them into a specifically vulnerable state) and then do regular high-damage attacks to finish them off is a fun pattern to follow even if it can feel messy at times.  What has it's good and bad is how the roles play out in conjunction with the personalities of the characters and their individual stories, and how the combat situations are designed alongside.  For like the first half of the game you have up to two or three characters out of 7 or so go different story paths, meet different enemies and have different paradigms (roles) for them to choose from at a time. The strong confident character X has a guardian and damage-dealer role at first, the shy and indecisive boy is about magical buffing and staggering, the little cheerful shamanic girl can do healing and staggering and so on. As the story progresse more characters find their way into your party pool and more roles unlock until the very end when everyone can have all roles, even atypical ones, at the cost of increased XP points needed to level up the corresponding skill trees. However this role-play also makes things a little predictable. For all the drama along the way one can tell that the characters eventually will have to group up towards the end in order for it all to make sense, to have these mechanics unlock their full potential. This is where the otherwise great story and immersion themselves are staggering a little.  The leveling and crafting sometimes feels a little dumb and like eye-candy. Per paradigm (combat role) each character has this huge tree of mostly passive stats and some active skills to go through but it could very well be displayed in a more simplified way instead and as such is a bit artificially glorified like it is in Path of Exile or Child of Light.  The crafting is minimalistic. You level up gear by infusing (?) raw components into it gained from mobs or bought through equally minimalistically presented 'online' shops. Different components eventually give the item an XP boost when infusing (which I never understood, looked all rather random to me). You level stuff up until it can't go any higher and then keep the item or (which only works for some it seems) transform it into a higher-tier version which can be leveled further again. It's very unspectacular, just a bar filling and some names and values changing. Weapons do look differently when wielded by the characters in combat but sadly you can't properly examine the weapon models and some paradigms (magical ones) have your fighters use their bare hands and not their tools of trade. I never really became much interested in the crafting, I basically started with it only halfway through in the hopes that some bosses wouldn't be as tough to beat. Completionists and those who want to flesh out their characters fully may dabble with it more.",

This is a pretty solid PC-port. I pull consistent FPS, the only time it stutters is after a cutscene for a few seconds until I guess it loads the area. Also there is no save limit like on the X360 so thats nice.

' Note that I have not played 13x2 or Lighting Returns before I waste money I am going to have to watch some videos' to see if they made any improvements'  Gone are the days where Final Fantasy is a name that means you have a world to explore loot its treasure and kill its monsters on your own path that has now been in place now since FF10 on leveling and the battle system from 12 and the lack of world map exploration and being forced to go in paths layed out for you for the whole game.   This game is a mash of these, I know I'm old but I started out with FF4 and then went to FF1 ' Heck i have played 1- 10 and then now 13' I loved the old mechanics from the older games.   I my self and from what I see a bunch of other people are the same we do not want a pushed story where once you get over half way through the game you get the first bit of freedom to look around only to find its limited, gone is the days when you had a fine crafted world to explore where you can go where ever you want.   I my self loved it when you got your air ship it meant that you was free to look over and finally see the world and go about any where but 10 fixed that like a spit in the face.   I do not suggest that you buy this game if you want to see the story I suggest that you watch it on YouTube and save your self. If this is how Final Fantasy games are going to be for now on I'm out and ready to hang my hat up I'll stay with the older games when it comes to Final Fantasy where they actually took the time and developed their story and make the characters rememberable.

            "review_text": " Graphic and design  In general is great. detailed environment design, detailed battles graphics and movie quality cinematic cutscenes. Experienced some frame drops on certain scenes but nothing major to report. Some people did complained about on performance issues that where in range of 'recommended spec'.   Battle system  Quite nice mechanics, more macro then micro orientated. You control one and others in the company auto cast/attack same target. 'Staggering' with paradigms shifts (switching who does what role) makes combat more strategic and dynamic. After a fight you are fully healed and 'death' system is quite forgiving.   Story telling and voice-over  Well... the story is complex and i finished the game just to see it to the end. Was curious i have to admint. The voice over is nicely made and on some small occasion you will notice lip sync issues. This was not annoying. The annoying part was mostly what was sad by the characters... Its trying to be 'epic' in every step of the way with stressing the importance of not giving up, team work and other nice things. Just... just.. this all looks like a 12 years old is saying. most of the time its a 'facepalm' how cliche it is. So protagonists are like children with 'good goals'. Antagonists are quite forgettable. Also all of them are trying to kill you and one you kill them they thank you for liberating them from a the only rightfulness path they could take. The game is trying to justify your killing spring as a saviour and liberator... just bunch of blocks. Nice feature is that every time you load you get a small recap of what happened 'just a while ago'. I played the game in multiple sessions with some time in-between so it was a nice reminder. Also a nice Dictionary vocabulary and you can read a lot if you like. more of a background story so you can skip if not your cup of tee.   Inventory and levelling system  Kill stuff, get points (even to off party members which is nice), assign them to certain available role of your choice. This allows some sort of customization but protagonists have already 'best-use-in' roles. You can still combined whatever party you want and they are all feasible most of the time. You can also level up your inventory items like accessories and weapons. This is a complete wast of time. Loot drop is minimal, gold (or gil) is a scarce commodity so if you want your 'Ultima' weapon you will have to grind your brains out to do it. Also, you will use wiki just to see what is optimal thing to use since resources are limited.   Level design  A hallway. sometimes a hallway with a dead end or OP beast that you should come and kill in 3-4 h with bigger guns. A lot of walking and if you wish to do some challenges (which are open at end-game period) you will need to walk until your shoes disintegrate. Then you will have a teleport system but this is not so helpful. I was hoping for an 'auto-resolve' at that point since you can not skip most of the battles (since they are in the middle of the hallway).   Conclusion  All in all. My strong recommendation is skip. A great looker, interesting and appealing battle system and that is it. The rest can be quite annoying and the story is not getting better are you come to the end. Its and endless hallway with stuff to battle with and nothing else. No exploration, no NPC, no quests, just a hallway.  Not for mature audience.   Peronaly played FF from 1 to 8 (yes, gameboy, snes and that stuff) and this is by far the less enjoyable from all. Had to complete this game just becasue its a FF game. You can try to avoid doing the same mistake as i have. You were warned...",

They are all unique and add a ton of flavor to the story's progression. Unlike 10, 9, or 8 (one's I've played), I don't feel like there is a 'main' protagonist in 13. All the characters are very relevant and lightnings role is maybe only slightly more than the others. That being said, story was very poorly presented. I still feel very confused as to what is going on even after 25 hours of and being maybe completing 2/3s of the game.

For about the first 10-11 chapters (there are 13), you are constricted to hallways that determine your path, with the occasional offshoot (which deadend and force you to go back). In that sense it lacks the feel of some final fantasy games like FFVII or VIII. However, the character development and world building are very interesting, which is honestly the reason I keep going in the first place at this point. The normal mode is certainly brutal to those who cannot adapt to the ATB Gauge type of battle, where some battles seem impossible, which is why strategizing is key once you can switch people in your party. Like most people have said, the game is heavily tutorial-based, where 5-7 chapters are strictly teaching you how to play with the system and how to strategize with the mechanics. If you cannot deal with the mechanics or just want the story, there is an easy mode, which makes the battles easier to endure and grinding quicker than in normal mode. Also, once you get to a certain point, the open areas are really beautiful and give missions for you to do so that you can get better gear or more CP to level up.

Although I'm still hard pressed to call it my favorite (Final Fantasy VI being the best in my opinion.) The story of it started alright and then took a huge turn into the 'WTF Zone.' Trying to figure out who Cloud was, if he was even in SOLDIER, and what relationship Sephiroth had between him and Zack.   Final Fantasy VIII was a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of WTF moments and I still don't think the ending for that was even a proper ending. IX and X had great stories but with X you had to wait until almost the end of the game to understand anything.

It is linear for the first parts of the game, but it opens up on Cocoon and lets you quest and grind. Overall I'm enjoying it. You can see I've played 60 hours so far and I'm not even done with the game.  Yeah, it is a straight port. It's not cool that you have to mod it to get higher resolutions, but once you do, it looks much better albeit a bit less stable than I'd like. I save whenever I have the opportunity.  Well worth the money, but with all the HD remakes going around, it's a bit disappointing Squeenix didn't make this the definitive version, just by tweaking the code a bit and allowing higher resolutions.  Edit: After finishing the game, I still want to go back to Cocoon to finish the C'ieth stone missions. Too bad they didn't let you go back to Cocoon as it changed however. Still, best Final Fantasy yet and I'm aware it could get better AND could have more things like a more open world, etc. Can't wait for FF XV, hope I don't have to wait another 6 years.  I also have to add, just like any other PC game, people don't realize resolution goes hand in hand with dpi. I have a 1440p monitor, but it's only slightly higher dpi than my old 1080p 21.5' monitor. If you were to play this on a TV you'd be sitting alot further back and the aliasing would be unnoticalble. Being that this game was mastered for TVs, I find sitting further back from my monitor really makes the details seems alot smoother and more crisp. Either I'll get a lower resolution TV to game on to go easier on my GPU or when GPUs are powerful enough, I'll get a 4K monitor with at least twice the dpi.",

The world concept was not as it was used to be, previous FF have the concept of open world and let the players roam free however this game did not offer the same concept. If you are the type of gamer that only see games based on the graphic, easy gameplay, and unappealing story then this game is for you. All the 'positive' reviews i see is based on the graphic, but im here to give you the hard truth. Compared to it's previous game, this FF sucks. Just face it, the hardest game mode was on normal (even normal was easy, compared to ff 7 fighting omega), the HP back to full whenever the fight is over, using 'skills (ie. Heal and magic)' does not cost you mana, it is just not a good game.  Overall i would rate this game 6 / 10",

I have no doubt that it could get really good later on but that's not something I want to spend several hours to find out.  First off, the combat was pretty decent. I like how it made a difference where the enemies was at the moment your character used an AoE attack as that made things a little bit more dynamic although only controlling one character in a Final Fantasy game like this isn't that much fun it was acceptable.  What made me refund this game was a few things like the score system after a fight; why am I getting score for a fight in a rpg that doesn't translate into EXP or anything? I'm not collecting a highscore as far as I could see and after a short google session I found out that I couldn't even earn EXP until chapter 3 or so, so what place has the score in this RPG? Also the story and the characters in the beginning, Lightning was a typical ♥♥♥♥♥ - something that's not all too strange for someone to be in a Final Fantasy game, but why does she start the game of by being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at everyone, even someone that's helping you like the guy that fights together with her(forgot his name, but he was aside from Snow the only character I liked from the time I played. Also having a Chocobo living in your hair is awesome and cute).  And you just get thrown into an event that has no context for you as a player and you're expected to just accept it that 'Those are the bad guys that you have to stop' without even knowing who they are.  My verdict of this game is 3/10, something I'm sad to give to a Final Fantasy game as I'm a big fan of the series.",

When the characters didn’t stand around looking awkward half the time because at those pixel rates awkward didn’t really exist. I’ve been playing the series since I was a kid. FF1 and then 3, then that one that was either 4 or 5 or 6, and then 7, 8, and 9. Then 10 came out and I played that one as well. And it was 10-2 where I started losing interest because something smelled funny about it. Then I picked this one up, on sale, thank the gods, and it seems like Square has just given up.   “They want something new,” a manager says.  “Does it have to be good?” a programmer yells back.  Then they all laugh, because people will buy and fanboy on it regardless.  I honestly feel bad for the characters. Their performances are cringe worthy. The story doesn’t make much sense, and yes, I realize this was a continuation, but shouldn’t it still make some sense? X2 stood on its own, even if it wasn’t that good. And the battle system is boring. Jump over here, stab, stab, jump, lose your place. Creatures mindlessly wandering around the battlefield.

The character development was extremely well written. Each character had their story very well developed and I was fully immersed in it.  As always, Masashi Hamauzu's arrangements for the soundtracks were brilliant. My first hour was spent just watching the opening scenematics and listening to the start up menu soundtrack. The game started out pretty draggy, but it was because the tutorials were implemented. Pretty easy to pick up, even when I've never experienced any FF games before. *Though I will get the rest, when I do have the time to play them.* For the price, it was a steal and a no-brainer. I'll definitely get my hands on FFXIII-2 and FFXIII: Lightning Returns when they come out next year.

I get very sick of running and riding across chapter 11 map for doing the side missions. There should have been more teleport points.  The gameplay is refreshing, with the paradigm shift system. Although many will think that the auto option makes the game very easy, this is not true for the optional boss. Smart choice of abilities during certain fight will be very beneficial instead of just smashing the auto option.  All in all, I would say that I have a very enjoyable time playing FF13.

            "review_text": "Pros: - Excellent gameplay, recent FF games moved towards more real time which gives a bit more action and on your feet thinking to battles. - It looks good and runs well on a 4 year old computer (as it should). - If you've never played an FF game before, this definitely is a good starter. - The characters are filled withn cheesy goodness and cute fuzzy warm feelings, you'll either become emotionally distraught or awkwardly cringe at the storyline, so either way, it's an experience.  Cons: - It's a PC port from a company that never expected FF games to come to PC, don't expect much for the controls. - Expanding that point, PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR ESC KEY! IT IS EVIL. To be exact, it quits you instantly. - Little to no graphics options (again, you shouldn't expect much from Square Enix). - If you don't like confusing stories with cheesy characters, either for their designed enjoyment or because you enjoy being confused and cringing at horribly cheesy lines, then don't bother. To be exact, the storyline has the equivalent sense to American TV series like Lost or Heroes (except the characters don't save the story).   Overall, it's not a bad game and I do recommend it because once you learn the controls and get into the flow of things, it's actually a really enjoyable game. In a time of gaming where we're playing Mr. Pixel's Fantastic Platformer and Javascript Memory Chewer Deluxe, it's okay if a game doesn't live up to graphical 'expectations', that no longer seems to be the point, the point of gaming is whether you enjoy it or not, not 'OMG I need to count all the hairs on x's head!'.

My only other experiences come from one mediocre movie (Spirits Within) and one interesting, if somewhat confused movie (Advent Children).  XIII has grabbed me lock stock and, despite it's linearity, it's slowly expanding gameplay and over the top story telling has completely won me over. The places, items, ships, characters, enemies all feel fresh and interesting instead of rehashed existing properties. Maybe existing FF fans have been wading in this world for 12 previous games but it's all new to me. I keep expecting the story to fall to the side and give way to dull wandering and repetitious combat but 4 plus hours later, I'm still wide eyed in wonderment.

            "review_text": "So I have put roughly 3 hours so far into the game. I recommend this IF you don't mind that the game is locked on resolution as well as framerate. I personally don't care A LOT about it being locked at 720p. I have noticed many of the negative reviews here revolve around that particular issue. Granted also, you may have to tweak your graphic options slightly depending on what you use (nvidia/amd/intel etc). So will you have to mess around a bit to make the game run perfectly regardless if you're using a godly computer or a low-budget setup? Yes. If you're not willing to put a little extra effort into making the game run properly, then do NOT buy this unless an official patch gets released later to fix said problems. Make no mistake, this is a badly done port but by no means impossible to play and enjoy.   If you are happy being able to play the game smoothly regardless of definition, then this should work out fine for you. If you are very adamant about having your flawless hi-defintion and auto-optimized settings, then stay FAR away from this. This is also under the assumption that you meet the recommended settings to run this game. My own computer surpasses the recommended and sure enough, it runs fine (after I did some tweaking in my nvidia control panel). It is also worth mentioning that you may experience 'stuttering' at a consistent interval. While I can't speak for everyone, this was fixed for me by simply plugging in a wired xbox 360 controller (which you don't actually have to use, you can just set it aside after plugging it in). If anyone is curious to the programming aspect behind this, in simplest terms, the game is 'searching' for a compatible device nonstop hence the stutter you may experience. The controller is the 'missing' device the game is looking for. Again, this just further supports how poorly done this is as a pc port.  Now in my 3 hours of gameplay, I haven't noticed any big problems either. I know some have mentioned something about missing audio, or random crashes, etc etc. Maybe I'm just lucky and haven't experienced any of that YET? Time will tell. IF I do experience any major problems like that, I will update this review. Otherwise, this is where I stand in my review. The game is perfectly playable which for me is always the deciding the factor.",

Not only is the story linear the same way 10 was, but leveling up is also pretty much linear, unlike 10 where you could make anybody anything. It's very grindy, which is isn't even fun because combat is boring and not very interactive.

Since I play games for the story in the first place, I love how many cutscenes and dialogue are used in this game compared to other FF titles I played before. All the characters get a lot of screentime so you get to know their personalities quite well. There have been some decision by characters I really couldn´t comprehend how they could do what they did, but until now all these strange decisions have been shown afterwards in a different light which made me understand their motivation. The story had some intersting twists up till now, wonder how it will all play out.   I played FF 1,4,7,8 and now 13 and up till now 13 is my favorite   (beware: I absolutely hated FF7, lame plot, lame chars imho, so if you loved FF7 I may not be the reviewer you want to trust)  The fight system takes a little getting used to, but once you get used to often switching, you will begin to see the potential and the fun increases dramatically. Be prepared to experiment a lot before you get a feeling which roles to combine and when to use which combinaton. Odin is the first enemy who will really test whether you understood the system (died a least 10 times before I could defeat him)  The music is typically SquareSoft. It´s elegant, complex and will help you immerge into the game world. A good friend of me misses the typical FF sounds, like the victory theme, but like I said before: finally a FF that does something new! Yeah many FF themes are brilliant, but after so many games they got very repetive for me.   For me this FF is much more an interactive Fiction than a game, which is why I love it.  Also it´s quite cheap. Squaresoft could have asked for the full price like many other companies want for their ports. The low price was what lead me to try this game and damn it would be worth a full price.  All in all it´s been a long time since a game got me hooked like FF13 did!",

Visually, though the game is lacking some of the advanced graphical options that most PC games include, the game is stunning at points. Out of game cutscenes are gorgeous, the set peices are beautiful, and the world feels interesting. At first, the game ran at a consistant 60 fps, but a little later on I noticed some flucations during camera movements in the overworld. During battles, I didn't notice any problems with framerates oddly.  The characters don't start out immediately likeable, and they do display some annoying traits, but I find their room for growth promising. That, and the overall story kept me interested, but I can understand how the plot won't hook in most people. Like a lot of JRPG's, the plot can seem a bit campy, but the voice acting isn't all bad, with a few exceptions like Vanielle. The pacing is alright, you never feel like too much information is being rushed to you all at once, but never feeling like there isn't enough progession.  Similiar to how everyone else feels, the weakest point of this game is the combat. You only end up controlling one character at a time, while everyone else auto fights. Your AI partners do their jobs alright, but your actual input for combat usually means switching paragirms (switching yours and your party's classes mid battle) and mashing auto battle.  Another big complaint that a lot of people have with this game is how linear it is. My big issue with this would be it wastes a lot of the resources put in to the visuals. Exploration doesn't usually lead to great rewards in my experience so far. Most important items, like new weapons and rare collectables, are usually found on the route to the destination or dropped by bosses. If you don't feel the need that you must revisit any area whenever you want, then the linear design shouldn't be all that bad.  TL;DR, a pretty linear, but very pretty JRPG with a bleh combat system. Also, it's 15$. Would recommend.",

No, KNOWING that Square would see how much we wanted XV on PC, perhaps a simultaneous release?   We aren't getting a simultaneous release, but instead an uber optimized port on par with GTA V's quality (So they say.)   So, with that in mind? You don't have to buy this game, skip the XIII trilogy if you just don't like the Aesthetic, because quite frankly . . . . .There are several other entries more worthy of your time on Steam atm.",

If your system cant run this game, there are no graphic options at all to turn down. Using a mod that downscaled the game from 4k (3840x2160) to 1080p (1920x1080) which is the native resolution of my screen even with the downscaling however (similar to dynamic super resolution). The hair quality was bad and also the eyebrows and eyelashes which does have a significant impact on how you play the game. At cut scenes i got screentearing which i can't do anything about and it really ruined the cutscenes. This game is great however this seems rushed and needs work. If you dont mind the game running t 720p then there aren't many problems at all. The hair quality is fine at 720p but it doesnt feel right. ESC causes the game to close immediatley and those are the only problems if you can deal with it at 720p AND RUN THE GAME The only reason I'm reccomending this is because if you don't own it on PS3 or XBOX360 then you should go ahead as the gameplay is great but the graphics are lacking. THE BIGGEST downside of this game is the size 59GB which yeah, is the size of many many games that i had to delete",

(people complain about easy battle system but they forget in FF7 once you get 'Knights of the Round' summon, its game over.) ff8 you can get 9999 health with 100 full-life in disk2 (out of 4).  CONS: you cant control all of the party members. you dont need to heal after battle. they removed the window speech so instead they made endless cutsenes. it IS possible to skip them but not all of them. super annoying characters (especially a girl with awful voice actress who sound like in japanese amatour porn). the lines are also lame, kinda like a mix of hollywood movie type and anime series type.   PORT:  disappointment. ABSOLUTELLY NO graphic settings so make sure you have the hardware before buying this. also you cant control keyboard settings and the MOST annoying thing is the ESC button which closes the game without warning, it doesnt even auto-save.    *btw, in my opinion the main character Lightning is the best of all mains and 3rd among all, right after aeris and sephiroth. but thats just me",

Anyway, the graphics are GORGEOUS! I can't help but enjoy the sights as I play this game. I am planning to play more. One of the minor things I enjoy is that it actually has keyboard mappings and prompts instead of only controller prompts, which I was afraid of when I got this game.  There have been a lot of talks about no graphics options which is kinda a shame, and I do hope they add that in the near future, or in the other Final Fantasy 13 games coming to Steam in the coming months. I am also going to be in the minority here when I say that even though it is a garbage port and even though I have seen videos of clunky framerates, I haven't had a hitch yet, which is strange considering what all I have read and the computer I play on is about 4 years old, let alone a laptop.  Please note, I haven't played this game very long and I do plan on updating this review as I play.

Good: Likable characters - I thought these were all likable characters, and while they never quite reached the likability of previous FF characters, I still thought they were pretty good (hell, even Hope redeemed himself to me).  Good: Gran Pulse - God, you never realize how good it is to be free until you've played through 20 hours of linearity. Seriously, I had a feeling of pure wonder when stepping onto Gran Pulse.  Mixed: Combat system - To be clear, I don't particularly like the auto-battle feature. I sometimes found it necessary when playing ravager in order to run up the stagger gauge, but other than that I thought it was useless, and it felt like an attempt to make the combat system easy. However, I did like paradigms, which made the combat feel less about attacks and more about roles.  Mixed: Story - In general, it was gibberish. It became too caught up in the whole futuristic/fantasy thing, and used completely made up words (which are fine in general, unless they aren't explained). However, I do like what they did with some of the characters, so kudos to Square for character development.   Bad: Linearity - The first 20ish hours of the game are completely linear. Bad bad bad.  Overall: 7/10   A fun game, that I did find worthwhile. Not my favorite Final Fantasy game, but not my least favorite either. The linearity felt like a poor design choice, but I still enjoyed the combat enough to get through that part of the game, and into the true fun that awaits 20 hours in.",

I had played the first Final Fantasy on the NES when it first game out. Final Fantasy II (IV) and III (VI) on the SNES. Was never a big fan of series from there on, although I do like VII (I just don't agree it's the masterpiece Milliennials think it is.). That being said, I saw SquareEnix has this on sale on their website for $6.50, but I still wasn't interested... Then I saw it contained the Japanese audio. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! Only a little over 2 hours in, and I can see why people complained about the first few hours calling it a 'tutorial.' But hey, at $6.50, and Japanese audio, I'm already satisfied! Or... not.  The game is as (or more) linear than Super Mario Bros (NES) in that you follow a directed path with no exploration WHAT SO EVER AT ALL (BORING!). Run down this magically created pathway, kill enemies, proceed to next area, jump up some debris, jump down the debris, battle, enter next pathway. I'm falling asleep walking in a straight line.  Battles attempt to be something special, and the first 20 or 30 battles were ok... But then it's just boring as ****. There is no strategy to it, NONE. None of the thinking or tactics of older Final Fantasy games. Nope, just let AUTO BATTLE do what it has to do, switch up the paradigm IF/WHEN needed. Lack of control over the other characters makes this a completely dull experience.  And then there's the story. The game doesn't even try to explain what fal'Cie, l'Cie, Pulse, Cocoon, Eden, or any frakin' thing is. They just throw it at you like you should already know. Seriously, it's worse than the writing for season 8 of Doctor Who. Somebody should have been fired from SE for this abomination.  I can see why SquareEnix has to re release Final Fantasy IV and VII constantly... They're great games, THIS and most recent Square games are NOT.",

Truth be told, I've never played a bad final fantasy game. Each one seems to come with higher production values. When this game was first released on steam, it did not have any video options to change the resolution, etc. It also had a problem with pressing escape which would close out the game. Both of these problems have been resolved. The game has been great so far, and I expect it to only get better as I progress.",

My first Final Fantasy game was 10 which I never finish and still haven't.. (working on it).. I played several after that and didn't really enjoy the majority of them.. I was convinced at that point that Final Fantasy X was the best in the series..   I played 13 originally on the Xbox but I got the Red Rings of DOOOOM and never finished it and to be honest I wasn't really liking it.. It was meh.. I realized I am one of those who loves grinding but in this game it was boring.. So I finally bought it here on steam and I must say... MY taste in general must have change because I actually fell in love with the game.. The grinding is still really boring but atleast the battle system isn't too bad.. I love how no matter how hard you grind the enemies are still tough.. seems like its almost pointless in a way xD..  This game made me cry and had me sad at work.. for that I say this game's greatest feat was its story... The characters developed really well.. Even Vanille who I really just hate... *deep breath* but in the end she was okay.. so Its not too bad...  ugghhhh The story was just so good... At times I kind got fustrated because there was too much gameplay... xD  and knowing how much I like to grind.. some chapters dragged onn soo much...  So to put in a few words. The game was really good.. In the beginning every character is somewhat boring but they turn out great in the end.. I still have a game crush on Serah :3 curse you snow!!! &gt;:( The battle system in general is unique though i must say most people wont like it.. The grinding is really boring :( Some parts in the game are also really boring and really unnecessary... I think giving this game a chance is definitely worth it.. I definitely don't regret it at all.. other wise we have different taste in games",

I don't even know why Square Enix did this. And who ever came up with this idea, I wish Square Enix fire him/her. Final Fantasy have never been this boring.  I'm on the final boss and came back to open world to play missions, and I don't even wanna play anymore. I don't know if I would finish the game and I wish I didn't start playing this.

You die alot in those, like you can die alot in FFXIII, the difference is however, DS relies more on your skill of play with the character while this FFXIII relies on what I mentioned above. Both require you to level up your character in some way to even stand a chance, but the thought process that goes into each fight between the two games are fundamentally different. I prefer FFXIII in this aspect.  Beautiful music, not one game I've ever played has topped the Final Fantasy soundtracks. Great cutsences. I honestly feel for the characters. The facial expressions they potray really help to draw a person in.  The Bad You pick up misc items from monster drops, though every item has a name, but still, they have no real importance but feeding you're weapon to go from lvl1 to lvl2 and so on. I thought I'd be able to make weapons from scratch using the monster drops, but from what saw, that's a no. I don't mind not doing, as so much of the dev's just putting alot of named misc. items in the game just to make them seem more important. Just name it all scrap or something, and lets move on.  The Ugly Framerates still drop from time to time, but clears up within a few seconds.  The Debatable I really like the linear pathway feature. For me, it's just a nice change of pace to RPG games. I'm use to playing nothing but sandbox, i'd like to think that Square Enix making the game a 'hallway' per-say (with beautiful scenery around every turn) and the occasional branch offs into some remote corner, planned. After all, a bigger space would possibly mean less work/effort put into the cutscenes, less into the fighting/combat and less into the length of the game as a stand-alone single player. But people want to give that all up for roaming space. Not flame intended but feel free to go to FFXI or FF:ARR for that. I have both.  I give it an immediate thumbs up. Great Final Fantasy game.",

It all starts with the battle system, almost all end fantasys, if not all usanm a simple control system of persongens where you control both 3 or more characters in battle, the only thing left in your hand is the enemy attack. In this game you control only the leader of the group, the other 2 are controlled by the host, that is, it can either help you as you screw the whole game. How many times we do not expect an enemy attack to release the action of three characters? As I said, you only understand it if you played some final fantasy than this series in specific. Couple this with the fact the game is locked in history, there is not much freedom of movement, which was a trademark of the franchise. How many times does not exit a maze, castle, cave out of the map to get items and XP for just then come back and get past the former enemies? This was also removed from the game ........... In short, I would not recommend this game for the simple fact does not recognize it as a final fantasy ......... ",

To the Point:  Maybe buy it if it’s on sale--otherwise, wait for it to go on sale, watch it on youtube/twitch, or pass it up. As far as FF games go, this is a 3.5 out of 10.  Longer review/rant:  Story (no spoilers):  The story is the weakest aspect of this game and perhaps the weakest of all final fantasies I’ve played; haven’t plated FF8 or 13-2. I’ve tried so hard to like any of the characters, but so far they’re so flawed with little hope of redemption I’ve been pushing through the story and vague, fluctuating plot, hoping any of the main characters will find enlightenment or a reasonable goal I can cheer them on for as I play. It’s felt like I’ve been on a long painful car trip, the car slowly breaking down and I question if the destination will be worth the pretty but irritating journey.   Art/Style: The art for the game is great; one of the stronger points of this game. The character designs aren’t bad, even if the character’s decisions and/or dialog are bad; if not awful. Environments are well designed even if the “dungeons” maps are at times boring. The CG cut scenes are top notch but honestly expected of them because of the last handful of Final Fantasy title’s CG cut scenes. The chocobo look good, the moogles look like bulbous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and all of the summons make Final “Fantasy” look mostly Final “Sci-fi.” Don’t get me wrong, FF 7, 8, 10 have plenty of sci-fi too, but at least FF 6 and 7 felt like equal parts fantasy and sci-fi, 8, 10(2) and 13(2) (15?) feel more sci-fi than fantasy and the only recent original fantasy FF games are their MMOs like 11 or 13 and that’s a whole can of worms I don’t want to open here. A shame and I hope if there’s a FF 16, it’s a strong “fantasy” title.  Gameplay:  The short answer is, meh? Sometimes it feels fun when the AI characters choose their skills well and the “staggering” system--that allows your characters to do more (and sometimes necessary to win) damage to the enemy--works well. What’s been most irritating is that Square-enix should know that most of its players know what “strategy” and “tactics” are but they designed it so you have to play select characters separately as a pair or their chosen group of three; you can’t pick your party until about 25-30 hours into the game, depending on your pace of play. Although you feel like you could put a decent group together earlier in the game, the “plot” forces you to play certain characters and half the time they work well together, but the other half of the time it feels like you’re going through the motions, forced to play how they’ve planned you to; and if you don’t, the battles will take twice as long or you’ll lose. For a “role” playing game, you’re given a pretty small role in how you’d like to play through countless hours of play.  Honestly, I could go on about gameplay, but I feel like some might be able to get through it while others will find it mostly unrewarding or irritating like me.  Graphics:  This is about the strongest point of the game. The environments, characters and just about everything look good if you have a good graphics card. That said, if you don’t, it’s okay with a decent card but will be nearly unplayable with a minimum card. It’s one of the few things getting me through this frustrating game.  Final thoughts thus far: I bought this game on sale and knew it wasn’t one of their stronger titles, but I love the original final fantasies so much that I couldn’t help but give their newer titles a try. Recently, I’ve been playing Final Fantasy Record Keeper on my iPhone/iPad and it’s been far and away more fun to play than this game and I haven’t spent one penny on FFRK. You collect a lot of characters in the mobile game and it made me want to try this title and afterward I will try FF8 for the same reason. And while there’s a few notable characters in FF13, the game and its story have been a real let down. Almost all of the FF games from 7 on down are amazing for various reasons, since then, they’ve been sacrificing story, fantasy and good JRPG mechanics for graphics and voice acting (the english for 13 is passable at best). I hope Square-enix go back to their roots and give us back our mages and knights, dragoons and ninjas. There’s a lot more to FF games than adding chocobos, moogles and crystals.   FF 13 so far, a depressing addition that makes me appreciate the classics more. I only hope there’s some light at the end of this tunnel.",

My main complaints we're the battle system and it was a little more indepth than I anticipated. Sorry.  World/Level Design: Top Notch. Final Fantasy games are always impressive.  Character Design: I felt they we're a little generic but Lightning. &lt;3  Battle System: You can just be a lamer and use a healer/dps/dps type paradigm in 95% of the battles and just hold the button of a rapid fire controller. This will result in a low battle ranking but has the potential to suck the life from the game.  Controls/Interface: Well done.  Sound/Music: Great, with the exception of the battle music seeming somewhat repeative throughout the game.  Port: I did see some frame rate issues with cut scenes. Not too terrible though if you are drunk or high. lol  Verdict So I do reccomend this game now but not to everyone. Only to fans of the RPG genre and especially fans of the series. If you tend to get bored with cut scenes and story line you may want to give it a pass.",

What you have left is this game . Walking, battles, and cutscenes is all this game has, and it goes on for 50 hours. Maybe you're thinking 'So what? as long as the story is good i can deal with that'. Well, i hate to be the one to break the news to you, but the story isn't that good, infact it's kinda bad, the worst in the series, and so are the characters. It's not even so much the story that is the bad part, it's the writing and delivery/timing, it's downright awful. This game is a massive chore to play, with no pay off at all. The visuals, combat, and soundtrack are the only things this game has going for it, and those qualities don't make up for the other short comings. For a game to be 50 hours of nothing but walking, turned based combat, and cut scenes, it would need to have an incredible story and characters, but this doesn't have that. It just goes on and on and on and on. This game is nothing but a beautiful mess, a massive waste of time and undeserving of the Final Fantasy name. Oh, and when you hear people say that this game 'opens up' towards the end, that is an absolute lie. All they are refering to is a cupple mini-map fields where there are monsters roaming that you can battle. Not open world at all.   And yes, I am aware their are a cupple towns you walk through in the game. Only 2 actually have people in them, and you can't converse with any of them, no shops, inns, nothing(one of those 'towns' is just a beach with a building so i'm not even sure that counts.",

            "review_text": "I loved this game. For the record, Lightning is f*****n Awesome! But before getting into it all, I should also say that I played it in two main sessions (of a couple of months). I played for a few months (probably about 30 hrs or so) then left for a year, got back and finished the game. I think there was a reason for it:  1. It's gorgeous, absolutely beatiful. I kept finding myself just looking at the environment, unit designs etc. and listening to the soundtrack.  2. Battle is developed, and fun. Lots o' it. The paradigm system (changing unit roles, if you will) can be made to work in any way you want, pretty much, whereby the same character ca play anything from tank to healer in the same fight.  3. Emotional story. I won't say it's the best written, most coherent (and least repetitive, it is) one ever, but dammit all if I didn't get teary eyed now and again. And that says something.   So why did I not finish the game in one setting? Well first off I don't play anything near full time. I do it to relax. I'm one of those casual gamers you hear horrible stories about. But also: I play for story, not to 'be the best'. Spin me a good yarn and I'll appreciate it. The story in this game is good, but not fantastic. The 'break' I took in the middle allowed me to appreciate the production values more when I got back, and also, funnily enough, reconnect with the story (it's emotional man).  Enough to finish it in, probably, the shortest time I could possibly finish a 70+ hour game (which, admittedly, would be about 70 hours but come on, I mean days here).  BUT, it DID get...not boring, but definitely not exciting... for a while in the middle there. So, while I wouldn't say it, by any token, ruined the game for me (I still loved it), I appreciated it more for taking a break in the middle.   If that's like you, you'll love it. If you prefer to steam through a game (pun intended) then maybe go for CS or something. I dunno.  This one was fantastic.",

When the launcher does launch, sometimes the game fails to launch, so you have to hope that the launcher will launch again. In my experience, the game starts properly less than half the time.  Once the game did start, I found out that it doesn't really support the Xbox One controller on Windows 10; it will accept one or two button presses, and then stops accepting all input (controller, keyboard, or otherwise). I tried playing with mouse and keyboard, but aside from being far less comfortable, it still stopped acceptin input eventually.  I hooked up an older controller I had and managed to play the first half hour (approximately) but then it crashed while loading a cutscene. I'm done with this game.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR - A horrible port of an otherwise amazing game - still worth your time.  FFXIII Has received a lot of criticism from people over being 'Too linear' or 'not final fantasy enough' - and while i can't disagree with linearity, i can safely state that this is one of the most fun games i've ever had the privilege to play. Whether you're a die hard fan, or someone new to the genre, i bet you will find yourself immersed regardless.  A story that might a bit confusing at times, but puts a lot of effort into character development - this is the ONLY final fantasy in which i cared for the characters. Sure, there is *that one character* who everybody hates (you will know immediately), but other than that, i really enjoyed watching how characters behaved. Not only that, but this game is actually quite long. I am currently on my 7th playthrough, and 16 hours into the game (knowing where to go / what to do / etc) i just reached halfway point marker. The 'sandbox endgame' is not as wide as some of the other jrpgs, but it does offer some stuff to do after you 'beat the game' - but even if you're just interested in seeing the story, you will have a long journey.  Graphics are absolutely amazing - although you might have difficulty noticing that with how ATROCIOUSLY this game was ported. Honestly, if you own PS3 or Xbox360, do yourself a favor and buy this game for the console. The port is really, really bad. For example, as part of gameplay you can gather data on enemies that shows stuff like resistances, important notes ('Can self-heal'), etc. Only due to some weird bug, this extra data will NOT be visible if you play using a resolution higher than 720p. Yeah, thats right - you have to choose to either get access to full game UI (but run it at 1280x720) or run it at full resolution but not be able to access enemy data. There are workarounds (google for FF13 GeDoSaTo), but overall this port is a massive, massive fail.  Soundtrack is fantastic. Both voices and game sound are very well done and fit properly. I have FF13 soundtrack in a boxed edition, and absolutely love listening to it.  World design and animation quality deserves its own spot. Its very easy not to notice just how realistic characters are animated - how they twist their hands, move their jaws, etc. But when you start paying attention, you realise just how much detail went into getting it to work - and its astounding. The world is just as awe-inspiring, with lots of design and art process clearly involved in its creation. Sure, there are 'simple' areas like that green grass field you can see on example screenshots - but there are also places which look damn fabulous, and there are more of those by far.  Overall, i would absolutely hands-down no-discussion recommend this game. I owned it on PS3 back during its original release, and got it on Steam during one of the sales - it is easily my favourite FF game, and one of most favourite games of all time. Don't listen to the haters (if you see any), go and try it for yourself - i promise, you won;t be dissapointed!",

I'm running on a pretty good set up, and most of the time I would run between 50-60 FPS, but after having optimized my nvidia control panel, and turning the settings to minimalist usage, I still was unable to attain the constant 60 FPS I desired, however this is not to the games detriment (IMO) as what is compelling about this game is the combat, cutscenes (if you've played, you understand that the story is just one big anime, and I appreciate it) and world design.  The combat is definitely an evolved FF combat system, attack gauge, stagger bar, paradigms, all relatively simple to use and rewarding to master. The games biggest challenges for me were just the huge amounts of grinding I found myself doing in order to gain enough gil for upgrades or Crystarium Points (CP) so if you do go after achievements like squirrels to nuts, then be prepared to put the time in; everything has a winning strategy though, so try to think strategically if you have a difficult time with a boss or larger enemy and optimize your characters to be as combat ready as possible. The world, while COMPLETELY linear (aside from backtracking for side missions) is one that begs to be explored more. Which sucks, since you really can't do that much exploring..  All in all, if you're thinking about it, I say go for it. That's what I did and I enjoyed it.",

I hate that one so much  The Bad -Extremely Linear compared to previous titles -The story, while good, is so extremely slow. You play for an hour, you feel like you are getting nowhere. -The only free roam is introduced in the very last chapters -Every scene with Snow and Sara makes me want to kill myself -Poorly Optimized for PC  In conclusion, many people hate this game and many people absolutely love this game. I feel that I am somewhere in the middle. I did enjoy the game a long time ago on the xbox 360, but playing through it again made me realize how painfully slow the story is and I lost interest. I do have fond memories of playing the game in the past though and for that alone I feel that people should atleast try it. Definitely wait till it is on sale if you are on the fence.",

The combat suffers from the same lack of intelligence as the story. While it had a few interesting twists (paradigms, and these weird 'aeresol' spays you could use before and after battle), that was pretty much where innovation ended. You had no control over party members, and you can almost literally 'auto battle' through the entire game. The combat is boring, repetitive, and does almost nothing to make the player feel like they have something invested in any of the fights.  My only hope is that future FF games take some lessons from some of the better games of the last few years; Mass Effect, Witcher series, Dragon Age series...JRPG's are in desperate need of abandoning tired old combat systems and reinventing themselves....",

            "review_text": "For me, this is a difficult game to review. This is the closest thing I have to a guilty pleasure as the open world is repetitive and dull, the combat is one-sided and stacked against you and the story makes little sense. And here I am with over 80 hours in it and another 20-30 likely to come soon.  I'll start by stating that I have never played a Final Fantasy game that isn't 13, so if that changes the context of this review, so be it. That said, this game makes me want to and I have already bought 13-2.  Before I talk about the problems with this game, I'll try to explain why I've sunk so much time into it. It is stunningly pretty; just ordinary gameplay is beautiful with a nice variety of colours, tones and eye-catching set pieces. While a lot of the enemies are over-designed so you have no idea if what you're looking at is a head or an arm, the lead characters each have their own aesthetics that speak of the fashion of the FFXIII world. As bizarre as JRPG clothing usually is, I really like the design choices that went into the protagonists. But where the game comes alive is in the pre-rendered cutscenes. Holy crap, they are stunning. I took 701 screenshots over the course of the main story (admittedly that's kinda par for the course for me), but the majority of them were in cutscenes. I cannot really convey how nice to watch these cutscenes are, so go check out the opening cinematic for the game. The only downside of the cutscenes is that a couple have SO MUCH going on that it's hard to follow; these were the ones where my screenshots caught only blur and semi-obscured characters. They were so desperate to show activity and movement that they don't linger on anything and that's a shame.  The gameplay of FFXIII is split between 'open world' running and the combat. Neither is perfect. By which I mean that both kinda suck. Aside from the rather petty complaint of all the characters having really loud footfalls (actually, the whole sound balancing was off on this port), the main problem with the 'open world' is how linear it is. You have to run down long corridors formed of walkways, tunnels or just convenient debris. You meet enemies who just stand there and wait for you, staring right at you under six feet away and doing nothing until you take that step too close. And you drift. I assume it's a problem with the port as I don't recall it on the PS3 version (I played the first 15 hours or so on PS3 before getting bored), but if you press forward you drift to the left or right. Running in a straight line, even down straight corridors, is impossible. You can alter whether you drift left or right, but the little dotted line on the minimap showing where you've been will always be a zigzag. It's not game-breaking, but it's bloody annoying. I've heard it said that 'it gets good 20 hours in'; this is when the tight corridors open up into a large area with side quests, but for me that was 40 hours in. By then I knew I was hooked, but the opening doesn't make as big a change as I thought. It's just one big area with a load of corridors coming off it to any other area. The final 2 chapters just go right back to narrow and confined.  The combat also has a lot to answer for. God, I could write a whole essay on why the FFXIII combat is bad, but I'll give you the brief version. It's real time combat with time-based elements. This means that if you sit there and do nothing, the enemy will keep attacking you. The time-based elements are that it takes time to charge up your attacks; any attacks. Each attack is worth a different quantity of 'attack bars' with more powerful attacks requiring more bars and thus more idle time to use. The problem with this is that you have no time. A massive focus of the combat is winning as quickly as possible; the combat scoring system that affects item drops requires you to win quicker than a set time. This on its own wouldn't be too bad but, given the range of abilities available, the daunting weakness/strength system and the terrible menu-based combat (the kind that fits perfectly in turn-based combat), it's impossible to fight most enemies with anything other than auto-choose attacks. Luckily the auto-choose AI is pretty good; it always calculates the most effective moves and uses them, taking into account damage, weakness, buffs etc. But there are other elements to the combat...random elements that you have absolutely no way to control. A number of attacks (both yours and the enemies') are proximity-based; some heal the characters near the medic, some deal massive damage to targets directly in front etc. But you have no way to affect where your characters or the enemies stand. Depending on where the mindless AI decides to let your team charge their attacks, you may be excluded from healing, clumped up to receive a powerful AoE attack or simply ignored. On top of this is the decision to make your party leader all-important. If either of your two companions are killed, drop a revive on them and boom, right back into the fray. If your leader is killed, sorry that's it. Game Over. Retry? Who thought that was logical? Yeah, I've heard of FF characters forgetting to revive outside of combat (Sorry, Aeris), but not being able to do it in combat, just because the arbitrary leader was downed? Rubbish. Oh. And having an unskippable animation for switching character roles mid-battle - WHEN THE ENEMY WILL STILL ATTACK DURING IT - is moronic. I've lost more than once because my leader was killed while the medic was posing.  I've already said that the story doesn't make a lot of sense. That's an understatement. You find out nothing until a good ten hours into the game and then it spoon feeds you a tiny bit at a time and gives you the equivalent of a book to read in the 'Datalog'; a menu with paragraphs of information about the characters, places, concepts and...stuff you encounter. This system is poor storytelling because anyone without the patience to read it all will be lost. Character motivations are rarely fully explained and this may be because of some translation thing, but most likely it's supposed to make everyone seem that little bit mysterious. It's more annoying than anything. Most motivations come through by the end, but vast portions of the plot are driven by characters doing the exact things they said they wouldn't...so...maybe I just didn't understand. All that said, I couldn't stop playing until I found out how it all ended. Sometimes it's the lure of 100% completion that keeps me going, sometimes it's gripping gameplay. In this case it was the mysteries of the story and a growing wonder about how the characters' stupid actions would somehow save the day.  From everything I've written, you're probably wondering why this is a positive review. Simply because I still want to play more. Yeah, the open world is a lie and the combat is stacked; I didn't even go into how most of the boss fights are just puzzles on unusual ways to use your combination of character roles. But after all of that I want to return to the bits I missed and finish them. Some part of me really enjoys this game and, while I'm unlikely to replay it any time soon, I still have a full 24 hours' worth of entertainment to get out of it.",

            "review_text": "The issue with Final Fantasy 13 is the characters. As a story it's kindof interesting in setting up the big plot that is 13-2 and LR(haven't played it yet so don't spoil), but it's also 30 hours too long. It tries really hard to be another Final Fantasy 7, but only what we thought FF7 was. We thought FF7 was a whine fest but on a recent playthrough I found it to be actually quite less so and any 'whining' is actually warranted. Nothing teen angst about it!  The characters are all too whiney. Hell, the main character(Lightning) has a line that is 'Worst birthday ever.' Not even joking. That line is SPOKEN. That's full on teen angst. Hope is absolutely one of the worst characters in any game I have played. I understand he's young, but that doesn't give him the right to be dumb. Snow is full on stubborn, Vanille is annoying, Sazh is all right, and Fang is....okay fine Fang is awesome. But that's one out of like...7 playable characters. That's not good. It's the antithesis of good. It's...not good.  As for the story? Well it's interesting. You have the relationship with the Fal'cie and the L'cie, the war between Pulse and Coccoon, what the Sanctum is actually up to, and vague hints at something bigger going on. And you find out what that bigger thing is in 13-2 and it's actually kindof awesome. But that's 13-2 and this is 13.  Another issue is the script. One of my friends said that he refuses to play a game where you have to read a codex(or in this case, a datalog) about all these things being mentioned to understand what they are, and I can see that. At the same time I will also argue that the characters themselves know what all this is, so why explain it via dialogue? On the otherside, there are ways that you can explain this ♥♥♥♥ via dialogue such as little before-chapter things or 'last time on blah blah blah' and then you wouldn't need a datalog.  The music has some tracks that I remember and some that I don't. Most of what I remember are the Barthandelus(sp?) boss battle and the final battle themes. I will say the final battle theme is actually really excellent, but that's 3(final boss has 2 forms, 2 themes) songs out of 40 or something.  As for the gameplay, it's boring and the character development system stops you at a certain point until you get to the next chapter. You literally can't. over-level. BUT, you still have to grind. It's not a very good system.  FF13 really falls flat on a lot of things, but is a good prologue for the actual plot; but, like I said, it's 30 hours too long.  Oh yeah!

Yeah the characters indeed look awesome, and they all have their own prominent characteristic, but that's it. The story itself is quite confusing in the beginning, no any bloody idea what the hell are they talking about. Plus, I feel for the entire game, the character themselves don't know what are they doing (until the very end) either along with an over-optimistic attitude. 'What's our destiny?' 'I don't know' ' Hey, me neither!' ' Then just follow the path and see where it'll lead us' ' Yeah, we must have fate' ' Hell yeah, you are right, let's go even I don't have any idea what we are doing' Once someone isn't in the mood the other guys cheer him or her up, once they don't know what they are supposed to do they just ignore it and keep on moving. I don't know, but to me personally, I'd rather figure out where and what is my goal before moving on. Next, I expected a lot more side quests in it, but sadly no. There are some optional missions you can take, but you won't call it a side quest because it just isn't. The story by the way is a straight line. Just follow where the indicator and that's it. It's a disappointment. Lastly, what really pisses me off is when you can gain full access to customize your party, when chapter 11( maybe 12, I forgot), while in this game there are total 13 chapters. Why do they even bother doing that? If the company doesn't want us to customize the party, which is ridiculous, I said then don't put that much characters in the game. To sum up, besides linaer plots, confusing background, and poorly designed customization, I said it's a good game afterall.",

No doubt over the years you've heard polarizing reception over this game, lots of stuff about how it's a 'long hallway simulator' and 'the worst FF game ever'. While I will concede that most of the game is extremely linear and that it's nothing like any of the other FF installments, I have to say that it's nothing resembling a bad game.  For one, it's got a hell of a battle system. Unlike other FF games, where player agency is minimal and you can win by holding down the confirm button after a certain point, that simply isn't possible in this game. If you don't pay attention, you will die. Battles are fast paced and demand your attention and thought to win. This fact, combined with the fact that the game consistently level caps you to keep you from ever getting overpowered (until you've beaten the game that is) makes this easily the most challenging Final Fantasy title since the 8-bit era.  The cast is pretty good, though not the best in FF history (it's hard to beat Cloud and friends, or Zidane and company). They're pretty memorable and all very well fleshed out by the end. They're mostly likable and the game does a pretty good job of letting you know who they are and what drives them.  The plot is confusing on the surface, but if you take time to pay attention and care what's going on (or just play through the game multiple times to catch everything you missed the first time around, like myself) it's a pretty well thought out tale with an impressively deep lore constructed. A good thing to keep in mind is that the story has one overarching prevailing theme throughout: Destiny Vs Free Will. If you keep this in mind the game is a lot easier to comprehend, particularly the final hours.  As far as presentation goes, this game is absolutely gorgeous. The art direction is second to none, the soundtrack is ambient and fitting, and it is one of the most polished, bug-free games you will ever play. Everything works as it should and you will never find yourself losing a battle or having to load because something in the game went awry. And yes, while the game is linear for the first 20 hours or so, there are very good, legit story reasons as to why this is, but to say anymore on that would to be going into spoiler territory. The game does a good job of constantly pushing the player forward. Think of it as an experience similar to an action/adventure game like Uncharted in JRPG form. I know that's hard to imagine but it works surprisingly well in this game.  All in all I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes beautiful story driven games with well develop characters and a deep lore with fast paced battles.",

You spend most of the time watching the characters deal with the various issued the story throws at them. It feels more akin to a point and click, than it does an in depth RPG. The combat is tedious and you basically just press Auto abilities and the game does the rest. That being said i do have this temptation to keep playing.

There are many things that really twinge on leaning to not recommended even though I say yes it is a good game. - The Paragrim system is by far the most annoying / just like FFX-2 i found it annoying that characters can change their job mid battle. I know it comes in handy but really it loses the reality of fantasy aspect.  - At the end of the game you kill Orphan and then if you want to use the extra accessory slot, you can only do it from a preload of the game prior to killing him and back track and do all the things from there... You cant start a new game with open accessories and with all that you had from previous. Maybe its me, but I find that annoying too, to sit and go through the whole thing again.  - Some accessories don't really come into effect, as they are completely random, literally 1/100 chance at times it appears, and that's when they are levelled max. Overall the game graphics are stunning, creatures interesting, and trying to look up Light or Vanilles skirt is fun. But it isn't the type of game I would play again. Not like FF6-&gt;10.  Glad it is finished, it was worth it, but not a 2nd time round.",

You don't need to know anything from these that the third one won't tell you... I still haven't saved the chocobo in that one and I don't understand how Hope even talks to lightning from the sky... still the best FF in my opinion is Lightning Returns. And XV is not gonna sell more than they said it should to turn a profit. The trading cards for these games are hella expensive so don't get them unless your planning on spending 5 dollars per 500 XP, and 10-15 dollars on foil badges per game. Also you will definately benefit from a controller for Lightning Returns.",

I wanted to give this game a change becuase the graphics are beautiful and some of the characters looked interesting. After about six hours i was so confused by the storyline that i had to look it up on the FF wiki. Its a convoluted, uninteresting mess in my opinion. My biggest concern was with the battle system. 99% of the time you dont have to to a damn thing except press (A) to not die. There is no thinking on your feet or any type of reactionary strategy. You preprogram a few paradygms for your party members and thats about it. If you enjoyed FF12 then you will probably enjoy FF13 also. Otherwise give it a miss. Its not often that i regret a $10 purchase.",

Game as final fantasy:  assumably it's not comparative to the other entries as it's not at all like them and much worse.  but as someone who doesn't know an older FF than crisis core, its a great game standalone.   Gameplay:  6.5/10. its too automated but still worth a go partially as it's a cinematic story game. (Hope and Eclaire!!)  music: 8/10. it's orchestrated. what else do you want?  Graphics: 10/10 for it's time and still looking good!!!  Controls: Quonky and irritating with a mouse, bugs, and low fps on any and all hardware at most points, but again decently playable.  Do i Reccomend it?: Kinda. best on console just for poor port and smae graphics, though you do get better reso, AA, and FPS where granted and not slow. it can also make you run a little hot. YMMV",

I'm not sure about other people, but I personally liked the story and gameplay alot. It was a big change from what I was use to but it seemed to fit the atmosphere and story. For instance, the linearity (which I honestly couldn't care less about) matched the fact that they were on a set fate that they couldn't escape, however at a certain point    when they left Cocoon and decided to make their own fate    things started to become less linear. The characters are also really interesting, not exactly your typical 'save the world' kind of crew ('cept Snow and his peeps) but it works out anyway because they develope over time! So all in all, I really liked this game! And I'd recomend it to people who wanna be visually and auditorily stimulated because DAMN is this a pretty game with some great soundtrack!",

Once you realize that traditional Final Fantasy will probably not ever return to the main line of games and you hedge your expectations and take this game at face value, you can enjoy this game. I came into it expecting nothing, but I was blown away by the storytelling that this game had. The pacing and cinematic experience is where this game shines. Even the battle system was something I thought to be amazing. It was great fun and fairly different from what I have experienced in the past. Overall, it's definitely one of my favorite RPGs from the past decade. I suggest people to try this game, but with the aforementioned clear mind.",

What is the fal'cie?  What is the Pulse?   However the game explains none of it... now i know what you people are going to say 'Thats what the internet is for' but hoping the game will tell me what those 2 are and not the internet but it didnt... i wish the game could explain would explain that in the story...   2: When your leader is KO,d Game Over:   this PISSES ME OFF when this occurs i mean in Final Fantasy XII when the Leader dies the game will tell you to switch and you can revive them NOT IN XIII though.. if you Leader is KOd well TOUGH LUCK GAME OVER FOR YOU!!  SEIORSLY WHAT THE BLODDY HELL!?  Why can't we switch leaders in the middle of battle!? Why can't the teams mates use a Pheonix down to revive the leader?  WHAT WHERE THEY THINKING!?! and this can make boss fights a PAIN IN THE ♥♥♥ i know Final Fantasy XIII-2 fixed this problem but WHY CAN'T THEY DO THAT IN THIS GAME!?    ",
