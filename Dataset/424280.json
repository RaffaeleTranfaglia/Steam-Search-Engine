            "review_text": " Developer:  SnoutUp  Publisher:  SnoutUp  Release Date:  27th January 2016  Platform:  Windows, Linux, OSX [Steam], iOS, Android, Windows Mobile  Price:  Free  Disclaimer: The following review was conducted on PC via Steam.   A kung-fu fighting pig, I am not sure where this idea came from, but it seriously gets you in the mood for bacon!   IronSnout is a simple beat’em up game without horizontal movement where you play as a kung-fu fighting pig. You encounter a continuous stream of enemies which come in the form of wolves. This is referencing the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, one would assume. The game play is simple to learn, but very challenging to become slightly good at. The game is all about leader boards, competing against your friends and other players world wide. The more points you score from carrying out combos of strikes, and the longer you last before your Pig becomes bacon sandwiches all contribute to your final score. You will find it tricky enough to break the one minute barrier most of the time, but when you do you soon come up against an increasingly challenging onslaught of wolves wielding axes, chainsaws, and riding rockets trying to be your end.   It is easy to see why this game has been released on so many platforms, but it is certainly a game more suited for either using a controller on for PC, or the touchscreen of phones. I tried playing using the keyboard controls and it is just a huge fumble-fest to say the least. Once trying to use the Xbox controller, you will see a noticeable difference in the way you are able to play the game.   Iron Snout’s art style is pleasantly presented in a simplistic cartoon form, nothing too fancy, and this is another element which makes it undoubtedly clear that this is a mobile port that has reached the PC platform. I personally would of liked to have seen a little variety in the background or maybe some different styles of enemies design being thrown at you rather than the same sprites over and over again. That being said, you can’t ask for much more from a free-to-play game.    If you like the sort of game where you can pick up and play for a few minutes and then put it back down again, then Iron Snout is going to tick that box for you, you’ll find it difficult to play this game for long periods of time, I think I maybe played it at most for 10 minutes at a time, any more than that and you’ll simply grow bored of the repetitive gameplay; but because of how quick it is to get into a game, and how quick games usually are to finish, this is the sort of game that has you keep coming back for more. The large amount of replay ability from this factor is definitely one of the strongest points from this title.   Although Iron Snout is a free to play game, it doesn’t come with all of the regular free to play baggage we have come to expect such as microtransactions or pay-wall barriers, this is simply put, a game that you can play to it’s full potential, for free - No hidden catches. It’s worth a small amount of your time to try it out and experience it for yourself. I for one have also downloaded this game onto my phone for that extra hit of Beat’em up bacon action on the go too. I urge you too, to try this little game out.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale   4) Recommended   5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Also it's only few MBs. It's like someone actually enjoys making games.  10/10 would expect it to be 15 euro like a lot of very simple couch multiplayer games we have nowadays. Of course I wouldn't buy it for 15 euro, because that'd be ridiculous. Certainly worth more than 0 euro though, good job.",

I would definitely recommend playing this as 1.) Its free!!!!!!! 2.) Good Time Killer 3.) FREE!!!!! 4.) Why not play it 5.) Simple and Fast Paced There is absolutely no reason not to play it, as it is  NOT ... 6.) GRAPHICS OR CPU INTENSIVE 7.) A LARGE GAME BY ANY MEANS 8.) CONFUSING OR HARD 9.)

This game can be played for hours or minutes it just depends on the type of person you are for me i use this game to pass the time give it a few attempts of beating my high score and thats me done.  Its a simple game that anyone can play, for a free game everything is as you would expect, and there is only one thing i can say about this game, download it to you libary and give it a try.

Story: There's really not much of a story. You play as a pig and you kill waves and waves of wolves that are after him for god knows what. But this game is really not about the story. But the main goal of the game is the get the highest score which you get one point every time you kill one wolf. You can also track and post your scores online and see how you are at the game with the rest of the world.   Gameplay: This is where the game shines and is the reason you'll keep coming back. You control the pig with W,S,A,D, he can jump,duck,kick, and punch left, right and up. The control is spot on and really satisfying to kill wolves. You also will be able to grab weapons from the wolves you kill, you can grab hats, chainsaws and more to add to your combo score much easier. All in all the gameplay is very fun and additive although can get repetitive if played in long sittings.  Graphics: Very simple but very nice 2D art of the wolves and pigs for such a simple games the graphics look very nice and slick. But i wish there was more backgrounds to choose from than just the same tree only background.  Bottom line:   You really can't go wrong with this game. It's free, can get highly additive and is great fun for anyone looking to kill a few minutes before going somewhere. I say overall i would give it a download and is fun for any type of gamer looking for a fun quick game to play.  ",

If you are planning on buying this game, think twice if you are sensitive to violence and blood. Jokes aside, in the game you control a pig that, after months of being constantly harrassed by the wolves, decides to break bad... and break bones. With a self explanatory and easy to understand playability, Iron Snout offers a challenging, yet, fun gameplay experience, that will entertain the player for hours on end. You will often find yourself trapped inside the game while trying to beat your own record (331 here). One complaint I would have to make is that the replay feature of the game is fairly low. After I finished getting all of the achievements, I felt like I had already 'played the game', and enjoyed whatever it had to offer to the utmost. The developers could have added more features to implement the game, like, for instance, a mode where the character could walk and interact with more objects, maybe find more guns and so on.  Nevertheless, if you want to challenge yourself (climb on the leaderboard), skip some time or just procrastinate, you would surely want to play this one, as it's an 'outside the box' game, and maybe have a couple laughs with it.",

These enemies ranging from your simple, unarmed, charging wolf, to a crazed granny attacking you with her picnic basket. Your character (the pig) uses an alternating range of moves that are entertaining to use and to watch as the countless wolfs surrounding you are thrown about the small map.
