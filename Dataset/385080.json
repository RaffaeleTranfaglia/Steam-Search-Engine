            "review_text": "It's a shame. This game has a decent style to it and a lot of assets, which look okay IMO. However, horrible controls, technical issues and awful menus make it unplayable.  If you scroll over my avatar, you might see that I'm playing this game right now. I'm not, it's stuck, or well - one of the THREE processes, used by title, is stuck in background, even after I quit the game.  When you start the game you will be greeted by something that should represent interactive menu. However, this menu is so bad that you have to mouse-over things and take a step back, try to figure out what button does what and then finally start to play this game. Okay, I may have overstated that one, but  it's quite close to that feeling. So many elements trying to grab your focus, hiding away important info,  blending in with background, using bad colors ... ugh.  Same thing goes for tutorial area, which is supposed to show you the controls.  It shows labels that are sometimes hard to see, due to the blending with background behind them. Tutorial itself focuses rather on level dangers and leaves out couple of important things ...   Finally, most critical 'off' in my opinion is definitely bad collision coding. I couldn't run 5 meters without getting stuck to random objects on map. Maps themselves are also somewhat blending too much, enough that I don't really  know will I die if I jump on something.  I feel like developer should take a step back and try to solve all the issues. It might end up as a funny runner game, or whatever genre it claims to be.  Right now it just looks like a title that has it all, but is not polished nearly enough to be enjoyable.  ",
