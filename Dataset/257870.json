            "review_text": "Oldschool RPG goodness! I've always considered this series to be an excellent example of a no-nonsense, just-the-basics western RPG, and Eschalon III sticks to that tradition nicely. It's got all the core features: turn-based tactical combat, openended skill system, exploration and quests, adventurous (although not exactly deep) story, optional survival elements -- and no fluff or gimmicks. Book 3 does end sort of abruptly and is the shortest game in the series so it feels a bit unfinished, which I'd say is the primary drawback; it's overall less satisfying than the amazing Book 2. Still recommended as this particular style of neo-retro western RPG is still surprisingly rare and this one is quite competent and fun when considered on its own.",

            "review_text": "I am actually dissapointed in this part of the series. That's why I do not recommend it. If you can get the series as a whole, you will understand why I am dissapointed. Book 1 and 2 are such magnificent games, perfectly balanced out for every role, playable in so many ways, where book 3 seems to be only playable in (almost) one specific way and comes to a very abrupt end. When you think you are halfway through the game, it seems to be over with a stupid ending.  So I recommend it when buying the complete series, but if you are only interested in a good RPG, buy book 1 and/or 2. If you want to buy only one, take book 2 because it's just as good or even better as book 1 but has improved graphics.  Yes, I really mean it, if you like these kind of games, buy at least book 2! Do not buy book 3 if you're only to play one of them.",

The people who say that I'm just stupid and don't know how to play are probably the same butthurt hardcore eschalon fans that have put 4-5x the hours the average person puts in them. Play the first game, and the second, so far this one is indescribably awful.",
