Most missions are really painful as you do not know why you are being killed and there is no save systeam so you have to do the game serval times usually. But there are a few missions that really stand out such as the hong kong missions and the hotel mission. The graphics look really good for its time and the controls are the simplest of the hitman games I have ever played. Its attention to detail is really good suach as the fact that the sniper bobs up and down. Its music is also one of the best I have heard.  It is very hard to recomand codename 47 to other people due to its fustrstion. But if you want to follow the history of hitman or show that you played one of the most fustrating games that most people did not finish, than pick this game up",

Almost every mission can be completed in 3~5 slightly different ways, but you can't save during a mission. It has a fair deal of excitement and suspense. The mysterious assassin, the stress on stealth, and a decent narrative make it well worth playing even many years later.        Main menu&nbsp;",

If it's on sale, however, I highly recommend to anybody who's into the Hitman series, or anybody who wants to get into the series. Does that mean this game is awful? Absolutely not, it's a wonderful game - but it's not without its faults. Here's some pros and cons:  +Although stealth is the best option, you really don't get penalized for taking the loud and dumb route. +Provides an exceptional challenge. +Plenty of missions and gameplay time (I've watched most of the game before, I haven't played it as much though). +Provides good story, especially considering most games from this era in time lacked basic story elements. +Rather than beginning out with weapons or needing to collect them, you gain weapons upon mission completion, regardless of play style. +Before starting your mission, you select what weapons, items, and ammo you bring into the level - but for a price, and it's only for the current mission. For the next mission, you must select/reselect your inventory again. It makes you think more strategically on what items to use, rather than just take everything you can carry.  -AI is pretty terrible by today's standards, especially compared to Blood Money. -Can be too hard at times. Codename 47 is harder than the rest of the games. -No checkpoints: so if you fail or make a mistake, you restart the whole mission. Fortunately, the missions are generally fairly short. -Camera is awkward at times.  -Controls are terrible. I promise, you will want to map the controls before you start the game. Here's my config, to give you an idea:  Walk forward: W Run: Shift (hold JUST shift to run. If you're also walking forward, it will not work, strangely enough.) Walk left (strafe): A Walk right (strafe): D Walk backwards: S Lean left: X Lean right: V Preform action: E Toggle sneak: C Toggle camera mode: Alt Drop item: G (X works good as well) Equip binoculars: B Empty hands (holster weapon): F Fire: L mouse Reload: R Change firing mode: Delete Show map: M Mission status: Tab",

Even despite these defects, it comes damn close.The physics model in Hitman was a definite milestone in computer gaming. No other computer game at the time had been able to achieve the realistic effects you’ll find here.The wonderful, colourful graphics, the realistic and well-suited sounds, and the game's challenging difficulty make it great.",

The story isn't by any means good , voice acting is embarrassing but what you really want if you are buying a hitman game the is stealth aspect of it that is where the game delivers.  I like to divide levels Very Open and Very Small, now the Small levels where their are corridors and hallways are where you'll enjoy the game you study your enviroment , guard's paths , where to accquire weapeons, etc essentials slowly form a plan and execute it, the Open once are just broken not because of how the game but how it renders its graphics because it is a very short distance and thats why Small levels are better, now to play Open levels your going to use ur binoculars every 15 seconds to scout if their is an enemy because they will be difficult to see and most likely half your health is gone, I have no idea why they implemented a life system where if you die you are given 3 more chances and your actions are still done because if you get spotted with a weapon the guards shoot at you and its either you or them who dies, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were a permanent death were applyied but thats my opinion...  Now if you want a stealth game I recommend this for you even thou the Open levels suck they don't ruin the whole game and besides you could spend hours trying to find the perfect plan to complete a level, and that is where the game shines",

Hitman:Codename 47, as i mentioned is the first chapter to franchise,game starts with you escaping the laboratory where u were held as laboratory rabbit,but real action starts after you get hired by ICA which serves as International Contract Agency,giving you an orders as well as providing equipment and money to take down high priority targets while keeping the low profile,using tactical approach rather the forcing a fights using environment,disguises,weapons to your advantage and trying to hiding corpses to not alert guards while completing mission,because you don't really wanna get into action fight,your not immortal and you get fewer credits for extra casualties  Game is really hardcore and probably harder for newbies who hasn't played any of hitman games,despite lacking the numerous options of taking down your target like in other Hitman games,this chapter of a game has only one or two,however it gives you no tips, no marks beside of yourself and extraction point,so you have to figure out everything on your own,way to approach your target and take them down without getting caught cause combat feels really clunky cause aim feels is really inaccurate,so I'd recommend you to get as close to a target as possible before pulling the trigger.

But the good news is that you can dispose/garotte more than a dozen of conveniently turn-around sentries so to buffer the alerts (remember no rating and be sure to piano-wire them dobermans in the Rotterdam level!).  The good: +easy AI when staying silent; no suspicion tripping meter, +fun to replay; lee hong and tradition of the trade!! even the last Colombian level with little friend, +no judgment for body counts, +hillarious AI behavior (they just taunting you with a .45 hole in the head!!!).  The not so good: -You will die; blasted by 5-AKs at close range, feasted on by a Jaguar, the bartender's sawnoff, sword of destilee..., damn sniper that you did not wire, etc. Then, the previous 40 min of your life did not happen, -ruined 'looking for suspicious' system that forced you to shoot everything, restart level, or play dress-up combo once triggered, -very steep learning curve for a couple of the boss-levels, -slow body dragging (can be exploited by the running glitch; user preferrence), -them Colombian commando xray vision  The weird: ??- strange final conclusion that must be understood by referencing Wikia...actually, from start to finish. ??- One stripper for that entire premise?

I mean really the controls have been to hell and back, while being ♥♥♥♥♥ by a pack of monkeys. I know its a Port put really. 2. The Gameplay is soooo stale it makes bread look fresh. 3. Dont buy it.  I can understand its an old game, but DO NOT get this. IM WARNING YOU! I mistaken this for my first Hitman game ever! That being Silent Assassin, I shouldve just researched this awful port instead of buying it in a nostalgia rush, I know my play time really hasnt given it a chance. If I ever play this again It will the time where I'm thinking about catching cancer from the nearest McDonalds.  SOOOOO not worth the $1.34 I paid I give this game HIV/Cancer",

Unfortunately for my plans of playing through the whole series, this simply won't run well. I've followed tutorials by PC Gamer and posted on the forums here but no fix has been found. The game won't start unless it's in windowed mode, which is fine. It's not playable in windowed mode however. There is a significant amount of stuttering or bounciness. I would be willing to suffer through this, however it impacts the game play as, first of all, timing of the NPCs movements is somewhat off (some move past where they are supposed to be way too fast) but most importantly, the rag doll physics are totally screwed up. After killing someone, their body will bounce and fly around like it's trying to improve the Poltergeist remake.   As an example, on the second real mission, there is a limo driver who you can kill while he is peeing. Whether I kill him with fibor wire, knife or silenced pistol, when he dies his body goes flying around the entire map, gets 'spotted' by guards and civilians and leads to me losing the game. Haven't been able to make it past this level due to this bug. Can't recommend this game unfortunately.",
