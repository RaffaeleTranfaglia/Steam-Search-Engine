    "description": "Einlanzer is a full-scale, epic fantasy role-playing game. The 40+ hour story of Einlanzer is deep, thought-provoking, and emotional, while remaining light-hearted and fun at times. Expect a strategic battle system, massive scope, regularly added content, and difficult moral decisions.",
