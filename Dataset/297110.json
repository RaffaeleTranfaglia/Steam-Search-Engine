Tap on the keyboard to play instruments or use the grid-sequencer to make outta this world jams! Then take them to the party that's on a cosmic scale!!! Good times ensured, drugs not included!  Pros: Made me remember what its like to make jams kicking of the a** on my midi-keyboard! OH sh**! I'm gonna go make more awesome tracks now in [electronic music producer program] !!!

            "review_text": "I had tons of fun with this game. Even at full retail price, I'd recommend this game. My only real issue about this game is that it's short- it's VERY short. It only took me 1 hour to finish the story line- which wasn't really much of one. Cosmic DJ is a game where you are a Cosmic DJ and have to save the city from 'Bad Vibes' from the main antagonist (forgot his name). The antagonist destroys all the 'Jamtennas' that provide good vibes to the city. As the cosmic DJ, you must fix these 'Jamtennas' by completing the tasks given. There are 4 Jamtennas you must fix and each Jamtenna offers 4-5 missions where you need to create a song using the tools given and fix the Jamtenna. The gameplay is very fun and energetic. It's not really complicated and can easily be done by a child. One thing I really liked about the game is that after you create your song, the game will mix all of the songs from that one Jamtenna into a remix which you can save as a .mp3 to your computer. You can create cover art while the game converts the remix into a .mp3. You aren't forced to save the songs, if you really don't like it.   Conclusion: If you are hesitant on getting this game, buy it. It's cheap, fun, and will kill time if you need to. 9/10",

            "review_text": "I bought it when it was last on sale. Not sure how much I payed for it. Normally I wouldn't buy a game like this, or really indie games this was just something to spend the remainder of my money on. Also, because my brother had a music sequencer app on his phone, and that influenced me to get this as well.  At first I wasn't that intersted in it. Now that I've put some time into it, and understand how to create music a bit better it's more fun. It's actually really easy to create a song. I call it song, but really it's just a loop. I haven't played too much of the main story just one jamtenna. That was when I first got it. Since then I've been messing with quickplay.   It reminds you a lot of Katamari Damaci. Seems very Katamari Damaci inspired.   I can't really convince you to buy it. I mean it seems like you would either be interested in it, or not. Music maker games were always a niche.   The only things I wish this game had were...... -Ability to choose own instruments in quickplay (which isn't that much of a bother really. maybe cosmic dj 2? :D) -Ability to save the loop unremixed. Most of my loops sound better remixed anyways, but still... Maybe you just want the loop? -Ability to tap along to your song while it's playing and the instrument not laying down on the track. Like when I'm choosing my instruments I can play with them, and tap out a beat with that specific instrument. If I do it while I am creating a song it lays down on the track, and I can't expirement with those instruments without it repeating!   Creating song's is addicting though.",

            "review_text": " Disclaimer:  I bought this game for $0.79 during a sale. My review is based on paying this price. If you look to pay significantly more or less for this game, my view point doesn't apply to you as much.    Summary:   Cosmic DJ is a music game that require zero musical experience. The player gets to 'create' music using one very simple tool. To spice things up some, there is a bit of a story driven single player mode that doesn't take itself seriously at all. It managed to get some laughs out of me, but it's silly humor probably isn't for everyone. The game only took me a couple of hours to beat. Apart from the story missions, you can just freely use the music creation tool and everything you do in the game can be exported to MP3s if yuou just have to share with your friends.     The Good:   Cosmic DJ does an amazing job of setting a mood and sticking with it. I quickly learned that the game wanted me to laugh and have fun the whole time and it succeeded in doing such. Knowing absolutely nothing about music will not stop you from enjoying this game. Soundtrack was pretty damn good :D    The Not so Good:   While you can switch the creation tool into 'grid mode' there is very little customization happening. For people who are familiar with music, you get to edit rythym down to sixteenth notes, but the actual notes are locked into 4 tones for every song. I understand that this is to make it easy for everyone, but I felt like I was missing out on some really cool stuff because of how limited I was. It seems like just a little bit of work could really turn that around.     The Verdict  : 7/10 -3 for lack of depth. I felt like Cosmic DJ could have really impressed me and drawn me in for a few more hours but missed the mark. But, for $0.79, it's hard to go wrong with Cosmic DJ.",
