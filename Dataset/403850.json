Everything seems to be worked out properly - a plot, a story, heroes, enemies, powerups, obstacles - definitely recommend - enjoyed playing and will play more",

I can play this kind of game on my tablet or phone why would I want to on a PC? I guess I should have read or investigated more. Thought 3 bucks I couldn't go wrong, I was mistaken.",
