The scenario-esk missions are challenging but quick to speed through, and the strategy necessary to dominate multiplayer games is great.   Problems The players themselves are the problem, leaving when they're going to lose.  It's impossible to acquire more than one deck without paying real money  The game itself is 10/10",
