            "review_text": "Millennium 3 is the 3rd installment of the 5 part Millennium series. Yes, that means you should probably start with the first one. That being said, each part is different. The main character remains the star but the story stays fresh with a blend of characters from the first two along with some new recruits. You can import your save game from 1 to 2 to 3 etc. and you get to keep your gear so that makes the series more rewarding.   The plot in M3 is quite enjoyable. The level design is nice and includes some big dungeons. So far, I found the characters in 3 the most interesting. There is also a lot of humor in the game with funny dialogue between characters. The main difference between 3 and the first 2 is that M3 uses a lot more side scrolling maps. At first, I found it a bit strange but you get used to it and it adds some visual variety and some fun jumping adventures for Marine. Otherwise, the plot is building up to the tourney at the end.   The game has a lot of achievements that are fun to get. If you are an achievement hunter, play the series on hard mode. It's not too bad (I typically do not play games on hard mode) and you'll get a lot of extra achievements for it.  If you're on the fence about this game, keep in mind that on Adorlea's official site you can play a demo of the full game that lets you play the actual game for 1 hour. I would recommend that you start with Millennium 1 however. You can play each game as a stand-alone, but it will be harder and the plot / characters won't be as meaningful.   Overall, Millennium 3 is a very fun third part of a great rpg series. Aldorlea's RPGs remind me of SNES rpgs, which I consider the golden age of RPGs. (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, Earthbound, etc.) If you enjoy character driven rpgs with some humor, you can't go wrong with the Millennium series.  ",

            "review_text": "Part 3 of 5. CARE SPOILERS!!!!!! This time you travel with a big group to the north east, the orc area and the forbidden zone. This time you can play with merline and later you get for a short an old face in a secret room (if you dont miss him) Hirado is back and how should it be, he understands very well with Abu. You have again very nice levels a higher path, a coast, a cave, a pit, orc fort and after that you met 2 old face again Jack and James (the girls greatest nightmares) and after that you find a very sympathic mermaid and last but not least you get an old face again. Karine is back and how should it be, Abu and Karine likes both too. So with a great little army we go trough the 3rd swamp that is absolutly different from the other 2 before and then we get a another ancient temple that is different from the 2 other before, too. The finish means a soul dessert and the castle.  So its again 40 quests, this time no teddy, some are the same like game too (poxed, cure, missable) and other quests in quests again, 13 are to defeat the epic design and some very hard animal kings (yeah this time 5 more then in 1 and 2). Really nice challenges, some are really frustrating even with best set up of the best weapon from 3 games but with the right strategy, items and levels possible to defeat, i really love this 13 bosses + the story line bosses. The secret rooms are again really nice designed like 2 or better i find (not all). There is many things everywhere to find and so much missable if you dont search every wall piece for piece, sure you dont need them but they are most helpful.  The normal enemy design is most time nice like flying sharks and many others, sure you miss some others and at the end of the enemys are really tough again but so many characters you will get the best set up. The story about a werwolf, mermaid and a great final battle. It has a bit of Oz (Robot, Lion and a beautiful water scarecrow (Joke). I enjoy it and happy to be able to start part 4 today. I hope you have your fun too and enjoy it and support this game. The developer is great you should play the first 3 parts and before i forget the last quests of the lost L. there a few hints to other games like take me higher quest, 3 stars of destiny and maybe even more.  So take care at the start you can miss 3 secret rooms, dont blow the orc fort, be careful in the castle with secret rooms and animal kings and enjoy it. The little weak points. There could be a bit more levels, shops, enemys (to much bee types but there would be so much more possible animals rhinos, elefants, hippos, squirrels and co.) but only little critic points. I miss the wallpapers again and the guide miss a secret room, quest guide but the quality is fine you see levels, enemy weaknesses and a straight guide in combination with a online guide you are well prepared (only hidden items you need find yourself sherlock :) I enjoy this game even you must really take care at the quests in quests every time very well i give this game 9.6 of 10 points for all who love or will love 2 D RPG games, test it and i hope you enjoy it. Look a lets play/ review and decide yourself but give it a chance to becharm you. Thanks for you time/ reading.",
