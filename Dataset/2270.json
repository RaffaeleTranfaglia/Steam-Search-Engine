I admit I'm not one of those avid gamers that true to using the keyboard. But I like the controller and doing keyboard is the only thing stopping me from playing the game more. However, this does feel like the old game, keyboard controls and all. And is still a blast and brings back great memories. I would still recommend it.",

This game is awesome, there is nothing bad that can really be said about it, it still kicks serious ♥♥♥ today.  Steam version review: Well since I have only played this version, the steam version, i can't really compare that much. However, there is obviously benefits to this version! First of all, it loads up and installs pretty fast! Secondly, there is no floppy disk you have to deal with, finally, the game runs extreamly smoothly. Although, there is one complaint I have, I can't make it go back to fullscreen after existing for a moment! Besides that, this game is awesome and I would reccommend buying it on steam!  Overall Game: I wasn't born for this game to come out, i was born well after it came out, but I have enjoyed it thoroughly! Even if my generation finds games like this extreamly hard (I agree with them, sometimes), this game is awesome, it is just so fun! I can see how this game and others like it made gamer's crave first-person shooters, they are even better than today's call of duty and halo franchises, in my person opinon. It takes a minute to get use to the controlls (If you are a console gamer), but it is suprisingly easy after a s hort time! I love this game, I only wish it was longer!   What I would pay: Wait until the wolf pack drops, you can get three games for the price of one, maybe even less. I got the wolf pack at 75% off, you don't have to wait for that, but I would reccommend the wolf pack at 15.00 unless you can't take the waiting any longer. It's a fun game, but dissapointingly short!",

John Carmack is one of my biggest inspirations, and this, in my opinion, is one of his masterpieces. id Software pushed the limits of what PCs could do at the time and achieved the impossible.  The settings they chose for DOSBox don't appeal to me however. I am not keen on using filtered graphics. I like crisp pixels. If you would like to see what I mean there, is an easy way to set the graphics very crisp and original feeling, and while we are at it, we can also smooth out animation a lot:  1. Right-Click the game in Steam, and choose  'Properties' . 2. Click on the  'Local Files'  tab. 3. Click  'Browse Local Files' . 4. Double click the  'base'  directory. 5. Open  'wolf3d.conf'  with notepad. 6. Look for the  '[sdl]'  section. 7. Change  'output=ddraw'  to  'output=overlay' . 8. Scroll down to  '[cpu]'  section. 9. Change  'cycles=auto'  to  'cycles=12000' .  Save and exit notepad. Run the game and enjoy.  This smooths out animation greatly, and provides original crisp feeling graphics. Some people prefer the filtered look, if that's you, just leave it as ddraw and only change the 'cycles' option.",

You have a finite number of lives. That's how many attempts you get at an episode.  As far as I know, it's the only FPS that attempts that. It can be quite an unforgiving game. If you fail to see the random guard behind a door before you get into a room, one or two shots at close range can end your life and force you to restard with a simple gun.  Wolf3D is still a very, very, great game. It's beautiful in simplicity, is still challenging, and a must play.",

In reality, in this era, we loved to shoot everything, the fact that we could kill some nazis was revolutionnary and amazingly epic, some could get bored because of the graphics ( that's a game of 1992 after all ), but i think that it is partly what makes the charm of the game.

Although this wasn't the first FPS, it was the first blockbuster hit that really established the FPS as a genre. However, the game doesn't hold up very well today.  Wolfenstein 3D is fun, but also very frustrating. Here are a few problems. 1) The controls are so atrocious that the game is practically unplayable, but a source port program like ECWolf can be used to update the control scheme. 2) The layout of levels is sprawling, and the blocky and repetitive architecture give most levels an annoying maze-like feel. 3) The game is weird with corners, meaning that sometimes enemies can see and shoot you around a corner, but you can't see them. 4) The mutant enemy type will often shoot you instantaneously on sight, without you having time to react. 5) There are only a few types of weapons and enemies, and combat quickly becomes repetitive. 6) The built-in auto-aim can be clunky and unreliable.  Ultimately, I recommend Wolfenstein 3D because it is still fun to play despite its many failings, which admittedly will keep some FPS fans from enjoying it. My advice is to play it with the ECWolf source port (or another like it), and to enjoy the game in small doses, playing a level or two per day so that it won't become tedious. If you want some nostalgia and can appreciate an older game in spite of its limitations, then Wolfenstein 3D is a good buy.",

The Steam version runs the original MS-DOS version of the game in the DOSBox emulator. This causes the game to be very laggy and run at a very low resolution. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you buy this then download ECWolf (Great source port of Wolf3D) and play it in that! (you will need to own it on steam to do so)",

Why would we, in 2015 (as of writing), want to play a 23 year old relic of gaming past? Well, it's because despite its age, and its primitive appearance, everything that makes the genre what we know it to be today is here. After all, this is the blueprint to the FPS genre. The gameplay is here, and there's a certain freedom that this and many games like it have that more modern games seem to lack. Sure, as I said before, the graphics are dated and it looks like a mess someone drew in MS Paint compared to pretty much anything since then. Sure, the voice samples are goofy when guards see you and yell in broken German and let out death cries ranging from cringeworthy to gut bustingly hilarious, but that's part of its charm. Wolfenstein 3d is a game that doesn't take itself to seriously and doesn't expect you to either. So, as inexpensive as it is to have one of the most vital pieces of gaming history to enjoy for yourself, you would be kind of silly not to get it and try it at least once.",

Lives that serve no function when you can save and load at anytime, tank movement, three weapons, the one odd secret wall panels you have to find with no clues in a gigantic maze of similar looking wall. I understand they were breaking new ground in 1992 but it's just not worth more than a causal play. Still can't believe it's not technically a 3D game",
