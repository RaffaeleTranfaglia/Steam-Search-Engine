            "review_text": "I took this game after i read some players which are not recommend it, and frankly, it is one of the best time killer games i ever play( First is Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Series, then Agarest Series ).  Gameplay 4/5 ( I`m using KEYBOARD, not gamepad )  While I think it is fantastic, why I give it 4 points about gameplay? Well, I have to say that character usually mix in the zombie, and that will contribute to a deadly wrong control :( It cannot be improve by a shiny mark 'player 1' on the character head unless the producer try to make a new update.  Graphic 5/5 ( Pixel Style )  It much depends on thinking. I like is style probably because i have played Hyperdimension Neptunia Before XD  Background Music 4/5 ( Push you into 100% fever )  Definitely, BGM is wonderful. Full screen enemies with Passion music, like you eat french fries with tomato sauce. But i think i can`t give 5 point. Why? Huhhhh.....The point which BGM repeat is bad, and i think the producer should be more careful about this situation. Fix it PLZ :)  Difficulty 2/5 ( Not friendly to Greenhand )  Well, there are some important things you need to know before read my review. I`m a Touhou 2D Shooter ( Looks like Raiden Series but more difficult ) and Touhou FTG game player. Which means i can live with it`s difficult easily. But most of the players are not good at play a game which is hard at the beginning. In another words, no tutorial, no difficult selection, 1 life, and the game is over. Although i`m good at 2D shooter, defeat 5 stages with 1 life is a hard work. So if you`re not good at 2D shooter, do not try it &gt;:(  Recommend play time each time: 1h~1.5h  The biggest problem about this game is that it doesn`t have enough modes to dig out it`s potential development. 2~4 players co-op mode, Versus mode ( try to survive longer than your enemy ), Overlord Mode ( 5 players, 4 survivors, 1 zombie commander/boss. Survivor needs to transport their goods and defeat commander, Zombie needs to stop them ), L4D Mode etc.   In short, it is a great game and i really recommand you to take it~",

            "review_text": "Very very repetitive game grinding in order to advance to the next stage. Not sure if this would be easier with a local co-op friend helping, but it would take atleast a few hours before you have a decently leveled character to start advancing to the next stage. Buying items for each stage is absolutely not recommended until you have fully upgraded every character as the items do disappear if you get a game over. It took me about 15 retries of stage one before I got a character strong enough to move onto stage 2, in which I would need to grind some more to unlock better upgrades. For achievement hunters, the grind will be the most monotonous task in getting all the achievements since it requires each character to be at maxed level. Rating the game 4.8/10 since it seems that using a controller better than using the keyboard and mouse (tried both), and the grind is just too repetitive to enjoy the game.",

It obviously does and after playing the first wave or two in survival just to get a bit more gold for pretty much the whole 40 minutes I played, I was bored.  The graphics just seem kind of ugly to me to be honest. They seem sort of uglier than what the trailer shows or maybe they just have something really off about them. Who knows. The music is annoying to. I had to mute it.  I can see some people liking this game but I think there's plenty of better twin sticks out there, for less than the $4 Autumn Sale price, and definitely the $8 regular price.",
