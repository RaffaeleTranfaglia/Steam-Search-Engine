            "review_text": "I really liked Faces of War. If you enjoy WW2 real time strategies or other war RTS games, you will like this one. There are three campaigns and each one has about 8 missions. The missions are challenging, fun, and can often take a few hours to complete. It took me over 40 hours to complete the game. It could probably be beaten quicker. However, I like to take my time. I also got killed quite a few times and had to reload. Of course I saved often throughout missions. One of the other things I liked was that although the game was challenging, it wasn't so hard that I would get stuck on missions. There were a few missions that seemed impossible but I somehow got through them. The game pace is good. If you are new to these games, play through the tutorials at least twice. There are some things such as calling an ally. I got about halfway through and forgot how to do that. Calling an ally is helpful and I wish I would have done it sooner. Also, some vehicles might not move, even though they are not damaged. Check the gas. The tutorial explains how to fill up a tank or other vehicle. Trust me, having vehicles, especially armored ones, makes life much easier. The bottom line for me is that if you like RTS games, get this one. I picked it up in a bundle with Men of War and had never heard of it prior to playing. I'm glad I did. Honestly, I would gladly pay the $4.99 for this game.",

            "review_text": "Great game, but there are a few big problems. Firstly, vehicles have a tendency to become unresponsive. They'll be totally fine in terms of health, and yet not be able to move. Extremely annoying. Sometimes troops become unresponsive too (my flammenwerfer was standing waiting to be shot last mission). You can't capture all vehicles which is disappointing if you've eliminated the enemy and want to go for a drive. Basically it's very fun but there are some annoying things. And you have to exit by hitting ESC at the menu. If you use their exit game button, you will try and get back into it and Steam will say, 'sorry, it's already running'.",

            "review_text": "3 Factions: Allies, Germany and Soviet Union. A total of 24 missions. You control soldiers with a limited inventory, the soldiers can take items and weapons from the dead or boxes in the field and can ride vehicles. You can take direct control of soldiers and vehicles and convert this in some kind of TPS. This will be particularly fun in the case of tanks and snipers.  The number of soldiers for your mission is limited so don't count with limitless reinforcements as in other games.  An excellent game at a very low price, buy it if you like MoW. I strongly reccomend you to play Men of War 1 before this, you can find Faces of War too frustrating if you dont have previous experience en MoW.",
