            "review_text": "So many people have compared this game to the Total War games (of which I own all and have spent a fair chunk of my life playing ) but that is rather unfair.People realise that Mount and Blade Warband Viking Conquest is a different game than Attilia, Kingdoms or Barbarian Invasion and so is Real Warfare 1242 diferent than Med2. They are very different games.I acknowledge the game may not exist if Med.2 didn't but it's still an interesting period of history and a quite complex old game to play well in it's own right.To be sure it is rather like playing in a leaking diving mask in some battles,it is a bit blurred.Fog I believe it represents and that is pretty usual up the Baltic Sometimes the view looks quite wonderful and the terrain lends itself splendidly for attack or defence and there are plenty of various, well modelled, historically correct troops to choose from. The game functions fine,load ups are a bit slow ,the music is a bit strange maybe I'm being picky but some of it sounds like a prolonged burp, battlesounds are excellent, controls of which there are far more than a certain other game and they are very good and give you tons of options for your troops.Been no glitches or crashes it runs well on Windows 7.Ok If I was only allowed to play this or Med 2 for the rest of my life of course I would choose Med. 2.But none the less Real Warfare 1242 is a pretty damned good wargame especially if you like the Medieval period ..It's a buck forty seven in my country now so its got to be cheap in yours also and definetly worth giving it a try at that price.You might be pleasantly surprised...",
