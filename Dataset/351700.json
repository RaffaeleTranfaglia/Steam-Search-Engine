            "review_text": "I was woefully ignorant of this game for many years, which is sad, because this is THE game I always imagined being able to play one day.  This is a game with such depth that it could only be an 'indie' game. 3D rendering, fancy production, developer time-tables... all of that Big Name Developer stuff would make creating a game like this completely impossible.  UnReal World is a procedurally generated (yet large and persistent) world, inhabited by incredible A.I. There are numerous tasks always available for you to do, and the objective is simply to survive. But almost inevitably: you won't.  Your character struggles mostly against nature (and the occasional bandit or warrior). The weather, the ice, the BEARS. Go fishing, go hunting, go trading. Make tools and weapons and traps. Whatever you think you could do in an Iron-Age Scandinavian forest, you can do it in this game, with astonishing attention to detail and realism.  The animal A.I. is amazing. Wolves split and converge over long-distances with their packs, howling for communication. Kill the biggest reindeer in a pack (the leader) and the other reindeer will become aimless until they're picked off by other prey.   Combat, while not action-based, has a cold realism to it unlike anything I've seen. Your life isn't measured in 'Hit points'... Rather your body, your limbs, your blood, your senses: they can all be attacked and taken away from you -- or you can take them away from your enemy. One hit in the right spot will debilitate you. Game over. But its a death that will make you smile. Dying is a part of nature, and a part of this game. Fight against it, but realize that its what makes your character's adventure... complete.  Hunting in this game is a challenge and never a guaranteed success. You, the player, as a person, need to learn the value of patience and deligence. But when you finally manage to track down your first elk or stag through vast reaches of forest, until at last the animal is too fatigued to run anymore... there is NO 'kill' in a videogame I've found as satisfying as this. Yesterday I got really lucky, and chased a panicked reindeer that injured itself trying to scale down a cliff -- but when I finally caught up to it, a wolf had half-eaten its corpse, ruining the precious fur and making off with some of the meat.  Smoke/Dry the meat, tan the skin, feed your dog, and donate a cut of meat to the 'gods' for letting you live another day. Work on building your cabin, or preparing the cold soil for future agriculture. There is so much to do, and it is all vital, well-designed, brilliant. This is a brilliant one-of-a-kind game that throws you into a real world like no other game I've ever played. There is no game I would more enthusiastically urge people to try. I am so happy this game has come to Steam, thus coming to my attention, and I have never been more happy to give a developer my money (thank you, Sami). Try this game.",

This is without doubt the most in depth survival simulator there is. If you want a game that really makes you fight to stay alive then this is the one you're looking for. Starvation is a very real threat, along with temperature. On top of the survival aspects, there are also hostile npcs who will easily kill you unless you get hold of some good equipment. The game uses text to describe what is happening, and does so very very well, combat is espescially savage, with the wounds inflicted described in immense detail. The only game I can think of that compares to UnReal World in terms of depth and replayability is NetHack.   Truthfully an excellent game and well worth the price.",

Then several years ago, in a nastalgic period, I came across this game again. The dungeon themes were replaced with a more historic and reality based theme, It was far more fun than I remembered it being. Either something else came along or the dogs continuous barking made me stop playing again.  When the game released v3.19, my now grown son said 'Hey I found this game that you're gonna love'. I laughed when he told me, he had childhood memories of it. Since Sami offers it up for free, I'll give it a go again.  The dedication, helpfullness and great nature of the developer(s) of this game show not only in this new gem but in the community that rallies to support it.   As for me, I became a lifetime supporter of this game within weeks of downloading v3.19 and try to send in a little something extra when I can. I hope steam allows many people to appreciate how compex, exciting and addicting this game is NOW!",

            "review_text": "I found UnReal world a few years ago while browsing Home of the Underdogs, a website highlighting all but totally overlooked games. I saw this gem there and read the discription about how it was an Iron Age Simulation of Finnland. I thought to myself, 'Okay I love survival simulation games, and it seems to be rougelike which I also enjoy, and the reviews say it's pretty hard and complex, let's give it a go!'  First, the controls take some getting used to. Also if graphics are a deal breaker for you then don't bother. I however find the elegant simplicity of the game charming and it allows for the imagination to really immerse yourself in the world the developers are trying to create.  The developers are both amazingly awesome individuals and I highly recommend checking out their webiste and blog.  I'll share with you my first experience of this game.   ~~~  After making some javelines, getting a basecamps set up and being largely unsuccesful at gaining much food I found myself slowly starving to death with very poor nutrition. I had tried climbing up nearby trees to see if I could spot game anywhere near my vicenity with largly no luck, and then I slipped on one of the branches and banged my head. It wasn't life threatening but it shook me up enough to not try climbing again, as wounds take a fairly realistic number of in game days to heal.  Suddenly while walking back to my camp as the sun was setting, I spy a caraboo herd. Not only that it looks like they were looking for a place to bed down for the night!  Perfect! I can just follow them, and then sneak in close and try to kill one of the caraboo before I die myself!  As they lay sleeping I edged closer, javilen in hand with a tip hardened by the fire I created with the local spruce trees. My target in sight I steady my javilin.  Throw and a hit! The whole herd wakes up! It's chaos! The caraboo I hit was only injured in it's hind leg but it was bleeding so by following the blood and it's tracks it was fairly easy to keep up! It looks like I was saved!  Hours pass and it's now night. The caraboo stopped bleeding and I can only hope that the tracks that I'm currently following belong to the caraboo that I did indeed injure.  One full day passes and into the night again. I make a stop by a stream for water and try to hit a nearby squirrel with my javilen in a tree. I miss and it taunts me, jeering and chittering at me as my head throbs and my stomach grows ever more empty while I retreive my javilen from its resting place in a tree trunk.  I continue following the trail one more full day. My health is low and I can barely keep the tracks focused. Suddenly I hear a grunt of a caraboo.  This is it! I'll finally get that animal! I start to sneak. I creep closer, and closer, I see the animal and it's injured. It's the same one! The gods smile on me!  One, step. Two step, three step. TWIGSNAP!  The caraboo's head jerks up! I hold my breath hoping it doesn't see me.  Two heartbeats pass and the caraboo bolts! I must have been upwind!  My heart sinks.  My javilen loose in my hand as I stare at the ground where I'm likely to die. This place isn't so bad. It's got a nice breeze, fir trees, a stream...  Wait a minute... it's got a stream!  I take off running in the direction the caraboo bolted!  Sqeezing past ancient firs and by long forgotten boulders I run! My last ounces of strength leaving me with each step!  I'm able to catch up with the caraboo as it's calmed down and then run at it full speed with the wind at my back!  I may not be faster than this animal. But I'm smarter. I am a human. I'm one of the people.  Expectedly the caraboo bolts! It's more tired than me and injured worse.  My plan is working. It's headed straight for the stream!  Once it gets to the banks of the water it dives in trying to evade it's persuer. I walk up to the bank as the fatigued animal vainly tries to splash around in the water using the last of it's energy. I then take my aim gripping my javilen with all my might and throw aiming for the neck of the magestic beast!  A hit! Hot blood pours into the water around the caraboo. It staggers back onto shore, falters, and falls. It's breathing labored I stand over it.   This animal who is no different than me, whom I have tracked for three days lies at my feet. The same place I would be had I not caught it. There is no good or evil here.   There is just life.  Later after a fire is made, roasted caraboo in my belly, and a hide tanning on a nearby fallen log. I pack the remaining several dozen pounds of roasted meat into my pack. There was a village not a few days from here that would be willing to trade some useful supplies for this meat. There my journey will continue. For I am one of the people. ",

The dev is passionate about the game and keeps things transparent as possible. It is a one of a kind game.  A tiny bit of advice from this player, is that you should NEVER give up, not matter how hopeless! So you've been ravaged by a bear you were hunting, you're starving, it's the middle of winter and you're getting frosbite all over. You collapse, and continue crawling on, for your hunger and wounds make you weak and slow. Suddenly as if the Gods have spared your life, you come across a village, the village houses you and gives you food. You slowly recover, track down that bear that savaged you and seek your revenge. If you can make it passed Winter the first time you play, I will take my hat off to you.  A very nice game, that I've owned since before steam. A++ 10/10 would recommend again.",

Engage in robbery, get brutally robbed by roaming gangs. Buy a cow to carry your equipment, smoke the meat when it dies. Start keeping hunting dogs to chase your game to exhaustion - or keep them leashed only to unleash them on unsuspecting robbers.   In the east, an even greater challenge - masses of hostile tribesmen, well-equipped red-shirted steppe folks seeking to enslave anyone they capture. Sneak onto their encampments in the dead of winter, silent as death. Skin them, and wear their hides as clothing.   But perhaps, start with not starving. I'm getting ahead of myself.",

            "review_text": "This is a one of the best all time survival, hunting, fishing, building, fighting, exploring, bartering, crafting, pretty much everything sims. Don't let the hours here fool you, I've put hundreds (maybe thousands) of hours into this game long before it got onto Steam. The game is fantastically replayable, which is good as you will be replaying it a lot when your characters die, over and over.   I would not describe the game as brutal, since there are some starting scenarios that actually set you up quite well if you just want to get to a point where you're stable and can focus on building a house, crafting, and trading. But the game IS unforgiving. No matter how well equipped you are, you'll need to think twice about taking on a Njerpez warrior (even alone) or going after that bear you see across the marsh. One missed swing or shot by you and one solid hit from your opponent (especially if that opponent is a bear) can end you all at once. Or maybe just give you a little scratch that you can tend to while you're sorting through loot or tanning a bear hide to make yourself a nice winter coat. That unpredictability that faces all violent interactions within the game can put some players off, but is a huge draw to others like myself. And if you're looking at a game like this, you're probably one of those kinda of players anyway!  While the game has tons of content and an absolutely enormous, randomly generated world to play in, the one downside is that it suffers from something of a 'late game' drag. I hate late game in the context of Unreal World since you can play for as long as you can keep your character alive, but when you've survived one full year and you're comfortable enough to sit for days on end at your homestead crafting or resting and not have to worry about feeding or clothing yourself, you'll know you've arrived at the 'late game'. However, once better interaction mechanics are implemented with NPC communities (something that is in the pipeline), this period will be vastly improved. In the meantime, what most players seem to do is pick harder scenarios, pack up and move, go on a really long expedition, or start taking on riskier endeavors (such as aforementioned bear hunting and Njerpez fighting. If you're worried your character has become to comfortable, remember there are always 'fun' ways to live on the edge in Unreal World.",

The devs have invested a lot of time and passion in this game and it really shows in the complexity! They also show a great knowledge about outdoors survival. In all fairness, if you are stuck in nature and have some basic crafting skills (like how to make a fire, a basic shelter etc), this game can provide you with a logical what to do list which is awesome.. this is how realistic this game is.  Challenges? Many ones, survive the first winter, survive for 3 years, protect the villages from Njerpezit warriors, become a shaman, make a big house, get some crops going just to name a few. A real challenge would be to survive the so called impossible custom starts (pick the culture that has the least points in attributes like Koivulainen, get your skills to a bare minimum and pump others like weatherlore and daggers, start in winter with the hurt and afraid scenario, no trading allowed with villagers). Quests are incoming as well so that is another big thing to do. What else can i say..   By buying this game you not only support the indie developers behind it but also the artists (check out some of their videos) and the teachers. Some variants are up on the developers site to download and play (and test) for free, so don't believe me. Try for yourself!  Godspeed on your journeys!",

You can do almost anything in the game that you want and the sheer size of the simulation and procedural generation is crazy. Every map is full randomly generated, although certain factions will always inhabit particular areas as that is part of the game's history. (Thereis a full in-game encyclopedia to tell you about just about everything, from were each of the 9 dominant tribes live, how they live, and what tools and skills the use in their daily life) The creators have updated the game for a very very long time and are consistent, I remember stumbling on this accidentally like 10 years ago on their webpage and thought it was awesome. They mix in real pictures to simulate many of the events in the game and locations and if you look past the basic spriting, its a game that shines. The soundtrack is great and the theme song is played on a Kantele, which is apparently a finnish instrument. They use a lot of their heritage in the game as it is based in the real world with mythological stuff thrown on top (but mostly in the form of rituals). You can hunt, fish, trade, fight, build, go bear grylls in Iron Age Finland, basically whatever you choose. Although it is not a super easy game in the beginning, it is rewarding once you figure out the controls and your basics. There are guides available online too that make it easier to start, or just figure it out by trial and error and look through your list of ancestors. It's not that expensive and you'll get more time out of it than AAA titles, except maybe Witcher 3, because damn that is a good, solid game. But this is cheaper, so get this.",

Replay value Great Devs, -if you're not a evil or disrespectful person to them  (CONS) No cons, really but here's things people might say by * *Controls *Graphics *Just how game is looked at by other people *Too hard  (Final Thought) It's a truly a great game and I hope the devs of this game will keep this game great as always, and keep it a great place in my heart.

I further did research online, and though the developer doesn't have a FB or Twitter account I was able to pull up very high reviews of this game and fans hashtags on twitter. I own and play games like Radiation Island, SurvivalCraft (over Minecraft), KoDP and few other survival/RPG type games, so I had to check this out.   To cut right to the chase this URW is awesome!   For this game to be 20 something y/o and still going strong with devouted fans and newbies (like myself) is amazing! After purchase, I actually didn't start playing till maybe 5 days later for I was reading up on the URW wiki on my tablet due to work and being on the go. But when downtime came I loaded it up and must say at first the whole key command took a little getting use to but afterwhile I slowly got the hang of it. Whenever I was in doubt, I would always refer to wiki via my tablet to free up space on my monitor, or hit (SHIFT + ?) for the layout of the key commands. I'm playing on a Mac so I think the key layout might be a just a little different from PC, but no big deal. Still have a ways to go by getting full grasp of this game, but overall I love it and have no regrets spending $ for I didn't know the game was free till after purchase. Plus I love to support game developers who create games and take there work seriously.   In closing I just want to say when URW came out as well as other favorite gems (KoDP, Avernum/Avadon), computers weren't affordable as they are now so I missed out. But now with companies submitting games to Steam as well as porting games to Tablets, it's a privellage to get a chance to play those games that I may have missed out on.

But there are some minor things that is just bad game design and it takes away a bit of enjoyment from the game.   For example tracking. Normally when you walk through the woods you notice tracks of animals here and there. Some pine cones eaten by a bird, or a squirrel, or a mouse. Some droppings of a hare, or a fox. Now and then some tracks. Even an idiot can clearly see these signs of animals moving about a forest, even though an idiot may not recognize what animal left that tracks. In this game, I'm playing a max intelligence character with 40% tracking skill and after walking over half the map he didn't spot a single track anywhere. What's more, walking through the woods is not enough, I have to activate a skill EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Come on. It's just tedious and not the least bit of fun. Just make it a toggle to track, which means pay more attention to the ground, and let movement cost slightly more or something.   The crafting interface is also a bit clunky. I have a pile of timber and planks and twigs on the ground, but if it's not in my inventory I can't build anything, and I can't pick it up because I'm not strong enough. Like, wait, that's not how you build a house... Builders don't carry EVERYTHING THEY NEED for the house, they just go get one plank at a time. If it's in the adjacent squares, that should be enough.  And so on. But it is an enjoyable game. Just a bit surprising that it was developed for decades and still simple things to fix like what I mentioned are still in the game.",

However, there are a lot of things that can still kill you - bands of robbers, bears, wolf packs, hunger ( food spoils rather fast after you've roasted it, unless you smoke/salt/dry it)  I had metal armor and I still got hacked to pieces by Njerpez",

U understand that you are not fighting machine and that you can not defeat bear with your bare fists nor you can easily sneak up on elk ? U like challenge, and 'base building' from survival games ? U dont need 3D or VR or any kind of new fancy graphics ?  If yes, GET THIS GAME !  I played this game back day when it was hard to find it, below radar, when it got out. I really enjoyed it than, and enjoyed it even more now, as new fatures have been added!  So my 73.5h are on steam only. I had zillion more hours playing it before year 2000 ...  One of those gems that never gets borring !",

Unfortunately the low resolution made it visually unappealing, and the UI and keyboard commands were nonintuitive and dated. If you havent played NEO Scavenger, I highly recommend it. It's harsh, survivalism, turn based, and has a much better UI.",

Of over 650 games in my steam library this is one of maybe 20 that has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment. I have been into survival games since long before they became popular and in my experience this is one of the most challenging and in depth survival games available. As an old school gamer that grew up in the age of Atari, Commodore 64, and IBM dos boxes, the graphics and UI of this game makes me nostalgic for a simpler time when games had substance or story, not just flash or a gimmick.
