            "review_text": "(First review, sorry!)  This is a racing sim, probably one of the best free-to-play racing sims. I've played this for almost an hour, and for most of it, I couldn't figure out the controls. I've pressed every button my keyboard, testing things out, and couldn't get my car to actually start. The control panel had what seemed like MILLIONS of controls, and would be very hard to remember them all, especially if you don't play often. I've fixed my controls though, and finally started to drive.  I turned off gasoline useage, tire ware, etc. so I could get used to the driving. Even with the fixed controls, the car was still very hard to control, and since some of the maps have a lot of twists and turns, I crashed often, or slowed down, and the AIs caught up, thus me ending up in 10th place in 10 minutes, even with a map I chose with only a couple of turns. Everytime I got back onto the track after crashing into the walls, I'd sometimes get hit with a passing AI, ending in me crashing AGAIN. Sometimes this cycle would repeat 2 or 3 times. Other than that, I had a lot of fun racing, and hope to soon get better as I play more.  Pros: - Graphics are decent - Sound is awesome (in my opinion at least) - Beautiful car details - Free to play - Runs on slow computers - Perfect game for if you don't have a lot of money - No lag - Replays are cool  Cons - Hard to drive - Music is annoying - No tutorials - Controls are like wow  Overall, I will give this a game a 6/10 and I recommended you give it a try if you like racing games.

More importantly, this game allows you to map your inputs freely, like any game that respects the player does.   also, there is none of this modern 'steering dampening' nonsense where your gamepad is supposed to feel like a wheel that only turns slowly.  No, this game respects you and your inputs. it doesn't mess with your steering curvature.  and the in game wheels are moving in sync with your controller and as fast as you can move the controller. I wish every racing game controlled like this.",

Or that inner voice that says 'yees!' when we finally arrive at the depot and park up our Flexi-Bus for the day OMSI 2– its late, the sun has set, both outside our windows (if we care to look!) and within the Sim… but we don’t care.. We’ve driven with diligence and skill, we’ve hit n hurt no one and managed to pick up and drop off everyone without a hitch… that’s what matters.. That’s why we play these Simulators –  That’s what Sims do for us! - They fulfil our innermost desire to be a part of something that we admire, to take control of the very vehicles that we venerate and are in awe of – Hours of our lives are spent recreating the paths taken by Road, Rail, Air and Sea in order that we may share the experience in some intangible way of that of the Driver, Pilot, Captain, Fireman, Soldier and Doctor? within us all – all this achieved speedily at the flick of a mouse button and without the arduous years of universities, specialist training and professional advice and preparation, we will not suffer any loss of limb if we make mistakes as we learn the art of take-off and landing, nor will we face litigation and inevitable imprisonment from the families of the loved ones that we lost at sea due to our lack of experience of sailing cruise ships, or even suffer from docked wages from South West Trains for continued late arrivals at London Victoria… Friends our desire and task is a simple one … to Simulate through our chosen modes … without the Wind, Rain, Ice, Snow or Insurance Costs ever affecting or view of our chosen destination -  To Dream the Impossible is what drives the human spirit – But to deny someone of that dream is to deny them of the very lust for life ….. So keep dreaming keep ‘Simming’ and whether it’s by Air, Sea or Land may your journeys be filled with fun, passion and excitement –  Sim on! n Smile as you go!",

So first i amjust using settings where the wheel does the gear changes and i do the braking and slowly i am getting the hang of it.On the game itself the graphics are not it's strong suit but as a person who was 18 when pong was released i have seen very low graphics over the years and one thing i have learned the best graphics don't always make a good game.My only complaint for me is when i first played i got motion sickness due to the bouncy car and only being able to look through the windscreen then i got in to the settings and that solved that problem.Are there better looking games out there of course there is but for what you are getting for FREE i think this game is ace.",
