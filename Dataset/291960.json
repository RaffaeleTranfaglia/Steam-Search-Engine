            "review_text": "I've got about 4hrs of this game under my belt at the time of writing. Why I'm I telling you this is because its my first impressions of Elminage Gothic (EG) I'm not a big RPG gamer with the exception of FF titiles and Dragon Quest. If you're thinking of buying this due to the 1st person RPG style from a yesteryear I can't think this will disappoint many. I rather have been enjoying EG however a few niggles which seem to stand out! It doesn't explain very much. This can be a + or - depending on preference. The biggest wall you will hit is getting lost and a party wipeout due to how the game has consumable maps!? Thats right single use maps, run out and its hit and miss if you'll see light again. Once this is understood and you buy lots of magic maps and remember to manage items and know when to head back its not bad. Although I could see this putting more casual gamers off. Overall this has the ability to become a favourite of mine.",

I've not even made it far into the 3rd level of the 1st dungeon and have been at it for a while, gotten annihilated, and save scummed (forget fairness). There are a lot of different mechanics involved in the game and I am still learning what some stuff does. This game will last you for a very long time. Good luck and god speed.",

            "review_text": "==&gt; Evaluation based on few hours of play. I'll modify it when I'll be more experienced &lt;== Thx to all who gave me tips to play better Elminage.   Elminage Gothic isn't bad game but its far to be good game.   + Nice looking graphics : artwork is fine even if sprite suffer of lack of good animations + Nice musics + Easy battle system + Ex skills system : you can choose 1 on creation (some very helpful or exclusive) + Nice alchemy system : if you create alchemist, you'll be able to transform ores in AP (Alchemy Points) to modify item to avoid gender restriction, add protections or elemental effects... + Moddind allowed : its possible to modify files in game directory to create your own Elminage with rules modification (you need software to unpack/repack Elminage files) + Alignement change : there is a way to set at opposite alignement Good &amp; Evil   - Bad menus system : UI suck. You have to find how &amp; when to save, too many sub-menus (its possible to create better UI that require less surfing with more efficiency. No drag &amp; drop system when managing items.. - Random bonus system at character creation never allow easily to choose your class (Ninja, Lord, are very difficult to create at start because class require too much bonus points to create). - HP/SP recovery sucking system : even if you can camp, i never found resting option button to recover all HP/SP from team. That mean long travel to dungeons-&gt;cities to rest in inn. - Too few portraits by class - Some Ex Skills are exclusive : Sacrifice exist only for cleric pre-generated character level 4, you can't create more characters with such exclusive skills. - Steam version seem to be port from PSP version, controversial version because Elminage Gothic is sequel from previous one Elminage that was better for fan to play in many ways (more classes, more advantages for some classes, more options to play...). - Classes problem : less classes to play than previous Elminage, some like Lord are weakness in protection now. Changing classes must be done as soon as stats match because only some spells can be passed to next class, all others will vanish (Ex Skills, stats above class requirement, class skills) - Level up system : you can't level up outside inn. I guess you need to rest to level up Grrrr.   Elminage isn't bad game but if you already played previous version you'll be disapointed because new rules/options not better. In all case you need to balance your team to kill hard (i think its better to kill hard &amp; fast (aoe) than to be better in protections only).  You can buy Elminage Gothic but i don't recommend until game will allow me to rest anytime in dungeons. Elminage Gothic concept ruins my experience to play for these reason. When you start level 1 team you NEED to rest.  By luck, with community modding, Elminage Gothic can become great game or for those who master how to modify rules.",

            "review_text": "Wow! What a game we have here. If you are a fan of challenging, punishing, brutal games like Dark Souls, and enjoy dungeon-crawling through beautiful dungeons with lots of interesting encounters, gorgeous artwork and enemies to encounter, and much, much more, then you simply have to check this game out!  You create a party of 6 adventurers from a variety of classes, races and stats, and head out into the world to explore why monsters have returned from a nearby cave. Well, things start to spiral down from there, and you're dragged into an epic adventure, however, the main draw here is the immersive, first-person dungeon-crawling.  You will be crawling through all sorts of crazy locations, from maze-like labyrinths, to dungeons with hidden traps around every corner. To find some of the secret locations in the game, you really have to search, and the game does NOT hold your hand for one minute!  If you love challenging games and want to endure the gauntlet while having a grand adventure in this party-based RPG, just buy the game now. For $9.99 it's an absolute steal since it features over 80+ hours of dungeon-crawling gameplay! And it never gets old because you are never quite sure what's around the next corner, and when you will get brutally murdered next! =)  Try this game now if you're into dungeon-crawling, old-school RPGs. You will not regret it.   10/10!",

            "review_text": "This game will take you back to the era of WIZARDRY and old Forgotten Tales games, where you move around a dungeon in 1st person view. The game also appears to be quite challenging as i have been killed on many monsters even in the 1st dungeon. There is some strategy with this game to play it correctly too, like having the correct classes in your party. The different races is also refreshing too, and not just the default human, dwarf, elf, etc D@D old style classes. They also have dragon newt and wereperson race, which is refreshing..even a fairy class. Quite fun and time consuming game, with lots of rpg classic aspects makes this game quite fun!",

            "review_text": "4/5 Seriously... am I playing Wizardry?  Elminage is in every way a full on Wizardry clone. EVERYTHING is the same except the maps. Even the artwork looks like it was taken from the Wizardy: Proving Grounds booklet from the late 80s.  Just because it is a clone game doesn't mean you should pass Elminage by. If you are into RPGs, you will have a blast with this game.   If you'r not familiar with Wizardry, I'll explain. Wizardy was one of the first RPGs to revolutionize the videogame industry. Many of the RPGs that were produced for the NES, were inspired by the Wizardy games. The game starts by forming a party of 6 characters. You can browse a few places in town such as the Inn and Shop; but most of the game takes place inside an underground maze. The maze gets harder as you descend, forcing you to make frequent trips to the surface to heal and level up. The character creation is very in-depth and mimics D&amp;D rules some-what. Lots of dungoen mapping and slaying :)",

This is an inferior port of the original PSP version which lacks basic functionality such as custom portraits, item icons, the game is riddled with poor and lazy translation, and is basically proof that Ghostlight fails to do the most basic of research into a game or its made references.  Though it runs smooth as silk, you'd be better off playing the PSP version if you have decent command of the Japanese language, and even then the game is simple enough to figure out. Ghostlight will not see another penny from me until they learn how to properly utilize the resources they are given.  Wasted potential.",
