One small island. Glitchy movement where invisible floor levels will suddenly raise you up or drop you down. One girl is standing specifically in one of these places so you're floating above her. The girls always stare at your forehead - its unsettling. Not as unsettling as when you stand behind them and you can actually see the neck mesh twist 180 degrees while the character model stays perfectly still. Or how every one of them remains completely static apart from the neck/head moving backwards (usually through scenery or furniture) to get away from you.   TL:DR - its cheap, but i would be highly critical even if this was free. Its not even a tech demo - its a glitchy mess. Avoid as if its digital-syphillis. Because it is.",
