            "review_text": "Hospital Manager is a nice little game, but it has a few faults. There's no time set between really fast, fast and paused. I would have liked to see a slidy time control thingy. Also it feels a little hysterical with pop-up notifications every few seconds. Lastly, I felt it lacked any logical way of keeping the patients happy. I had to surround them with pretty things and vending machines, so much so that they could hardly move, and they were still unhappy, no matter how fast they were being seen by the doctors. All in all, if the game would slow down and let the player take control, it would probably gain the legendary status of Theme Hospital somewhat. Good effort, thoough. Hopefully the developers will keep working on this. For what it's worth, I managed to spend a whole 3 hours with this",

Yeah It maybe dumb. but any game dev can tell you that you want to advoid ♥♥♥♥ like this most of all. This should not be a problem because any real teasting from gamers would point this out.",

            "review_text": "*Note: I only played the tutorial levels and the first three missions and my experience of this game is therefore limited.   What is Hospital Manager?  Hospital Manager is about running your own hospital. The game is divided in a number of levels where you build rooms and hire staff to treat the patients that come to you with their ailments. You cure the patients by first diagnosing and subsequently treating them. Both actions reward you with money to improve the hospital and reputation. You can improve the hospital by upgrading the staff, (re)decorating the hallways to keep the waiting patients happy or by spending money on research. A certain amount of reputation is needed to complete the level. You gain reputation by diagnosing and curing patients and lose reputation when patients walk out on you.   Why I do not recommend this game  Let me start of by writing about what I like first. I do like the way the game does not take itself seriously, opting for a comical take on the hospital simulator. This ranges from the over the top injuries the patients have to the proposed treatments and the vibrant colours used, as wel as the notion that no matter how bad the injury may be, enough benches, flower pots and clowns on site will keep the patients happy. I personally like this kind of humour.  This, however, leaves a lot to dislike for me. For starters, The layout of the hospital is predetermined and you cannot choose the size and content of the rooms you build and can only build in predetermined spots, severely limiting player creativity. After the room has been built you need to pick a staff member. They have three attributes (speed of treatment, profit per patient and number of patients helped before the doctor needs a break), but some staff are twice or even three times as good as others, whilst costing less in wages. During gameplay you get frequent (and I mean frequent) popups with tips or pointers, but they take up a rather large portion of the screen and hinder gameplay when you are zoomed in. There is no way of disabling the popups. Also worth mentioning is that this is a mobile port and it clearly shows. Aside from the removal of the microtransactions the game is identical to the mobile version. This means that all the busywork in the form of tapping is still in place, therefore each level forces the player to constantly click on vending machines, staff and patients.  I would also like to draw your attention to the inaccuracies written down in the 'Key Features' on the Store Page. For instance, this game has no  'comprehensive management'  in any way, shape or form. Just build rooms, hire staff, decorate the halls and keep the research going, whilst doing your busywork and closing the popups. And their claim that this is a  'nonlinear adventure'  just boils down to cause and effect: If you choose to, let's say, hire a clown in January he starts working in January. If you however hire the clown a month later he starts working in February. Seriously? This is worth mentioning as a Key Feature?   Conclusion  All in all, this game is not good. It is a mobile port with shallow gameplay, almost no management whatsoever and severely limiting player creativity, with a nonsensical Store Page to boot. Not recommended.",
