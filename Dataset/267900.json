The soundtrack is one of the best Ishiwatari has ever done.   Otherwise it's a pretty forgettable entry in the GG series, but still worth it for those three things alone.",

If it weren't for that this game would be a silly curio and not an idea gone awfully wrong.  Boost mode is okay I guess.  But the only good things this game did was introduce A.B.A and have Colour Edit.",

I mean what game designer would come up with this game mechanic style it's crazy.    4) Also there no multiplayer online only locals.",

No! its the 4 player free for all with a very confusing button layout. (why is the start button the right thumbpad for instance)  Wish I would have read the reviews and digged deeper. Oops. I hope GG-X (which is what I really wanted) comes to Steam. I also hope whoever did the port does a better job.",

I tried everything, even what the GGI Ark System recomended as well as fixes form the Forums in Steam to no avail. I liked this game when I played it on console, and really wanted it to work. But seeing as I could only use one attack and had no ability to walk in any direction except right, it made it IMPOSSIBLE to get into.  Shortly after my attempts to fix this game failed, I simply had to get rid of it.  Also, no resoloution options at all.  This is a very very bad port.",
