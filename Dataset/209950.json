            "review_text": "Triple Town is a devilishly addictive puzzle game, masquerading as a town builder. Players place objects like grass, bushes and trees in a 6x6 grid. When three of the same object touch, they merge into a single new 'leveled up' structure, earning players more points and freeing up valuable real estate. Three trees become a house, three houses an estate, three estates a mansion, and so-on.The better a player plans, the longer their round will last. Play it right and you'll perfectly line up three mansions &amp; wrack up big points. But one mistake can lead to churches, houses and other structures littered around the field, making it tough to progress.Triple Town is perfectly tuned – any time things are beginning to look too dire a wild card crystal or object-deleting robot comes up, allowing the round to continue.Triple Town's core matching gameplay is extremely addictive, but the package itself is brought down by its lack of depth and options.Triple Town would be better off if it were sold like a standard puzzle game and included a few more options. However, if you are a casual gamer, looking for something easy to play when idle, which doesn't require fast reflexes or a lot of thought, this is a game you should try.",

            "review_text": "Cutesy art, simple mechanics, and its origins as a mobile title will lull people into thinking this is an easy game. And while it may be easy to play, it is incredibly hard to net high scores in the game.  You have a basic grid on which a randomized series of items are situated, the items you place are randomized. You must link together at least three items of a kind in a vertical or horizontal chain, these chains can zig-zag and connect together a great many items, merging them into the next item up in quality of the same item base. The three base unit types you have are Rocks, Bears, and Plants. These three base units cannot be merged together, this leads to a conflict in placing each item as you must try to set up future placements without any foreknowledge of items to come,  The puzzle element itself is enjoyable and challenging, it will function as an enjoyable time sink if you let it. There is also an external element of resource collection and island build up. This is all to obtain game altering items which can allow you to place whatever you need whenever you need it in a pinch - generally not worth doing until you have a great many of them and are going to attempt a long game.  It is fun, but it is frustrating how you can often end up with a string of items you don't want which will end up killing you.",

The Android/ios platforms do get updates occasionally (as far as i heard) however those updates are not reaching nor will reach the pc version.  This game itself feels like 'something is missing' it always feels a bit empty, and lacks more resolution options for the window (wich on my case is very uncomfortable and small)  But the game is still cute, i like it, is a nice passtime.  If only we could get updates at par with the Android version, it would be more known steamwide and better, even more fun to play, however that will not be happening anytime soon, it's truly sad to hear and know that, but i still like this cute game.  Please give the PC users and players, the chance of getting new content sometime ",

Triple Town's simple and unique gameplay is just as addictive as it was on the mobile or facebook, but even better you get the whole game, The Capital City part makes you want to keep playing so you can keep adding onto it with every completed town.

            "review_text": "Triple Town is a match-three game paired with simplistic city building elements that requires more strategic thinking than games in this genre usually do.  The game is easy to learn and pretty hard to put away. The premise is simple: You start with a somewhat empty board, the 'city', and then receive one component per turn, which you need to place on the board. Three of the same kind result in one piece of the next higher tier. For example, three bunches of grass give you a bush, and three (or more) bushes connected horizontally or vertically give you a tree.  The tricky part is that the resulting item appears in the spot where you put the previous item, and this is where the strategy originates from. Not only do you need to create matches on a small board, you also need to plan ahead so that future pieces fit together and you can upgrade to, say, a castle. Matching the highest tiers will grant you a treasure chest. with random loot.  Depending on the mode you play in (the game offers several with individual rulesets), there will also be bears. Bears wander around the board and turn into tombstones when you trap them. Three tombstones can be matched for a church (which does give you points) and three churches give you a cathedral. Building those is extra hard because the bears move around and trapping them may require you to clutter the board.  To make it easier, you are given a storage spot where you can swap and keep one item, and there are special components such as the bot (that removes any item from the board) and the gem (which works like a joker). There is also a shop where you can purchase items and components with gold that you get by making larger matches. This is strictly in the game, there are no in-app purchases or DLC.  The other element of the game is your permanent capital city where you can place grain fields, military buildings, etc. which yield resources. These, too, can be matched and thus upgraded. If you play well, the game gives you rewards that can be put down in your capital.  Overall, Triple Town is a deeper-than-it-looks match-3 game that gets quite addictive (further made 'worse' by there being achievements!). It's a friendly game that does not get stressful (it's all turn-based). Sadly, while the iOS version got ratings in the 80s and 90s, the identical PC version scored much lower. Different audiences, I guess.  I enjoy it, but I do like match-3 ganes, turn-based strategy and puzzlers. :)",

This can become quite tricky the more items you have on a map since once you run out of space to place objects the level is over. When you upgrade an object you get points for it, naturally the more advanced an upgrade is, the more points you get. You can use those points to upgrade your town, which is the hub from where you access the randomly generated levels. The town's buildings generate items that will help you during the regular levels. The bigger and better your town becomes, the more and better items you will get.  The problem with the game is that there is no goal. No special challenges, nothing to achieve other than endlessly upgrading your town. It's the same thing over and over, and that felt rather pointless to me. You could try to get the best possible upgrade of an object (there is even a Steam achievement for it), but for that you need a lot of special items, and you can only obtain those by upgrading your town and collecting more money. That means you need to grind for dozens, if not hundreds of hours and all you get for it is a Steam achievement.  Imo this would be a decent time killer for mobile platforms, but there are simply far better puzzle games on PC to waste your time with Triple Town.",
