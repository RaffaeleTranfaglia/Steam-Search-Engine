            "review_text": "The last game in the fantastic Prince of Persia trilogy. This time, the game changes radically. Again.   The new gameplay now includes elements of stealth and the ability to do more damage without being seen or heard. Exploration and making progress through climbing, swinging, jumping, sliding and wall-running are still a huge part of the game, which is awesome. They even added some chariot levels. But the biggest change and probably the most important is the appearance of the Prince's alter ego.  The Dark Prince is manifested by an internal voice that speaks to the Prince... at first. The Dark Prince is cold, cruel, arrogant, and sarcastic, and attempts to convince the Prince that they are the same person, and that the Prince should strive to serve only himself, using the Prince's vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions. On many occasions, the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince's body and the Prince is fully transformed into a kind of hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles.   While searching for the Vizier, the Prince encounters Farah, who does not remember him, and is surprised that the Prince knows her name. Despite this, the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together.  Yuri Lowenthal's soothing voice is back. The Prince would not be the same without it. Beautiful monologues scattered through-out the game make it so much more enjoyable. The music is having Persian influences, but is much more epic than Sands of Time. Epic as in a theme of grandeur and heroism. Majestic and impressively great moment that you are experiencing, with lots of well-done cliffhangers. I still like the original more than everything.  Some of the characters are familiar to the player, others are new and provocative. But with no doubt, both look unique and interesting. The Prince changes his appearance several times, as the corruption keeps getting further. And eventually transforming into the Dark Prince. Besides that there are a lot of weapons, secrets, and other hidden items.  The game looks fantastic, as it shows you the very roofs of Babylon and then down into the depths of the city's dry well.   As well as the Warrior Within, this game has a secret ending. The good ending requires a bit more effort, but it's totaly worth it.  Solid gameplay, amazing music and voice-acting, great and intruguing storyline, with lots of plot twists, and nice looks. The last part of this trilogy really mixed all of the best from the previous games. Thus creating an incredible game that feels great.     10/10  ",

            "review_text": "Update: I had an issue when I was unable to slide down the chain with the Prince. This issues can be fixed by enabling V-sync setting form the option menu. After enabling that setting, you ought not have any more problems sliding down the chains.  The visuals show the age of the game but the gaming experince is still good. The dialog is not great and the hero's voice is a bit annoying at times. Overall, I am enjoying the game.  The game is buggy for WIndows 8. I am stuck at a stage where I cannot slide down a chain. Earlier in the game when the character runs along the wall, he just falls; I had to quit the game and start fresh to rectify the problem. The camera angles are terrible but it is tolerable. This game is not playble for me until I have a patch for this game. Be careful downloading old games.",

Classic. &lt;Insert other usless cliche here&gt; This is the pinnacle of the action platformer (My love for this series keeps me from replacing assassin's creed as the pinnacle of action platformers, because really, it's a completely different type of game, and I love them both). No arguements. The final chapter in our nameless hero's journey is an epic one, and has very few faults. A truely outstanding game. Prince of Persia holds a very special place in my heart, I knew the first 2 minutes that I played the Sands of Time that I had discovered something truely remarkable, and the feeling lasted all the way till the final game. It deals with far more diverse topics then the previous two games, among them, the darker parts of the prince's personality. And the story is top-notch, a quality I've come to associate with Ubisoft games. This series is not one you should miss out on.",

They looked at Warrior Within's faults and did a little fixing. The Prince is somewhat likeable again with them bringing his personality from The Sands of Time back to here. The switch between yourself and that dark side of you from time to time is pretty okay.  I say THIS is an improvement. At least over Warrior Within.",

            "review_text": "In the context of the series this is a very dissapointing third act, but a solid game on it's own. The game was really short and rushed. The story and dialogue were poorly written and inconsistent. Rather than tweak and enhance the formula that has been established in the previous two game this game chooses to do the opposite. The mulitple endings in the previous game have been ditched for a single one. The nonlinear play style has also been ditched. The new 'Speed Kill' mechanic is annoying and I found it to be rather hit and miss for me. I was contantly rewinding because I missed my window. This was even more infuriating during the boss fights when I was the only way to defeat the enemy. Using speed kill as the dark prince was much more satifiiying. It felt more stealthy and was just easier overall. I really like playing as the dark prince, the change in fighting stlye was nice, but it felt unpolished. I hated the banter between the prince and the dark prince. It was so annoying and after dieing/rewinding and having to hear it over and over again, i just ended up putting it on mute. And I never really understood where the dark prince came from. Was he a side effect of the sands, or something left over from sand wraith? I didn't like how the game forced you to use the dark prince only during certain times. It would be cool if you could choose and depending on how much you use him or for what events it triggers differnt alternative plot lines and areas on the map. Say if you defeated the Vizier as the Dark prince you would trigger the bad end and would simply take the vizier's place and a sand god. Overall this game is not as sophisticated as it's predecessor. I do not mind the lightening of the tone and color pallette but it would be nice if that came about because of your actions in game.",

The Prince is even more mature and more noble with his resolve when the story unfold. The game is completed with beautiful ending that conclude the Sands of Time trilogy. More than worth for the fans and gamers alike.",

Sometimes prince being thrown into the air while just standing afk.  Sometimes you cant grab the ledge and cant continue the game. The most critical bug, that caused me drop the game, is unable to move down the rope. I couldt go any further.  I`m a big fan of PoP series, but Steam version of this game is full of critical bugs ruining the gameplay.",
