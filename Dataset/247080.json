            "review_text": "Keep in mind that I've been dreaming of a proper top-down rhythm game for years. Quite a lot of what I have to say is based on the fact that I think with a bit of work this game could have potentially been my favorite game of all time.  It's excellent concept, straight-to-the-point presentation, great use of color, more than functional randomization, a very nice shrine mechanic, the ability to dig through walls, fully functional and easy to to understand beat counter, some interesting boss fights, speed/scorerun support and a huge number of different ways to play the game all do a very good job of distracting the player from realizing that the core rhythm/roguelike concept is actually used in quite a uniform and unimaginative way.  The way the game works is that you have a beat counter that multiplies your gold the more you move and attack in accordance with the beat. This is a really interesting mechanic and doesn't require any outside knowledge or athleticism to get good with (like some dancepad games do) but it's actual implementation leaves me thinking it was not realized properly.   First off, the only punishment that you get for missing a beat with Cadence (the standard character) is that you cannot move for about a half-second and you lose your gold multiplier. This is ok, I suppose (certainly instant death on missed beat would be far too cruel, though there's a character for exactly that purpose) but it doesn't really hinder you in anyway. The most blatant example of how little the beat mechanic matters are the Blademaster enemies in Zone 4, which parry your attacks on reaction and then lunge forward, then becoming vulnerable. If you are constantly moving along with the beat these 'range-proof' enemies can group up with time and become a real nuisance, but if you stand still killing them is almost effortless. You can bait out their parry, step backward, and then strike immediately to kill them. Of course, you can do this along with the beat if your footing is good enough, but doing it without beat sync completely removes any risk in this case.The amount of enemies and gold in Zone 4 is excessive, to say the least, so even if you were to walk around with a gold multiplier of 1.0 you would have more than enough gold for the shops.  Second, absolutely none of the levels seem to have been designed with the rhythm mechanic in mind, behind the simple concept of allowing the player to dig through walls if they get trapped behind a wall. All four zones are fairly entertaining, but really, none of them would be out of place in a pure roguelike. The source of difficulty in all four zones comes not from keeping the beat or engaging a 'dance routine' with specific enemy, but something totally irrelevant to rhythm. Zone 1 is difficult because the areas are cramped, Zone 2 is difficult because the areas are too wide open and the enemies are nimble, Zone 3 is difficult because of the ice/fire hazards, Zone 4 is difficult because it forces the player to edge along walls which are full of traps. Zone 4 is the only zone where I would actually say the player is free to engage in rythmic pattern without beng forced to go along a very distinct path, which is overshadowed by the zone's overwhelming number of brutal enemies and traps.  Lastly--and this is runnng FAR against the grain here, I have not found a single person besides me that has this opinion: the music isn't actually that good. As far as it's intended purpose goes, anyway. Surpisingly, few of the tracks are particularly fast or even energetic. This leads to a lot of levels where, if you even care about the beat at all, you are stuck moving at a clumsy and slow rate. There is only one track in the game that has players move more than once per beat, and only one track in the game which has rests--both of which are the same track, King Konga. King Konga is by far the best boss in the game because he is not only the only boss which has irregular rhythm elements, but the only boss where your accordance with the rhythm actually matters. Death Metal has one of the fastest tracks in the game but it ends up being practically meaningless because the boss is so easy you could beat him without stepping in time even once.  All in all this is quite a fun game but not really the ultimate rhythm/action hybrid I've been waiting for. Ironically the people I would reccomend this game most to are people that have don't have much interest in roguelikes or rhythm games, but like the 'idea' of both. If there's some sort of update to the degree of randomization I think the game would be a tremendous platform for fangames--without actually touching the level editor, I actually think I could make levels far more interesting than some of the less fortunate randomizations I've seen. Some sort of compilation of levels made by hundreds of modders would be excellent.",

            "review_text": "I'm so excited to finally be able to review this game post-launch!  I pre-ordered Crypt of the NecroDancer back in 2013 when they started allowing people to do so, and I've been playing the alpha since it became available in April of 2014.  It's a rhythm-based roguelike with some small measure of cross-play achievements (you unlock things as you progress in the game for future playthroughs in other modes), and while all items start identified (i.e., you always know what a scroll or weapon is, unlike a 'true' roguelike), their placements and whether or not they even show up is randomized.  The dungeon randomization is great, and you can specify specific seeds if you want to share levels with other players or work on one specific layout, but where the game really shines -- and its purpose, really -- is the music.  You can only move, attack, use items, cast spells, and anything else *on the beat*. Monsters also move on the beat, and they move in routinely predictable patterns so that over time you learn how to anticipate them and counter them, and in fact some monsters require you to learn these patterns and match the beat in order to even damage them. The skill cap is pretty high, the amount of replayability is immense (there are 9 playable characters and a 10th 'challenge' character, all of whom greatly alter the gameplay in different and interesting ways), and there's even a 'beatless' character that allows you to play the game like a traditional roguelike (monsters move when you do, and you're not forced to stick to the rhythm). And if you want a real challenge, you can even play on a dancepad...  As someone who has been playing roguelikes ever since actually growing up playing Rogue, and who used to religiously follow rec.games.roguelike, I am so delighted to see an injection of 'newness' into the genre like NecroDancer. It's sorely needed, and while I doubt we'll ever see it emulated, I hope it inspires another developer to merge *their* love of two genres into something as incredibly engaging, challenging, and outright *fun* as this.   I am so happy for Brace Yourself Games, and I'm so incredibly excited that this game has finally surfaced for others to experience and play. It's VERY good.",

It's made with love and passion and you can feel that, as it sends shivers down your spine and erects your ears and eyes, while dancing through dark dungeons, defeating bouncing monsters and even a skeleton conga line. This is only 15 bucks and yet worth more than most of the AAA titles out there. If you're into gaming and music, get it. The soundtrack from Danny B. is exceptionally great and you can even switch between it, a more rousing electronic cover soundtrack and a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome metal one! And if you have no taste in great music, simply use your own stuff. The game is easy to learn but freaking hard to master, using only 4 keys. If you like to move it, move it, just grab a Dancepad and get it on! There are so many characters with unique bits of story and a complete different gameplay, many enemies, bosses, unlockable items, EVERYTHING! You haven't hit the purchase button yet? DO IT AND TURN THE VOLUME UP! Your neighbours gonna love it, too, I promise!",

            "review_text": "This is the most impressive rogue-like I have ever played. CoND beautifully integrates tile based combat with music. Each turn lasts for a beat of the current level's song, leading to fun, fast paced action. Even during early access it felt like a complete game, and the full release is a masterpiece.  The controls are easy and straighforward, requiring only the arrow keys to play. The graphics are simple but well made.   The music is great. The soundtrack was composed by Danny B, and each song is edited masterfully into the game. CoND lets you use your own music for the levels, but I have never done it because I love the core soundtrack so much. Despite hearing the songs hundreds of times, I never get tired of them.  The various weapons and equipment provide a wide variety of play styles and item interactions. The enemies are well designed, each with varying movement and attack mechanics. The boss fights are unique and wonderful experiences. Each one is musically themed, and the varying musical styles reinforces the awesomeness of the game's music.  There is a very large amount of content and replayability. Between items, enemies, and floor layouts, there is a lot of variation between runs. There are high score and fastest time leaderboards which are very competitive, and people frequently race the game live. CoND can be very difficult at first because you have to learn each weapon's mechanics and each enemy's attack patterns, but there are many tutorial and training mechanisms built into the game. Practicing is well worth the time, and mastering the game is very rewarding.  I recommend this game to anyone. It is an absolute must play if you like rogue-likes or music based games.",

This game is not easy, especially in the beginning, but it intergrates rouge-lite mechanics and an upgrade system that never feels overpowered, when a player dies, you know its your own fault the player must learn the patterns to enemies to be able to succeed and cannot rely on items, for those crazy enough there is a hardcore mode in which the player cannot use any of the upgrades they obtained in running through the game. This is one of the finest games i've played all year and will most likely continue to be one of my favourites of rythem based and rouge based",

            "review_text": "[Minor spoilers about end game gameplay].  I had been in the Crypt for almost 20 hours before I first encountered the Necrodancer. I'd like to talk of that experience:  The identity of the Dead Ringer revealed, I felt a pang of confusion, only to hear him guide me, and then to realize I had to juggle two heroes terrified me. How many runs had I failed this far? And another boss after what already seemed like an impossible ordeal.   It only took me a few moments to realize the new mechanic I had to juggle in the last fight, and it was an amazing surprise which immediately filled the dancer floor with new energy.   I spent the first minute of the encounter with the Necrodancer keeping my heroes side by side, getting used to the beat. The easy beginning really affords those fighting Necrodancer for the first time the time they need to get ready.   And then, one by one I begin aligning my heroes, triggering bombs to the stage--not too difficult.   When the Necrodancer took to the dance floor, indeed was my heart beating at the 120bpm step, in sync with the Necrodancer himself. I begrudgingly set aside my Obsidian Crossbow and equipped the Golden Lute, determined to do this right. At first, I ran from his reanimated fiends and explosive spells, trying to realign myself and regroup with my ally, but as soon as I understood his rhythm I slided in for a hit. The Necrodancer skips away only losing a single heart from my note, summoning more monsters between us.  Black Knights began to flank me on all sides and it's a challenge to keep them off with my ally's Flail. At one point I realize the Golden Lute can only sing its music if Cadence has a empty tile to move to, so being surrounded by shield bearing skeletons on two sides and a wall and ally covering the other two, I struggle to make any movements at all, all while rapidly losing health. For an instant I fear the worst, but in the next beat does my ally bash his Flail fowards, knocking back one skeleton--I immediately pounce on the next beat, allowing my Lute to sound the minions to dust.   The fight continues with me piercing again and again with my Lute, bringing the Necrodancer to a third of his health, while monsters continue to scratch my ally and I. In the fight I've lost four of my nine hearts, leaving both my ally and I at one and a half hearts left, and as I continue to hit the Necrodancer do increasingly powerful monsters seem to appear.  Eventually, there are too many skeletons in erratic formations I can't easily line up to attack, their pursuit herding me to one side of the dance floor where an Ogre has just joined. I've died many times to Ogres in the fourth zone, but I know the brute, slow, can be defeated if I merely kite around it. However, I worry that in the process, the new ally by my side would then get smashed in the ensuing blow. I move in, hitting him again and again as I circle to his back.  It was at that time, checking the hearts of my ally and I, going over the directional combinations to use bombs, switching to my holstered weapon or beating my war drum, as well as predicting the path of the many dancers of the Necrodancer did I make my fatal error. My attention split, I panic and move one tile away from the Ogre, immediately attracting his singularly directed club.   My obsidian armor, then powered down and thin as paper from the onslaught of reanimations is cleaved in two, Cadence immediately perishing under the mighty blow.   I will now begin talking about my opinion of the game:  I spent 20 hours trying to get farther and farther than before.   Being able to dance with the Necrodancer was an incredible experience, despite dying, my body is still flowing with music high. Please try this game. There are very smart design choices evident throughout every aspect. The music, the level design, the enemies and items all progress so well. Timing each act to the length of a song, having enemies which all have simple but broad ranges of dance moves to overcome make them easy to approach but brilliantly challenging in hoards. You feel extremely rewarded for your experienced-earned dexterity the roguelike demands--the game is a fantastic challenge that's never too easy.   A great example is in certain circumstances (secret vendors and trapdoors) do you find yourself in an incredibly confined space with two minibossess and two small minions. The first time you see this your fear and greenness lead to your immediate demise, but after enough of dancing do you begin to, not only feel comfortable with these, but even actively seek them out for the item and gold reward from defeating them.   Once you can beat bosses, your greed begins to demand you defeat them without a single misstep, for the glorious Flawless Victory that rewards your ego as well as giving you an additional chest to bolster your hero. I thought being an indie game this would be a quick fun change of pace but it's so much more. I've only played twenty hours but I don't intend to stop any time soon. It's a game I would recommend to any friend who comes over, it's a game I would play when I have a short break or if I have a few hours. Sometimes it can be tough if you keep dying but the rewards essentially beg you to succeed. I keep coming back for more Crypt of the Necrodancer! ",

The enemies all have tells and literally have choreographed attacks. Everything gives signs before the action takes place, much like many roguelikes. It's just that this game took that dance and set it to a kickin' soundtrack. You can even practice against enemies without needing to throw yourself into the deep end to figure out their tells.  Even the characters are more upbeat and lively than your average roguelike. The little things, like how they greet NPCs (shyly VS boldly VS force of habit) and their surprised reactions to teleportation make them seem less like digital avatars and more like humans. A little detail that adds a lot of magic to the game.  [edit] THE STORY. Add the story to another fantastic bit of this game. Only frustrating bit is how hard it is to complete story mode, but hey, it's a roguelike. That's to be expected from the genre.

And if for some reason you hate the music (or you get sick of dying and hearing the same bloody song from level 1 over and over again like I do (inb4 'git good')) you can substitute the level songs with your own music.   You play at Cadence, one of several musically-named individuals who must make their way through the titular Crypt for their each individual reasons, which is fun but the true awesomeness lies in the music-related combat and sweet pixel art visuals. That being said the game is hard. It's really hard. The good news is with a few proper upgrades you can become veritably unstoppable in any of the worlds. The learning curve drops into a cliff about the time you meet the Red Dragon, who can take you out with a single well-timed fire breath from across the map, and he'll show up every now and again in Zone 1.  Easy to learn and hard to master are how I would describe this game, and would definitely recommend it unless you're known to break things if you get easily frustrated.

It has most of the elements of a Rogue-like, except you have to stay on beat!  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (and now offered in 3 different variations!) and the game is deceivingly difficult. It's very easy to pick up, very hard to master and highly addictive.  Even having played through the first 3 zones countless time while I waited for the fourth one to come out, then all four a bunch of times when it did, I still enjoy playing this game from time to time (I have played a lot more than Steam indicates.)  I often despise randomly generated levels but in this game it works very well and follow a set of logical rules. Each level will always be similar while always offering something new. There are tons of different items that will help you on your runs and different characters that provide different challenges when you get bored of Cadence, the main character.

Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm roguelike dungeon crawler action RPG from developer Brace Yourself Games and publisher Klei Entertainment, and if the description of the game is confusing, don’t worry. So is the game. Players are dropped into randomly generated dungeons and tasked to explore as deep as possible without dying. Death is permanent; when you die, you start from the beginning all over again.  Exploring, fighting, looting, moving, everything is played to the beat of the Danny Baranowsky chiptune soundtrack. You are likely to die many, many times as you come to learn the various kinds of loot you’ll find and the multitude of enemies to fight. The good news is that the game is ultimately fun to play and enjoy for players who are into rhythm games and randomized dungeons; the bad news is that getting to that point is layered underneath the frustration of not knowing what to do for the first few hours.

If you put a bit of practice into learning each of the enemy's patterns, it is incredibly rewarding to beat each floor, especially for the first time. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but it's a game that you will enjoy if you spend a bit of time learning how to play it.

Keep missing some beats (because the soundtrack is incredibly excellent? Heh... not really. Just great, but not superb kinda thing). The soundtrack changes every level you go on, meaning that the beats change pace level to level. This also provides a nice variety while playing - you move at a different beat every level, and combined with the randomly generated levels (can't memorise paths - they always change) provides enough entertainment for a few hours.  You can also change music tracks if you want, which I'll be doing soon. So if you for some reason get disappointed in the music, swap to your own. The provided soundtracks are nice, but sometimes the fast(ish) beats combined with the dungeon monster aspects results in missed beats and dead characters.   I do not have any significant flaws with this game - it provides what it says it will - a different approach to rogue-like dungeon exploring that is enjoyable and not buggy at all (I didn't encounter any bugs while playing). Got it on sale at 50% price or something, but even at full price it would be worth grabbing to play.  Price - fine  Gameplay - fun  Bugs - None found while playing  Soundtrack - Sometimes not to my taste, but irrelevant when you're trying your best to survive in a dungeon.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: 9/10. They did almost everything right. Mostly boils down to how experienced you're willing to get, because it's tricky to get used to.  Crypt of the NecroDancer is about shanking monsters to a kickass beat. The game stars a girl named Cadence whose entire character, backstory and development can be summarised by 'a girl named Cadence'. It is very much centered around the gameplay and music working together, which works super well in a pretty flexible way compared to other rhythm-based games. The introduction is short and doesn't add much to the game other than justifying the mechanics, so you'll pretty much have the same experience regardless.  The game takes 'turn-based' in a slightly different way. Each beat of the song is represented at the bottom of the screen and symbolises a turn each. If you miss a beat or do something you're not supposed to such as walk into a wall of stone, every enemy still gets a turn while you're standing there hoping nobody noticed that your pants just fell down. Each time you miss a beat, your current combo is broken, meaning you don't have any time to stop and read useful information as even standing still will bring it to a screeching halt. Combo, you say? Why yes indeed, a combo. Maintaining the combo gives a boost to the amount of gold you pick up. Items that you pick up such as weapons or rings may give additional boosts to people who haven't accidentally thrown their flimsy shovel into a solid wall or stood around stroking themselves for too long unless they're a Monk, who for whatever reason is allowed to stroke himself for as long as he likes, which pretty much defeats the entire premise of the game. Comparing two items is a pain, as stopping to read the item's description will cause you to lose your combo, meaning you have to do a god damn raindance around the item just to read the stats and figure out if it's going to increase your chance of winning by 0.3%.  The ENTIRE game can be controlled using only 4 buttons/keys, which is about as convenient as an enemy who you can't actually hit with default gear because it won't line up next to you. I'm looking at you, golden slime. Sure, it's an interesting mechanic, but its main flaw is replacing memorising which key to press with memorising which combination of the same keys to press. It does show appropriate key combinations beside relevant items, but stopping to read it in the middle of a room more undead than a haunted mass grave is usually not worth the time. Guessing which combination is hardly worth the risk; you may be trying to heal in the middle of battle and end up throwing your sword across the room.  Using your own (or someone else's) music instead of the original game's works pretty decently in terms of functionality, although the soundtrack is good enough that you wouldn't want to replace any of it in the first place.  Local multiplayer is an interesting feature, although playing it with a first-timer was akin to participating in a three-legged race with a monkey who has bricks for feet. Unless you're both relatively similarly experienced, one of you is going to drag the other behind. Well I wouldn't say drag behind as much as them stumbling about while you're already buying everything from the shop with a stack of gold, which for this game was about as fun as letting a monkey with bricks for feet kick you in the shins after you finished the race without him, because now neither of you are having much fun at all. And that was after they went through incredibly short tutorial. Sure, it taught the basics, but you only really got to do everything in the tutorial once before it was over and it was clear that it didn't adequately equip a person with the experience they needed to survive unsupervised inside a padded room. If someone wants to play for the first time on your copy of the game, let them play singeplayer first.  Overall decent game. Can't say much about price because I almost exclusively buy games when they're on sale.",

The amount of modding you can do to it also makes it look like you'll get your replay value out of it, especially with custom music, but sorry Youtubers, this is likely to be a copyright issue for you.  Now thtat I've enjoyed controller support, though still with a wierd setup, where one button does pretty much everything, so you'll find yourself playing on the D-pad and ABYX buttons interchangably, until you forget which combination will spawn your powerups and bombs, and wish there was a single button for them, and/or a macro. While it's cool that you can use D-Pad and ABXY interchangably, I would much rather have a dedicated face button for bombs, heals, etc...  This game offers a ton of replayability, with alternate modes available through unlockable characters, such as a pacifism mode, vampire mode, and rhythmless mode.   Pros: A truly immense amount of replayability with nearly a dozen modes, daily challenges, and custom levels and music. The unorthodox coupling of the dungeon crawler genre and rhythm game genre has produced one of the best indie games of 2015. Being a rhythm game, it shouldn't be surprising that the game has an excellent 16-bit inspired soundtrack, as well as its extended soundtrack, which happily belong on my mp3 player for when I'm not playing video games.  Cons: Learning curves and difficulty spikes leave something to be desired for the 3rd and 4th worlds, for which gameplay may in fact be impossible for some characters/modes.  Final Verdict: This game also earns a place with a very few others, earning 10/10. Any issues that I have with play, I can usually attribute to my lack of skill. The game provides a lot of entertainment, challenge where desired, and some great beats to enjoy it all with.",

            "review_text": "Part rhythm game, part dungeon crawler, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a well-excuted and original concept that marries its inspirations effectively without sacrificing too much from either genre. While it doesn't dig too deep into either genre's traits, if you enjoy rhythm games or dungeon crawlers you will find something to like here (if you can look past its flaws).  The meat of the gameplay revolves around spelunking through four zones of four stages each, with the first three having a small pool of possible bosses at the end. By keeping with the rhythm of the track and timing your actions to the beat, you are rewarded with a multiplier bonus that increases your gold pickups (and which later on enhances some equipment). While this is very important exploring the first two zones (especially as a new player because your loot pool will be low), zone 3 becomes extremely hectic with very aggressive monsters, lots of damage traps, and higher base gold pickups. The coin multiplier is useless except for gear once you reach Zone 4 because the gold pickups are so large that you can ignore it completely outside of combat. This seems to go against the design decision of adding rhythm elements and makes the game feel more like a barebones mobile-esque experience instead of DDR with swords. This might change with other characters (of which there are 10 to choose from), but the zones felt very similar in terms of game design when playing with Melody and Cadence for me.  Even though the game only has 16 (randomized) floors, you have a great deal of customization options from the level select hub. Different characters completely change how the game plays; a monk who dies from touching gold, a bard who ignores the rhythm and turns the game into a turn-based crawler, and a miner with infinite kickable bombs are some examples of how the gameplay can be radically modified. CotN is also completely playable with a dance pad because everything is controlled with the arrow keys! This alone gives it my 'Best One-Handed Game' award for 2015. A level editor and a seeded All Zones Mode are also included for enthusiasts.  Overall, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a superbly unique experience that is cheap enough that anyone who has played DDR should dust off their dance pad for. While it isn't the deepest rogue-like or the hardest rhythm game, there is enough content included to sink your teeth into for at least a dozen hours.",

This game is all rogue-like, with none of the physical, rhythmical feeling that comes with playing most dance pad games. The art and music in this game are amazing, and it is a pretty fun rogue-like when I put the dance pad away and just play with my keyboard...but that's not what I bought the game for so I doubt I will be finishing it. Playing with the dance pad makes the game much harder, and there is a dance pad mode that is supposed to make the game easier, but it still wasn't all that fun. Before the Echo is more the kind of game I was looking for. So if you are mostly a DDR/ITG/etc fan with not much interest in rogue-like games, don't be fooled by the images and videos of dance pads...this game is not really designed to be optimally played on one.",

            "review_text": "I think you are better off just buying the soundtrack (which is just absolutely amazing) and leaving this game alone.The whole randomized levels thing isn't very well implemented. You start with the same items on every level you often end up severely lacking in some resource, be it a weapon, healing items, armour, shovel etc. It also leads to a lot of shenanigans such as: Starting off right next to the miniboss (all of which have a near global aggro range btw) and a bunch of tought to kill cronies, teleporting into 5+ mobs most likely leading to death because the monsters stepped onto the floor switch but haven't moved off the destination spot, and the ole classic 'Shopkeeper's on fire'. The whole beat gameplay thing is fun for a while, and it is, but late game enough you are better off ignoring it since you get plenty of gold without needlessly putting yourself at risk. I think it's kind hilarious that a lot of the monsters will move/attack to the beat as well, sometimes putting you in a bad spot as long as you are playing the game the way it's meant to be played. That makes it seem near discouraged. This may sounds a bit mean, but the cutscenes are quite poorly made, I would even go as far as compare them to Zelda CDI games. Of course they don't stoop to that level but the resemblance is very strong. I don't expect something insane from a 15 dollar indie game, but there are other ways of adding story content without excess animation, take the old school dialogue box scenes they used a lot in RPGs in them good ole days. Voice acting is pretty odd, I'm currently playing as the protagonist (the game does feature a variety of playable characters), female character Cadence and her voice seems to change during battle, certain spells and hits from certain attacks will cause her to sounds like a deep voiced bloke.

            "review_text": "9.25/10  Gameplay: Possibly The most fun I’ve had in a dungeon crawler. Everything moves around the crypt landscape to the rhythm of the music. This happens in quick, quarter note long turns that have both you and your enemy acting at the same time. The aim is to learn the enemies’ movements and fight without getting in their way. Striking and dodging to the beat is extremely satisfying, especially when in quick succession. Though be warned, things can get really difficult. I consider myself pretty good, and have come to accept that I will never 100% this game. NecroDancer also features a mode to play on a dance pad, as well as local co-op. Despite how there isn’t much reason to replay characters that you’ve already completed, I could see this having great replay value simply for the fun of it.  Story: The Plot is surprisingly enthralling despite most of it being told through ten second cut scenes. It makes your journey actually have purpose and drive, where they could have easily coasted on the gameplay alone. It’s all pretty emotionally charged too. Though with the blend of music and gameplay, it mostly comes off as totally badass. The characters are likable and have some handicaps that really mix up gameplay.  Music:  NecroDancer has not one, but three amazing soundtracks, so any stage you play will have 3 different versions of its music. Add this to the fact that every stage and boss has unique tracks; it piles up to be roughly 70 songs. And honestly, I haven’t found one that I didn’t like. I’ve even danced to the OST while alone in the dark cause I was getting so into it. Thankfully, the Soundtracks are also available on Steam. And if it’s not your thing, you can even import music from your own library. My personal recommendation is to go into options, and set all character soundtracks to random. This way, you will get the most variety out of your experience right away as you’re still learning the game.  Art: As much as I don’t care for the pixel style in general, they do a great job with it. Every character moves smoothly to the rhythm, bending knees, bobbing heads and whatnot. The cut scenes are basically just a moving slideshow with dialogue, but they’re still very nice to look at. Each boss also has a little intro splash screen that I just love.  Tip: If you're having trouble starting, switch to the character named Bard, he is not constrained by the songs rhythm so you can really take your time.  All in all amazing. I would recommend it to anyone, on sale or not.",

However, this game's enemies all follow fairly easy to learn patterns, and it's mainly a matter of recognizing those patterns. The weapons in the game are all interesting, with different playstyles being offered in the first few levels to start off; the different weapon variants keep it interesting. Compounded with the soundtrack by DannyB, this game is amazing. I've found myself saying 'Just one more run' over and over again. The 10 different characters all offer unique playstyles, even if some are less fun then others. The variety, mechanics, and options in the game allow for hours of fun. If I had one minor complaint, it seems like the 'unlocking' method for the various lobby NPCs seem somewhat pointless. It'd probably be better to just have to unlock them with diamonds instead of golden/glass keys. All in all, an amazing game that I would reccommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes or pain.",

You see, it describes itself as a roguelike rhythm game. There isn't much rhythm in there. Now, the problem might be, that I am a classicaly trained musician and the way I see rhythm is probably a bit different. My issues might not be revelant to other players.  How I would describe this game is a roguelike with simple mechanics but with a quite clever gimmick. Turns happen on their own in regular intervals, not when you move (as in classic rogue-likes). Enemies move in certain patterns (some move every turn, other every other turn etc.) The tricky part is to quickly evaluate your enemies and make right decisions in a short time given. To help you move in the right time turns are sincronized with music. That is really all there is to it. Also, the game is very forgiving when it comes to moving on time.  Occasionally, things get a bit more interesting. There are traps, which accelerate/slow down turns (and music.) There is one boss fight, where rhythm is irregular (one beat is skipped.) There is one miniboss, which disables the music until you kill it (never found it to be an issue... everyone can just tap a perfectly even rhythm, right?)   There are some choices in the design, which I am still not sure whenever I like or not. Do do have a choice of different characters but rather than offering alternative playstyles, they give you special challenges. I thought it to be a strange choice but I do like it more and more. The game core-mechanics are too basic to allow for different 'playstyles' so just complicating things by creating special rules for all of the characters is a welcome addition. The weapons are very very unbalanced. However, the good ones seem to be difficult to get in the actual run. It work alright in the end.  Not a too big a fan of the soundtrack. I am usually a big fan of Danny B soundtracks, but this one is a bit dull. Probably the issue is the big focus on a regular beat, which I find to be snooze worthy. Comeon, rhythm is an importan part of music. You cant be THAT regular.  So lots of negative things. But it is still fun. Give it a bash. Probably none of my issues will be relevant to you.",

            "review_text": "Wow, this was a game. It's got a fantastic premise and great implementation, complete with a short but sweet story that matches the theme perfectly. Its literally everything I want from an indie game, except for one thing.  This game is ♥♥♥♥ING INFURIATING. Harder than Dark Souls. Harder than any rage quit game. It doesn't have 'Artificial Difficulty,' where you die, learn how to not die, then move on. No, it's just ordinary difficulty. By the time you're on zone 4, you can expect to be fighting 4 or 5 enemies at once, enemies with complex attack patterns that can teleport your character and reverse your controls, and if you f*** up once, you're so deep in murder beasts that you may as well restart. This game has a threefold difficulty, and each one multiplies the others. If ONE of them was changed, this game would be great fun, but as is, I spent 8 hours playing the last zone and I only managed to make my way to the final boss once. Here's what hurts.  A: All upgrades are temporary. There is a SMALL pool of 'Permenant' Upgrades that you can purchase that persist through death, but for the most part, all of the upgrades you can buy are you unlocking items that you -might- find in the dungeon. Every time you die, all your equipment, bonus health, and gold, get removed.  B: The Zones are LONG. One zone consists of three levels and a boss. In order to gain a checkpoint, you ned to beat all three levels AND the boss without dying even once. Once you die, its back to square one.  C: The game is both complicated and fast. This isn't a problem in zones 1 and 2, where the enemies are simple, but once you get to zones 3 and 4, EVERYTHING is a threat that can kill you, and it stacks enemies together whenever possible. Not only that, but each level in a zone has a faster beat than the one before it, with zone 4 lvl 3 at a manic two beats per second. Two turns every second. At that speed, there's no time for reaction, you have to plan out the entire battle ahead of time, which is hard considering that you can't always predict enemy movements. One mistake, and your plan is garbage, just like your body. Now, don't get me wrong, this manic, difficult, fast paced gameplay is exciting and a serious blood rush and I enjoy it... when I have enough equipment to stand a chance. The problem comes in when you spawn in with one dagger and a bomb and you have to fight through a few mobs before you can get enough gold to buy things from the shopkeeper.  All in all, the game, as it stands, requires inhuman reflexes, an ability to memorize and predict at least 5 enemy movements at once, at least 4 turns in advance, and the manual dexterity and rhythm skill to pull everything off.  That said, I did say there were a few things that could be changed to make me SEVERELY reccomend this game, because it's GREAT fun. This game is so much fun, which makes it dissapointing when it tarnishes that fun by crucifying you for even the smallest mistake. So, here are my suggestions for ways to make this game less punishing.  Idea One: Have a better checkpoint system. In addition to a checkpoint at the beginning of every zone, make it so that you have the option to start at the last zone you completed. Beat zones 1 and 2? Good, start at 2 when you die at three. Beat 2 and 3? Start at three. That way you wouldn't lose ALL of your progress.  Idea Two: Have Permanant upgrades that actually help. Give the option to purchase a basic Iron weapon that will spawn in with you, because that dagger is pitiful. Maybe have an upgrade to start with gold so you can buy things from the shop. Maybe have more upgrades that buff your health and defense so you don't get murder ♥♥♥♥♥ the first time you lash with a whip instead of moving out of the way of an ogre's club. Let you start with a random/specific spell.  Idea Three: Carry over your equipment from the last zone. if you beat zone one with a hellacious ammount of gear, you should be able to start zone 2 with all of that gear, every time.  Idea Four: Make more shrines that are actually useful. most of the shrines only make the game harder, and its hard enough already.  Summary: If you love a SERIOUSLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE, this is the game for you. You like pain? Go for it. You like an insurmountable challenge that you can brag to about your friends? This is it. I have never before, in my entire life, thrown my hands up on a videogame and said 'I can't do it, I'm not good enough.' I'm doing that here. This game is literally too hard and too punishing, and after playing zone 4 for 8 hours only to die at the final boss because I didn't know his attack patterns, I'm throwing in the towel. This game isn't for casual gamers.   (Posting this as an edit to the review, because apparantly its too long to be a comment. Thanks steam T_T) A developer that cares? O&gt;O  1. I didn't even know that was a thing! I unlocked every cage I found, and when I beat 3, I kinda just assumed I'd unlocked everything when cages stopped showing up in 4. Couldja add a tooltip in-game saying that they only appear in earlier zones? That'd -really- help.  2. I had poked all zones mode, but doesn't that start you from Z1? Take a long time to work up to Z4 from that...  3. Yes, I had noticed that bombing shrines got you loot, but bombs are a limited resource XP  4. I never got to practice ANY boss... until just recently. For whatever reason, playing the game in offline mode prevents bosses from being unlocked in the bossmaster lobby. Not sure if that counts as a bug or not, but I took this game with me on a road trip and didn't have internet, so the only practice I got was grinding my face against that cheese grater of a congo line. (Achievments dont happen either.)   4B. On that topic, I'm not sure that this is a bug or not, but the only boss I ever seemed to face was Coral Riff. Z1. Coral Riff. Z2. Coral riff. Z3. saw Congo line ONCE, died, found coral riff the second time. Z4 seems to always be Dead Ringer, (Which makes sense because [REDACTED FOR SPOILERS] but it seemed kind of odd that I kept running into him.  5. I -really- don't like the fact that you have to dig through walls in 4 to get to the enemies. From an immersion standpoint... seriously? The guy just sealed all his monsters into rooms by bricking over everything? It just doesn't make sense.  5b. from a gameplay standpoint, its also ANNOYING AS HELL that you changed the rules about digging in z4. In all other zones, you dig out one block, but in Z4, you dig out two at once, and the second block you dig has a 50 50 chance of being left or right.  6. Oh yes, any -single- enemy can be easily defeated with nothing more than a dagger. Its when you're adjacent to a parry/rapier knight who has a teleport guy behind him and a bomb guy trying to skitter into your flank, a confusion caster trying to ruin your day and you're in z4 level 3 playing at two beats per second that a knife starts to be insufficient.   BUT, apparantly, I'm missing the upgrade where you can start a run with items because I beat zones 1-3 too quickly for him to appear. I'll go back and do that.  and also grudgingly change my review to a yes, because that's almost literally exactly what I said I wanted, I just didn't know it was there or how to unlock it.",

            "review_text": "One of a Kind. A Must for Any Gamer Who Likes A Challenge.  Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm roguelike unlike anything else produced to date. It takes a turn based battle system and turns it on its head by having the turns fall on the beat of the game's killer soundtrack. Yours and your enemies' moves fall on beat as you navigate randomly generated dungeons in search of paths deeper and deeper into the crypt.   What makes it great? For starters, the soundtrack. In a rhythm based game, a great soundtrack it crucial to success. Crypt of the Necrodancer hits it out of the park. Danny Baranowsky, composer of the soundtracks of the hit indy games Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, created what it easily his best work to date for this game. The driving beats keep you immersed in the game for hours and hours.   While it COULD only take you less than an hour to complete the four levels in this game, the Necrodancer will not likely allow this so easily. The game is quite difficult, requiring many attempts to learn the patterns of the enemies and what items will best serve you as you travel deeper into the crypt. But don't let this scare you. The game is easy to pick up and play and you will find yourself unable to put it down as you get better and better at slaying the countless undead jamming out in your way. With three challenging floors and interesting bossfights in each of the four zones, you will feel accomplished and rewarded with every victory. You will have earned it.  With well over 100 hours on record since early access, I can say that you will find plenty to do in this game. With 10 unique playable characters and tons of item unlocks, there is no end to the replayability. Leaderboard and daily quests will keep you logging in frequently to test your skills. Have a dance pad? The game fully supports it. Yes, the controls are simple enough to allow you to easily control the game with a pad. It is the definition of easy to pick up, hard to master. Wish you could Necrodance to your favorite tune? Load it up. The game supports custom tracks using MP3s. Want to create your own level layouts? There is a level editor. There is very little the developers did not include in this game. It is chock full of everything you could ask for.   Whether you are a roguelike veteran or someone new to the genre, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game worth picking up. It is a refreshing new experience in a video game world that has grown a little stale of new ideas of late.   While you are at it, pick up the soundtrack. It is that good.",

This game has tons of replayability because of this. -Lots of unlockables, including items, spells, weapons and even characters that can drastically change how you play the game. -The pixel animations are fantastic- not only do they look expressive and goofy, but they also help the player to know when to attack or dodge. -The combat is incredibly simple to learn, but learning the attack patterns of enemies takes time and concentration. Mix this with managing your health and items as well as forcing the player to stick to the beat, and you have an incredibly tense yet fulfilling gameplay experience. -The game is very difficult, but it is incredibly fair. All of the enemies can be beaten if you learn their patterns or know when to use the right items. Eventually, you end up getting into the zone and become a master dungeoneer. -If an enemy is too confusing for you, there are rooms in which you can practice against all types of monsters, even bosses and mini bosses. -Direct support for modding and even speedrunning. Neat. -Local Co-op? Yes Please! -Three equally awesome soundtracks of varying styles that can all be changed out on the fly? Count me the heck in! -Singing merchants? Woo mama. -You can play it with a DDR pad? BEST GAME EVER  Cons: -Content wise, there isn't a whole lot to this game- there are only 4 zones with three stages and a boss each. However, the randomization completely makes up for this. -While there are a lot of unlockables, I ran out of items to buy after about 8 hours of playing. There is, however, a system where you can trash unlocks, forcing you to get them back again. It essentially lets you play the game all over again if you want. -The controls can sometimes be unresponsive, such as when you are trying to use an item or a spell. These inputs require hitting two keys at the same time, and I often would up missing a beat or getting in the way of enemies because the keys simply wouldn't register. This might be a problem with my computer.  Verdict: This game is incredibly well put-together. It's compelling, challenging, and a heck of a lot of fun. Also, I will be really surprised if you don't get some of the songs from this game stuck in your head.  Score:7.5/10",

The music itself is the single best soundtrack I've heard on any video game ever. It's catchy, it keeps the gameplay moving wonderfully, and the shopkeeper sings along. Lots of RPG elements, with equipment and spells and armor, all of which must be earned with diamonds found within the levels.

However, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a VERY solid rogue-like, and has some great dungeon crawling features that any rogue-like fan is sure to love.  My only gripe, and keep in mind, this may be entirely human error, is that the soundtrack feels at times like it's not meant to keep you on tempo. Kicks and snares don't always feel like they're on two and four (or one and three, however you prefer to think of it) and sometimes it throws me off (keep in mind I said it may be my fault).  Other than that, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a very solid game, with plenty of depth and a great soundtrack to listen to.

You should be able to at least keep a little bit of your loot when you complete a zone, or be able to buy new starting items somehow (if you can, apologies, i have yet to find all the shopkeeps) you can throw the dagger, but it goes entirely to the other side of the room (and sometimes disappears) and after you lose it you're completely defenseless and are pretty much guaranteed to die.  and if you want to keep your coin multiplier, you have to make a move with every single beat, which means if anything unexpected happens you usually don't have enough time to react to it before you have to move again (the average reaction time of a person is 1 second and most tempos are usually 80-100 bpm) so it's usually more worth it to completely ignore the coin multiplier.  other than that this game is really good and i have tons of fun playing it. never seen a game like it before, it's definitely very unique in how it utilizes the rhythm system",

There's some stuff that's odd, like getting multiple attacks in on a beat. My only real complaint with the game is that you don't know how to beat the various monsters until you run into them, and some take a bit of trial and error. This means that you end up getting a certain distance and then dying a lot, and there can be 'learning walls' that are typical of many games.   Finding a new type of monster is kind of like when you encounter a new rules interaction in Hearthstone. You won't quite know what's going to happen, and sometimes it's more intuitive than other times. Some people will like that aspect of exploring because it keeps the game fresh, but I dislike having to start over and progress until I find the same monster that killed me to try again. It's kind of like Dragon's Lair in that sense.   Once you beat a monster, you can practice against it in the lobby, but that's not really helpful because then you already know how to beat it.   Despite that quibble, the game is highly addictive and fun. 8/10 will keep playing.",

The core of the gameplay is moving to the beat, which you'll get used to after a while and it stops getting hard to move to, and instead just becomes muscle memory. After the first campaign it completely flips the gameplay making it stay new, the third campaign is just incredibly hard. Story:6/10.

I also think there should be more codex because I get stuck at world 2 very easely. It would also be cool to have next to the level editor also a seed editor, but maybe I'm the only one that wants that because I do programing for sport. and maybe unlock the level editor sooner because I seriously can't beat world 3 (witch has my favorite music) overall realy adictive but the game is too hard (for me at least) so maybe you could also make dance pad mode for the other levels?

The game is satisfyingly difficult, but not impossible to master. Dancing with all of the enemies is a unique feeling, especially when you've gotten it down pat (only be destroyed and completely humbled by the next zone)  Pros: - You can use your own music for the rhythm game. - The difficulty curve is agreeable. - Lots of different unlockable characters with different play styles to make the game feel like new. - You get to kill dragons. And there's as chess battle fight. - Local multiplayer mode.  Cons: - You can buy powerups with diamonds you find in the game, but you run out of powerups pretty early on, and the currency feels hollow. - The game gets pretty repetitive after awhile. - Nothing about the game is exactly riveting, mostly just something to do.

            "review_text": "There are many games which combine very quirky game mechanics or ideas that would not seem to logically fit together, and sadly many of them fail because the ideas, in practice as well as concept, don't work well togehter. However, I am certainly glad that the developers of Crypt of the Necrodancer went for it anyway, because their decision to combine dungeon crawling and rhythm mechanics has created one of the best indie games I've ever played, competing with both the giants such as FTL and The Binding of Isaac and the gems such as Gunpoint and Battleblock Theater.  The concept is simple: It's a dungeon crawler where you must move, attack, cast spells, loot chests, and kick ♥♥♥ to the beat of a wonderful soundtrack composed by Danny Branowsky, composer of the soundtrack to other great games such as The Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy, and Desktop Dungeons. As you advance through the increasingly dificult levels, slashing skeletons and slaying slimes, you acquire better and better magical loot with which you must battle the final boss of each floor; one of four randomly selected music-themed bosses (all of whom are walking puns). Once you beat the Necrodancer himself, you unlock new characters to do it all again!  I personally have not tried out the Co-op mode myself, but it also looks very fun.  Overall, it is a great game with beautiful art, amazing music, and just enough difficulty and satisfaction to make it fun game after game.   EDIT: Fair warning: it does get pretty hard toward the end. The difficulty curve is not unbalanced per se, but zone 4 is just very, VERY hard, and the boss fights that follow zone 4 are also very difficult, meaning that they'll kill you quite a lot, meaning that you'll have to start all over from the beginning of the zone. Again, it's not an unfair difficulty curve by any means, but it is extremely challenging. That being said, the challenge adds a wonderful degree of satisfaction to finally slaying the Necrodancer, so if I could redesign the game I wouldn't change a thing.  EDIT: Forget everything I said about the difficulty. Even if you've played hard games, you don't know difficulty until you've tried to beat zone 4 as Aria. To this day I've only ever gotten to the boss fight at the end of the zone once. Dios mio, those devs are EVIL. I can't even imagine trying to play Coda.",

Want to take your time? Play bard, who is not bound to the rhythm of the music. Want to kill nothing and tickle enemies with your flower power? Dove. Want to be challenged to your absolute limit? Try Coda, who plays at double speed, dies in one hit, dies when picking up gold, dies when missing a single beat, and has an extremely limited item pool.  Success in the game is earned through patience and learning the patterns of each enemy - many enemies brutally punish being mindlessly charged, with a few beats of reckless attacking quickly seeing you dead and furious.  Bosses are fun and challenging, but true strategy is not required for most of them when playing the easier characters, as a good collection of items can see you downing bosses in one bar of music. The story progresses through increasingly difficult characters with the final character being substantially harder than those before. It's a difficulty spike, but by the time you reach it you'll feel a possessed determination to reach the end at all costs, inspired by the previous four hours of relentless beats infecting your mind and demanding you complete the NecroDance of Destiny.  Barrier of entry is moderate - non-gamers or the rhythmically (or physically) impaired may have trouble sticking with the game until it 'clicks' for them. Bard allows everyone to enjoy the puzzley elements of the game and practice for harder characters, and there are practice rooms available for absolutely every enemy type and boss; so those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed red dragons can stop slaughtering you on your otherwise perfect run. Session time is short, with levels being 2-5 minutes in length, three levels a zone with a boss at the end of each.  I planned to make this a two minute silly review, but this game deserved justice.

In a way you would not expect those particular genres to work with each other but somehow this game pulls it off. It's a very unique compilation. On the outside its a dungeon crawler. You progress through a randomly generated dungeon gathering loot. Once you're dead the only thing you are left off is gold with which you can purchase unlocks, additional crates and items to be found in the dungeon. Any unspent gold goes away and you start from the start. And you start all over on each death with just a bigger chance of getting better things along the way.  The combat hover distinguishes it from the normal rouge like games. As its essentially a rhythm puzzle to be solved. In short - each enemy has a movement pattern in which he moves taking a move in the beat. Its easy to learn and tackle a single enemy but when different ones come at you at the same time fending all of them is quite the challenge. It makes for a very unique and satisfying combat when you pull all the moves in the right way.  The audio layer of this game is just amazing. Even more so as it's integral part of the game. It's worth getting the game for the soundtrack alone. I have no words to better describe it - just amazing. Well worth a listen to.  Graphicly it's nothing special, but nothing bad as well. The pixel aesthetic might not be the best pixel art I've seen but it does the job.  Sadly this will not be one of my favourite games ever. Simply because I'm bad at it. Not a big fan of a rhythm based part of it. Moving only on the beat seams a bit limiting and while the combat is quite enjoyable I was more often failing at it than not. In the end didn't feel interested enough to persevere longer than the first layer of dungeon.  I do however suggest checking it out.
