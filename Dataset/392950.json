            "review_text": "Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure has received quite a lot of negative reviews during the first days after it was released, and this because of 2 main reasons: on one hand, the game had a lot of bugs of various severity (from typos or bad translations to crashes, achievements unlocking and the impossibility to start the game on some systems); on the other hand, the game featured two achievements that were obtainable only by investing a huge amount of real money (around $200) that attracted the anger of a lot of people, including myself.   However, the feedback that the community received from the developers is quite impressive – not only they changed the paid achievements but they also started to fix the major bugs and they are currently working on fixing the minor issues too, and all this in a very short period of time.  The game itself is not entirely bad, it’s quite repetitive but at the same time it was designed to hook you up, just like the standard smartphone/Facebook games. The fact that you have a limit to the actions you can do in one play session might or might not make you revisit the game next day, to progress some more.  The gameplay consists mainly in solving hidden object scenes that award some items used to complete the quests or collections or unlock additional bonuses. The fact that you have a most 15 locations (depending on your level, 1 - 15) that you visit over and over again adds to the monotony of the game – but on the bright side, after you solve 3-4 times the same hidden object scene, you learn exactly where all the objects are which makes it much easier afterwards.  Additionally, you can receive some chests from killing mobs, but unlocking them proves to be a real challenge – the puzzles are timed and most often of high difficulty.  For those that want to 1-click solve a chest puzzle or a hidden object scene, there is an in-game shop from which they can buy items in exchange for real money. The shop also provides all the objects needed for unlocking new locations or completing the collections. However, in comparison with most of the other pay-to-win games, all these items can be acquired also by playing the game, without spending a cent of real money, but of course these drop in small amounts so one is expected to invest a lot of patience and time to finish this game.  The objects in the hidden object scenes and the whole artwork is designed in the style of Artifex Mundi games, meaning that overall the artwork is nice and with vibrant colors; the objects are quite visible but at the same time hidden strategically so that they blend perfectly into the background, making them harder to be spotted, which is by definition one of the characteristics of this genre.  At the moment of writing this review, I think that the biggest complaint from the community remains the long time to achieve 100% - in order to do that one needs to revisit every location a few hundred times and all of this require energy; the energy pool is quite small and limited, allowing you to play only 4-5 hidden object scenes in a single play session - this will probably make people loose interest in the game quite quickly since they will not be able to enjoy the game for more than 10 minutes at once. Hopefully, the game parameters will be adjusted in the future.  I decided to give this game a positive review, not only because it is an enjoyable experience (despite the long grind for 100% achievements) but also because of the constructive attitude from the developers, that are actively working on improving our gaming experience.

            "review_text": "“Our story begins...”  … with a whole lot of waiting, because this is an energy-based hidden object game (unless you're going to throw cash at it after half an hour).  The game gets a tad repetitive, and exploring the same locations over and over can feel like Groundhog Day, only in this case the groundhog is a mace-wielding rat and there's elves. I'm still playing and still entertained so it must be doing something right.  As for the story, I'm sure there was one of those in there somewhere, but I appear to have misplaced it under a pile of having-to-wait-ages (which is a shame). Not sure how it compares to other free hidden-object games since this is my first, but it's a nice game for taking a break from work, etc. Fun puzzles and... hidden-objects... it does what it says on the tin, really. Looking forward to completing it at some point.   ( - ) Negatives - the wait - repetitive - still waiting for the “epic battle against evil” - no Bill Murray  ( + ) Positives + pretty locations with some very well hidden objects (I'm going to make the bold assumption that that was the aim of this here hidden-objects game) + fun puzzles + good for short breaks form work etc... + initial bugs have been fixed so it should be running smoothly",

Yes, there's time-limited energy involved and you can't play for as long as you like in one setting... but the game NEVER encourages you to spend money to speed something up.  If you're happy to play once or twice a day for 5-20 minutes, this is perfect.",

If you have 0 energy and need 10 exp to level up(example) you can kill monster. When finish quest, should not received rewards before check about exp to level up and energy again. - Save diamon to use in late game, when you can buy restore 100% energy when you have max energy higher. Same that you should save all chests, coins and weapons to use when need like above . When you have no quest, you can use weapons, coins to kill monsters to level up faster to have new quest. - Some quest can do in same time. - When open chest, after 50% of time if you feel you can't finish it you can use tool you have or pause game and check guides. - Final you need a little lucky when explore or kill monster, you will received true item to finish quest so you can save energy to do other things; or when open chest you can received weapons to finish all kill monsters achievement; or collect enough items to finish the collection.

The way it is constructed you either have to only play it for a couple minutes a day, wait, or pay to buy more energy so you can play a game not really worth paying for. Not reccommended, don't waste your time. I only got to level three after playing for about ten minutes and was out of energy and would have had to wait a hour for the bar to be refilled. No thank you, go back to facebook with your trash game.",
