Too bad that the developers didn't have time/money to finish making the game. The game is so buggy you cant even play it. I have a brand new gaming computer wich can run BF4 on Ultra settings with no lag (and many other demanding games) but this game is so badly optimized it's not even playable. I bought it on the release day for over a year ago and the devs has not made anything to make it more playable since then. So DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!",

The developers have basically abandoned this game, what it had to offer, and left a lot of other users, including myself, disappointed and annoyed.",

The game feels unpolished, i really expected more after seeing those reviews.  -Graphics The textures themself were not too bad but required you to be in a range of 30m to even really see them. For example grass, road, tree's. You can look at the screenshot i took when i was ingame. Its basically total sh!t. Btw. the field of view is like 50-60, which is insanely close and feels like sh!t too.  -Gameplay The gameplay is pretty bad. I've not played much because my tractor instantly fell over. There was no way to flip it up again, so i was basically ♥♥♥♥ed. To get into the tractor you press leftclick on that little thing that pops up, to get out you press y, whyever... There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay.  -Sounds Well, the music was pretty decent. Not Simulator-like music. Well, its not really the type of music i enjoy though. Kinda reminded me of the game 'Barney' (where you play that cow, i loved it x3). I didnt really listen to the other sounds, if they were bad i'd have noticed though.   -Controls The controls are pretty weird. There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay. (Sry for copy pasta)  -Quality The overall quality is pretty bad. The game feels insanely unpolished. Like in every UIG Game, it changes the OS-Resolution, even though it's autodetecting stuff to set your video options before starting. Well... The FOV is 50-60 as i said, im not a fan of it. Road only laods when you're in the range of ~30m, otherwise its insanely bugged. Grass does only load in a range of like 10m. There is no HUD or anything, you just get extra menu's by holding TAB, C or other stuff which were pretty confusing. There is no way to flip your tractor, mine's fallen over like 5 minutes after i got into the game. RIP me.  -Overall Experience Defiently one of the worst faming simulator games out there. There are so many games which are much better and more enjoyable. I would definetly not recommend the game to anyone.",

The engine is actually really beautiful for a simulator and such, but that comes with a downside. It is terribly optimized. I have a really fair computer that actually meets the recommended requirements, yet I can barely top off 30 fps (frames per second) on medium. In retrospect, I was not able to play this game. I can say that I really don't mind if the graphics are good or not, but when I can't get a respectable fps, it's too hard for me to play.  The driving is abyssal with very simple physic calculations, like flipping over a tractor going five MPH and taking a small turn. Sadly, because of my previous woe with the performance, I was not able to try much of the game out, so for those with really powerful computers and want to try this, go ahead, but don't expect much.  The game would've been amazing if it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥-poor performance with the engine.",

I´ll recomend this game couse it gives endless hours of meditativ-game-state. and it´s a +1 just becouse you can leave the game and do other IRL stuff. Or play a diffrent game on the 2nd screen.  ",

As a simulation of agriculture 2/10 (there are farmyard animals, which I suppose must count for something, they have something to do with farms, right?). As a simulator of altered reality and of how agriculture might look in a universe of metaphysical vehicles that only exist conceptually, a physics dominated by a fluctuating gravitational force and where Albert Einstein toured his one-man balloon sculpting show from coast to coast 11.3333333333/10.",
