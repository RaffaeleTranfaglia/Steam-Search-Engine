It's still a hell of a fun game with loads of hours possible before you. A good buy, especially at this price.",

            "review_text": "The best title in the series. Low amount of different units, but extremely deep combat. You are able to win battles with just moving your army around into better positions and demoralizing the enemy. The only RTS where you are punished for micromanaging your units - it will just tire them and you will lose strength. Loving it :) Try to read Sun Tzu 'The Art of War', it will really help you get better in this game.  Graphical glitches seem to be solved (No menu flicker).",

It is an old game so don´t expect a nice graphics game by today´s standard but back when it was first released it was really great. This game has the best video´s of agents ever in a TW game. Just play and see ;)",

I dont remember the game being so stiff ( Thats what she said) but that is easily something anyone who´s played a older total war game should get used to. Overall i rate this game 12/10 just for old memories :) Btw im playing this on max ( if you can call it max setttings) on a 4-5 year old laptop. Should you get this game then you might ask? ¨Hell Yes¨ Nostalgia at its finest!",

If you haven't bought it already then don't; Shogun Total War does NOT work on Windows 10 any longer. (December 2016) and I doubt anyone will release a fix unless 1,000's of players mention it.",
