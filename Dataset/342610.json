Very twisted indeed!",

Evade and attack various enemies that chase you across a sometimes morphing landscape while also searching for items to help you along. Unlock new areas as you treasure up. It's quick to get into and a lot of fun to explore.",

After ten minutes of constant dying: gee, maybe I should read the information that the game is displaying on the screen.  After an hour: wow, this game is incredible.  After many more hours: this game is genius.",

Takes place on a 7,6,6 tiled hyperbolic plane, rendered as a Poincaré disk with your character at the center. Alternate renderings including a (truncated to fit your monitor) half-plane and a partial embedding into 3-space are available for fun, though it's only really playable on the default Poincaré disk. Many different biomes are available to visit on your adventure, which make creative use of hyperbolic geometry and its unique curves and properties. Contains both easy challenges like fighting your way through hordes of hostile foes, and insanely difficult challenges like walking to the center of a circle or walking away from a spot and then returning to it.",

It's simple, you collect treasure in the form of diamonds, spice and other things, explore the various world types all of which have their own unique little gimmick, collect power-ups that have all sorts of funny and strange effects and of course kill tons of monsters. As you play you will discover more biomes and enemies and treasures.  For the price and what you get, It's worth every penny.  8/10 would get motion sickness again.",

Buy it now.    6/22/15 Edit: Just noticed I had left 'procedurally' spelled incorrectly this entire time.",

Pros: - hyperbolic geometry; it's a completely different way of doing dungeons, with some very interesting properties - biomes - all of them have unique properties - simple rules  Cons: - character graphics - they look like a bit out of MS Paint or M. C. Escher drawings; if it's the latter, then I guess it is by design",
