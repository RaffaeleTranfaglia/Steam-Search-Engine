'Choice of Robots' the decisions you make dont feel like they impact the game as much as I would have wanted them to.   If you are new to the 'Choice games' I would still recommend Choice of Robots or Choice of the Deathless over this one because they are a bit more complex and offer a bit more feedback on how your decisions impact your character stats but if you allrdy playd a couple of Choice games this is a good addition to your collection if you are into the setting.",

I think there is even a free version but I am happy with having spent a little change to help the author. I feel like my choices actually changed the story. I am excited to go back through it!",

However, I didn't develop the same attachment to my character or the supporting cast that I did in Choice of Robots or Tin Star as examples. It might have been that as a reporter, my character was more of a story observer than a story maker. I also felt like some of the plot itself was contrived and more fed to me as a reader than something that developed through choice-based play. I consider it a decent product for its price.",
