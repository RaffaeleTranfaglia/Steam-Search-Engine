            "review_text": "Whilst I haven't played many games of the Point and Click genre, I do know that the game Scratches has a much bigger map than this one. The voice acting is good, and the graphics aren't too bad but certainly not top notch either. You may find the fonts used throughout the game (even on the main menu) offputting as they don't blend well with the game or interface in my opinion.   I bought it at a discounted price, but to be honest I am having trouble deciding whether or not it was worth that. The storyline was good but, leaves a lot to be answered as we never do meet the girl who is the 'damsen in distress' throughout the entire game. That being said though, it has an interesting theme and I did enjoy the puzzles for the most part.  As for the horror factor, there were a couple of parts that made me jump but it's not really a scary game. The music throughout was sub-par, but bear in mind this may have been made on a small budget.   In conclusion, if you like point and click games Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches has some tricky puzzles, and will be worth picking up at a discounted price. If you are looking for horror, this is very mild at best. And if bad fonts bother you, I wouldn't go for it. Still, I'd recommend it as I managed to finish the game and the story is fairly thorough.",

            "review_text": "Words are not enough to express my dislike of this game - glitches that cause part of the menu to poof for good; events that seem to undo themselves because you did something out of order... the simple fact that you can do some things out of order is annoying because there are so many you can just  not  do until the game deems it time. If the item I want is right in front of me, just let me grab it. There were some okay puzzles, but a lot of them were random as heck and nonintuitive or just plain made no sense at all. The story left a lot to be desired as well, and what little you get simply comes from far too much reading, so by the time you get to story text that would be interesting, you are just so tired of filler text that you don't care enough to read it. Navigating in this game was also a major pain and some areas were awkard and could not be reached unless you moved in a certain way that made no sense. The ending was a let down that had me going 'huh, is that it?'   The girl magically comes back off-screen after putting a cloud of smoke in the ground... yeah okay where was she, what happened to her really? We hear nothing about where she was all this time? Well.... let's just cover that all up with a 'twist' that says the unnamed woman who died just so happened to be the mother of the dude helping you with the translations... not that that adds a single thing to the story, and I kinda expected it with the way he was so into the lore, etc., that he'd chat up a seemingly-'losing it' young girl.    P.S. I swear to god you are some kind of diary voyeur because you snoop so so many of them in this game, and despite most of the entries being filled with garbage or blank pages that you still have to flip through (which may be more realistic but tedious), you always go back for more the next time you see one.",

This is one of my favorite Myst-like adventures. if you can still enjoy the slide show style of movement, and you like a creepy (if not genuinely scary) vibe, try it out. I love the setting and the sound, and once you get over a few quirks in the inventory interface, the puzzles mostly make sense.  This game makes me wish I was Welsh.",
