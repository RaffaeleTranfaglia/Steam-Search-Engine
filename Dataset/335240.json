            "review_text": "It seems that the developers of Transformice have finally found a new way of labeling and sugar coating unaddressed bugs and glitches by calling them 'hectic physics'. As fun and cute as this game is, I would keep away from it if you're not okay with frustrating bugs, persistent server crashes, overly dramatic staff, incomplete updates, and with that, updates that only seem to break the gameplay. If you were to even log in now and click shift+enter, you'd see an incomplete UI update bug that hasn't been addressed for almost 2 weeks, and we'll be lucky if it ever is. If you enjoy developers releasing an untested update on a game expecting users to beta test it for them (as if they look at user suggestions and reports), click download now. But all in all I think there's a lot about this game that makes it not 'steam ready'.  If you ignore the brokenness of the game and look at the community, you won't find too much better. I wouldn't come to Transformice expecting to find a kind community that will help you improve your skills. Expect to be called noob, cussed at, and made fun of for being a beginner, although there's a few kind souls out there that will help you out. A lot of spam too, but you can ignore spam and other users you don't like, so long as you don't ignore so many that you pass your ignore list limit of 500!  But hey, if you like dressing up mice in outfits and can put up with everything stated here (and more!) then maybe this might be worth checking out for you. I've still playing this game after 4 years and for some reason can't stop logging in every day...and it's free to play too. Expect this game to get over-whelmingly positive reviews from a spamming majority of the user base that seems to idolize anyone in a position of power.",

This game is plagued by a terrible community just like every other game, however it's cute attention to detail and the competitive community on steam make it a worthy game. So long as you can deal with ignoring the chat.  However not everyone in the game is like that, this game is a worthy steam game and is really fun, it's just once again communities tend to get large, or get plagued with asshats that just LOVE to ruin your fun.  I give the game a 8/10, the game itself at least. It can run on potato but it does still lag here and there in the larger rooms. Find yourself a smaller room, get some friends and learn the basic ropes before you go into the major rooms where people can just ruin your day. Hell, I'd love to play with some of you guys! As a LoL Player I can pretty much just soak in the toxicity and spit it into the garbage can.",

Not a hardmode game, just a stupid one. I played this MANY years ago as a browser game, promptly forgot about it, and then could not remember why I quit. Let's just say it took me under five minutes to remember why. Also, a game that hasn't updated or changed in the past five years or so, except for monetization? Yeah, no. Improve things!  0/10.",

It's a great multiplayer game for a large group of friends who don't typically screw each other over, or a riot to screw EVERYONE over as the shaman mouse.   The controls do take some getting used to, especially the spells, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be launching the other mice to their doom while getting the cheese all to yourself. Master wall jumping as soon as you can, because it can literally make the difference between death and SQUEAKING by with a victory! *again, pause for laughter or groaning*",

In the beginning of the round a player is chosen at random to be the shaman rat and assist the others with boxes and boards.

There are many different levels with varying difficulty for all kinds of players, ensuring it can still be a fun game even after mastering the strategies required to come out on top.

Now, the community is a WHOLE other beast. It's really, really bad. This is a kids game. Combine CoD, Dota and LoL together and you still get a rather pleasent community compared to this monster.  While you can't really influence the community, at least SOME moderation would be nice because currently it's non-existent.  If this game starts getting acceptable graphic and netcode as well as some moderating for their community, I'll reconsider this review. Before they do that however, I recommend you stay far away from this game.",

And some shamans ( not Pink/Blue maps) will kill mice for no reason, don't they know theres a survivor mode?  In the game, you get items for your inventory, which can be fun, summoning beach balls, chickens, paper balls, and strange yet awesome energy balls, flying airplanes, and getting coins (shaman coins, survivor coins, and so on).

Theres nothing wrong with them, you can write on the map, doing whatever you like, and i mean ' WHATEVER' you like, This means players can draw something disgusting, which they do most of the time  And finally (mostly because i have no idea what else to put)..... the Chat Box  You can type whatever you want, it's not like Animal Jam (Or this is what i think, i don't really play it :P) will block your message that says anything bad such as ' I love you ', but Tfm lets you marry so im fine with that part i guess..   And although its a 13+ game, kids still play it! This game will easily hurt ( and by HURT i mean Cyberbullying ) them just by someone saying over and over, ' N00b Sham '   At the same time, I recommend just because of how it works, but then, i don't, because of the community and its awful ways...  yet, i still play it! But not often...",

The gameplay is simple enough, run to get the cheese with a special round everyonce in a while where you get magic. Simple, but it also has enough going on that a good player can easily stand out in a crowd. Of course the key to getting the full enjoyment out of this game for me is finding a good room. The best games of transformice aren't that way just because there are considerate players (which is nice too), often its been the very active and lively chat thats kept me getting cheese into the wee hours of the night. I've played this game on and off over the years and seen the transformation (he he) that its gone through. It's come a long way and Im glad to see it finally made it to steam. And for all you wj-ers, rushers, pro-firsters, pro-shams and bad souls out there, yes you can log into your old account and you will retroactively earn all the achievements you deserve. woot.",

            "review_text": "Despite me only having 15 minutes logged at the time of the review, I have been playing this game on and off since late 2010. What I can say is that the game is an average game at best with okay physics but a lack of necessary features and some bugs can make the game rather grueling to endure.  The game's premise is simple: collect the cheese by using wasd or arrow keys and then return to the mouse hole to earn points. In time, you become the shaman with the ability to build platforms for the others to traverse. You also get skill points to then use in a skill tree to get more passive abilities as shaman or completely new abilities. It's a solid concept and it is enjoyable. There are also multiple room types. Regular rooms have a normal map rotation comprised of official maps and then permanent community made maps while vanilla rooms only uses the official maps made by the developer. Furthermore, the business model is sound, using in game purchases only for cosmetics rather than game changing effects.  However, there are no rebindable keys to speak of. This will turn off quite a few people. Secondly, the tutorial is clearly lacking, completely omitting any sort of shaman tutorial. Being a decent shaman is rather difficult and the community will be quick to call you names should you fail. Finally, the steam client is a little choppy. You're better off using the official site or downloading the non-steam client for the time being.  All in all, it's an okay game. The lack of key features will make the game not as appealing to most but for a free game, what are ya gonna do?  Also the community can get to CoD and Dota 2 levels of hostility.",

It can be little hard at beggining, when you will join a room full of experienced players doing things that didn't go well for you but it takes not a long time to fit in. There are lots of people playing it so you don't have to worry that it's another multiplayer game without players.

You play as Lil mice which has to get ones to the cheese and back to the hole. It gives (mostly) a shamane-Mice which can help the others with stairs, balls, baloons and like. Problem here: The Shamane is INGAME with all the other mices (unlike Lemmings where the 'Guide' is just a mouse-arrow). :3  -Nice Grafic The full game lucks just cute, really. Its lovely made, you have a lot of funny Animations for the mices. Dancing, crying, kiss, anger and like can you just show ingame with a lil gesture. Its really nicely done!  -NO P2W! This game has NO PAY TO WIN! Thats really a great thing which sucks in free to play games. The game has maybe a Ingame store but its -ONLY- Cosmetik stuff for your mice (also cute things, honeslty :3). But Exp and like do you only get if you play the game. That do i call fair :3  - Really nice Multiplayer game The full game is based to play as Team with the other mices. You must see what you can do or how you could help.   Fazit: I love this game. It remembers me back in time were i played Lemmings. Transformice is also cute and pretty easy to play. The Shamane Role is a bit harder but after some time you get the drill. Also i love the Teamplay modes and the map editor. Honestly, Such game, FULL FREE with NO P2W...You really should give it a try.

I've been playing transformice since 2011, but I had not played it since it was released on steam. What I found was the following:  -It was still primarily a platform racing game. -Some more skills had been added, which was neat. -My tribe was still very active and they all wecomed me back warmly.  -A group of people in room 12 were discussing how difficult certain maps were on the new 'Divine' mode. -In room 11 A group of friends all joined the room right after I did, greeted eachother, and then proceeded to joke about and swear at each other in a variety creative ways for several minutes. My favorite colourful phrase was probably '♥♥♥♥ crust'. It quite reminded me of my own friends. -In survivor2, players were taunting each other, as is normal for a game mode that involves trying to kill the other players. -In most other rooms players were complaining about the high levels of lag. Indeed, even my ping was well over 2000.    While I will concede that at times there are many players who can be rude or bratty, toxic chat content is not - in my experience - more prevelant here than in any other mmo. Unless you're in a room with many brazilian players, then you should expect to be cursed out in a mix of portugese and broken english.  Conclusion:  The community is fine, unless you are quite sensitive to playful profanity. If anthing is a horrible problem in transformice, it is certainly the lag.",

Its a godly ammount of fun and I think I would suicide if I was unable to play it for 4 hours, more addiciting then drugs and just so beautiful. I cant sleep at night anymore until I have played this game for hours on end, it makes me feel safe, it makes me feel happy, it makes me feel good.... Uhhhh yeah the review.  In the game you play as a poor little mouse in a 2D anime world, disowned by your mother, abused by your farther, your objective is to get the Cheese at the end of the stage so you can feel happy again. However you aren't the only reject on the streets, there is also others (Which in this case: Other players) and they also want the cheese. There is enough for everyone but who will be the one to pull the trigger? The game is a platformer with a twist! There are loads of mice and usually a Shaman, each player takes turns to be the Shaman and well the Shaman is the almighty god of mice, chosen by Jesus Christ to lead the mouse to victory and give them what they deserve. The Shaman gets accsess to spawning items and using arrows which the game for some reason calls cannons, they also have there own skill tree and can have additonal stuff like teleportation, respawns, ability to ressurect mice and spawn cheese or even send them straight to the exit. However they aren't chosen because of how they act and how they are, some Shamans are inexpirenced and just don't have the mental ability to lead the other mice to victory, some Shamans are evil and wish to cause further pain and suffering. The mice in the game have 2 skill tree's and can only do basic stuff like jump and climb certain blocks, they can also climb grass by doing a certain glitch but were not counting that. The music is a little bit off and on in the game, sometimes it decides to start and sometimes it dosen't. It dosen't loop either. The levels can sometimes be difficuilt depending on how your team is and how smart the Shaman is (Sometimes in the Soul Mate levels your soul mate can be AFK, making the level impossible) GAMEMODES Bootcamp: Its like practice mode really Transformice: If I explained it I think you would have later questioned my explanation considering it is above this text Vanilla: No stupid maps, No crotch sculptures. Only play maps that the swagmastering admins have made Survival: Shamans are your enemy, they seek pleasure from your pain. Don't let them abuse you and deliver you into eternal suffering Music: Submit music or videos to play in a mini box while you play or die!  Now the microtransactions They are there, but there not forceful. You can get things faster but it wont negatively effect other users or put them at a disadvantage, besides why buy stuff off the skill tree's if you can buy hats and hair and daggers!  Pro's: + Multiplayer is pretty good + Quickmatch system works well + You get a free badge for downloading the Steam version + Title system and level system + Its free + Its beautiful and the story is so greatly written + Its good for your soul + It makes you feel good inside and everywhere...I mean...evvverrryyywwwhhherrree + Its gods creation Cons: - You don't earn cheese fast enough to be able to get most items in the store, meaning you would have to play for days which is fine but y'know... - Music mode has its problems... depending on who your playing with - The mice and Shaman look pretty crappy when your not taunting - Fullscreen is fiddlely - Not all achivements in the game are featured in the Steam achivements  The only glitch I really uncovered was how my chat in Music mode would not go through. I kept switching server to server and other players couldn't see my chat at all. Overall I give this game a 8- no 10/10  You should download it right now, don't even think about not playing it. If you don't have enough storage space just uninstall your browser and other steam games, trust me its worth it. The game is just so addicting, its so well made. I actually feel at peace when playing it and I can always have a good laugh. I don't even feel the need to go anywhere out of this game's distance, not even the bathroom. I only really stop playing the game when I go to sleep (Which is after 10-20 hours of playing it) and im still playing it as I write this review. I play it when im eating my pizza, when im awnsering skype calls, when im replying to steam messages, when I get up, when im calling the pizza delivery, when im getting the pizza. I never really stop playing It just feels so...good...it makes me cry tears of joy on how good this game is, it makes me get really, really hot. *Ahem* Now if you excuse me I have a game to return to.",

Myself I would recommend this game but strongly warning that the community is toxic (e.g. 12 years old). However it often comes in standard gamemode such as vanilla or normal room, I'm pretty sure most of people there don't feel pleasant with slow action since they have to repeat the same maps again and again. While some other gamemode provide much higher challange but you can be sure that the community is way better there, however they are all tough gamemode for newbie.  Pos experience: + Different gamemode lead to different challange + Amazing unexpected bug + Time killing  Neg experience: + Acid community + Unfair player skill level, some skills are way advantage on a gamemode  So what I would recommend is the good experience only come through in a certain of time playing, and it will be much difficult to the one who not yet know.

The shaman thing adds nice variety. PLAYING as the shaman though, that is crazy hard to learn. I might have missed the tutorial for it, but the only time I played as the shaman there were no pop-ups on how to play or anything. The game just said that I was the shaman and had to get the mice to the cheese, that was all. So naturally with the knowledge I have from previous games, I totally failed. Otherwise great fun but not for those who want a game that they can play for more than 50 hours.",

I love it. Maybe too much... How am I addicted to a game that doesn't involve violence!? I also did a microtransaction on this game.... That's not like me.... I rarely do that.... I'm thinking about doing another one.... HELP ME IT'S SUCKING ME IN!  This game is hysterically chaotic, hectic, and feels like a social experiment sometimes. It's simple but allows for a whole bunch of possibilities. You are one of dozens of mice that must make it through an obstacle course as fast as possible. Most of the time, someone becomes a shaman and must save as many mice as he/she can by building planks, boxes, balloons, cannonballs, etc.   There is also a plethora of getup you can buy using the cheese you've been collecting or with 'fraisies' that you can buy via microtransatons. Therefore, it's not pay-to-win, it's pay-to-look-kewl (or at least cute in this game...)   There is one major drawback in this game that may turn people away: it doesn't have the best community in the world.... not even close: Horny youngsters, harassers, hax callers, new player haters, tryhard enthusiasts, scrubby noobs... I'm hesitant to join the official forums at the site...  I say that if you join, stay on the default server you get placed in once you log in. It's usually the kindest place. Emphasis on 'usually'.   I'm loving this game. I already uploaded a let's play on it, made some fanart, and even got a sweet look going. I say give this game a shot!  Also represent in the Steam Awards.
