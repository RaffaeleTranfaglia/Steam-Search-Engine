            "review_text": "Ave!  A great, old school rpg and its really immersive for its archaic 2D graphics, as soon as you get a hang of it, you're in Ancient Roman era , fantasy britannia. Details and depth are really nice with many easter eggs, rich with history and has a really good sense of humour.   The mechanics are satisfactory, got traits like fallout and skill point buy like MM's. It's sand-box'ish you can do your quests in any order as long as your party is skillful enough, travel anywhere if you have enough food in your bag, talk to everyone in game world provided you're not a Roman trying to find his/her way in a brigantes village. You can play both as Romans and Britons, they have slightly different stories.  This game totally amazed me, by giving me much more than i had anticipated, made me wonder what is missing in most modern games.   If you like 2D rpgs and can endure the mechanics like of Might &amp; Magic, it will be a worthy purchase for its price.  8/10 , at least",

            "review_text": "Nethergate is and old game but that does not make it any less great.  The game takes place in the ancient roman times, you either pick between the romans or celts. Both offer a unique campaign and different gameplay styles which adds a lot of replayability. You control a group of various characters, typical rpg archetypes that have strength and weaknesses. The game offers a very good story campaign, despite the old graphics the game is very rich in text and dialogue. Furthermore it's very well written and quite atmospheric and just adds a lot to the overall enjoyability of this game. It might not be for everyone but I highly value the flavor texts and attention to detail.  The story itself is interesting and actually really unique, you party needs to fulfill various quests and venture into the unknown facing all kinds of dangers and delicate situations. The game is a grid based tactical rpg which is played in turns. The gameplay is actually quite smooth and holds up well to this day. You have access to a large overworld and visit various places to fulfill your quests.  The only downside of this game might be the outdated graphics but don't get me wrong it still plays very nicely and does not feel that clunky. It's definitely worth it for someone who values good rpgs with solid mechanics and nicely narrated storyline.",
