I picked up a key in a building early in the game and died, and had to restart. I did nothing to deserve to die ! Bad translation aside it should not be this unplayable. I don't know how to progress. There is some effort put into this idea, but these guys don't know how to make a game with even basic standard options. Should be taken off steam!",

I bought a random Steam CD key from a G(2)A for fun and decided it was worth the investment. Boy, was I willy wonky right!!!   Red Lake provides nothing short of fantastic visuals, with it's realistic graphics, stunning 3D animations and A.I., bone-chilling and atmospheric music, in-depth and all out customizable controls, top of the line and detailed guns with only the most bountiful arsenal, and best of yet: breath taking gameplay.   This game had me on edge for every single minute that I invested in it and I will never regret having spent all those sweet and precious moments playing this game. In fact, this game was so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing that I didnt even want to beat it. Kinda like tearing out the last page of a book so it never ends :D  I would reccomend this life changing game to anyone and everyone. Kids, adults, seniors, whoever the person and whatever the age, this game fits all. To all of those that hate the game, they're just jealous of it's majesty and magnificence. Only nobodys would judge such a perfect and spotless game, they're all inferior.  This game took my heart and soul and gave back so much more.  12/10",
