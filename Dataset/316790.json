Everything has a legitimate reason, and if you don't see it you're not paying close enough attention. Old school or not, fans of adventure games need to play this.  11/10 - probably the best game I've played in a really long time.",

            "review_text": "Does this game really need introducing? Grim Fandango: Remastered is the remastered version of a noir adventure game with humourous dialogue. You play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent at the Department of Death, who is trying to sell enough luxury packages to get out of the land of the dead and in to the afterlife. Sadly things do not go so well for Calavera and he becomes entangled in a conspiracy that threatens to keep in the land of the dead forever.  While the remastered version isn't the super duper HD remake that some people felt entitled too it does give people, like myself, who have not played the game before an excellent opportunity to play a real classic.  +The character models have been redone and look great +An interesting and unique setting, the land of the dead +Intriguing characters, each with their own backstory and relevance to the plot +Good story +Terrific voice acting, especially the voice actor for Manny +Brilliant writing which not only makes you want to play more but also leads to some really funny lines +Outstanding soundtrack +Easy-to-use controls which, from what I hear, are far better than the original control scheme +Keys can be rebound and the game also has full controller support +You can switch between the new and old graphics with the press of a button +Optional developer commentary  +/-The puzzles are extremely difficult and as someone who hasn't played it before and has never played a puzzle game with a similar difficulty before I found myself using a guide for all of the puzzles and even then some of them were still difficult +/-There are a lot of complaints about bugs in the game but thankfully I have not encountered any yet  -When they remastered it they didn't put it in 16:9 so it's in 4:3 with bars on the side (admittedly the bars do actually fit well with the game), you can run it in 16:9 but then everything is stretched -Towards the end of Year 1 and throughout Year 2 you have to do a lot of running back and forth which gets pretty tedious -Lip sync is very hit and miss  Verdict: 9  An absolute classic which is a must have for fans of point and click adventure games and still holds up well 17 years after its original release.

You could just as well play the original, because, besides a few light effects and a bit sharper textures on characters (not in the cutscenes mind you) it IS the original. I expect a lot more when a company republishes a timeless classic like this. Seeing 'render bucket lines' from outdated renderingmethods, making small rectangles all across the screen just doesnt cut it. It would not be hard to render this again, and give it the treatment that it SHOULD have, and hey, get it in a HD format like 16:9 or 16:10. Looking at 4:3 format with a texture border, rectangles making color noise and different formats on cutscenes and ingame.... NO.  Get the original game instead, at least then you won't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about the halfassed job they've made with 'remastering' the game.",

            "review_text": " The Right Way Play the whole game with tank controls. Tim demanded this achievement.  Oh Tim, Tim, Tim. A good game designer that still cares is trapped within you somewhere, but I don't know where it is these days. You make mediocre games that don't sell and try to appeal to an audience that doesn't play video games... as opposed to when you made amazing games that didn't sell and appealed to people that did play and enjoy games, but just like the people that post on Neogaf, you're a full blown cuck now that doesn't care anymore, cashing in on subpar concepts, selling them, then quickly abandoning them when you don't see profit. You've become the thing you've hated: A cold and calculating robot businessman that wants to sell products rather than make art.  Tim Schafer is the best possible example of the old adage about never meeting your heroes, cause you'll just meet hack frauds.  Speaking of hack frauds, there is nothing worse than seeing the Double Fine logo appear before the start of this game. Not only did they have nothing to do with what made Grim Fandango great, but they ruined this port as much as they could. I've crashed this game twice. TWICE. I didn't even know it was possible to glitch and break GF, but Double Fine sure made it possible.  On top of making it possible to break the game, some of the character models will jump erratically in place. Whether it's the cause of broken/corrupt animation files or poor programming, I don't know, but this is inexcusable for a 'remaster'.  On that subject, the quality is still what it's always been. It looks exactly like how I remember it (outside of the missing frames or animation from the original)... because they didn't change anything, but not that they needed to. This is still a gorgeously designed game, but even I noticed the artifacts and weird compression that was necessary for the time it was made on the backgrounds or the cinematics. Is there anything they could have done? Well maybe they could have remastered a game that they still had the master files to. It was no doubt a better choice to just leave it rather than tamper with it and make it ugly like Resident Evil Remake HD.  They did however tarnish how seamless the original felt by throwing up stupid HUD icons made specifically for console gamers or just modern gamers, cause I think even consoles gamers aren't dumb enough not to realise that they can press up or down to do something in game. No Doublefine, we don't need those out of place icons. PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY TO SKIP THE CUTSCENE! Gee thanks.  One of my favorite things to do in the original was to save at specific points just so I could mess around or explore them. Some of my favorite moments included the poetry slam at the Blue Casket or the real world with the real humans. I'd give the files their own names and everything, and I could make as many as I wanted. CAN'T DO THAT NOW! They made Grim Fandango into some bad survival horror game, as I'm locked to only 8 slots for some stupid reason.  I do remember when they hyped how the new game would have remastered music. Didn't sound any different really than I remembered it. It's still one of the best soundtracks ever produced to any game, period. If there was anything that needed to be touched up, it wasn't this.  There's also something straight up broken about the new tank controls. I'd get myself caught in door loops over and over (which is to get you to go in and out of the same area over and over if you're not careful) in a way that I didn't in the original. There were also new point and click controls that were added but I didn't try them because you'd have to be an idiot to play this game like that.  Does this remastered version do anything right that's new? Well... the commentary I guess, but even then I'm scared to hear that Tim will say that every character is a pangender neutral skeleton soul, or that Grim Fandango is problematic/misogynist cause females are sometimes the bad guys or that he was appropriating Mexican culture when he made this as he's a disgusting evil white male. Yuck. Go away Double Fine.  I'm not saying you should bust out your old CDs or to order yourself a copy off eBay. At the end of the day, this is still Grim Fandango, and even broken Grim Fandango is worth experiencing. It homages the classics like Casablanca or His Girl Friday but without having to rip them off. GF also sports one of the most creative universes I've ever seen in a video game. Yes, it's based on the Day of the Dead, but it's so realised like nothing before or since. The puns, the jokes, the characters, the setting. Everything clicks and works. I've never forgotten a thing and know it like the back of my hand... but I had to play it again. Even despite my disdain for Double Fine. It's just one of those kind of games.  Tim Schafer might have killed adventure games with his ridiculous budget that he obtained from Lucasarts for this game, but to be honest, this was something to go out on a bang on. I'd be fine with him bankrupting any company as long as he made games like this. If this remaster was more about convenience and getting it to new players, fine, but to a purist like myself, this is still nowhere even close to the best way to play this classic. Recommended but with an asterisk. Buyer beware of what you're getting into.  The Pro's:  +It's Grim Fandango  The Con's:  -It's buggy Grim Fandango ",

            "review_text": "When we die we are no longer met with a void, instead, we are driven to a travel agents office, an agent doing community service in the hopes of getting away from it all. But all the clients he gets are a bunch of “deadbeats” that aren't going to further his goals of working off his community service or sell enough premium travel packets so that he can leave this “Land of the dead”; a state of limbo in the form of a menial, tiresome, job for the average working dead man. This agent, Manny, is working as a Grim Reaper offering travel arrangements for the newly deceased. With this introduction we realize that death has as many hardships as life, and we're soon to realize the extent of it.  Grim Fandango immediately strikes us with a depressing undertone: a laborious economical hierarchy is the erzats of the idea of paradise, and the jouissance of everlasting life in a heavenly realm is as laughable as it should be when it is ironically juxtaposed to what Grim Fandango conveys. Contrasting the drabness and tiredness of this limbo and the subject of death itself, with the incredibly jovial tone of the game and the obvious Mexican influences (Día de Muertos, where the dead and death is celebrated and the attitude towards death is rather lighthearted in general), creates a constant tug of war between disjunctive emotive states that somehow perfectly match each other.  What you notice not before long is how stingy the game is with hints. You have so very little go on in each turn of the game and it's not rare that you sometimes stumble upon the solution before you even know what you are supposed to accomplish. The problem is not clearly conveyed and therefore it's difficult to really follow what the game wants you to do. Fortunate enough, the game world and the conversations are entertaining enough to warrant some dillydallying, even though it is on the edge of returning to the sphere of annoyance and frustration it just manages to keep you going.   Moreover, the puzzle design and solutions are a bit nonsensical. Not in the way that they are impossible to figure out or take you a whole lot of time to figure out once the problem is laid out, but in the absurdity of it all. The puzzles have a certain path or linearity to them that makes it somewhat simple, you just try everything available and everything comes naturally, but when you step back and retroactively think about the puzzle, you realize the absurdity of its solution and can't help but laugh. Items are placed with the ilk of haphazardness, and the aleatory coming forth of characters often attribute to this overall lostness and entanglement a player may feel or find themselves in. The nonsense and madness has a structure and form that is not unimaginably difficult to see through, the objectives are veiled or very subtle, but the required actions are transparently easy to imagine in many places, especially for a player keen on exploring. Mindlessness is oddly enough probably a better prerequisite than thoughtfulness in this particular game. Your ideas have to digress, regress and follow the illogical nature of “just doing”. This creates an interesting challenge for veteran puzzle players, and a helpfulness for those that are not familiar with the game genre: the knowledgeable have to reevaluate their problem solving, and the unfamiliar can flail about and still hit the button of progression. I shouldn't undermine the puzzle-design too much, though. It is still wonderfully thought-provoking and funny, and there's really more logic and sense to a lot of it than you may think. Mainly, you just have to surrender yourself to the game's logic, or non-logic, which is something I was more than willing to do, despite the silliness.   Despite an interesting story, premise and generally wonderful art-design and style choices, the game can look quite awful which slightly lessens the over all impression. Most animations still look dated, textures vary in quality and the same goes for lighting. Personally, the parts that look bad are negligible, and the negation of that made it an emaciated attempt at ruining my experience, but I know others may differ in how they approach graphical quality, so it should be stated that the game doesn't look fantastic at all points, but it is easily negatable.  The mixing was also one of these things that brought the game down a bit in some places. And this was to me not as easy to ignore, since I can always look away from the ugliness, but the auricular noise is unavoidable and with bad mixing, it can interfere with dialog, which hinders progress and thus becomes an annoyance. A lot of the sounds just doesn't sound nice either, like the design of effect-sounds can be really jarring and difficult to listen to, especially when they repeat. Like the driving section – which, by the way, may have been the worst driving section of any game I've ever played – where to music was very loudly intermixed with the motors rumbling and created this painful cacophony that along with the cars awful handing made this part very difficult to enjoy, despite it being in the company of our very lovable personal driver.  I hate to keep going with the negatives with a game like this. But the game doesn't have an autosave function. That's perfectly alright, it forces you to keep track on your progression and where you are, it also gives you the power to stop whenever you want to without having to retread old steps, but when the game can lock itself into a state where you are forced to restart, you really need something like an autosave or a checkpoint system. There is no way to predict if a game is buggy or not, so if you don't save because you know you're going to play for a while, and then the game bugs out on you, you're stuck either leaving the game for another day, due to frustration, or going through the same thing you just did all over again. This is really not acceptable in any game, honestly. Sure, the game is wonderful, but redoing everything retracts from that impression, unfortunately, and replaces any joy with frustration. There's something sad about losing immense enjoyment from something so basic like not having the game hardlock. I am not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but it happened during my playthrough.  In reality, we all probably know what Grim Fandango is, and it's great to see it come back for a later generation and for those that never got around to playing this classic game. The small issues that are game-related, like hardlocking and retreading is forgivable due to the substance of the game and are easily worked around by saving often, it's just sad to see something like that wear down on an otherwise incredible game. Grim Fandango is in fact truly unique, as you might imagine, and its setting is interesting in a way that not many games are. The humor is that of any classic Tim Schafer game that in accordance with some of the greastest character designs is worth it solely based on that, but you get a whole lot more, as long as you don't expect a remastered version to be entirely perfect, because it isn't, you will find a lot of enjoyment in this game, for both for the thoughtful and the mindless side of yourself.",

At first, I must admit, I didn't like it at all. The graphics seems dated in a bad way, and I found the first few scenes uninspiring.   After following a walkthrough for most of the first chapter, things started to get more interesting and I was able to really get into it. I found myself really rooting for Manny and wanting to help him get to where he needed to be. The puzzles were challenging, the storyline had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged, and the art deco inspired artwork and jazzy soundtrack grew on me. There are some unique devices in this game (I thought sprouting was such a cool visual and cultural quirk) and in the end, I could see why it has become such a classic. I'd definitely recommend it for fans of point-and-click, story-led, character-rich adventure games.",

            "review_text": "What's there to say about  Grim Fandango  that hasn't already been said? I don’t think I need to recount how, despite a sterling critical reception, it sold so poorly that it signalled the - mercifully temporary - death of the P’n’C genre. This game about death, starring a bunch of skeletons on a mission to reclaim their rightful destiny. Now, in this remastered version, given a second chance at un-life, have they finally done it?  Aye, I suppose they have. Let me explain.  Okay, so  Grim Fandango  is a great game, we all know this. The sultry dialogue sizzles with attitude, the characters are desperate and devious, lovable and loathsome. The performances are top of the class, seriously.   It’s flawed, yeah. Oh yeah, it’s flawed as hell. After a strong start in the art deco masterpiece that is El Marrow, you’ve got a short, silly section in some brown woods with a bunch of trial and error puzzles. Then Rubacava, a massive area, with more interesting characters than I’ve space to list. A place you’ll really lose yourself, speaking both metaphorically and literally (it is a big area…)  And then more trial and error ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a bit later on, and the denouement, which is just too small and brief to leave much of an impression. I don’t want to give too much away, so excuse me if I sound like I’m being flippant, or overly critical. There aren’t any truly terrible parts, but it’s inconsistent. There are signs that parts of the game have been rushed, and there are some puzzles that it might have been better off just leaving out entirely. But, I can’t think of any other adventure games which don’t have rough spots and dodgy puzzles. The highs of  Grim Fandango  are higher than most other games of this type. I don't mean to be fawning, but this game has a lot of soul.  So, what have they changed with this remastered version? The biggest thing is that now it’s entirely playable with the mouse! Nice! I’m not sure it was so terrible having to play with the keyboard, but hey, it’s good to have the option. Probably I’m a weird anomaly ‘cos I played with a controller anyway, but that worked fine, so yeah, thumbs up there.   Then there’s the textures. They’ve been redone, at much higher res than before. They look alright but it doesn’t make that much difference really, when most characters are just suit and skull, or boiler suit and fat orange arms. There’s also some shadowing thrown in, but literally the only place I noticed it was in Manny’s office, in front of the venetian blinds.  Grim Fandango  looked fine, it didn’t need to be prettied up, but it would be churlish to complain, really.  The big draw about this edition is dead simple. You can buy it. You can’t buy the old one, and haven’t been able to for some time. But, now you can, and that’s wonderful. Even better, there’s an option in most areas to listen to director’s commentary, enlightening chat from some of the finest minds in the industry. And Tim Schafer.  And, did I mention that the music has been entirely redone? It’s all orchestrated now, and that’s worth the asking price alone.",

I grew up playing LucasArts adventure games (see the icon), and I loved almost all of them. But Grim Fandango was such a different game, born in the awkward tween years between 2D and decent 3D, and I couldn't get around the controls.   Well, that issue has largely been fixed, with modernized controls. And that's great, because the game has fantastic writing, graphics as gorgeous as thick polygons can be, and a generally awesome sense of style. It's a cool, funny world. I want to like it. I want to love it.  But here's the thing: the puzzles are terrible.   I mean, all the puzzles in all those games are terrible. They all involve trial and error for hundreds of insane combinations. None of them are even approaching logical. I remember spending so much time looking up solutions for Monkey Island on a BBS, because the dialogue was worth the trouble.  But the games are artifacts of a bygone age, where puttering around aimlessly and seeing what happens when you use the banana on the typewriter was acceptable, because there weren't that many games, and these games seemed like the most expansive ones out there.  Now we live in a world with a glut of games. So many that I find myself evaluating games on 10 minutes of play. I'll say Grim Fandango deserves more than that, and it got it; I played for four hours (with a walkthrough, because honestly, those puzzles), and I never got the kind of enjoyment I'd get from an open world game which sucks away hours with engaging content, not busywork.  If I had played Grim Fandango when it first game out, I'm sure I'd still be smitten. And I know I'm spoiled by modern game design. But Grim Fandango commits the ultimate sin of game design: it fails to respect my time. And I don't have time for that.",

For which I am thankful, I'd wanted to play this one for a while but probably would've never gotten around to it if not for the remaster.  I do wish that they had at least fixed up a number of game-breaking bugs; more than once I got caught in an infinite animation loop that forced me to reload a save, and there was one spot where the game crashed a few times while I was trying to work out a puzzle, which was quite irritating. The game still looks pretty old but with the blocky design of the characters working aesthetic I suppose it doesn't really matter much.  Gameplay-wise the puzzles... vary. There's a bit of moon logic here and there and the area map for year 2 is a bit big and daunting and kind of hard to figure out everything you need to do in it, but it vaguely makes sense overall, I supppose. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than the average in terms of gameplay, but it's alright enough.  The real draw here is the characters and the writing, both of which are quite good. The game has a noir-tinged mexican aesthetic and a lot of the characters play to that, making for a pretty diverse and unique cast with a lot of personality. Glottis in particular is especially loveable, and a lot of the villains are the best kind of hateable. And there's a number of other characters thta leave an impact, and a few noteworthy death scenes as well, the story isn't tame by any means. And there's a good sense of humor running through everything too. It's just a pleasant game world that keeps me invested in the game when the puzzles do not.  The game's a decent length, too; over 10 hours on my first playthrough and that was with resorting to a guide a few times when I got really stuck (because at the point where things stop being fun I don't want to ruin the game by allowing it to let me suffer). The third and fourth chapters do feel a bit rushed compared to the rest though, things happen really fast but everything feels like it gets tied up in a satisfying enough way by the end so it's not a huge problem.  There's not really a lot negative to say about this, and the remaster even includes some nice developer commentary (implemented in the most infuriating way though, seriously now...) But yeah, it's a good game, though I wouldn't personally call it a great one, but still.",

The opening sequence is one of the best I've seen for an adventure game. I quite enjoyed playing Year 1; however, once I got to the Petrified Forest, the gameplay kind of went downhill. The puzzles became obtuse enough that I had to start referring to walkthroughs. I hit two bugs in the Petrified Forest - one having to do with the flaming beavers, the other happened when I tried to use the wheelbarrow. Fortunately, I was able to get past these by doing reloads.  Year 2 in Rubacave was pretty interesting, but, even though I usually knew what my goals were and what I needed to do, I often had no idea how to go about it. I don't have the patience these days to 'try everything on everything', so I looked to walkthroughs again.  Once Manny leaves Rubacava, the game really goes on the rails in the sense that there are fewer puzzles to solve and more cutscenes. The entire Coral Factory section is really boring. Moving into Year 4, I had a problem with Manny getting stuck in the doorway of the boobytrapped garage. The only way to proceed with the game was to switch to Tank Controls to get out of the room. I was referring to walkthroughs pretty heavily just to get to the end of the game.  On the positive side, I really love the characters, the environment, and the story. The game is really fun to experience, but not all parts of it are fun to play. If you love adventure games and have either a lot of patience or the kind of puzzle mind required for this game, then you should definitely get Grim Fandango. If, however, you are easily frustrated by obtuse puzzles and dislike using walkthroughs, then I suggest watching YouTube videos of playthroughs. You'll miss some of the non-required funny dialogue, but I think the game is definitely worth watching as a movie.  Note that according to the global achievements list, only 29% of players make it to the end of Year 1, 19% to the end of Year 2, 16% to the end of Year 3, and 15% to the end of Year 4.",

            "review_text": "When  Grim Fandango  was originally released in 1998, it was met with critical acclaim but poor sales. Trends in gaming were changing, and players were looking for more graphics-intensive titles with the novelty of Internet multiplayer. The age of the first-person shooter had begun and adventure games were on the wane. LucasArts, the monolith of adventure game developers, decided to cancel further development of adventure games, and let go most of their dev teams in the years that followed. For a while there, it seemed like  Grim Fandango  would be the last great adventure game ever made. When new games pushed it off the shelves, it basically became lost to time—out of print and held by a company uninterested in reviving it.  Fast forward to a little over a decade later, and adventure games are thankfully back on the up and up. LucasArts veterans at Telltale Games have achieved a noteworthy level of commercial and critical success with  The Walking Dead  games. Video game auteur and  Grim Fandango  creator Tim Schafer is finally revisiting the point-and-click adventure after his 2000 split with LucasArts; the  Broken Age  series is being developed at his own Double Fine Productions. With this new resurgence in mainstream popularity, the adventure game genre looks like it is finally here to stay. Good news for new games—great news for old ones and the people who remember them.  Now, with a new deal between the newly Disney-acquired LucasArts, Sony, and Double Fine,  Grim Fandango  is finally seeing the light of day again, by the hands of its original authors. While the adventure games of today have evolved in  Grim ’s absence, many of them are still indebted to  Fandango ’s artistic success. It’s about time we got the chance to revisit it. The remastered edition is a loving look back to an era when adventure games were not merely a thing, but the thing.  (  Read more on Deadshirt  [deadshirt.net]  )",

            "review_text": "-=DISCLAIMER=- Unlike some other reviews, this review will deal purely with what the game is like, NOT how the game runs. I don't believe that a game should be held accountable for technical difficulties that a few people experience. For me, the game runs perfectly aside from the ocassional framerate stutter.  -=END OF DISCLAIMER=-  I've never played the original Grim Fandango (I was only 3 when it came out), so nostalgia was not a factor in the purchase of this game for me. I had heard that Grim Fandango was an exceptional (if a bit lukewarm) release in the LucasArts canon, so I felt that I would be missing a piece of gaming history if I didn't play it. (Plus, I'm a huge fan of Adventure games). The game is a run of the mill adventure game on the most basic level, but stands head and shoulders above other adventure games.   THE AESTHETICS Dodgy mechanics notwithstanding, Grim Fandango's humor is where it really shines. It certainly has a decent pedigree. LucasArts is famous for their humor, and Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango's director) is a very funny guy, The story and art style is an intoxicating mixture of Art Deco, Film Noir, and Central American legend. It is serious enough to make the player understand the gravity of the story, but light enough to lampoon classic examples of Noir and even throw in an occasional pun or two. The dialog is rock solid and the voice acting is fantasic, both painting a rich and detailed world of comic intrigue. Every dialog tree is chock full of exposition and chuckle-worthy quips that range from farce to high-brow humor, though the game tends to lean more towards the latter. The story is what will keep you playing as you slog through the dated mechanics.  THE MECHANICS The original game had a strange control scheme that forgoed the standard point and click scheme and replaced it with Resident Evil-style tank controls and key presses. The new version features a more traditional point and click scheme and controller support that makes it very accesable to new fans of the genre. In theory, at least. In practice, the new control schemes are the only mechanical difference the new version has to offer. The new version suffers from issues that all adventure games suffer from. Namely, difficult puzzles. It would seem that one must use an entirely different kind of logic to solve puzzles in Grim Fandango. As a very young child, I played educational point and click games and I am a huge fan of The Dig and other LucasArts Adventure games, so I consider myself to be somewhat capable at these kinds of games. Even so, Grim Fandango mangaged to throw me for a loop during the first puzzle. The thing this game needs most is a hint system.  THE VERDICT Grim Fandango Remastered is a great game (even if Remastered is a bit too generous of a word). The mechanics are slow and have not aged well, but the fun art design, sharp humor, and fantastic voice work more than make up for it. Despite what the new control schemes would suggest, the game is not as welcoming to new fans of the genre as it at first appears. For those who already own the original, this game is only a must-buy if you cant get your original copy to work, as the new lighting and textures alone aren't worth 15 bucks. However, for those who grew up playing the original, or for those who are fans of the genre and want to experience a piece of gaming history, Grim Fandango Remastered is a must have.   PROS +Funny +Amazing Story +New Control Schemes +Art Style is Absolutely Stunning  CONS -Mechanics have not aged well -Difficult Puzzles -No Hint System -Slight Graphical Upgrade Not Worth $15  I Give It a 8.2/10",

There could have been a few somewhat more detailed 'What if I had a..?' type of clues. The logic is often similar to that in earlier games like Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road, but maybe the less whacky atmosphere of Grim Fandango doesn't invite to the same kind of lateral thinking.  But, by all means, use a walkthrough when necessary. Puzzle solving is one of the lesser rewards of the game, so no need to be ashamed if you have to use a little help when you find yourself banging your head against something and want to get back to enjoying the story – because that's what the game is about: the storytelling, the characters and all the artwork, voice acting and music that make up the atmosphere of Grim Fandango are truly wonderful.  As an enhanced release, I find it worth the cost. I have tried playing it with various mods but never gotten into it on more modern hardware as I did when it was first released and played on a 15' CRT monitor. It still shows its age, but not in any annoying ways. Also, two thumbs up for the addition of more control methods.",

Pros: -Good voice acting -Interesting story -No bugs  Cons: -Slow (when moving to places) -Difficult with no clues sometimes -Some very repetitive things -Point and Click game  I would definitly recommend this game if you are into Point and Clicks as it is way better than a lot of other point and clicks that I have played. However, if you are just looking for a game to play and are indifferent, I would recommend you buy another game. So this is a tentative recommend/don't recommend. However, for me, it wasn't that fun purely because of 'Point and Click' genre which is my intrinsic bias.  Rating: 7.6/10 ",

Levels are confusing and unclear, the camera is fixed, the graphics are still badly rendered (even with the remastered) and some of the puzzles are a nightmare to solve. I had to use a walkthrough guide to find most of the solutions.

            "review_text": "Grim Fandango was released in 1998 as the first and last 3D LucasArts adventure game. It was a success, but the lack of marketing and the three year development time had prevented it from being as successful as it should have been. In addition to this there were many other popular titles released that year, but since its release LucasArts adventure games haven't really been as successful.  Grim Fandango really is a masterpiece for its story, style/art and music and there really isn't anything like it. The story is played out from the perspective of Manuel 'Manny' Calavera during the end of his not so successful career. Manny is a travel agent escorting lost souls into the next life with a variety of transports based on how good the lives of his clients were lived. When Manny keeps facing coincidences of not being able to service his clients he seeks to steal some clientel. The one client he steals from his colleague is a beautiful soul known as Meche, and his actions result in her walking to the next life over the next four years. Manny then sets out to solve his problems and find Meche to stop his guilt and pain, and he falls in love with the romance of finding her.  The game is skillfully crafted to make the user think and pay attention to all the details, to get engrossed in the hand-drawn environments. The orchestral music fits in with the dark, retro, noir style beautifully and the original developers working with a new company have paid an enormous respect to this title. The title disappeared from shelves soon after being placed upon them, and now nearly 20 years later it has been restored on modern hardware to become available for an eternity. This title should not have been made in this day, but the massive co-ordination between Double Fine, Disney and Sony have made this possible and we should all be thankful. In fact Double Fine are planning on bringing Day of the Tentacle into the present day. It's this kind of love that the world needs more of.  There's nothing out there like this game. It's dark, noir, comical, political, complex, stylish, beautiful, crafty, testy, interesting and completely unique. What are you waiting for, haven't you bought it yet?",

You have the overall Mexican Day of the Dead/film noir cocktail world and story. Then there's the rock n'roll hot rod-riding demon, the submarine-armoured giant octopus, the fake make-up manly jaw and the main hero who smokes.

First is its buggy! as others have commented it can cause issues and take away from the experience.  The other aspect is you have to use a walkthrough. I love point'n'click games since I was a youngster and have never really felt the need for a walk through but some of these 'puzzles' are really not 'puzzles' but things you will not figure out. I got to the end of year 2 before I gave up and looked up the solution only to realise I would have never figured it out otherwise. That is very bad design, there are other parts later on that suffer from the same thing.  Its not really a 'remaster' either the character models have been updated but thats it, everything else looks exactly like the original (which I actually liked since I never played the original) but the complaints people had 20 years ago have not been fixed (regarding bugs) and thats pretty bad and lazy if you ask me.  Overall the game has a great story but in truth its far better to just watch someone do a no commentary play through of it online since the 'point and click'/gameplay elements are not worth it. That way you get to experience the thrill and wonder of the story without the frustration of the rest of the game. Truly a sweet and lovely story though.",

            "review_text": "Having never played this when it was first released in 1998, I always heard great things and wanted to try it out. Unfortunately, the game was just full of disappointment.  TECHNICAL ISSUES: I understand this is an old game, so I didn't really have any complaints about graphics or audio (though, some voices had a little distortion, like they were speaking too loud into the mic). I only had 2 technical issues. The first was the gamepad controls. They work, and you can get used to them, but they can be frustrating sometimes when the camera angle changes. The 2nd problem is some scenes were incredibly annoying to work with, where it was hard to walk in the right place. In the 1st floor of The Department of Death, there are two different routes on the opposite sides that lead you to the same room, which was really confusing.  STORY: I heard a lot of great things about this story. To me, the concept and lore of the game was very refreshing and original. I liked the setting and the overall theme. But the story as a whole was really bland. You could summarize the entire plot in maybe 2 paragraphs. I also felt the maturity of the game was really inconsistent. Some characters talked like it was a kid's TV show (especially Glottis...), but I wouldn't consider it a kid-friendly game either considering it involves gambling, swearing, and 'killing'.  GAMEPLAY: This is where I felt the game was lacking the most. First of all, you can't lose. Even when there are dangerous things, you can't even try to fail when facing them. So you might argue 'but that's because this is more of a puzzle game'. Yeah, well it's not a very good one at that. I had to look up walkthroughs for roughly half the game because most of the puzzles involved something something that I would have no reason to know (sometimes, the puzzles involved reactions that would never work in real life to any degree). Sure, I could've figured out all of them on my own eventually, but I don't feel like wandering the area interacting with everything in sight with some random object in my hand in the hopes that something will happen. For a few puzzles, I actually followed the walkthrough and I was still stuck, either because of glitches or something timing related that I, again, had no reason to know about.   Overall, the game was a chore. Maybe it'd be fine if I were still 12 years old and bored on a summer day, but as an adult this felt really mediocre and tedious.",

            "review_text": "Grim Fandango is a classic beyond classics. One of the greatest adventure games ever made, it has been a crime that the game was not available digitally until 2015. Remastered fixes that glaring problem and even manages to fix a few of the original releases issues.  I will start with the bad; The background textures have been left completely untouched. I understand this is a remastering more so than a remake, but it is bizarre to see touched up character models against environments from 1998. It makes for a weird contrast. The art style is wonderful, but the bumped up resolution doesn't do favors to the old settings.  Going back to the title, Remastered isn't even really what I would call this. For a game like Grim Fandango, I don't think this is truly a negative, but it can be misleading. This is more like a re-release for the digital age. You do have some new controls, better animations and developer commentary, but this is basically the same game from 1998.  Now on to the good; literally nothing has been changed. It irks me when games get a second lease on life, then developers feel the need to alter mechanics or out-right redo entire sequences. Tim Schafer believed in his creation enough to preserve it for the future.  That isn't to say every aspect of the classic game was perfect, but I'd rather take a flawed masterpiece over a botched remake. The style oozes personality and the voice acting helps make all the jokes zing. Grim Fandango was more focused on atmosphere than it was puzzles anyway, so the game still holds up immensely well.  When the puzzles do come up, they are sometimes a bit obtuse. Older adventure games were never founded on logic; you might get one or two puzzles that are easy to understand, but most require concentration from the player to pick up on seemingly nonsensical clues.  Every character in this game will give you a hint for a puzzle, but that puzzle may not appear for hours or their tip might be hidden within a conversation tree. It leaves you tinkering with some of the later solutions for a seemingly endless amount of time wondering where you went wrong.  Thankfully, these puzzles can be solved in any order. Grim Fandango made the smart decision to not lock players into an arbitrary path. You can fully explore most of the areas you are thrown into and go about solving them in any way. Sometimes the solutions build on each other, so doing section 3 before 1 won't matter.  Still, I can't say time has been kind to this part of the adventure. I do like that puzzles aren't the main focus, but it still is frustrating to hit a brick wall from time to time. Thankfully, the story kicks ♥♥♥ and never manages to lose a beat.  While the final chapter may be a bit short, the game culminates in a battle that feels right. Nothing comes out of left field and nearly every plot thread gets tied up. Even if there is no ultimate resolution, the journey is well worth the trouble you may experience.  Honestly, I still love this game for everything it does. I'm happy that Double Fine were able to acquire the rights back from Disney and publish this for a new generation. If nothing else, at least older players can now play the game at a proper frame rate on newer hardware.  9/10",

Character interaction is ecelent, with a lot of interesting dualogue that is fully voiced. The plot of the game evolves as you progress and it has some surprises in store.   Graphically the game aged pretty well for a 15+ year old title. It was the first game where I saw animated hands with individual fingers, mostly in older games hands were just oven mits. Clothing looks like it's worn and not just painted on, which was also a first for me. The remastered version does a great job of bringing back anti aliasing and adds higher definition textures to the 3D models. Since the backgrounds are 2D they are still in 3:4 ascpect ratio, but the do add some nice looking borders on the sides to make it less jarring on the eyes.  The story is this game's strong point and it will stay with you years after finishing it.",

            "review_text": " MY BACKGROUND:  Sometime in the 90's I read a games magazine and the front cover was Grim Fandango. I never played the game back then, but somehow the cover stuck in my mind. Some years later I was browsing the Internet if I could buy the game, but I didn't find it anywhere. Now a few months back I found the game Remastered in Steam so I had to buy it and try it. The game is remastered so it kinda reviwed the old game back to life. It still looks old, but remastering the game makes it playable for a first timer. I think that if you play a really old game today, there must be a nostalgy factor in it or otherwise it's just going to suck for you. Remastering the game to 21th century makes games playable even without earlier experiences.   ACTUAL REVIEW:  This is a point and click game which I very much enjoy. If you're not into point and clicks, this game is not for you. The game is an adventure game with lots of dialogues and humour and you advance in the game by completing puzzles. I love how the main character speaks English in a funny accent with Spanish words here and there. Love it. So far the story is very funny and I am eager to complete the story asap.  The only negative thing in the game for me is the puzzles. They didn't age too well. They are illogical and impossible. I can not complete the game without a walkthrough which I am going to use for the whole game. The story and the jokes is what I wanna experience and by using a walkthrough to solve the impossible puzzles I am gonne get just that.  Really happy that they remastered this old title for me to play and have a good time. I suggest though that you buy this game on a sale and not for the full price.",

If you first got a chance to play this game back in 1998 and are looking to re-experience the game in an updated version with better controls and director commentary, than you’ll be satisfied. While it was buggy at some points and was slightly disappointed with the lack of the updated backgrounds, the visuals still hold up fairly well 15 years later. If you’re a huge fan of the original and want to experience for old times’ sake, then you’re sure to be satisfied.  Now if you look at this game from a modern perspective and compare it to more recent adventure genre games, such as Telltale’s “The Walking Dead,” then its age does show. Grim Fandango was made in a time where people had more patience for games. A lot of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, which isn’t too much trouble with the abundance of walkthrough’s on the internet, but it just goes to show how helpful it would have been to add a hints feature to the remastered version.  If you’re a fan of DoubleFine and want to experience them at their best or are a game design student who wants to see a great example of the point and click adventure genre of the 90’s, than this is for you. For everyone else who didn’t grow up with the original, then you should shy away from the 20 dollar price tag and pick it up for no more than 5 dollars. It’s a good game to burn a weekend through with and it’s story, music, and art style are quite memorable, but it’s not worth the full retail price. ",

The new character textures look great but very out of place against the backgrounds from the original 1998 game. The lack of an auto-save feature is puzzling as well. However, where the game really shines is in its unique Day-of-the-Dead style story and interesting character development.  The short 5-6 hour play time and the game's various flaws make it hard to recommend at $15, but the game gets down to $3 (80% off) during sales. Alternatively, Grim Fandango seems like a pretty good bet to end up in a Humble Bundle before too long.",

            "review_text": "In Christmas 1998 my Oldest-Favourite-Auntie (I have a lot of Aunties…and a lot of favourites!) purchased me the original version of this game. I had a very under-powered PC, even by those standards, with a horrific graphics and sound card. So much so, that everyone in the game sounded like they were talking in slow motion. For every line of dialogue. On both discs.  I still loved and played the crap out of it. It was by far, my favourite game growing up, and up until the point where I purchased Final Fantasy VII about 5 years later (I was behind the times) for my (at that point upgraded to a VoodDoo2 GFX Card! WOW!) PC, I played it roughly every 2-3 months in full. I had every puzzle, dialogue choice and ‘level’ memorised. It never got boring, even taking in to account it sounded horrific listening to all those skeletons talking in slo-mo voices - it's a good thing I was desensitised to horror as a teen or this would have been proper nightmare fuel!  So when I learnt this game had been re-mastered, I had to buy it. It took me 3 hours AFTER it finished downloading, to open it up. I was scared. Scared that it couldn’t live up to my memories, that my rose-tinted glasses of childhood had made a barely salvageable game seem magical.  But I bravely opened it up, let it load. Clicked for a 'new game'...and then I heard, for the first time in my life, Manny Calavera’s true voice…and I fell in love with this magical game all over again.   It played EXACTLY as I remembered…only everything sounded utterly fantastic! And it looked even more stunning than I recalled with the remaster! And the tank controls when playing with a proper keyboard! C’est Magnifique! I completed it, from memory, in a single session. Not with all the achievements mind, but I just needed to get to the end, and see if I felt the same as I did when I was 13 when I finished the game. It was even better, hearing it as it was meant to sound this time. It was a perfect moment in a life of gaming.  I haven’t been able to bring myself to play it again since – it was such a perfect gaming experience I’m terrified that if I play it again I’ll spot something wrong or it just won’t meet up to that original play through I gave it that was so perfect. I will go back to it though. At some point.  Now that the gushing is over I’ll try and be critical in the review.  The script is expertly written, voice acted and executed. The mechanics are very ‘of the time’ for a LucasArt’s Adventure 90’s game, far from sophisticated and ‘perfect’ in a critical/technical sense, but perfect in every other way when combined with the aesthetic and beautiful design of this world. The Land of the Dead that you inhabit feels so rich and vibrant at times it’s hard to imagine this is the ONLY outing and exploration that has been made in to this world – there is so much opportunity now with the games revival for a series of mini-adventures around some of the smaller characters and/or new characters to be introduced in to this universe. I hope whomsoever owns the IP for this franchise now, is brave &amp; aware enough of how valuable the product is, and what potential this world could hold for future games.  For me, this is an absolute ‘Must own, must play’ game. No true gaming connoisseur can claim to be a connoisseur, without this in their collection.  Purchase, play, and fall in love ☺ ",

            "review_text": "Grim Fandango is one of Tim Schaffer's (Pschyonauts,Maniac Mansion and Brutal Legend) best games and here's why, the graphics are amazing and has a great Day of the Dead style which gives the game a bit of quarky charm. The game has a very ingaging and flowing story that combines comedy,drama,romance and film noir all brilliantly all with some of the funniest and clever lines I've ever heard in a video game. It has very likeable and memorable characters that are bloated with personality From the always thinking on his feet Manny to the big and lovable Glottis. The setting in the game are all brilliantly disigned and give the game some well-needed atmosphere all acommpanied by a smooth jazz soundtrack witch adds to said atomosphere and gives the game a noirish tone as I said before. The only things bad I can say about this game is the the puzzles can be a little repetitive (epecially the safe puzzle ♥♥♥♥ THAT PUZZLE) and the ending 'boss' with Hector LaMans was a little anti-climactic. other then that this game is a masterpiece  My rating for Grim Fandango R is a 10/10 Highly recommend this to everyone who loves Lucasarts games, Point and click games because first time playing I got stuck pretty quickily (Try playing this and figuring out where to go without walkthroughs that is my challege to you (I DARE YA!!!!)

Playing as Manny Calavera, you must solve your way though numerous (and extremely challenging) puzzles in order to find Meche, a lost client. I won't say much else about the plot, as this game is best played going in blind.  However old, this game has aged well. The score, characters, and plot are all vivid and memorable. At times it's as if you are controlling a character in a movie. The game gets very complex, and I won't lie - I had to go to a walkthrough a few times. The puzzles in Grim Fandango are both ingenius and non-intuitive. This game will stretch your thinking.   After all the puzzles and steam achievement searching, Grim Fandango proves to reward the player with a beautiful world, lovable characters, and creative dialog. I will be visiting Land of The Dead again.  (Cons: some puzzles too hard, clunky inventory, dated graphics)  8/10",

Only negative thing I can think about is that some puzzles are incredibly tedious if you're not sure what you're doing. That is, if you're too impatient to spend possibly hours to figure them out. In that case, there's guides on the internet, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. (If you don't mind the potential spoilers.)",

It holds up today as an engaging experience with memorable characters and a supremely imaginative world.   It falls into the classic adventure trap of weird puzzles where a seemingly-logical solution to a problem doesn't work, because the game is forcing you into perhaps a more fun-but-not-intuitive solution.
