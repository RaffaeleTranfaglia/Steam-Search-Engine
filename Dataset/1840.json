    "description": "The Source Filmmaker (SFM) is the movie-making tool built and used by us here at Valve to make movies inside the Source game engine. Because the SFM uses the same assets as the game, anything that exists in the game can be used in the movie, and vice versa.",

There's also a huge fan base on YouTube for Source Filmmaker videos to help keep you motivated. Even if you've never animated before in your life (like me) I highly recommend this. With enough effort and time, anyone can make a SFM video. It's also really versatile- you can readily add custom textures, models, maps, anything! Not to mention the SFM Steam Workshop that is full of great content. Cannot recommend this software enough. Give it a go!",

I can tell, once started there is no turning back, you can give up after 100 hours and leave with emty hands or never give up and continue till it sucks the life out of you. I don't call it a lifewaister but this is the reason why you wouldn't bother to play games anymore. Warning, once addicted to it, then you know whats coming up next.

There is nothing to hide about the difficulty curve presented. SFM's interface seems daunting at first, but official tutorials, user made tutorials and friendly advice will get the ball going.   And the kicker? At the time of writing I've spent around 7 hours in this program. Felt like not even one hour. It's addicting. I'm gonna have a good time with this now, and you will definitely as well. Give it a try.",

Starter Pack! as they say, accomplished at a minimal satisfactory level, when using this tool. Yet as time goes by... you improve on each little detail your brain can detect. Source Filmmaker is a very intersting tool that many users find difficult at the first steps that you encounter with. Some people are nervous to show their work.. but nervousness binges you to do that representation, of showing your work. We all feel like we can improve and yes, there is always room for improvement. Let's not forget whilst looking for improvement that joy, pride, and plain satisfaction is something that is also needed. I for one spare room for improvement and each time I use this tool, I improve. Sourcefilmmaker is such an amazing tool, complied with many features and aspects that any digital artist/filmographer can find easy to use and have a very fun time. I agree that Sourcefilmmaker is the best Filmmaking tool for anyone who likes to start out with basic animations, poses, posters, etc.",

Admittedly I have not created any animations longer than 3 seconds... but I have enjoyed playing about with creating renders/images for my profile or desktop backgrounds. I've experimented with posing, props and lighting.  I would love to finally animate something but alas it seems my computer (laptop) just isn't strong enough to handle the programme. My framerate is awful in the viewport, ranging from 2 to 4 FPS when trying to position the camera. Trying to watch back any animating I've done so far is nigh impossible as it's just too laggy to see what the movement is like.  Now it might sound like I'm being awfully critical and negative in my review but all-in-all, I LOVE this programme even if I am only to make still images. It's free and the workshop is full of amazing models people have created and supplied freely to the community making it truly a team effort.  I would definitely recommend this programme to others, as long as you think your computer is strong enough to pull it off.",

            "review_text": "Hell, this is one of the most diverse animation tool I've ever utilized in my life, and had given me quite a reputation for the videos I make in my Youtube. Of course, just like every starter of every tool, you'll feel like you're driving an airplane without any experience of piloting it, with you just looking at a perplexing cockpit layout, and if used incorrectly, you have the possibility of failing then crashing. But again, just like every user, once you've garnered a lot of experience with the tool, spending hours playing with it, you'll find yourself as an expert at this point.   The concept of this program is extremely easy to learn, which is probably an obvious statement since you might find a portion of Youtube all flooded with millions of SFM videos. The layout, just like what I've said above, might be scary to look at, but the process of learning the fundamentals of this tool is very quick. Well, of course, the speed of learning this tool would depend on how you capture the lectures of any tutorials.  However, there are some 'gripey' sides of the tools which could leave you in complete frustration.    Crashing.    Yes, the number one enemy of several animators and several other program users.  There are  COPIOUS  amounts of unintentional actions which could trigger this much hated term.  There are times that when you download workshop files then open the program, during the middle of the downloading process, the program crashes. There are times when you click on a particular button, for instance a model selection, it will crash. There are times when you export your polished videos, and during the download progression, it can crash.  There are times that when at random intervals the program crashes during your video production and when you open the file up again, the file corrupts. It CORRUPTS. Then it is permanently erased from your usermod directory.  But overall, the program is a 8.9/10. An excellent piece of software.",

It's very simple to use as long as you know the basics. At first, it might seem hard to use, especially if you haven't animated before. But, taking the time to understand everything about this tool, will make it easier to use. I have learned most of the basics and can create at least 1 minute shorts, though it might be tough, especially if you're impatient to wait for the rendering to complete. It took me 4 hours to render a 1 minute short, but the video got corrupted somehow. So it can be very tough to deal with errors when you spend all your time on that. You have to learn to get over it and try again, and it doesn't matter how long it takes, as long as you get it done, you'll feel like you just accomplished something great! Crashes? Can't stop you. Errors? Can't stop you. Anything? Can't stop your work for making something you're determined to create. Keep on trying, and never give up with this tool. There might be a few bugs here and there that can stop your progress from creating something, but that doesn't mean you can't stop trying to create videos! Keep on TRYING. Fail? KEEP ON TRYING! Fail?

The main purpose of SFM is to make videos and animations, but can be used to produce stills/posters also. A major plus to this program is that assests from ALMOST ANY Source game can be imported and used in these videos (unless the engine has been severly modified, like Titanfall). There are also many videos on the Internet with tips and tricks on how to do things in SFM - from the fundamentals to the complex operations that make this such a powerful tool.  Two more things: This program is power-hungry! Make sure you have a good rig, otherwise it will be difficult to use. Don't give up. The learning curve for SFM is a harsh one...start with simple things and move up from there.",

Till, I finally said F*** it and just worked in it regardless of lag, annoying yess, but I eventually learned to get around it, and almost make it seem as if I had none.  Now, Do I suggest people use it? Yes, Hell yes  Do I suggest people upload the first thing the make? No, practice in it first, learn as much as you can from anyone you can, the community is cancerous, filled with A**hats, OC lovers, Cancer spreaders, and just general BS, but dgging passed that there are some good people to communicate and learn from in all walks of life, do not be afraid to tak to someone in a community with a generlly bad reputation.",

And also, it will take a while to get used too the program. It will cause you to rip your hair out at how frusturating it can be sometimes, but if you put time and effort into it you will achieve very great animation skills, especially considering how dank the end result can be. Just look up SFM on Youtube, and you will see how great the animation can get once you put alot of time and effort into your own SFM  Welcome to the community of animations, just PLEASE don't make cringey FNaF sfms because the community is filled with them... Ew... Just stick with L4D, Overwatch maybe?, TF2 (Very good in this department), Hl2, And other Source based games. Keep it Source man.

As supported by the lower-quality animations made near the SFM's launch in 2012, animating is a quite different experience than in most other software and it takes some getting used to, even if you are familiar with things like Blender or Maya. More natural animations would be best created using the Graph editor which handles things like acceleration, whilst rigid and straightforward animations are simpler to create using the Motion editor, which only handles raw motion. I might also mention how you can lock objects to other bones, making things like holding weapons or wearing hats much easier to animate.  Using the timless Source Engine as its base, the Source Filmmaker is a powerful tool for creating the animations of your dreams.",

This is the tool your looking for, I've spent hours using this tool and ive learnt how to use it and making animations but haven't submited anything to youtube, using this tool doesn't instantly give you animation nor poster/scence sort of thing. you need to make it with your own immagination. it has excleent graphics for all your HD needs and will give you an excleent animation at the end. you can even record within games and use maps. its all up to you to make your stuff. Download this excleent software today and make your own animation and best of all It's FREE! no need to use other 3d animation tools this one is porbably the best tool for animating out there.",

It's possible with SFM. I personally use it mainly for images (as seen on my deviantART account, which is L45TF0R3RUNN3R) but I plan to try and get into animation. Of course, SFM has it's ups and downs. For example it can be difficult to use at first, but once you use it enough you can get the hang of it. There's the downside of some models such as Halo: Reach Elite models not being able on the workshop, but you can find them via many sites, including Facepunch. At least, I think that's what it's called, so forgive me if I got the name wrong.  Overall, SFM is a great and mostly simple yet somewhat complicated 3D animation/image-making program.

Giving it a negative review would be like giving a $3,000,000 camera a bad review because it was meant to film multi-million dollar movies, not something in your backyard.  Valve and Just people that like the Program have made hundreds of hours of Tutorials teaching you how to properly use it, and like any other activity, practice makes perfect, i myself have no used it much as my steam library was randomly deleted, and i just haven't gotten a chance to re-install until now.  Some of the most epic and most beaustiful artworks ive seen on steam, and even around the internet were made using this program.  This is much simpler than trying to use photoshop to re-create your favorite tf2 loadout, and much more imersive than just taking a screen-cap in a game.  Source film maker earns a 9/10 in my book, just becasuse of how well balanced the tools are, the avaliabilty of content through both the commuinty workshop, and 3rd party webistes, the avaliablility of tutorials and learning programs, and just the sear limitlessness of what can be created if you just set your mind to it.  Overall, this program is great, worth a download, if your impatient, leave it alone, do not hate because you are to lazy to watch a few hours worth of helpful videos.  If you need proof of what this can do, go check out the saxxy videos, and what users have done, some of them calling themselves novices.",

Next to that, you are also able to add content to the game from the workshop, or things you downloaded from the Internet.  If you aren't any good at animating, you think it's too much work, or you feel you're not good enough, don't worry. Source Filmmaker allows you to make posters (images from scenes that you put together). However, some models can have issues when you export a poster. Instead, make sure you aren't in the motion editor (where there is a lot of green at the bottom. Motion editor reduces quality slightly) and instead export it as an image.  Now my main issue is that Source Filmmaker takes forever for an update to be released. Sometimes they add new things, other times they improve other things. But it can be several months between updates, whether large or small.  If you're expecting a game, the only thing you're able to do is go into a very early version of Team Fortress 2, alone, without anything to fight. This is mostly for recording gameplay animations without having to do it manually, and it can save a lot of work.  Overall, this is a fantastic way to start animating, and it's a great tool for an experienced animator to use. If you wanted to make a few animated videos or maybe a couple of cool posters, then this is the program you should use.",

I have yet to really figure out how to even make a 1 second clip myself because once you get deep into the menus it's a myrid of options, lines and graphs that would make your head spin for a week.   Second, it lags and is unstable. Hands on Ctrl+S at all times and use it every 2-3 minutes.  For casual players, it you don't want to fork out cash for Gmod to make Machinimas, this is your next best bet. One very good way to jump start your SFM journey is to watch the tutorials Valve put up. Just endure through the sometimes boring tone of voice of the narrator.

Using it has a little to be desired, but its YouTube tutorials and thriving community are very supportive in terms of helping. The controls are a tad finicky, but once you use it for a bit, it generally flows quite well.  Another great aspect of the program is the great Workshop. The Workshop is one of the greatest things, as you can use it expand the universe you build with.  It's also great for making dank meme pictures, as well as profile pictures for your favorite games. :)  Would definitely recommend.   Old review!  Overall : 9/10  The program, although it has cumbersome, crude tutorials and controls at best, it still shines at what it is meant to do: ANIMATE. Once the controls click, the whole process feels like a breeze, and is, in turn, very satisfying. If it just doesn't work out, then there's Valve's official tutorials too! Takes a while to understand its complexity, despite its simple-looking interface. The diversity and unique things you can create makes it something worth trying out.    ",

I myself am not skilled in animating, but with the help of SFM, i'm getting the hang of it. It's certainly not 'easy' but after just a few hours, i understood the basics and with not much time under my belt, i have made a couple good test animations.  the only main issue i've had is frequent crashes when using a lot of usermod items, but it always autosaves whenever i do ANYTHING, so it's more an inconvienence than anything.  Without a doubt, worth any prospective animator, or filmmakers time. or even just a gamer, it makes me appreciate SFM films on youtube a lot more,",

I perfer you practice manipulating the legbones, armbones, hair-jiggles, and handbones, not the fingerbones straight off the bat.  Since this stage is only the Beta Stage, things WILL change, SFM MAY crash, it's either you go with the crashing, or wait until the official SFM releases.   SFM gives you more uses for the CTRL, SHIFT, and the Scroll Wheel for 3D animation progression control.  You can also make Sonic Game remakes. I KNOW.

The thing that makes Source Filmmaker awesome to me though is the community's creations. And I mean  most  of the creations. Why most? Because Typhoon Cinema and FNiA models exist. Which brings me to the only downside of this incredible tool. Typhoon Cinema and all the other cinemas out there ruin SFM for me. Because they produce disgusting clickbait thumbnails that attract little children. And most, if not  all  of the uploads on their channel aren't made by them. Otherwise this is an almost perfect tool to use for 3D animation. I rate this a 10/10. Thank you for reading this review! :)",
