    "description": "The year is 2051. Location: SATAZIUS, a long-abandoned planet. The cruiser Agano was on patrol when it was attacked and stricken by a confederacy of space pirates that had established a base on SATAZIUS. The pirates attacked the Agano intending to steal the assault ship ‘Trafalgar’ that was stowed aboard the Agano, but the Trafalgar made...",

There's nothing special about the gameplay, other then that it feels nice to play. Like all shooters you have to destroy as many enemies as you can and try not to get it. The game is very difficult (well at least for me it was) and the graphics look neat.   Recommended for Shoot 'Em Up fans.",

Borrows heavily from Gradius and R-Type in its approach to level design (lots of environmental hazards, traps, etc), and features an arseload of weapons to play around with, many of which you'll recognise from other classic horis. It's boss. Get it.",

While it's far from the quality of a Tecnosoft or Toaplan shmup, it's still pretty fun and worth a few bucks if it's on sale. The level design varies from stupidly easy to cheap and frustrating, the graphics are dull, and the music is bland, but if you're desperate for a shmup, you could do far worse.",

For not-so-good shoot-em-up players like me, there's difficulty selection and the option to 'continue' 9 times after running out of lives.",

Biggest gripe would be probably be the weird configuration when using the steam controller. Can't seem to configure properly and right now, the B button is set as the exit or quit button. You can imagine how irritating this can be when you're doing really well and you accidentally hit that button.",
