            "review_text": "It's probably fun eventually but honestly during the first mission I got the gist of the entire game. Build a few standard resource structures (in this case for one single resource, Biomass), gather enough of said resources to build other structures, rinse and repeat. And in the meantime you can burn trees down or throw bugs off the edge of the floating island while your space chickens slowly eat bananas and grow into sellable chickens so you get more gems to build more structures.  Further into the game you probably unlock more God powers that could be fun to play around with but I found myself wondering 'Why am I playing an inferior remake of the game I played and thoroughly enjoyed beating about 10 years ago?' and the answer eluded me. That game of course being Populous: The Beginning, a far superior experience in nearly every regard. I guess I respect the developers for trying to resurrect the God Game genre but this was pretty bland from start to very hasty finish.  P.S. If I was allowed to save the game I might have returned at a later time to see if gameplay improves but alas I don't have 3 hours to spend on a speculative gaming sesh when I have this mountain of other verifiably Good Games to play.",
