            "review_text": "This is my first negative review of any game on stream - that's how disappointed I am.  First, I was looking forward to this game. The discription sounded like something zen and relaxing. So I put it on my wishlist, and, after a while, I bought it. With the first start, I was hit by severe disappointment: I tried hard to like the 'game' as is, but in the end, I would even consider $0.01 to be way too expensive for this snot. The execution is so depressingly lazy and unloving that I could write a better and more realistic 'bonsai game' from scratch in a day with only rudimentary OpenGL knowledge - and in the end this would probably even turn out to be orders of magnitudes less resource hungry than this monstrosity. Honestly, I would be ashamed of myself to bring an abomination like this 'game' to steam let alone even dare to think about taking money for it.   Pros:  (+) Nice Zen like game idea. (+) You can mute the background music ingame.  Cons: (-) 'Game' started with extremely loud music, but settings have no audio controls whatsoever (-) Wasn't able to run it without fullscreen. (-) Can not choose type of tree to start with (-) No tutorial, no background information, nothing - not even credits. (-) Horrendous user interface. Why do you need two buttons which only toggle each other ? Clicked on the 'water' icon while it was already selected, therefore the 'scissord' button was automatically selected, and instead of growing the tree. I cut it at its base irrevocably. (-) Evervating and absolutely unfitting background music you instantly want to deactivate.  (-) Tree only grows while running the game, but game minimizes as soon as you tab outside, so progress can't be seen while doing something else. (-) Trees only grow two-dimensional most of the time and do not grow biological / natural at all. (-) Branches do not tend to split where cut. Branches appear randomly in obscure places (e.g. inside other branches). (-) No way to influence tree growth. Except letting it grow randomly and then cut away what you don't want. (-) Leaves are not attached to branches. All leaves randomly change position every time tree grows or is pruned. (-) Leaves are randomly cluttered all over the branches - if at all - and do not even point in the direction of the tree. (-) Leaves are outlined by a thick line of background colour, rendering underlying leaves and branches invisible. (-) Even when the stem and the branches are twice as thick as the cursor, it is still a pixel hunt to select them. It doesn't help that the leaves are obsfucating everything once they appear. (-) About a thousand things more of what is wrong or lacking with this abomination.",
