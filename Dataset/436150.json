It's free, you can waste time on here if you want but don't make any ingame purchases, you'll truly regret it. Stay away and play a different poker game, there are plenty of others out there. This one should be avoided. I mean, come on. They're not real cards, you gotta kind of expect this sort of thing is going to happen, but the eternal optimist in me gave it a shot. Alot of other poker games will not be so cheap and actually use a simulated deck. Yes, you will start off winning fine (if you know how to play poker) but then suddenly things start getting pretty dang suspicious. This should be removed from Steam immediately.",

The table is now closed for yah, go play on the 1k-5k buy-ins, so you will waste your precious money even faster and will buy in-game money from us for your real money.' ~ Developer $.$  10/10 business model  The game is full of AI controlled 'players' which pretends to be a real ones. It's like tricking community/players into thinking that this game have actual playerbase, lol. They play like players, they use emotes like players and it's getting annoying after a while that you play against AI all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. Don't even get me started that AI gets a really lucky draws, and they win a lot of the times. RIGGED... jk, but really I think it's rigged, so you will spend real money faster, before uninstalling this game.  I would give this game 2,5/10. It's fun unless, the 'beginner table' gets locked down due to your level. It have the graphics, it has animations and nice emotes.   It's fun game for first three hours. Then, it's good uninstall simulator - three click process and guess what... this option isn't locked down due to your steam level and it doesn't require spending real money. Yup that's right.

Don't take this game serious at all as far as being a real random poker game.

Your character can be customised with hats, shirts and pins (all for the gold currency, which is hard to get unless you pay for it).  The game also allows you to play blackjack for your chips. This means that (if you're feeling lucky), you can up your stack before you enter a game. Be warned! This could also put the game out of your reach with the minimum buy-in.  The game has multiple styles of poker including standard in game cash-games, sit and go's (you pay a set amount of money for entry, 5 players. 2nd comes out even, the winner gets a lot more), push or folds (small buy in with big blinds) and the big win (buy-in goes to the community pot and then you play. At the end of the time period, money is given out depending on your position on the big win chip leaderboard). They are all fantastic modes.  The one thing I would say is that a glitch made me lose all of my money. THIS WAS UNDER A SET OF UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN TO YOU.
