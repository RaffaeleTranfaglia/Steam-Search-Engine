            "review_text": "Fat and unwieldy are two words to describe this game. While it uses many exotic contextual actions, dynamically grabbing pipes, ledges, and other objects in game to ascend to higher safer perches, the game just falls flat on it's face.  I believe the description of this game is a 'vertical' fps, which I think they meant to show by this emphasis on climbing and acrobatics, but I think what went wrong is the aiming, which felt clunky, enemies didn't seem to die fast enough, mostly because you're flipping and climbing everywhere just trying to find the guys, and an overall unappealing level design which was consistent of mostly blank brick buildings and bridges leading to nowhere special.  If you can get over the aiming and the level design, you might be able to take this game. But given the size of the game, I feel like I could use my space better than with this game.",

Every time someone dies, they make this horrific scream that is just out of place. And before they die, the AI just kind of stands there and shoots, offering no kind of tactical process. I'm not upset that I wasted a couple dollars. I hope the developers can put that money to good use and make something better.",
