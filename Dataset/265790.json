    "description": "Up-tempo adventuring and family drama ensue when the survivors of a disastrous charity project return to the dead ships in the former Aral Sea in Uzbekistan. Residue tells a personal story by letting you explore a larger-than-life, ridiculously detailed rendition of one of our world's most fascinating (and horrifying) locations.",

It's a bit clunky, tho, and really short, so I'd advise to pick it up on sale if you're not sure. Still, I found it enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "Honestly don't know what the fuss was about. Developer seems cool, but this game just isn't good. You play 3 single characters that only do 1 thing all game, 2 of which don't work well. The old guy moves super slow, and the grappling hook guy doesn't work half the time or you have to grapple something you can't see. The art is ok, but the voice acting is terrible, and the character development and dialogue make no sense at all for how humans actually act. Lips don't mimic speaking. The story is about some sunken shipyard and saving your mom who's stuck at the bottom of the river, at a pressure that would kill someone anyways. (spoiler:but not really) Even though she is under there for the entire game, and like 2 hours, she somehow survives without mouth to mouth or anything, even though humans can hold their breath for like 2-3 min. The story is furthered by notes and there is some jib-jab about a crash or poisoning or something, but is convoluted and just not interesting enough. The game has a terrible case of not letting you know where to go, as many people have pointed out, and you get stuck often. Usually its like 'oh I didn't know I could do that/that looked like it was in the background/there are 20 ways to go, do I go backward or forward?'. Also I found numerous bugs where something that was supposed to happen didn't for no apparent reason, or because I didn't do some innocuous thing that doesn't make sense and I shouldn't know I had to do. Also, sometimes someone just got stuck or someone bugged backward to a part they weren't supposed to be. All the bugs needed a restart to fix. And then the end doesn't really make sense. 5/10.",
