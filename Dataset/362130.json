            "review_text": "Ashes of Immortality is a short RPGMaker game about the fight between The Family and Vampires. The Family is a group of hunters killing everything not normal.  And you are a female member of this Family. Oh, and you are in search of your father. During your search you find companions. Most bizarre companions like a Vampire, an half Vampire and another member of The Family (who wants to get you back for judgement). The story, even if not new, is fun enough. In the dungeons you solve a few and easy switch puzzles, find new equipment and kill monsters.  Oh, and there are a handful of side-quests and of course the long collecting quest.  It was fun playing the game...till you got your airplane (a big bat). With it you can visit all loacations. And....there is this one location with Dracula...if you beat him...booom you are max level and rich. OK, there is another location where you can fight against boss monsters (including Dracula again). But at that point the fighting is useless. The enemies can't hurt you anymore....I fought Dracula and paralyzed him...even with 50K Hitpoints it was over in a few minutes and he didn't hit my party once. Oh, and don't miss a nice reunion for one of your party members.  Would I recommend this game? Yes, till the not so good end it was fun.",
