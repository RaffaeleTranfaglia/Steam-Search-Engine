The mix of a 3D element and new mechanics made the game definitely worth buying. The messages, though. XD Oh, and I'm glad that they made an update that allows you to reset the game when it had the template levels and got you still 'earning money', because I had to delete it in order to grab the Ethics Fail achievement. Props to them. If you have some time and money to kill, give this game a go. The music can bore you, but it's that calming pace that makes the game enjoyable.",
