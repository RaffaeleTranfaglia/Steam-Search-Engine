Edit: They fixed the problem and seem to take what is said and change things fast we will see how it goes.  Edit 2: The dev is working to make the game better and more customizable, thought this game already is very customizable. Make the world yours",

            "review_text": "When I first got this game it was frustrating to get used to the controls. But after an hour of playing I realized that the problem wasn't the controls, it was the pace of the game. Since the whole point of the game is to build a village untill your ready to conquer a dungeon, you spend most your time building and gathering resources. But it takes forever to do that, and it shouldn't. I thought after I got workers to collect wood and stone for me, it would be less time consuming to collect enough resources needed to build houses for my village. Wich is true, but it still takes about a minute to put down a damn fence or remove a field, Wich is a problem because when your building or removing something, you can't move. Basically what I'm saying is most the time your staring at your screen as your removing something or building something, and being someone who is used to fast paced gameplay, I find this extremely boring. If your patient and keep an open mind then maybe you will have fun, but I'm done with this game.",

You build your own village --&gt; gather ressources like wood, stone etc. then build buildings like houses, fields, bakery etc. in order to get more villagers to hep you gather ressources and stuff.   goal is to conquer the cave or to destroy the monsters down at level 10, so u gather ressources to make better swords and armor and then kill them. really really nice!!!  like 'the forsaken' but with a goal and hints and quests and awesome !!! ;)",
