            "review_text": "Well, I finished it in under six hours, so it's not a long game. However, I didn't 100% it, and I intend to go back and do more.  But value propositions aside, I got this game after seeing Jim Sterling play it, and the running and jumping, the sense of speed and momentum, looked so fun. It is. I did not get tired of it at all. This game does speed excellently. Perhaps perfectly. Thus, it was worth the price to me. Whethe it provides enough value to you, well, is up to you.  In addition it solves the problem of first-person platforming by both letting you see your feet, and always providing platforms big enough you can judge your positioning with no problem. Thus, the platforming is very fun.  The shooting, too, is quite good. It's minimal, but where it shines is when you find yourself soaring through the air and shooting things (to life or death) before you land. That is quite satisfying, and almost makes me want a challenge mode or to try speedrunning it.  There are two other mechanics: a grappling hook and magnetic boots. The magnetic boots, in my opinion, feel awful. The transition from walking on a wall to jumping off or vice versa is jarring and not at all smooth. In addition, twice it bugged out and gravity still applied to me, so I just fell. The grappling hook, however, I quite liked, once I got used to it, though it can be fiddly remembering to hold down the button to keep it attached, which killed me a couple times.  Then there's the fact it is gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing. My only complaint with this is that about half the game isn't in the gorgeous valley but often rather dull interiors, which is quite a shame. They could've easily been designed better to solve the dullness problem too, but I shant spoil how.  The soundtrack, meanwhile, has only one problem: the running tracks are too good. Too exciting. And when you're just wanting to pause and find collectibles or read notes in a speedy section that can be a bit jarring.  Lastly, the story's good. It's not remarkable, but it's solid. And it is told all through environmental notes scattered around and audio logs, in very much a walking simulatoresque style, which some people will have a problem with, but I found myself engaged in it.  Really, in many ways this game feels like it owes much to walking simulators like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, except they then made it a proper game. They added gameplay. I don't hate walking simulators, but really, they're not games, they're digital art pieces, and can only be judged by their story and beauty. This has those as well as being a great game.",

            "review_text": " Valley  is a first-person action game with little bits of other genres woven in. For instance, it almost reminds me of a walking sim early on, and then when you get a L.E.A.F. suit it's a bit more exploratory. The suit itself has some nice capabilities, like taking and giving life to creatures around you. The running and jumping is a really nice aspect to the suit, which feels very free and invigorating to me in a sense. You can also essentially 'live forever' as long as you have energy to replenish the life around you as you take life from the areas you are in. This is key for collecting the acorns as well, since trees tend to drop acorns on a regular basis.   It's not a very long game, but the areas are fairly sizable and vast. There is some really nice equipment upgrading as you continue on, and several types of collectible items to collect for acorn doors, which are locked without the proper amount of acorns, and some mysterious medallions you find in certain boxes with a slight shiny glint you can see from afar if you're in the right spots called pendulum cases as you travel different areas. You can go back and forth as you please with the Travel option in the pause menu as well, if you gain new upgrades and want to explore around some previous areas.  When hostiles start to appear on the map, you have some very slight FPS elements involved in targeting while being attacked. This is extremely light, and I don't find the difficulty to be a problem at all in this game. I find it a little short, but compared to other games at this price range, the grapics and music and complete package make it one of the better games on Steam I have played in this price range.  One gripe I have is the look sensitivity was extremely fast! I had to move it all the way to about five percent from the lowest setting in options to use it with my controller. This probably should be updated. I also fell through rocks a few times while exploring out of the way areas, as well as some ceilings that I went above. A few times I was completely stuck, and I had to restart the area. Things you collect are still accounted for, so you don't have to redo everything again and again, aside from getting to the spot where you need to be. In this suit, that's not too hard to do, generally.  As mentioned, the time was a little short, but I'd rather complain a good game was too short, than play a bad game and constantly hope the next part is the end of it. Most people don't even bother in the latter case, but I can be a bit of a masochist in that respect... Sometimes bad games are so bad they end up good, and sometimes they are so bad they have a lot of humor along the way. It's refreshing when I find one of those that bring something to the table, intentional or not.    Pros",

            "review_text": "I have now played all the way through the game and I really enjoyed this experience. Its feels more like a puzzle platformer (think portal) but there happens to be shooting as well. Although, the shooting feels very peaceful. I would even say, there is a bit of 'walking simulator' in this game too. But that's a big caveat, the walking/running/jumping is WAY WAY WAY better than any walking simulator that I have played so far. Primarily b/c jumping/running/grappling are so damn fun!  Oh, did I mention there is a grappling hook! The grappling hook isn't free form though (which is a bit of a bummer) and requires specific mount points to use. I'm ok with that though as I am guessing the game would be too easy if you could grapple anywhere.   When I started playing this game, I got the same feeling I did when playing the original portal (not portal 2, as I don't know why but portal 2 just wasn't as engaging for me as portal). Maybe its the landscape, maybe its the great sound track, maybe its the unique little creatures, maybe its the elf like unity with the environment. I don't know, but this game has the magic for me.  Onto the performance. Its not great but is still playable. I get between 30 to 60 fps on my NVidia GTX 960 + Core i7-4770 3.4GHz + 16GB Ram runnong on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. It also has that unity Setting screen before the game. I don't know why b/c their in-game settings seem pretty decent. It seems the developer would know how to turn off those settings since the game overall feels fairly polished (sans the frame drops). I also experienced 1 game crash at the beginning of the game which made me go through the first section again (at least I had my suit so it was easy to repeat that first walk plus I took a slightly different route)   Overall, I would highly recommend this title.",

            "review_text": "Valley is a fairly short (about 5 hours) first person... game... thing... It's kind of hard to pin it to an exact genre, but I suppose it's a mix between FPS and platformer. It's probably not going to blow your mind, but I found it a lot of fun. Basically, you're given a suit of power armor that has all kinds of weird abilities (like super fast running and jumping) and asked to traverse a bunch of levels with it.  If I had to pick one flaw, it would be the lack of difficulty. This isn't really an issue for me, I don't mind 'easy' games, but if you're looking for a challenge, this probably isn't going to provide it. The shooting is pretty rudimentary and you get enough health upgrades to make most encounters fairly easy. The platforming is also pretty easy, and though there are a few instant death pits that might get you, the penalty for dying is pretty light.  However, while it might not be super challenging, I thought it was pretty fun. You're given enough abilities that make moving around the world feel exciting and interesting. While the platforming didn't make me sweat, it did get me to say 'wheeeee' a bunch of times. It's hard to describe, but I defintitely found a lot to like in the movement mechanics in this game.  The story is decent, if a bit cliche. The visuals can be surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the soundtrack is really nice as well. The level design is kind of middling, sometimes being really exhilirating to move through but boring to look at, and sometimes being really pretty to look at but kind of tedious to actually traverse. I did like the touch that allows you to choose if the main character is male or female; since the game is in first person, it doesn't change much aside from the 'oof' noises you make when you get hit, but it's a nice feature.  Overall, I really liked this one. A surprisingly entertaining and polished title from a fairly small studio that had me grinning every time I booted it up.",

The movement starts to become reminiscent of Tribes (a good thing!) and the trickle of upgrades to your suit to unlock new abilities (e.g. double jump, grappling hook etc) come at a steady pace to keep things interesting.  So far there are light jumping puzzles and a few 'swarms' that you have to neutralize to proceed as well as a couple of door unlocking mechanisms. Very fun game with an interesting story so far.

The graphics mixed with the great story telling as you progress thru the game is just what I needed. I was hit by the feeling of nostalgia, while playing this game, it reminded me of a time when games didn't focus on just first person shooter genere, with crazy multiplayer perks. It took me back to a time when I was just a kid and would play a game that focused on a good story and caused me to feel creative in my own being. If you are looking for a game that is visually stunning, and has a great story linked to it, then I recommend this game to you. If you are looking for a game with a lot of action packed gun shooting, gun slinging, explosion extravaganza every corner you turn, then this game isn't for you. Yes Valley does have quite a bit of action experience as you play thru the game, but it doesn't focus on that primarly. The game focuses on telling you a story as you progress, with recordings that play on your exoskeleton suit and even notes left behind from people of the past, you are bound to get a immersive experience. Once again just disclaimer this game is more focused on showing you great visuals along with great story telling. I feel like the people who give this game a bad rating should have viewed the game from a unbiased stand point and under stand that the game isn't supposed to be like most games are like today. If you are still reading this review then perhaps this game is for you. Only way to find out is to give it a try :)",

I'm not normally into achievements.  I had a lot of fun exploring the world of Valley. It's a difficult game to describe but essentially it's a gorgeous walking simulator with an action game mech suit thrown into it. The primary focus of play is exploration and even though there are some FPS and platforming elements thrown in, if you approach it as a shooter or as a platformer, you will find it is too easy and disappointing.   Exploration and discovery are the core motivators and if you don't enjoy that then you probably won't like this game.   There's a tiny bit of Metroidvania influence in that some abilities gained later in the game can be used in areas encountered earlier in the game, but it is very minimal. I would call Valley a really good game but if they had doubled down on that Metroidvania angle and given you a compelling reason to keep returning to early areas.... it would have been a  great  game.  Despite that, highly recommended if you like to explore beautiful environs and uncover secrets. There are zero physically encounterable npc's in the game and the narrative is delivered through notes and audio logs so prepare to be alone and enchanted by the mystery of the Valley.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to start with the bad and just get it out of the way. There's some pretty janky things going on right now. Mouse sensitivity is WAY too high, I had to lower the sensitivity as far as it would go AND reduce my mouse' DPI to 200 to get a playable sensitivity. To make the game run higher than 60fps I had to set VSync ON to 60 fps, at which point the game ran at around 90-100 in open areas, and a nice 144 in indoor areas. There is combat in the game, but it's really basic and pitifully easy. The devs have stated that they are going to attempt to fix the technical issues in a patch hopefully by 8/29, this is going up on 8/26.  All of that being said, it was a wonderful experience. The meat of the game is the first-person platforming. This game is a bit deceptive, in the first five minutes it feels like a walking simulator. Then suddenly it opens up and gives you a powered exoskeleton that sets you loose to perform incredible feats of strength and agility. The mechanic of being able to drain life of plants and animals to power your suit to perform some of the more intensive functions is cool, as is being able to give that life back through the aptly named 'God Hand.' What the game ends up being is an interesting science fiction romp through a visually pleasing mountain valley and eerie dilapidated WWII research facilities. The soundtrack is also excellent and fit the theme of each level that I dashed, jumped, and swung my way through. I felt like I was playing a Miyazaki film, and that’s high praise.   For those of you that like to get that little bit extra out of your games, there’s a couple types of collectables to gather, and secret areas to find that either give you some more of the collectables, a bit more background story, or both. These collectables are scattered throughout the world in chests, and the secret areas often hide upgrades to your exoskeleton itself. The bad here is there is no sort of tracker in regards to how many of each level’s collectables and secret areas you’ve located. I found just the simple exercise of finding collectables and secret areas enjoyable in and of itself. If you only go for collectables for the sake of getting that 100% completion, I can see you getting irritated. If you’re like me and you’re interested more in the gratification of finding these things yourself, that little thrill when you find them, you’ll probably have plenty of fun. You can travel back to areas earlier in the game and keep your suit upgrades, your total item collections, and even story progress. This takes away some of the sting of missing things earlier on, because you can return, and since just traversing the levels is often the most fun part, it still feels satisfying.   Mechanically, the movement mechanics feel satisfying. First person platforming can often feel frustrating and unresponsive, but here everything felt appropriate. The ability to look down and see your feet helps you to guide yourself to exactly where you want to land, and enough variety in the puzzles to keep things feeling fresh throughout the four to six hours that the game will likely take you to reach the end. What combat there is didn’t blow my mind, and while it feels a bit lackluster compared to the platforming, it’s not so hard as to ever become tedious. The one boss battle of the game was interesting enough for me to accept it, as it was as enjoyable as the combat ever got and did add a lot more to a fight, and added in more complex movement and dodging that played more to the game’s strength than the rest of the combat in the game.   I enjoyed my time with the game enough after my six hours of playing to get through the main story. I am also planning on to go back and get the collectables that I missed. I highly recommend this game, but as always, do the proper research before buying. Watch a bit of gameplay videos, read reviews, etc.",

Smooth gameplay with no frustrating glitches this was a game that knew what it was doing. I cant forget about the soundtrack that soothes my very soul. This game is a 10 out of 10 to me especially with a price like that.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: I love the speed that this game gives you. The movement is excellent, and your character is always fun to control.  I highly recommend playing this game through at least one time not looking for any secrets though, because they really do ruin the pacing and slow you down. Other than that the game is great.  -----  As someone who really can't get into most survival horror, and especially hated the effects of slender on the internet, I almost dismissed this game outright based on its developers. After watching 4 minutes of Jim Sterling's video on it, though, I soon came around to wanting it. Though by the time I bought it, on sale for $14, I had forgotten what about the game made it so interesting to me.  When I opened it up I was expecting a bog standard walking simulator, minus the needed plot. After a few minutes, I found the game's L.E.A.F. suit and soon remembered what made the game great. Valley isn't a walking simulator, but a running one, one where one must travel between points quickly by managing and balancing their inertia. One might compare it to Sonic the Hedgehog but I think a more apt comparison is the Marble Blast games.  Unlike those however, Valley is beautiful. You will need a monster of a card to run it, I have a 660 and I was barely getting 60 fps at 1080p on low on the later levels (albeit at a very high fov since I am super prone to montion sickness). I think a 960/Rx 480 is nessisary for getting 60 fps on ultra, though. It's definitely not Ark bad though, and the game looks good enough to make up for it in my opinion.  The music design is excellent, mostly. It tries to match the mood of you or your character as you traverse the valley. There is one level where this is pulled off perfectly with it matching the tension and happiness of your character as he or she speeds down a railway. There were several sections where I missed the trigger to play the next song and was left with a few minutes of silence.  This happened because I spent a significant amount of time looking around for collectables and upgrades. If you do this you will both mess with the pasing of the game, and its scripting. For this reason I highly recommend just avoiding going out of your way as much as you can. To do this will require significantly more skill, since you won't have as many energy pickups, but will lead to a more satasfying experience overall, I think.",

            "review_text": "Play if you're looking for: a game with a lot of running, jumping, and movement based puzzles. Interesting story given to you through narration, delivered well. Play if you like collecting all the little widgets. Don't play if you're looking for: A first person shooter or complex puzzler. Both elements are present, but they are by no means the focus of the game.  Valley is a game about the joy of moving fast and looking at pretty scenery, and it does very well in both respects. It's rare to find a first person game that does movement and jumping puzzles well, and a lot of effort obviously went in to making it work. It's more than just moving in the right direction and hitting the jump button at the right time: you pick up momentum by sprinting a distance, more momentum by going downhill (less uphill), and the direction of momentum when you leave ground plays a big role in where you'll go and how far. Later mobility upgrades (such as double jumping, grappling hook, and other cooler upgrades I won't mention) increase the variety of puzzles, how you can approach them, and greatly extend those movements of blissful, sprinting through the wilderness joy. The game encourages speed too: between the shape of the valley ahead, the energetic music that just started, and the wild deer running alongside you can't help but be pulled along.  Scenery and setting are done very well. The scenery is a joy to explore and look at, from the close up to the distant skyboxes, and there were a lot of moments I stopped to stare (or moved to a better vantage point and did it there). Indoor areas feel immensely large but that way do not interfere with movement and gameplay (more cramped areas would be difficult to navigate and break that feeling of freedom of movement). A lot of games look good, though, what makes this one special? The little ways that it presents you with this beauty: coming out in to the valley for the first time with the sun shining through the trees as the cave slowly opens up in front of you, hearing a door mechanism screech a few seconds before it opens, having your eye drawn to something important or impressive by a glimmer of light from a wandering sprite or the sun's reflection or a flashing emergency light; it's all perfectly designed to get you to look there. And on that note, it's hard to get lost: there's usually something fairly unintrusive such as fireflies, lights, even the slope of the valley or shape of a peak that draws your eyes (sometimes without you realizing it) and says 'go here to advance level.'  The game isn't perfect: it's a game about movement, but sometimes you're forced to stop and at that point it gets frustrating. I want to run, you told me I could run! Generally, narration is well timed, but occasionally it will pop up at a wrong momement and I would stop to listen because I didn't want to miss part of it or potentially interrupt it with another narration cue. The game features collectibles, some of them scattered during joyous runs through valleys or underground pipes, and interrupting that to go poking in corners brings the game to a screeching halt. You can go back to any previous level fairly easily to collect more things (in fact, you have to for some as they require later game upgrades), which is good, but there was little encouragement to me to do so which meant I got them the first time or not at all. Occasionally, the overly large areas also get in the way of play: pretty to look at, but when you're still hiking around that giant mound two minutes later to see if there's a box or secret room hidden behind it that kind of sucks.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience. Play to go fast, and enjoy how the game encourages this.",

            "review_text": "'Sonic the HedgeGod' - Jim Sterling  Or as I'd like to call it, mechanical satyr running simulator 2016. Personally, I like it just for the storyline and atmosphere it sets. It's a fascinating tale it spins of life, death, jealousy, human hubris, victory at all cost and love. The music is top notch.  As for the mechanics? Not as satisfying as I had hoped. The game has a marvelous sense of movement. You really feel like you have mechanical legs, landing with a satisfying metal thud and leaping across hills, lakes and chasms is utterly exilerating, but there's very few situations where the game's marvelous sense of movement counts. 80% of the time in this already very short adventure, you're just trudging through bland rooms and while there are very memorable moments, god knows why the Dev didn't seek to repeat those more often. Furthermore, the shooting and enemy mechanics are non existant.   I'm absolutely torn between these two qualities and if I had the option, I'd leave this review without a negative or positive recommendation. As I'm forced to do so however, and the game stands at a 96% Steam approval rating at the time of this writing, which I think is too high for its flaws, I feel forced to give it a thumbs down.   What a tale though.",
