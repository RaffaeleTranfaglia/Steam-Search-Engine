You control all the robotic players on the field in this turned based strategy game. Never knowing what your enemies move will be. You must guide your robots to dominance over many turns. What makes Frozen Cortex really riveting is developing a strategy and seeing it unfold. Rather that be success or devastating failure. While the rules are simple as is the playing the game. Planning the right formation or pass takes mastery over time. With a plethora of customization options, from teams to map editors. Frozen Cortex has everything one would want in a sports game. The only issue I ran into while playing the game was excited clicking through some replays and missing them. Did I mention the friggin robots?  I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!         YouTube™ Video:  IndieView - Frozen Cortex + Giveaway!&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "I like this game. Don't let the sports facade fool you; if you like turn based strategy, this game has a lot more depth than first glance suggests.   Full disclosure: I was on the closed beta, so I've had more direct contact with the devs than your average player. My perspective may be biased.   As a fan of Frozen Synapse, I was expecting more of the same this time around. The first couple weeks of testing showed promise, but the sports theme turned me off, and the absolutely brutal AI made it difficult to enjoy. They've since tuned the AI and match settings to be more accessible at the beginning, and even more ridiculously difficult at the highest levels.   The real breakthrough for me came when I started to understand all the rules of combat. It IS a strategy game first and foremost, with a sports veneer. Winning is downright satisfying, since you know you'll never be handed a cakewalk. You start to accumulate tactics and tricks that give you little advantages here and there, and that depth is where it shines. The game becomes yours.   The waypoint system is polished and intuitive, the graphics are clean yet pretty, and the cameras and animations are very satisfying. The music is excellent. There is a story that pops in and out of the single player leagues; you can engage with it, or skip over it as you see fit. It's interesting flavor, and gives depth to the coaches, but not mandatory.   The multiplayer features are robust, and it's nice to be able to take as much time as you want to make your moves. Player-organized leagues. Multiple simultaneous games aren't unusual, so you'll never have to wait for a game. Email notifications of pending turns, YouTube auto-capture and upload... nice polish features.   It's a tight, aggressive strategy simulation that's easy to understand quickly, and has room for complex plans and tactics. I think it's worth taking a look, if that's your style of game.",

'Why is that', you ask?  * Sports - It's a sports sim...with transformer looking robots and dozens of skinng options. The game is *like* American football on an electronic pitch (procedurally generated high-tech circuitry on a gorgeously scuffed-up industrial-strength looking floor). Except this isn't just American football. It's that and Rugby, European Football, MMA, Roller Derby, Rollerball, and a throwback to Cyberball 2072! And THEN some!   * Strategy - Man, think grandmaster style Chess. Now think of something better, like Chess with Mechs. To say this game is a challenge would be an understatement. Just planning a move can be painstaking; let alone a series of them. Whether you're playing the AI or another human opponent, paying attention to every little detail can mean striking paydirt or get your bot's head ripped off (...that doesn't really happy but you get my gist).   * Tactical - People talk about games like Enemy Unknown and Shadowrun: Dragonfall's tactical gameplay. Not saying FC is any better or worse, but you would be hard-pressed even thinking about leaving FC out of the conversation. We're talking Wasteland 2 meets Fallout Tactics on the pitch. Your five versus my five. My brain versus yours. And there's no mashing buttons and constant clicking of the mouse or keyboard here DURING the play. You live with your choices! Once you map out your play, click the continue button and watch the carnage unfold.  You not only get to map out YOUR scenarios but you can map out YOUR OPPONENT's scenarios too. It's like Bobby Fisher playing Boris Spassky in '72. What if while Bobby is planning his moves, he gets to MOVE his peices around WHILE moving Boris' peices around with unlimited access to see the counteractions of various strategies? He would've NEVER moved that damn Pawn! Think about it! What if you can map out a 'What If' in real-time, then rewind it back to do it again differently without retribution? Wargames anyone? I think I actually named one of my bots WOPR, btw. Furthermore, if you're anything like me, watch your opponent do the one thing you hadn't planned for and lay your best laid plans to waste! &gt;:(  Mode 7 should be commended for what they have bought to the gaming community.

            "review_text": "I love Frozen Cortex, but I will admit it panders to a specific audience. If you enjoyed Blood Bowl, and enjoy very slow turn-based strategy, this game might be for you. Plus the game has only gotten better over time.  The developers have added a lot of flavor to the season mode, as well as finally letting you continue to play more seasons with your team after your first season is over. Managing your team is very fun. You can release and sign players (who all have individual stats) and even bid on free agents.  The only real downsides are that it is painful to play online because your oppenent either doesn't bother to take his turn or there is no one online. The camera angles can be annoying, but can be edited in the settings menu.",

The team editor is broken so you cant change the nema or stats of your players. Some times the game fails to render icons during the matches. There is also no way to affect the starting positions of your players. That means that custum players are meaningless because you migh end up with your blockers on the end sides and runners on the scrimmage line.
