If you are looking for an effing hard platformer with tight controls but still fun to play with, for your sake please play the Super Meat Boy instead of this. Don't get me wrong, i do like if a game punishing me with some hard obstacles. But the challenges in this game aren't rewarding at all! And the story.. the atmostphere.. aren't engaging enough to keep me continue my playthrough.  Stomping and shredding the werewolf was fun and satisfying. It really was.. and then come this sequel..",

Short game though, beat it in only two hours. I'd say get it on sale when its under a dollar.   The voice of the people is the voice of God    9 / 10 ",

The plaform controls are pretty good, I died a lot but there were no cheap deaths, mostly my mistakes. The only section I wish they would change is when you fly on a bird and the game becomes sort of shoot 'em up, the bird moves painfully slow and it's impossible to dodge anything. Controls are pretty good, I heard people complaint about them, but I quite liked them.",

Its a cool little platform with some interesting mechanics and levels, its short and cheap and will fill that itch you may have for a classic platforming game",
