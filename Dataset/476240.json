            "review_text": "First impression: quiet puzzle game  After 20 of almost 100 levels, this game feels a lot like  LYNE : not only is the design similar, it is a good game to break out when you have a little time. Like LYNE, it also features new bonus levels daily. The levels work a little like a labyrinth: you won't need a moment of inspiration, but it is very easy to work yourself into a dead end if you're not careful. A mobile release is planned, but so far, this game is Steam only.  Recommended.   This game runs well on my old Windows XP machine. ",

The game starts off easy, but gradually makes it more difficult, often requiring thinking and or trial and error. For $0.99, this game is a steal!!!  Final Rating: 8/10",

            "review_text": "   This appears to be a puzzle game with a chess theme.  You're basically moving your Knight around the board trying to get it onto a particular square in order to solve the puzzle .  You start of easy with one blue knight and after solving a few puzzles the difficulty is ramped up and a red knight appears along with the blue knight.  You then have to try and move the red knight and blue knights into the correct position.  Probably gets more difficult as the game goes on ,i haven't played long enough just yet to see how.    Nice relaxing puzzle game with easy on the eye graphics style.",

There later levels feel less like a chess puzzle and more like a one-by-one slide puzzle, which drains you fast. I'd recommend Lyne over this game, if you had the option. But, if this is on sale and you're looking to kill an hour or two, it's hard to argue with the price, just don't expect an enjoyable late game.",

            "review_text": "There's a reason this game has zero negative reviews: it is pleasing to the eye, ear (super pretty ambient music track), and mind. Just a lovely, chill, relaxing, rewarding game. The puzzles are challenging, but not annoying or insanely difficult, and all totally logic based. No knowledge of chess required (but the checkboard pattern plays an important part in helping you figure out where to move / store pieces). I'm over halfway through after several days of off and on play, and haven't had to skip any boards yet. If you get stuck, just reset the board and start over, and you'll likely figure out the solution quickly. You can take as many turns as you want, there's no time penalty or move limit / counter. Ridiculously cheap. Bug free, and fully functional. Probably the best value on Steam that I've come across yet. I play this to mellow out after other games or situations leave me stressed and annoyed. If logic puzzles appeal to you in the slightest, buy this game, you won't regret it, I guarantee. 11 out of 10. Simple perfection.",

The game itself is very simple: you have red and blue knights and you have to get all the pieces into similarly colored squares. The easy levels do a fair job at teaching the main mechanics, but then the difficulty level starts swaying all over the place. While there is some strategy to the harder levels, there's not very much in the way of set patterns or rules of thumb etc.   I also didn't like the 45 degree tilt to the game board. It's very hard for myself to visualize the movements in the default orientation.",
