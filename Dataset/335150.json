In short: I installed, had a black screen for about 20 minutes, then closed the window and uninstalled. I tried playing 5 minutes after it was released, admittedly. And I was kinda expecting some excitement at being one of the first to play it as it was released on steam. 5/10 would go through similar circumstances again (with it loading properly, of course).",

This games liking is a matter of opinion and gamechoice over anything.  Rating : 7/10 Would play again",

When you finish a dungeon all the loot is placed on cards and the party has to each blindly pick one, meaning with large parties, chance mostly affects distribution, rather than the contents loot itself.  Except they attatched pay to win onto it, Half the cards are only available for paying players, and flipping more than one is doable only by inserting real cash money.  Playing it is a real informative look at what not to do as a developer.",

The premice of the game is not to get the best items and look cool its to kill things and finish quests. So the game is playable without having to buy items, you are able to play all the way through. The only time you can buy items, is when you want to buy some stupid gear with real money which in reality you can buy with the ingame currency or by somehow crafting it. So i think this is not a pay to win and that you can play for as long as you like without having to buy things will real life money.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to be honest... I don't see what is making all the hate on this game, I have played a fair bit, and i find it very enjoyable. its kind of like, realm of the mad god upgraded.   There are 3 things this game doesnt have that realm of the mad god has, full screen, permadeath and an oceanic server.   Full screen i would like, it would make it a lot more enjoyable experience playing the game in my opinion. though i would like to state that realm of the mad god had weird scaling issues when it went to full screen so i'm not completely sure if i can count that as an advantage over this.   As for perma-death, it is my most hated system UNLESS you have some kind of progression system in the game that is built upon death. like rogue leagacy's coins gathering mechanic. Realm of the Mad God took this idea and completely murdered it, making you spend real money to get what, in my opinion, should be the progression currency. (for example you need to buy gold coins to unlock more classes)  Lastly the oceanic server, this is clearly purely because i live in australia, for most people this wouldnt be an issue  Back to this game however, it has more classes, more abilities, it has a pet system which add active and passive abilities to your character. I guess you don't have things like Archer arrows penetrate but in Realm of the mad god but honestly, 4-6x the active abilities makes me not care.   I see some people saying about the whole paying model? I mean yes it's there... It's a free to play game, are you new to the concept of in game stores to pay for bonuses? It's a very common free to play model and is, in my opinion, one of the best.   Those who say they are constantly bombarded with things telling them to buy stuff or that it always opens windows going to their 'buy diamonds' page, i don't know what you're doing wrong but i've not had any of this at all. There is a little store button down the bottom? If you click on that you will go to the store i'm sure... Besides that, it's the normal free to play game stuff.   I have played many free to play games and personally am quite used to the systems in place here. I believe this game could be a spiritual successor to realm of the mad god, if that's what you're looking for, welcome.",

Boring. Gameplay? Even more boring.  This game looked not that bad from the pictures and such, so I downloaded it, after all - what is 1MB to download lol. I tell you, not even worth the 1 MB . You get kicked into an island without any story whatsoever, with 2 keys to play with except the moving WASD keys.... So you press left mouse to shoot and 1\\space to preform a skill. I found myself holding the left mouse key for infinity with the most unsatisfying attacking animation in history, then to realize the skill looks even worse... Apart from shooting tiny little pixels of nothing for 5 minutes I found a statue of a crab (?) that led me into a duengeon which I just rushed into the boss because the monsters do nothing and take way too long to kill. A lvl 1 Assasins vs A lvl 8 Boss... I really tried hard, but I just couldnt die. I stood afk for almost 2 minutes and he barely damaged me... Are you kidding me?.... Maybe the late game is better but all the sound fx bugs and the animations are just too much to play untill the late game.",

You need no skill in this game I played as a warlock witch in most games is a squishy high DPS class but when i got hit from anything I took 1 damege out of my 1000 health! I also leveled up by clicking words and in mid game its asks me to be a VIP. The gammererer is also very goods is thiss games, It also has three sounds in the whole game. The hit sound you and monsters take( I cant tell if I am geting hit or I am hiting them, the crappy looping theme, and the best one when you go to the store that is P2W. I even had huge bugs some times I would just start moveing to the left and then I have to tab out of the game to fix it. But like it matters because I take no damege from anything. The classes seem every similer with just retexeerd skills. And every time I get a drop it is like 10 levels high than I am. Over all this is the most game I have ever played.   Over all I give this game a 1/10 for trying to be a game.  P.S .......................... I just dont want too remember this game any more.................. I dont want too. ",

When you first launch the game it starts to download game files (why coulnd't it just donwnload them through steam?) and you are greeted with a 'Choose class/create character' screen. No customization to characters or anything. Once you have choosen your class and your name, you will be thrown into the game after a character selection menu. Game downloads more files (or just tries to establish a connection) and then you will be thrown into middle of enemies with other players and music. No sound effects, except the characters making weird noise when taking dmg. I immediately quit the game after noticing that the game was pretty much a Realm of the Mad God (which is a much better and playable game imo) copy. I would have liked to have another game LIKE RotMD. Not a copy of it. Yes, I did only play for 5 minutes, but that was enough for this game imo.",

My problems with this game stem from the fact that the difficulty ramps up around lvl 20, there is no real story so there's no need to read the quest descriptions, and after about 15 minutes I was so bored that I only kept playing to see if the game would get any interesting at higher levels.  Pros:  Character selection  Rogue-like design  Quests  Cons:  Difficulty spike  Quests have no meaning  Boring (though this might be good for insomniacs)",
