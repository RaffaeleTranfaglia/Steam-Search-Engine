            "review_text": "This game is one of the worst I've played. Everything you shoot bleeds, The walking speed suggest your bald, spider-demon daughter tied ankle weights to your feet, while running throws your flashlight around like a madman, enemies are either stuck in walls or do no damage, and putting an enemy out of it's misery of awful game development deletes them. That being said, the game provides a good laugh. So even though the game it's self is terrible I still recommend you get it because you can probably finish the game and get a refund. That is if you can stop laughing at your shaven-headed spider baby who melts through walls.",

            "review_text": "I'm sorry but what is this crap? It's like taking LSD and watching into the Sun without Sun Glasses. Also there are Zombies, but they do nothing other than prevent you to pass, they are like Walls, no seriously, you have 36 Shots and need 10 Shots for one Zombie but there are 10 coming, so there is not enough ammo to allow any progression anyway.  And if you run out of Ammo it's not that they kill you, no, you simply can't walk forward or backward, they are blocking you and their Melee does nothing, also the Zombies hit you all the Time while you can't move anymore, but it does nothing, they hit and hit and you loose no Health, you simply can't move anymore because they are like Walls blocking you.  The 5GB this Game uses are pure waste, looks ok, controls are ok, but it's no shooter, no survival whatever, not even scary, only ♥♥♥♥ing annoying and bugged like hell, i even fallen trough the Floor in the first Minute after it started and had to restart. Also it's what you have to do if you run out of Ammo, because you don't die even if they hit and hit and hit you, you simply can't move anymore because Zombies are blocking you from all side, while you hear a repeating glitched Audio, thats all...  And also you have different Guns that looks like Rifles, but no matter what you switch too, the Gun you hold is a Pistol, well whatever...  It's really the greatest crap Game of this Sort i ever seen, deleted the Game and moved it to the Scrapyard!",

By the way, for some reason, the weapon design does not reflect their picture on the corner of the screen... yeah...  Also, seems too easy. Walked through fire and flames and didn't even receive damage. I think this meter is probably broken.  You don't have a reason to deliberately buy this game.",

            "review_text": "If, like me, you're a fan of the FPS genre of games, you'd think Time Ramesside is a worthy investment - it's not. I don't like having to unrecommend an FPS game with a promising premise, but this game has far too many lazy technical and gameplay problems.  Sure, you have a few graphics settings - but they're clumsy - you can't turn off motion blur, instead, you have to click 'low-&gt;medium-&gt;high-&gt;epic' on the settings and guess at which one might turn it off. It does work well enough in 4K, but that's not the problem.  The developer was simply too lazy to 'finish' the game. Some scenes in the game look great! And others look like utter crap - fuzzy textures on incomplete models clashing with highly polished jail cells and nice lighting effects. What we're seeing here might well be the effect of introducing the developers to crystal meth halfway through the development cycle, which might explain the jekyll &amp; hyde levels of quality and shabbiness. You even have clipping issues when reloading your gun - jaggy polygons seen through your partially-invisible arm!  Gameplay is equally and inexplicably shoddy - it's the same effectively as 1996's Quake, from iD software (it's 2016 now). You can run, jump, look up, look down, run over piles of bullets left around on the ground. You fight some nicely modelled zombie things which disappear as soon as you shoot them! I guess they spent the 'develop a lying down corpse' budget on more crystal meth. For some reason, in the first level, you're in some kind of jail/mental asylum full of zombies. The cell block is around as big as New York City, which is weird, and not really much fun running around in this endless single path full of the same game assets again and again.  So, all in all, this might look great but it's not, it's awful.",

The ending doesnt exist (literally just loops back to the start), has terrible level design and layout, with clipping errors spread throughout each and every level. The game trailers actually use stolen assets and retextures of the unreal engine 4 reveal demo. Literally put them side by side and you will laugh at how blatant it is. How this game is even being sold on steam is absolutely amazing. I have never witnessed a game this bad.",

If your game is so bad that I literally cannot get more than a few minutes in without completely giving up, you have hit an absolute new low. I can't even possibly imagine that this game was made as a ♥♥♥♥ing SOURCE mod, much less a full-fledged UNREAL 4 game. Ugh.  In the 10 minutes or so of playing the game I experienced: Disgusting main menu with no music, backround visuals, nothing Horrific framerate, no matter what I did Graphics that look like something out of 2005 No story whatsoever Boring initial setting Clunky and awkward cutscenes and gameplay Getting killed by the first enemy  BUT  The weapon switching is pretty cool. 1/10 ",
