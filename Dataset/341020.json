            "review_text": "As someone who has played almost every Metroidvania on Steam, this one is pretty good. The game just drops you into the world and turns you loose. A lot of people seem to take issue with this approach, but I like the fact that the game pushes you to explore and think. There is a minimal amount of explanation and the player has to figure out everything. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, and its rewarding to figure out some of the game's puzzles and progress. There is no in-game map, but it's not that big of a problem. There's a lot of hidden secrets and the game has many of the standard MV upgrades you have to find (double jump, swim etc.)  The default controls are a little weird as other have said, so keyboard play is awkward at first. After the first hour though I was fine",

If it had a slightly more interesting soundtrack and didn't crash on me 3-4 times throughout my run of it, it would have been 5/5. A must buy though for people who enjoy metroidvania style games.",

Lots of secrets, upgrades and enemies to defeat. And jewels, lots of jewels.   Innovative inclusion of sound in puzzles.    The not so good:      Lack of a proper tutorial, I've found myself singing at walls way too many times   A certain kind of enemy with a shield in narrow corridor that made me lose 20 minutes   No keyboard support    The conclusion:    A must have for all the fans of the genre and a should have for people that appreciate a beautiful game with solid gameplay.

            "review_text": "EDITED AS OF 6/4/16   Pretty fun game. Nice controls, nice graphics.  Pros:  Metroidvania style platformer Controls are tight and responsive Harkens back to a time when games were difficult, and didn't lead you by the hand to everything (although now as CoT, it has a bit of tutorial. But it is NOT invasive)  Intergrated dash button is MORE THAN welcome, as is the simplistic map Good audio Sound being the main idea is a cool concept  Cons:  Metroidvania style platformer; you will be doing A LOT of backtracking Hit box for your character seems a bit bigger than it should be (combined with your limited range, it can be a nightmare)  Personal Cons (FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED DEXTERITY): As was my complaint when I first bought this: 'I wish there was a dedicated button for...' That's still the case, only this time, a.. well, it's a spoiler. But, there comes a time where you need to double tap the down button QUICK, as it's a main mechanic. Luckily, XPadder was playing nice, and I was able to map the down arrow to one of the unused controller buttons, and turn it on turbo.  Controllers are... wonky. They work, just buttons seem not to line up as you set them (it could be the controller itself too). Mini con  7/10.Frustratingly difficult at times, and you'll love every minute.",

            "review_text": "After 30 minutes of play, this game sets a pace that I'm not interested in continuing on in.  The interesting visuals and dramatic first 5 minutes of the game did a good job of setting an interesting tone for me. I was excited to see what the game actually had to offer.  Then 15 minutes later, I was still wondering when the game would start.  The introductory 'graveyard' level is too long, relies too much non-imaginative platforming (one area feels like bad rip from the first level in Mario 2), and doesn't offer anything but a possible feeling of suspense based on how quiet it is. But that suspense never gives way to anything -- Only the next empty area: a boring labrynth of dead-ends in the 'library.'  After searching the Library, you eventually find your way to the first actual level of the game - the forest. Experience riviting pleasures as you wander through a seemingly endless collection of random doors and caves, opening treasure chest after treasure chest, collecting countless items that mean nothing to you as the player.  After meeting a large creature that expected me to play it a specific song to communicate with it, and it killed me for answering wrong too many times, I didn't have the urge to continue.  Overall, this game has some setbacks that don't grip the interest of the beginning player: the pick-ups give a sense of pointless collect-a-thon meets scavenger hunt, and the level design gives no real feeling of excitement, adventure, or familiarity. Even with a map, it felt like a confusing collection of randomly designed rooms thrown together without much forethought.  Perhaps this game picks up if you give it more time, but based on my first 30 minutes, I can't recommend it. Which is a shame, because I love the visuals, theme, and proposed genre of this game. The gameplay just didn't do it for me.",

            "review_text": "Got three minutes in the game before controls became an issue. Immediately checked out the settings to remap keybindings. It wasn't clear how to, so I went ahead and searched for the answer on Google, and the discussion forums used by Steam.  The consensus is 'you can't.'  Okay, so for someone playing on a home computer basically what I've been told is I need a twenty to thirty dollar peripheral (a controller) to play this game. It'd be psychotic if the publisher were to suddenly offer downloads for Rock Band and conveniently neglect to mention the requirement of third party hardware.  So none of the publishers or developers associated with this software will be getting any of my business unless this problem gets fixed. Well, any more. They already screwed me out of fifteen bucks. I will -happily- take down this review if that gets changed, but until then...be aware.  Kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that another player has to go through the trouble of buying a game first to tell you it's broken, huh?",
