            "review_text": "Does the thought of helping a young goddess regain all her former power and wisdom appeal to you? Then this might just be the game for you.  Enter the mind of Devine, a troubled young goddess with a lot of burdens to bear. Starting off as weak and powerless she searches a forgotten realm for the memories of a life long lost and gradually gains the strength to take on her unknown enemy.  The characters in this game are great; I wanted to learn so much more about them and the world in which they inhabit. The story was very intriguing as well; although it is somewhat easy to figure out I was still very happy to see its conclusion. The game is not overly long but its long enough to get your money’s worth in my opinion, especially if you plan on collecting coins and character skins.  The art style was very pretty too, I loved the bright vivid colours and cartoonish design of everything. The exploding light effects when slaying an enemy are particularly impressive. The environments themselves are pretty and have diversity about them, from deepest caves to sweet happy little villages this game covers a lot in a short amount of time. The soundtrack is catchy too; I really liked it and found myself humming along to a couple of the songs a few times.   This game is a ton of fun, the powers and abilities we are given add a subtle depth to the combat and exploration that whilst having been done before is very well implemented in this title. The ability to switch the characters mask at will was a nice feature and stopped the combat from becoming stale. But fair warning the controls on the other hand were lacking and imprecise, in my opinion it added to the charm of the title I can see some becoming annoyed with them. Also towards the end there is a huge difficulty spike that drove me insane, but it felt so great when I finally overcame it.  At full price I would be really - hard pressed to recommend this due to its simplicity, a couple crashes and sometimes frustrating controls, but when on sale or if you are metroidvania fan then this is a buy, it’s still a nice adventure through a wonderful world and I am looking forward to any other titles in the series.  Have Fun ^_^",

            "review_text": "I had been waiting a long time for the release of this and was hoping it would be a great game but when it did finally get my hands on it my hopes were shattered.  The games looks nice and colourfull and for the first 10 minuts or so things seemed to play nice and smooth but then it happened the game started to stutter and big frame rate drops soon began to show. On certain parts when going up to a higher point instead of it being nice and smooth the whole screen seems to flip to the next screen this also happens on when you try to drop down also.  The other thing is I found myself getting bored with the going backwards and forwards meeting the same old but few but far between bad guys who don't really do anything other than move towards you. Boss fights are another drawn out borefest and seem to take an age and by the time you have finished them off you start to think what was the point and when you get to the next one it is more of the same thing.  There is also a problem with collision detection I found myself falling through many a ledge when I should of been able to land perfect.  The game just feels unfinished and needs a lot of work doing to make this run nice and smooth but even then there just isn't enough to keep you interested in finishing the game.  For me I can't see myself going back to try and complete this unless something really changes.  ",
