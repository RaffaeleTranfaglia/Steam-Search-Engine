            "review_text": "I really do love stealth games though I understand they can be rather polarizing as they test patience and can be unforgiving. Turnover is a particularly unforgiving game and has pushed my patience with the short amount of time that I have spent with it.  That said, from each death I learn how to better navigate the game as Turnover has very solid and consistent mechanics. Each level takes me a few deaths/runs to understand where to expect encounters and available paths and how to get through, but getting to the end is wonderfully rewarding and I feel like I really deserved it.  Long Division, LLC is also very open to feedback and is responsive which will make this great game even better with time.",
