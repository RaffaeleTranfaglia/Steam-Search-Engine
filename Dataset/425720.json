    "description": "A VR minigolf experience taking you to a beautifully landscaped course high above the clouds. Single player, online and local multiplayer, and a course editor allow you to build, share, and play other user created holes. No swing or power meters here, simply swing the club to play. Fully supports HTC Vive and Oculus Touch.",

That being said, this game is good enough to get my approval anyway. When the eventual additional courses and course editor come out I'll also be able to choose to play the kinds courses I prefer.",

Con: Multiplayer is not really feasible. Holes can be short and swapping headsets every couple of minutes is a real pain, especially since people tend to have different head sizes and IPD. Would be better if it let you play all 9/18 holes and then swap to the next person.",

The Game is fun and best suited for Party fun. The Achievements are quite unrealstic and need to be managed alittle bit better. Your power won't translate properly without a small backswing, and some of the courses can be the stuff that aggrovates people to no end and casue stress and frustration.  The Game design itself is very pretty and you can loose yourself into the enviroment.  I recommend this game to you if you like golf, don't mind abit of a challange or are looking for a good VR party game.",

            "review_text": "I have played about 5 VR games so far, and this is probably my favorite. However, it does have some bad bugs in it though that need to be fixed:  - When you swing to try to hit the ball hard, the putter sometimes swings right through the ball. Even worse, sometimes it records a stroke even though the ball didn't move. - Often you hit the ball out and instead of dropping the ball where you last hit it, it puts it at the location prior to that. - In my last game, the ball became lodged in a barrier. I lost 5 or 6 strokes on the last hole just to get it unstuck. What a great score I would have had. :(  Also, I wish there were more courses, but please no more like hole 11. I hate that one with a passion.",

The music is annoyingly repetitive, trying to hit the ball too hard seems to make your club pass through it, and while the magic of VR minigolf is that you can create the weirdest holes possible, some holes seemed to overdo it and felt hardly special instead.  Still, with good physics, great graphics, online multiplayer AND (future) Steam workshop integration for course creation, you will never run out of new and beautiful tracks to play on.",

This is a great game to show people VR.

Also actually getting the club to hit the ball requires some finesse as you can easily end up ghosting right through it. Also the physics are bugged, with the ball reliably bouncing backwards away off a gentle slope. Not the best vr game out there, needs work, but at its core it's still fun. the bugs just push it toward the edge of frustration. Still did all 18 holes. You'd be better served going to play it in real life. That said, i'm sure there'll be updates and fixes.",
