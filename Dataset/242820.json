            "review_text": "140 is a simple game, but it is a very lovely fresh game. the game is on the lines of a casual puzzle/platform game where you control a cube/triangle/circle and you just have to save all the colored balls around the levels, it has surprisingly good boss fights and great level design. Nothing was impossible and it was all enjoyable due to the soundtrack and visuals. In my personal recommendation, if you have $5 to spare on this game, you should probably buy it, if you don't have the 5 dollars, it's been on the humble bundle a few times and its not super popular, so you could probably pick it up from someone for very cheap, if not free from a friend. The best way to explain this game is fresh and relaxing. Which doesn't come very often in puzzle/platform games.   Only true regret: the game is very very short. would've been angry if it was $5, but I spent $1 on a bundle.    So now the standard game rating:",

            "review_text": "140 is more like a piece of abstract artwork than a game intended to be played and enjoyed. It's simple elegance pervades every corner of the experience, to the extent it almost manages to push gameplay entirely out of the picture. The basic shapes and purposeful use of contrasting colors invokes comparisons to Mondrian, with a calculated simplicity and conspicuousness that elevates the presentation from rudimentary to a captivating example of minimalism. Moved by the beat of a reserved yet distinctive audio track, the experience feels alive as you move through levels, perfectly in sync with each other as if performing an elaborate dance.  In this way, you are something of an outlier; awkwardly progressing through areas you ought not to be in. This creates an odd sort of disconnect between the gameplay and the atmosphere, as while both work wonderfully together to create a brilliant rhythm based platformer, their is just something  off  about all of it that left me somewhat unsatisfied over the whole affair. I enjoyed every second of the one hour experience, but I also feel no need to spend anymore time within the game.  140 is undeniably a very cool game, one which demands a closer dissection of its elements than you would assume at first glance, the core of which is incredibly tight and polished. It made me think and left me feeling smarter for overcoming its challenges, but as the small side project of a single developer it is, it shouldn't be expected to have the amount of content or range of mechanics to feel like a fully fleshed out concept. It's an experiment, one that succeeds at what it attempts while prompting you to dig deeper into its refined define, but that is all it is and expectations should be set accordingly before entering its psychedelic world.",

The great audio track starts off simple and as you progress through the level it slowly builds up to a great new age/electronic tune. You use the audio to your advantage as the environment moves and changes with the beat. Its a very short game which is expected for its price point and there are only 6 levels, 3 of them being unique while the other 3 are just reversed versions of the first minus the checkpoints. Yep that's right if you die you start the level again!   ----&lt;DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF&gt;----  -You like awesome graphics -You want a long adventure -2D platforming isn't your forte  ----&lt;DO BUY THIS GAME IF&gt;----  -You are searching for something unique and quirky -Enjoy a bit of a challenge",

            "review_text": "I beat the game and was really pleased, only to find out that I still had half the game left to complete, sort of...  I hate frustration platformers, but the first half of this game nailed the right level of difficulty for me. It mixes a rhythm game with a platformer, where as it goes on you'll need to use the abstract but enjoyable electronic music in order to time your movements.  Visually it's extremely simple, but surprisingly appealing and even beautiful at times. Screenshots absolutely do not do it justice. I feel the slick animations in time with the music and sound effects, particularly in the boss encounters, raise the visuals above what you'd expect from such simple assets. Even the way the character morphs between shapes while jump and move is brilliant, even better than the squash and stretch animations of Thomas Was Alone.  Mechanically I felt the game did an excellent job at throwing new ideas at the player constantly, while giving concise organic lessons before throwing them into something more difficult. Each of the 3 bosses I fought had that small learning period as well. The checkpoints are frequent and I was rarely frustrated. It seems some players aren't even aware of the 'second half', as they only appear if you go through the main menu back into the game, and go just further to the right than you had to go the first time. These 3 extra levels seem to be identical to the original 3, but mirrored left to right, using different color combinations, with permadeath... I didn't realize it the first time I tried the first mirrored level, until I died and spawned back at the intro. I decided to give it another crack and I was able to complete it without dying on the next try. The level of stress shoots through the roof, as the whole level becomes as tense as the hardest sections of the game. I don't really enjoy that level of difficulty, specifically the concept of punishing failure with repetition, but in this case it's not really extra content, so it can be safely skipped if you're not up to it.  My playtime so far, beating 4 of the 6 levels was just shy of an hour, but I quickly fell in love with it's simplicity. It doesn't match the charm of Thomas Was Alone, or the unbelievable visuals of FEZ, but it's damn good for what it is. It runs flawlessly at 120FPS at 1080P, but it probably supports higher resolutions as well. I played with a keyboard rather than a controller because I honestly just started it to see it, but it hooked me and I ended up beating the whole thing in one go. Pricing is up to the buyer, but I'd say it's certainly worth the asking price on a moderate sale, or in one of the dozen bundles it's been in.",

It had some nice ideas and really couldn't be faulted from a design point of view but personally I found the whole thing a bit boring.   This, from the Limbo director however is right up my street. It is in many ways like a remix on the idea of Limbo in that you are a thing, it's a minimilistic platformer, and you have no real abilities to speak of as such, just moving and jumping, but I found it to be an immersive experience with good tunes which brilliantly play an integral part in the gameplay and not only good design but a new idea or mechanic in almost every little section.   Admittedly it shouldn't take you more than an hour or so to complete and there's no real replay value there other than the challenge of trying to go through the game without dying atall, but if you like brilliantly designed, short, challenging and immersive games then go for it. I had my experience, I enjoyed it, I recommend it.",

            "review_text": "140 is a deceptively simple-looking 2D platformer, where you play as a silently morphing geometric shape attempting to collect all the shiny things and dodge all the obstacles. Pretty standard platformer fare, although the little twist on this one is that everything moves to the beat. I enjoy myself a good rhythm game - here's lookin' at you Space Channel 5 - so it's a pet peeve of mine when a 'rhythm' title has nothing to show for it other than a few elements moving to a basic pulse. From the screenshots I assumed 140 would be a prime example of that, but was proven wrong almost as soon as I started the first level.  There is no screenshot in the world that can truly demonstrate how flawless the rhythmic aspects of this game are.  Everything  responds to the music both technically and visually, whether it's the way an object moves, how it changes aesthetically to 'describe' a sound, or how the background music morphs, builds and fires off as you plunge further forward. It also offers a whole lot of rhythmic complexity, so if you were expecting to breeze through by counting 1-2-3-4 then brace yourself - we're talking tied notes, dotted rhythms and syncopation with this one. Finally, I especially loved some of the fantastic audio-visual moments that this game offers up, which I won't spoil but can guarantee you'll love seeing if you happen to be musically minded.  Getting worried that I'm talking about music and rhythm a lot? I wouldn't worry too much. The game is still playable if you find it hard to clap in time; it just means that certain obstacles will feel much, much harder to get through as the answer almost always involves just listening. Thankfully, the default levels come with unlimited deaths and generous checkpointing, so as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement you'll be fine.  So, the final verdict? 140 is a solid testimony to the rhythm-crossover genre, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a rhythm game. I'd also give it a try if you're just looking for something a little different to play, as I'm not sure I've ever seen a game like this before. However... the second I post this review I will be uninstalling the game and never playing it again. Funny considering I'm singing such high praises of it, right? Yeah, well - you know that little 'as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement' disclaimer I made in the previous paragraph?  I have every achievement. Never. Again.",

You play as a small object that basically shape shifts, leaping from platform to platform and trying to avoid obsticles that get in your way, which all work with the beat of the music.  You have to reach the end of each stage and collect a small object to put in its correct place, which is pretty simple. Theres 3 levels that are very short indeed, but at the end of each you encounter a challenge known as a 'boss' which can be a little tricky to complete but eventually you will get there.  But dont think this game is so easy, once you finish your 3 levels, theres 3 more levels known as mirror levels, and thats when it gets hard, you have to do each level without dying, which is possible but if you have no patience you will get angry fast! lol  Overall an excellent idea of a game, controls are easy to use and no complaints on the resolution and graphics, perfermance is fine too.

            "review_text": "Not particularly hard or unfair, all that 140 asks of you is a consistent performance at a pace of 140 beats per minute.  '140' is a minimalist platformer (up until the bosses) in which all of the challenges are set to music. It doesn't sound like anything special but its execution is excellent. Controlling the game is easy. Your low speed and high acceleration make every move easily predictable. Every challenge is layed out before you in a way that allows you to almost instantly know what to do to overcome it. There was never death that I felt was unfairly due except perhaps for the bosses. However, even those really were my fault. The feeling of unfairness just came from how overwhelmed I was by them on the first try.  Every motion in the game apart from yours is set to a steady rhythm. Obstacles move in time with the music and platforms appear on-beat. You are a geometric shape that changes as your state does. A circle while moving on the ground, a triangle while airborne and a square while standing still. Every level consists of simple, timed platforming during which you must, at regular intervals, collect a little pick-up (whose movement represents a mechanic you're about enable) and take it back to a specific point to progress. Each level culminates with a boss. All of which are slightly different but are all basically about avoiding obstacles thrown at you as opposed to the ones you jump at in the platforming sections.  The music is sort of recycled for use throughout the entire game. Specific elements of it are only heard when particular mechanics come in to play so it's not always entirely the same but it's definitely not a different song. Again, the exception to this is the bosses. They come whith their own musical flavours. Consistent with the rest of the game but separating them from the platforming sections and each other. This all works in the game's favour. The music feels a part of the game's design and it helps you play. It's also awesome music.  '140' is very short, consisting of only three levels each taking around 20 minutes on the first try. The game does offer replayability to you through a mirror mode in which there are no checkpoints. I can easily see only a minority (although not necessarily a small one) being drawn in by this since, once you've beaten the game, you've seen and conqured every challenge. What more is there to do? Well, this 'hard mode' poses its own challenge by asking you to remain consistent in your abilities for an entire level. Fail and you must start from the beginning. Even if you reach the boss.  Personally, I liked this. I seems a solid enough goal to aim for seeing as you know what's coming is simple timing and fairly easy platforming. Even the bosses aren't as fraustrating a second time. If the game hadn't set this challenge for me, I might not have decided to try it but since it did, I gladly took it on.  '140' is an enjoyable distraction. If you liked things like 'Thomas Was Alone', 'Element4l', or 'Limbo', you could probably get into this.",

It's great to see such a concept used this well and while simple, and very short, it's almost perfect it what it does.  Beware, I beat the game in about 1 hour. After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)  The game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!   As usual,  presentation ! 140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical '2D retro pixelated graphics' that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style.  It never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly. I really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole 'atmosphere'.  It's hard to talk about its  music  without talking about the  gameplay  at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.  As I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of.  All your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets. Well, how can you still make an unique game with that? Music!  Similarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.  Another game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!  I've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!   Another noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it  teaches  you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse! Sometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges. I never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret!  After you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.  Every big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller 'level', something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight.  It is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!  Another thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah. But it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated. It really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.  One nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!  I could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!   All in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about.  I'm really surprised about it, great little game! If you're a bit skeptical of the 5€ it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.",

You gotta align your jumps and movements to the beat and it's often quite challenging, but satisfying when you manage to get it done. It's really cool when they introduce new mechanics, which each produce their own sounds that align to the beat as well. Within each level, the music keeps layering and changing, and the color scheme keeps switching. Very well thought out progression in these levels. And the basic, flat geometry and simple color scheme, although barebones and minimalist, are quite beautiful to look at and see in motion. Even better with the euphoric music and how well they complement each other. It has very interesting boss fights too, unlike what I have seen in any other game. Because they match the unique stlye and mechanics of the game. It's all very abstract and minimalist, but that is exactly what is intended and it enhances the mechanics that much more. Everything is tightly and cleverly designed to match a simple vision. It's really simple, but often the most genius things are the most simple. And that is how I can go into all this detail over some squares, circles and triangles.  So 140 is a great audio and visual experience, and a fun and challenging platformer. It's pretty short though, being just 6 levels. But for the price and the experience, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out.",

It is relaxing and challenging at the same time. The music is wonderful, and so greatly interwoven with the visuals and the environment.  If you like the Trailer video, you will love the game.  About the people who say the game is 45 minutes short: Yes, the 3 basic levels can be beat in under an hour.

As mentioned earlier, gameplay is a mix of platforming and music. There are three chapters, with each chapter having different objectives. You control a object that can shape shift between a square, triangle or circle. The goal in each chapter is to keep moving forward, collecting items and activating switches and platforming along the way. As you progress through the chapter the music will change. Some of the platforming can be challenging and can take a while to get right. One complaint is that there are no save points during chapters (only inbetween chapters) so when you quit and resume your game, you have to start at the begining of the chapter you were on. There are a total of 3 chapters for campaign as well as 3 challenge chapters which will test your skills.  To be a successful rhythm game you have to have good music. Does this game have good music? Well, yes it does. Audio is electronic pop which is not iritating to listen to.  Graphics are presented in a 2D fashion. The textures aren't well detailed, however this isn't important in a rhythm game.  A good rhythm game. ",

I also love the art style - simple shapes and colours... This game is a work of art.  The game requires that you become aware of rhythms and patterns to proceed past each obstacle. Some of the obstacles are challenging and the game encourages you to figure out the solutions by yourself - no helps or prompts. To compensate for this, there are plenty of checkpoints (perhaps too many?) in each level so that you aren't left frustrated after dying. I found the 'boss' challenges to be at a perfect level of difficulty. I definitely recommend this, although extra levels would be nice (I completed all difficulties after a couple of hours).

Each time you complete a segment you save at a checkmark, which makes it less painful when you fail over and over again. Some people may struggle with the timing or precise controls required to complete some of the challenges, but I wouldn't call any of them impossible.  Most objects on the screen, besides your character, are simple squares. It doesn't get much simpler than that, but somehow it works. The graphics are vibrant and trippy at times, moving and changing colors to match the electronic music. The music by the way is fantastic! As you complete chapters and other key parts of the game the music will shift to reward the player with some awesome sounds.  My only complaint is that the game took me less than 90 minutes to complete. When you complete the 3 main acts (which takes 1-2 hours),you unlock the same 3 acts, but in reverse and without checkpoints. This should provide me some extra play time, but I'm certain that I will get frustrated and give up without the checkpoint handicap. So for that reason, the game doesn't have much replay value and the campaign is short, so I would only recommend this game if you find it on sale for $1-2.",

Tried the first level and died right near the end, so this will obviously take me a little more then 30 minutes.

            "review_text": "140 status: Completed primary campaign yet to 100%  Oh I am so damn conflicted about this review! I really don't know which way to go with it.  Look, this is a flash game. It has gorgeous visuals and sounds but it is still a flash game. This is okay though. I am absolutely a million times behind small time indie developers getting a more minimalist yet heavily polished experience onto steam so they can make some money and start off, even if the whole experience feels like a flash game. An example of this done right is Antichamber. It has the most blindingly shiny polish ever and it has length to boot. 140 has....well it has the polish at least.  140 is a moderately challenging platform game. Sadly though it only has 3 very short levels and it can be completed within a lunch break. Now you may be thinking that this might be a Nintendo hard game that makes up for its short life span with complicated levels, and really the levels aren't that hard at all, in fact the game doesn't really start to show its teeth until the third and final boss fight, and that's only because I'm completely thick and it took me a while to get used to the switch of gravity. I expect with practice you could probably speed run this without glitching in 25 or so minutes.   That is not to say that this is bad, by no means at all is it bad. Were it a free flash game it would be up there in most peoples top 10s. My only real complaints is the hit box seems to be a little bit out.  You see this is a platformer with static areas that will kill you and push you back to the last check point. There are no enemies to speak of which makes the experience feel a little lonely, rather the environment reacts with the music in the background which means that you have to get into rhythm with the sound track in order to progress which makes a very nice experience. The graphics are very simple and programmer arty which is fine with me. I see this as a very clever way of doing your first steps if you know a little about code but don't have the resources to hire a team. However everything is incredibly blocky but its stylistic, I am kind of on the fence for graphics. The hit detection seems a little unfairly sided to the static too, resting against a wall that suddenly changes will kill you, its only a pixel but you should really give the player the benefit of the doubt in most cases.  When you finish the game you can play a hard mode version of it, sadly though all the stages just go from right to left instead and they removed the check points. Not really worth much but at least its there, might add another hour or 2 to the game if you want to get your moneys worth. I would also like to point out that this game runs fine on low graphics for me but was a bit slow on high with my native res. I personally could not tell the difference and as its just 2d squares coloured I don't really see how you could up or lower the graphics, my rigs a little old now but it might be something for you to look out for.  At time of writing the game is £4 on steam and when I give my rating and recommendation I have to take that into account. Now remember I like the fact that these smaller flash type games are getting on steam, they are good fun little games, but they need a little bit more than what this offers and in this case its length. As I say, were this a freebie on newgrounds it would probably be getting an 8 or a 9 but as it stands I can only really give it a 4.  Don't take that as it being crap though! This score is just relative to its price. Make sure that you do play it if its in a bundle and you own it. But unless you really really really love the music/minimalistic genre you might want to wait until its a steam sale for at least half price or you might feel disappointed.  Remember 4/10 just means its below average, it doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. You may feel differently and I would love to hear your reasonings. Feel free to comment :)",

            "review_text": "140 is a rhythm-based platformer that challenges you with increasingly difficult stunts as your geometric character progresses through the game. Each time you complete a segment you save at a checkmark, which makes it less painful when you fail over and over again. Some people may struggle with the timing or precise controls required to complete some of the challenges, but I wouldn't call any of them impossible.  Most objects on the screen, besides your character, are simple squares. It doesn't get much simpler than that, but somehow it works. The graphics are vibrant and trippy at times, moving and changing colors to match the electronic music. The music by the way is fantastic! As you complete chapters and other key parts of the game the music will shift to reward the player with some awesome sounds.  My only complaint is that the game took me less than 90 minutes to complete. When you complete the 3 main acts (which takes 1-2 hours),you unlock the same 3 acts, but in reverse and without checkpoints. This should provide me some extra play time, but I'm certain that I will get frustrated and give up without the checkpoint handicap. So for that reason, the game doesn't have much replay value and the campaign is short, so I would only recommend this game if you find it on sale for $1-2.",

When I saw the trailer I thought you had to switch between the different shapes (circle, triangle, square) but that's actually done automatically as you move, thankfully. The main game (3 'worlds') is short. Probably only take 1-2 hours to complete. But there's 3 mirror/shadow worlds that are much harder that aren't factored into the 1-2 hour completion stat.

I got it in a HumbleBundle, so I'm ok with the short length of the game but had I bought it separately, I'd feel a little ripped off.  One interesting thing is that each stage has a boss fight. The first two bosses aren't too difficult but the third boss is extremely frustrating.   Overall, 140 is a good concept but it is more boring and frustrating than fun. I think BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a much better rhythm-based platformer.",

            "review_text": "140...as others have stated; is a platformer with obstacles that are in sync with rhythm.   Let me start off by saying that the soundtrack was amazing...at first. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't much variety to the soundtrack so it quickly fell off and became boring. Though, it did slightly change...you can still feel it being recycled.   The graphical choice was probably more so due to lazyness, lack of imagination, time restraints, or even budget. Either way, this kind of style has been done before. Despite the fact that graphics obviously don't make the game...the devs could at least tried to do something new with it. (I do like the equalizer, though. That was somewhat nifty.)  Gameplay is straight forward. However, it becomes almost tedious. Your timing has to be absolutely perfect otherwise, you're going to have to hear the annoying static sound along with a checkpoint set back. At least there's checkpoints...  Though, I do not mind pinpoint precision. Games like Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Boy require such. But...they have more of a satisfaction to it once completing levels and a better soundtrack.   I do understand that soundtrack and graphical choice are matter of opinion. Nevertheless, I believe that only goes to an extent.   If you're interested in this game; I suggest waiting for a pricedrop. It is definitely not worth $5 with the amount of OTHER indie games you can get for that price. Or, you know...get Super Meat Boy or Electronic Super Joy. (Or...Super Hexagon if you're fond of seizures.)  With a scoring system of cheese without beef. It would get charred cheese stuck to the bottom of a pan.   ",

It is not worth $5; in fact, I would argue its literally worthless. This feels like something a college student would do as a school project. The actual playtime you get from this is about an hour, maybe less or more taking into account how good you are at its “boss fights”. No replay value, no real content to absorb, nothing.

There is an interesting premise, sort of, in the sense that a lot of the more complicated platforming is alleviated by timing your movements with the music. That's pretty cool but the developers never really expand upon this idea. The game is essentially a couple good ideas without an substance. To make matters worse, this game is incredibly easy (despite developer's claims) and very short. I beat the game in about 40 minutes with no inclination to play again.  I would love to recommend this, I really would, but simply put it's a mediocre game with some great ideas that are never really executed beyond an extremely simplistic manner. Will you like the game? Maybe. You will, however, be wishing there was more substance than what you are getting.",

In level 3 you don't even need to match the melody to jump on the blocks, that's disappointing, the feature of the game is gone.",

            "review_text": "I almost never take the time to write a review of a steam game, most steam games I'm simply pleased with but not blown away, occasionally I'll write a positive review of a steam game I absolutely love. However, I don't believe I've taken the time to write a negative review of any steam game before this, so take all that into consideration when reading this review.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  Forgive the caps lock but I had to be clear, this game is a very good example of what people mean when they call a game 'indie' as a pejorative. Is it lazy? Yep. Is it self congradulatory? Yep. Is it overpriced and exploitative in design such that it takes a lot of time to beat just because of bad game design choices? Yep.  Think what you will about 'miminalism' but time and time again the indie community has shown that they believe it to mean 'getting away with being lazy by calling it an artistic choice'. This game uses solid colors like crazy, they aren't 'beautifully rendered' solid colors, they are just solid colors. In every area of game design aside from the music (which is decent) this game cuts corners on production.   First of all the mechanics consist of little more than basic 'avoid hazards, time jumps'. The hazards are a lazy static design. Honestly, this game looks a whole lot like what a game would look like if you set out with the idea of 'making the game requiring the least amount of effort to make and charging the most money you could get away with'. And you might suggest this is cynical or baseless, but think of this: This game does not have an options screen. You can adjust window size before playing but once you are in, you are in. Why doesn't this game have an options screen? Pretty much every game in the past 20 years has had an options screen, but for some reason this game is 'above having an options screen'.   What nerve the developer must have to think so highly of this game. And now, for the coding, this game could be coded by most decent coders in a week or two. That's it! Compare that to a game like 'The Binding of Isaac' a game with so much more depth and variety that most programmers couldn't even code or imagine. And take note, both games cost the same amount. That's the biggest insult is the price point. This game has THREE LEVELS. That's it, and how does the developer pad out the game with 'additional content'? He adds THE SAME THREE LEVELS again but with the X axis inverted on the level.   'Mirror mode' is acknowledged as incredibly easy to do, it's one line of code most of the time, inverting a level can be done in under a minute, it is absurdly easy, that's why some games have it as a 'cheat code'. Here, the almighty genius of a developer thinks so much of his game that he thinks these 3 inverted levels without checkpoints constitute 'new levels'.   What really irks me though is that somehow some people seem to be buying into this game. Read the reviews, I can't wrap my head around it, are we really such sheep that this passes as a quality 5 dollar game? I can't imagine all those reviews are real, I don't want to believe I live in a world where so many people could be such suckers. This guy is selling the video game equivalent of snake oil and people are gobbling it up.   To everybody who loves this game, I have a suggestion: You can play games of superior quality like this online FOR FREE, google kongregate or newgrounds, or google some game jam like ludum dare where people make games in literally 3 days and the top 200 entries for any game jam will be better (and less lazy) than this game. AND they will be free. I know for a fact that this developer has made more than enough money scamming people with 'minimalist' game design. The least he could do if he was going to be a lazy game designer is make it pretty. LIMBO is a pretty unremarkable game gameplay-wise, but at least it looked like the art took more that 2 seconds to make.   By this point I'd estimate most people have tuned out this review because it's quite long, but I had to make it and I had to make it long because I feel that passionately. Most of the indie game design community are very kind and selfless people they want their audience to enjoy their game. Here is the most damning thing about this game, and I truly believe it:  I don't think the developer cares if you like their game, only if you buy it.   I truly believe that, I got this game on some hefty sale and I still feel like I was ripped off. There are so many games of this and better quality online for free, this game has no art production value, very little innovation, and ONLY 3 LEVELS. It's a platformer with no art assets and only 3 levels that costs 5 bucks. Do you think a developer so selfish as to try to peddle such a scam of a game deserves any of your money?   Please do not buy this game, if for no other reason than to teach developers that they should care about their audience and not take advantage of them. Keep the indie community a better place by supporting good developers and not giving money to lazy exploitative developers such as this one.",

It goes from having a checkpoint every two or three deathly pits in the standard stages, to having no checkpoints at all and requesting you complete entire levels without failing in the reverse stages, unlocked after you finish the game. No way I'm doing it, it wouldn't be fun, it'd be masochistic, with no reward or gratification at the end.",
