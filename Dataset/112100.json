            "review_text": "If you're familiar with Spiderweb Software's RPGs, it will come as no surprise that Avadon: The Black Fortress is another extensive old school party-based trek through areas full of nooks and crannies with unique encounters and secret loot caches to be had, as well as exciting set piece encounters and an intriguing overall narrative. That's pretty much true of everything they put out. The big changes to the formula are: a new world; a significantly more linear progression than most of the other entries in their lineup, a class-and-skill-tree approach to character builds, and party members who are fully fledged NPCs that contribute insights and dialogue throughout the plot as you move through it, can be spoken to between missions, and have their own side agendas you will have to deal with.  The new world is an intriguing fantasy setting where five disparate and feuding lands have banded together in a defensive pact against pirates, invading empires, marauding humanoids and dragons, a blighted magical corruption, and other exterior threats. The pact is held together by the dictatorial enforcement of the Black Fortress Avadon, and they maintain a network of spies and enforcement agents to ensure compliance. The fairly unique conceit of this particular entry (and who knows, perhaps followup games in the series) is that you play Hands of Avadon, sent to enforce the laws of the pact and defend it from threats within and without. This gives you rather more authority and a much more fearsome reputation than your typical band of wandering adventurers, and this is used to good effect throughout, although alas you still have to contend with buying your own supplies, a tired RPG trope that seems even more out of place in this context (though they do attempt to explain it).  The linearity is somewhat unfortunate, but things do open up as you gain access to more of the areas and return to zones on new missions, and most of the sidequests can be done at your leisure. Still, the flipside of linearity is that you're always being sent into challenges that you should be equipped to handle, and it's always clear what you're expected to do next, neither of which are guaranteed in more open formats.  I am personally a big fan of Avadon's approach to skills and classes. I find the structure of new ability at rank 1, additional effect(s) at later ranks, and unlocking a secondary ability at a late rank very rewarding and I never feel like my points are wasted or that I have to save points from level to level just to advance at all, which have been issues I've historically had with the more freeform skill approach earlier Spiderweb games took (and other games with skill systems, for that matter). And Avernum in particular suffered from boring fighter syndrome where spellcasters got huge suites of spells to cast for a varied combat experience and fighters...got to hit things. Not here. The Blademaster class even passively is a blast, with heavy passive investment rewarding cleaves, a hilariously effective level of hit prevention, and the chance to riposte, curse enemies, or begin regenerating if hit, and then on top of that gets group buffs and debuffs and attacks with additional secondary effects. The Shadowwalker hurls shurikens, teleports around, throws pots of acid and smoke bombs, backstabs and poisons, and is a huge fountain of damage in general. (Needless to say, I was pleased when the Avernum remake cribbed from this system, albeit in a more Avernum-y way.)  As for the NPCs - there's one of every type, you get them all pretty nearly immediately, they stay levelled with you even if you're not using them, and they all have interesting personalities and backstories. I've never been a huge fan of the 'party too large for everyone to simultaneously adventure with you' thing, but this is about as good as it gets considering that.  So all in all, another classic RPG. It's not quite as old school as previous series from Spiderweb, but the deviations from that formula mostly are in the vein of improvements in RPG design, in my book, not stepping away from the core appeal.",

            "review_text": "Let me just say, I love all of the Spiderweb games. That being said, Avadon just might be their best game. While it is most definitely more linear than Geneforge or Avernum, the story and companion dialogue more than make up for it. You can spend the game looking for twists on your first playthrough, but I would bet that you wouldn't be able to guess most of what happens, especially because a decent amount of plot direction depends on what decisions you make. Whenever you hear someone say something like, 'For a game to be immersive it has to have fantastic graphics and a mega budget', show them this. I feel very fulfilled having just finished this game for the first time, and feel a compelling urge to start a second playthrough. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.",

Been trying to beat the final guy for over an hour, on the lowest difficulty setting with a max level party and the best weapons/equipment in the game according to what info I can find online. Attacks that did ~80 damage to the previous boss now do at most 14 damage to him. His health bar hasn't moved a single pixel in the last twenty minutes. And the kicker? I've been using the cheat codes every single turn. Pretty much have to, the boss gets 5 actions most turns which he uses to apply conditions to all 3 party members. He keeps magically yanking his own soul out to create golems that make him completely immune to specific types of damage. Have to spend 2-5 turns smashing the golem before being able to touch him and most hits are registering damage in the single digits. Pure frustration.",

The graphics are a little rough around the edges, but they have a unique charm. The story and choices that you make which have a lasting impact on the story branches available to you is really good. Characterization is not quite as good as, say, Planescape, or DAO, but still pretty good, you do get a feel for your companions and their unique personalities. I am probably only about 10 or 12 hours into this game but I've played it on a few different platforms at the same time, and I can verify that what class you choose and the companions you choose to take along with you can dramatically change the game play and even the story to some extent (choices available to you). I like the skill tree, it makes it so that even if you decide to be a shaman and also take the NPC shaman with you, you won't be carbon copies, you can be two distinctly different types of characters with their own role in the party dynamics. While I have not beat this, I've gotten far enough to easily recommend this to anyone. Besides, there is a free demo if you want to spend an hour or so to see if it is your bag. ",

It is reminisant if the SSI gold box series, similar to Buldar's Gate but not as emursive or has as much freedom in the games story. This game is not perfect but over all it has a very good story with some decision based lines and out comes. In order to complete some quests and parts of the story I did have to use a general game over view guide and codes easly found on the internet. I don't think it is posable to complete the game with out a basic guide or using some codes (even on normal) as the quest system is very simplistic and some of the fights are far too hard(not unlike some of the calssic games). Qusets do not up date on every step so it is sometimes hard to know exactly where to go and what to do. There was an excessive amount of dialog to read in the game. It was great that i could control up to three cahricters at a time even though only one was rolled by me. Over all a good game. If you like turn based RPG's and classic RPG's you should check this game out!",

            "review_text": "I played some of spiderweb software's earlier games when I was a kid, so I have some heavy nostalgia as I go into any of their products. ...unfortunately, Avadon doesn't quite follow through. Although it really really could, if it had been polished more.  The combat system is technically balanced and reasonable, but comes across as slow and plodding. You have to sit through the entirety of every attack animation followed by a brief pause, for every action any character takes, before it will load the interface for the next character's turn -- which isn't so bad, the first hundred times you see the basic attack animation. Combat also activates too soon, a lot of the time-- it can take several turns of walking before anyone is in range; and that walking may take you far out of your intended travel path...and into line of sight of more enemies, that can repeat the process. It can also be difficult to tell at a glance whose turn it is, until you figure out what to look for, and sometimes the hitboxes of tightly grouped combatants overlap a bit (making it hard to select the right one). Previous games also had a significantly more varied spell list -- the list has been easily halved, although the list of abilities for mundane combat characters has grown noticeably. In short, there is nothing cripplingly wrong with the combat in this game, and it CAN be interesting and fun (particularly against named unique enemies) -- but it could have been so much better, so easily.  The game's story centers around being a new member of the secret police for a dubiously moral authoritarian medieval city-state, which keeps the peace for an alliance of five nations. Which is excellent and unique. All the characters are interesting, dialogue is interesting, and I will play this thing through to the end to see how it goes (..and then again with a ninja or sorceress; so I will have enough lockpicks to get through all the locked doors this time). Unfortunately, that good dialogue and the interestingly-designed quests that go with it happen to be implemented as poorly as the combat system. In one case, the only way to destroy a piece of evidence is to go talk to the local captain of the guards about it (and not the spymaster for your kingdom; only the local guardsman will do), and after bringing it up, choose 'Never mind. [destroy evidence]'. How are you supposed to find that option, unless you've already decided to turn the evidence in instead?  The quests in this game are far, far too easy to break; and I find myself enjoying the story not because of their craftsmanship in game design...but in spite of it. Even with that caveat, I can't deny that I AM largely enjoying it, and particularly the fact that even though they force too many situations to boil down to simple binary choices, it's often not 'right' vs. 'wrong'. It might be tradition vs. cultural innovation, freedom vs. security (vs. duty), or even just choosing whether or not to accept someone's offer to surrender/ flee. ..I'm finding that a lot of my choices get overruled though, with circumstance forcing everyone into how the narrative WOULD have gone if I'd chosen the other way. I'm not sure if this is a magician's choice scenario, or just bad luck on my part. In any case...  If you want to play the secret police of a medieval magical mind-break-the-prisoners authoritarian citystate, with free reign to just do whatever you want to anyone you want, a reasonably complex and realistic political climate, and turn-based combat that is fine but slowish, give Avadon a try. ...but expect to experience the story as they laid it out (with occasional breaks for mass-effect style Paragon/Renegage options), rather than actually control your path.",
