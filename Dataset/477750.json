            "review_text": "An excellent, niche wargame that takes a look at a neglected period of history; the maelstrom of religious and political strife that was the Thirty Years' War, a destructive, dark period in European history. This is AGEOD at its best, with all the usual fare: army and unit creation to your own liking, decision cards for religious and political change mingle with more military minded decisions, such as siege and mercenary recruitment cards. If you've enjoyed any of their previous games, you'll love this. So far the game has been very stable and the turn time resolution is very fast. If you are interested in the period, this will give you many happy days of wargaming.",

            "review_text": "The game crashes at very turn for me. Also, I am sick an tired of the developers(AGEOD) exploting their fan base and then releasing half-finished games like this one. The fact that you get '(...)' as unit description even after around ten titles released by the developer, becomes just outrageous. Did they really not have the time to put in some flavour and unit descriptions?? No time to type half a para for a unit (of which there are probably twenty five per scenario)?  This game needs a better commitment from the developers. They just cannot pose as 'niche game developers' and use that as an excuse not to do elimentary stuff while the niche wargammers flock to them out of compulsion as there is no other game which models supply and other realstic factors in such detail yet.",
