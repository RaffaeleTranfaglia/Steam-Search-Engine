    "recommended_requirements": "OS: 7 Processor: I say a Core 2 is needed, but this thing will probably run on the Apollo 11's flight computer. Memory: 1 GB RAM Graphics: If your graphics card is limiting this game's performance, I'm surprised it's displaying this message. Storage: 100 MB available space Sound Card: Be honest, this is probably the first time you've ever actually read a developer's sound card recommendation. Kudos to you my friend! If you have a system that plays sound my recommendation is you crank that puppy to the max and blast The Darkness's 2003 power ballad &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;. You can thank me by purchasing the family friendly, fun for all ages, modern, computerized, local multiplayer, video game for computers Trenchfoot (by Cocompadres). ABLR my friends: Always Be Log Rolling. Thanks!",
