While the Time Trial levels mostly work, the are very shallow - fun wise. The collection levels on the other hand aren't fun at all. You're supposed to use momentum to get all the collectibles, but more often than not you just bump into things or miss gems and get frustrated.  I don't understand why they didn't make a game similar to Ecco the Dolphin or Aquaria? An action-adventure would have complimented the style so much better, than this hectic shadow of a game. Style over substance, sadly.",
