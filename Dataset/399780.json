            "review_text": "Similar to those flash games where you can't hit the walls with your mouse cursor, but with lots of clever twists and puzzles that make this game engaging and challenging.   Pros - The controls are a great example of doing exactly what you expect and feeling tight, I was pleasantly surprised that despite being in a circle which is an odd place to move about, I never felt like the block moved unexpectedly.   - The music lends to the game feeling at times very chill, and also exciting when you are close to finishing a level and desperately trying not to die.   - Cool death system, in some puzzles when you die, rather than simply respawning to the same spot, you will respawn in the same spot but at a different point in the circle, which gives a fresh perspective on the puzzle.  - The 'expand' effect is hard to describe in writing, but moving outward toward the circles edge or inward sometimes gives this stretching effect, which is very cool and lends itself to some very clever puzzles.  - Similar to the last point, the puzzles in the game consistently had me thinking that they are very unique and clever.  Cons  - 'Trial and Error' Like most puzzle games there were a few parts that were frustrating because it felt that in order to solve them you needed to have died multiple times, in order to memorize the layout of the puzzle and just grind through it.   - The checkpoint system felt inconsistent, sometimes being very close together and sometimes having to go back an entire room which felt tedious.   - Menus, I get the game has an aesthetic and all, put using the cube to change graphics options and resolutions took way too long with all the animations, and since I had just started the game it wasn't very intuitive how to even get to the options menu in the first place.   Overall I recommend it for the unique take on a 'dont touch the walls' game.",

The music is good, if a little pretentious (piano and bass strings), and comes off as a forgettable indie soundtrack. It's cool that there are game elements timed to stings in the music, but it makes the listless tracks even more forgettable. Perhaps it becomes engaging an hour in, but honestly, the only thing redeemable about the game is it's art style.",

            "review_text": "Expand is about pure and simple gameplay.  In Expand, you are a pink cube which is navigating through a circular environment. The game is entirely centered around this mechanic; the world is circular and you are constantly going in circles, going in and out towards and away from a ring in the center. It is akin to top-down gameplay, navigating through rooms, but is very stylized, and the rooms are all circular. The rooms change around you, and you are frequently being pushed or pulled through the environment, dodging things as they go, or else trying to navigate your way through a maze ahead of a wall of death, or narrowly avoiding death from things moving in and out of the walls.  Very little of the game involves much in the way of thought; it is much more about reflexes and execution, though there are a few simple puzzles here and there.  It is a very simple game, but it is somehow satisfying; the simplicity allows for some very pure gameplay, and the visuals (and audio) all work together to make for a solid experience.  That being said, this game is very short; I beat the whole thing in 94 minutes. There are no achievements, no secrets, no nothing – just you and making your way through the levels. There are four major areas, plus a fifth one at the end after you beat those four.  I can’t say I didn’t have fun. But at the same time, this is not a particularly deep experience; it is just pure gameplay. And – I’ll say it again – it is quite short.  All in all, I wouldn’t recommend paying much for this game, but if you can get it for cheap, it can be a brief but positive experience. ",

Soundtrack is pretty great but it doesn't do much but add emotion in a game that doesn't benefit much from it. Theres not really any story. I guess it makes some of the more difficult moments more tense than others. That's about it. I got this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 17 so judge for yourself if the price is worth it.",
