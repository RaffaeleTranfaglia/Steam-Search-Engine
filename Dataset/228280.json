It will crush the game and you won't load it anymore. What to do if you already bought the game and caused the crash: write to the support and wait... Wait... Wait...",

            "review_text": "October 2016 I have worked with Beamdog on several occasions on trying to get this game to work properly and have gotten frustrated and will not be trying anymore on getting it to work. I give up on my beloved game!!! Nothing they had me try worked properly unless I created characters excatly the way they wanted them created. If I created one the way I wanted it I still could not use weopons for a fighter etc. This is very dissappointing. I still have many crashes and still am not able to get out our candle keep.  I will be seaking other games to play.  May 23 2016 Gave beamdog files to look at and find out what is going wrong with the game still no word on why my game will not work. I was informed they are looking into it. Although they could not recreate the issues I was having so I had to send them my files.  New Edit May 18 2016: just downloaded the update, still broken, still not fixed, do not waste your money on this game, nothing is fixed..... As far as people telling me how to fix my game that do not have info showing they are developer by their Icon Badge or do not have any level of play time for BG EE, I am not sure If I should trust someone like this telling me how to change setting on my computer etc. If others choose to do this that is your choice.   New Edit May 2016: BG EE Still Broke!!!! So Disappointed After Illydth comments I did a unistall of steam and reinstall of steam and a complete reinstall of game and verified the game files and still cannot play the game it still crashes. None of the bugs below are fixed and Fighters still cannot use weopons. What good is a fighter if they cannot use any weopons but a quarterstaff or a club! Also I cannot even make it out of Candle Keep when starting a new game. I have posted screenshots on this in the community hub for all that think this is a bluff.   New Edit: I have still not seen any fixes for the problems I am experiencing with Playing my game BG EE since the update. I am so sad. Fighters cannot use any weopons this makes it hard to fight if you cannot have any weopons..........  I really Love This Game BG EE, and would play it for hours on a PC. I am in a delema I want to play and cannot enjoy it anymore. Since the update that was installed on April 1, 2016, which I could not stop. Here are just a few of the problems I have noticed.  - Game Crashes more times than I can throw a stick at it. - Characters are cartoonish  - Beta version Fighters cannot use any weopons  - I Get achievements for things I have not even done in Lands I have not even been to. And my old Achievements are all gone being replaced by things I have not done. - Map scroll is all messed up - Multiplayer games on steam cloud network are unable to access for all the hours worked on. - Multiplayer join does not work - Many more issues, too many to remember - It appears that the updates were more for people using handheld devices than real pc gamers like myself according to Beamdog's website. Quote from their site on update: “Enjoy text and dialogue selection features optimized for smaller screens, as well as numerous other improvements.”  I really wish there was an option to roll back my game to the original without this update until they get the bugs worked out so I would have lost all my hard work and over 300 hours of game play. I understand there is a need to fix the bugs and update at times, but this one caused me more problems than I can count. I want my Loved Game Back. Please hurry with the fixes so I can get back to playing my game.",

With the latest patch my friends can no longer connect to my server despite multiple troubleshooting attempts. This game has always had multiplayer issues and it is not getting any better.

(tm)  If you want to playt this game to relive Baldur's Gate - Stay Away If you want to play this game to relive Baldur's Gate and do it with your online friends - Stay far away.   Amber Scott - Writer for Beamdog: “If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say like, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.”",

Baldur's Gate is an old favourite for its great story, engaging mechanics and fun gameplay. The enhanced edition isn't really that different from the original for someone that only played it out of the box, like me. If anything, it's improved, since it now runs smoothly (I remember making coffee while I waited for the city of Bauldur's Gate to load).  Don't buy into the haters' speech.  If you're new to the game, get it. It's awesome and has so much variety to its locations and monsters, that it feels better than a lot of more recent games (just remember, it's based on AD&amp;D, so the rules are sometimes strange for people raised playing 4th or 5th edition DnD).  If, like me, you played it a long time ago and would like to replay it for nostalgia's sake (and also because it's awesome), go right ahead and remember you can mod the hell out of this game if you feel something's missing.",

            "review_text": "At first, I was happy I could finish this game, after some 13 years of stopping at Nashkel Mines and never going through with it. The graphical update is well-made, and I appreciate Linux-compatibility, even though AI path-finding is still a mess. With all that said, I did not miss much since 1998, I'm afraid.   Mechanically, this game didn't age well. Might not have been that good at the time either, but such was the zeitgeist. Design had come a long way since then, and has improved upon much of the formulae of these rpgs.   The breaking steel weapons, while integral to the main story, are quite irritating early on, as they represent no challenge besides managing the inventory of several party members. All of whom are limited in carry-capacity by their strength. While it does make sense that your wizard would not be able to carry four sets of metal armour on their back, neither does it for Minsc, nor my Dwarven defender main character. Money is all around the place, and after some time, you only look potions and arrows. Magic items available in shops are not all that good, and I have only spent money on purchasing the party's first +1 weapons, which are magical and do not break. I was sitting on over 50 thousand gold by the end, not even bothering with selling things after some time.  Outside of these early purchases, the way of progression is generally looting and pillaging, which made me feel like we were a party of murder-hobos masquerading as heroes (renown maxed with good deeds and not killing town guards). The game world feels static, many models are standing around the town of Baldur's Gate, yet people are pushing their own unconnected agendas with you playing the henchmen or merry matchmaker. Boring. I did go into length to do as many side-quests as possible, but it made little difference. The world did not come more alive for all my troubles.   The story was bland if anything, and conversational choices mostly boiled down to 1, being nice, 2, wanting money for being nice and 3, acting rude, stabbing people and generally not being very nice. There was no opportunity in changing the flow of conversations or saving face once you lost it, which is not fun. Many of the characters feel out of place, thrown into the setting as “that dude in front of a house who gives you a quest that takes you to the next location”. Companion characters not connected strictly to the main story come at you seemingly random, many in the middle of the wilderness or a road, and you most probably already have a full party of capable individuals and cannot be bothered to dismiss someone just to check out what this new random bloke could bring to the party. I simply went with an early-game group of lawful neutral and good individuals, as boring that might sound. I did get Khalid killed early on though, as he was not bringing anything to the party, however, Jaheira, our druid would have left if the fighter got dismissed.   Game-play wise, AD&amp;D is really bad, and I wish they had gone with a better system. Then again, such was the time. In this game it is perfectly justifiable to make a bard character who then sits out all fights, singing and thus bringing +2 attack value to the rest of the party, because bonuses could mean that much. Then again, I made a steel wall made out of dwarf, a true craftsmanship of his kind I must say, who walked up to people and hit them for damage beyond the baseline health of most spell-casters. Exploding corpses were a triviality during our adventures. That said, fights are challenging and can be frustrating at times due to the nature of saving throws in the d20 system.   Memorizing spells was a bother, and I never liked it in D&amp;D and its variants. It's not good design, and I am glad video game creators put these kind of player-limiting stupidity behind us.   As for the content added by Beamdog, the creators of this Enhanced Edition, well, I wish they didn't force so much their impossibly irritating, edgy female character, Neera. The encounter triggers a fight whether you like it or not, and ends in an offer to recruit the mage, whether you like it or not. Well, I just slit her throat. Good riddance! Her voice-acting was worse than that of Imoen's, and that is compliment I never thought I would give that character. All in all, Beamdog failed to improve on the mediocre writing already present in the game.  As a closing thought, I think I would have enjoyed Baldur's Gate more if the system was based on GURPS.",

MY other party members were too busy calling me queer, 'why aren't you a queer fellow' -Imoen  or telling me I was going to fail, 'Our quest is vain' -Xan  for me to care for them.  Minsc, however, took the feet out from under my feet and always knew what to say to keep me going in the right direction, 'butt-kicking for goodness!' -Minsc  Minsc only wanted one thing in return for his presence. To free his friend from the vile scourge of a gnoll encampment.   I was more than willing to assist Minsc to achieve his goal, but I was currently on my way to vanquish the foes that were tormenting the Nanshekel mines, but I assured Minsc I would help after.  As soon as I breathed my first breath of air from the godforsaken mines of Nanshekel I gave Minsc one of those sexy side winks, but all he could reply with was, 'Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, watch it! I'm huge!'  I could tell Minsc was growing impatient, so I pushed on towards to the gnoll encampment without any delay. We were unfortunately walaid by many the highwayman and foe. I thought Minsc was enjoying the adventure with his enthusiastc war yaps, 'The squeeky wheel gets the kick', I was wrong, however, so very wrong.  I was precisely one load zone away from the gnoll encampment (one ****ing loadzone!), filled with glee to help my friend Minsc, but when we got there I then understood true disapointment.   We loaded in and I looked to Minsc hoping to see gaiety and pride. Instead I saw hate and utter disapointment, 'hey Minsc, heh, so we got to the gnolls like you wanted, heh, ready to save your friend?'  Unfortunately there was no love left to be felt by Minsc' eyes. His eyes were black and full of rage like a shark that smells blood.  'Heh, hey Minsc, heh, ready to go save your friend?'  In one fell swoop Minsc drew his +1 two-handed sword and dropped the negative-nancy wizard, Xan, like a dirty sack of potatoes.  'Minsc! What are you doing?!'  'You say you help save friend, but You not help at all!!!' Then Minsc began hacking the not so politically correct and naive rogue, Imoen, but I didn't care. All I cared was that I get through to my one true side character Minsc, so I did the only thing I could do. I Ran.  I began running frantically through the gnoll stronghold, praying that Minsc would recognize we were where he wanted to be all along and stop slashing at my dwarf cleric main character, 'Owen', instead I now had an army of  gnolls chasing me and my beloved Minsc who couldn't care two shakes about the gnoll army that he was now seemingly a part of from my perspective.  I continued running, pleading through my laptop screen until I hit a dead end and there was no where left for me to run. My escape was blocked by an angry horde of gnolls, and an even angrier Minsc.  I tried besting the gnolls in hopes it would in someway calm Minsc down, but when he came within striking distance of me all I could feel was the sharp cold iron impale me just under my ribcage and I collapsed like house of cards in a pool  of not only my own blood, by also that of gnoll, looking up at my beloved Minsc, 'I forgive you' I whispered.  '*Squeak* Boo says that he was just doing his job,' -Minsc.  10/10 would fall in love with Minsc, only to be killed by him again.",

            "review_text": "Hard not to recommend BG and the like... classics. So a Thumbs up. Did the EE team do a great job? Short answer - No.   They didn't improve on much... the graphics are not brand new or amazing, just ok. I think character animations are the same, if not then they are just there, nothing impressive. They added back some things that were removed in original patches like the hidden ring at the Friendly Arm Inn, which was a huge boon for mages. The new characters and voice acting are ok, I have not used them all... but the overall impression is it was a quick and dirty job. The new companions are available but its hard to find a party compilation that works with them all due to original party members having allegiances that means you take two of them or none. Not the EE teams fault but they didn't really think it through it seems. Forces you to miss the new or have a wacky group.  Some EE team’s criticism.  Pathing is still not great, in tight corridors if you tell your 6 man team to move and the guy at the back hits a wall of bodies, he/she will decide they have to go another way and start off in a different direction. Not often, but if you are going to “enhance” a game old pathing issues should be fixed.  VERY Minor spoilers below but helps show what I mean about the new EE stuff just not being thought out. The new wild mage companion takes you to a new area. A goblin will escort you to a cave. By following the goblin and listening to his voice acting, which was kind of cute/fun you miss a side quest for the cave, and I think you’d miss the goblins voice acting if you didn’t skip the side quest and follow him. So after the cave you explore the area, find a side quest and now you must go back. You need to find a thing in the cave, but that thing has garbage loot on top of it (non-magical junk - shortswordx2, leather armor and a helm) so if like me, your inventory is full and weight limit is near capacity; are you going to pick that loot up? Probably not. Unfortunately in order to interact with the item you need, you have to move/loot the garbage. So, I googled it and realized the item had to be there so I looted the garbage and ah ok. The item you need, lets say it is a belt. Was it in the pile of garbage, no... you can only see/'interact' with the belt after looting the other items it should have been included with. Like C'mon. What a run around for very little gain.   You meet a guy that buys wolf pelts. None of the random spawns drop them.   I could go on... New material is great… Full price for half thought out &amp; poorly implemented new material… meh  Tldr; Bottom line is if you have never played BG – do it, right now. Amazing RPG, better if you understand D&amp;D rules, and even this older top down style grows on you quickly. But imho the EE team did very little to earn your money, get it on sale.",

This game handles like a C-RPG would; you can play the game in real-time(not recommended) or you can pause after each turn, each character takes their turn at the same time, mind you. This game's story is excellent and the writing is top-notch; no complaints. The graphics are nice and are easy on the eyes, nothing that requires a gtx Titian or anything; you could run the game on a toaster. When you start up the game, the game tells you to play the tutorial(I think?). The game itself has a steep learning curve, however if you stick to it and get at least a small grasp of the game; much fun is to be had. I can't really say anything bad about the game. Did I mention the storytelling and dialogue; it's fantastic, the stuff of legends. No compliants at all 95/100.",

The Baldur's Gate series was and still is the crowning RPG series, the one to rule them all and in the darkness of Bhaal bind them. So of course the question is how does this enhanced edition work out?  Perfectly. The new companions are interesting with their own back stories that really expand the rather modest repertoire of companion stories This is of course compared to today's standards with games like Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that the original Baldur's Gate was released in 1998 and it still makes me onanate and ♥♥♥♥ me britches from the awesomeness of it. They are prevalently assigned classes that were not in the original, but were in Baldur's Gate 2. The old one. This edition also provides some new locations to explore and have fun with (though they are mostly tied to the new companions).   Some might be dissapointed because the original was, with all the mods, a far superior game, in many ways exceeding this newer version. But, and I say this with tears of joy dripping down my red colored baby chins, the modding community and the community as a whole are strong with this one and the mods are already coming out in numbers. My favourite is the NPC Banter mod, which gives just so much to the game that it's a must. Companions get these thinking and emotional dimensions that just must be experienced. It's still in development, but it already does wonders.  I'd write more, but I must go feast on the flesh of kobolds now and help an infernal looking kid find his dog. Good day, adventurers!",

The people who give this glowing reviews did not finish the game. And, as you can see, I invested many hours into it. There are areas where if you talk to an NPC before doing something else, the game just about blows up--from talking to an NPC! Your party is stuck, unable to leave the zone. I mean, it's just one thing like that after another with this broken mess. Sure, it is nostalgic, it's FUN, but only if you dabble for a few minutes and then quit, as I suspect 99% of the reviewers out there have done. Play it to win it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I played through most of the game's content but am not able to finish it to see how it ends.  [addendum] Beamdog fixed a lot of bugs during 2014, and I quit playing at one point toward the end without actually finishing. As someone here and on forums has suggested, the game did have corrupted savegame file problems that made a HUGE mess out of the game if you happen to be unlucky enough to have run into it, where the only solution is to reload from an earlier save. My best guess is, I ran into one of those problems, continued playing, and the game was messed up forever after that. Very possible starting a new game with the final patch would clear it all up.  That doesn't change the fact that the game was unplayable for me. And just because *you* played it through 100% without any issues, doesn't mean it didn't have problems last year.",

I'll get to the additional content later.  I had a really fun time playing this game, I had grown up on it when I was a kid, but I had never finished it. So, before this edition was released, I picked up GoG version and played it through to the end with a mixed party, it was a sweet ride, sweet enough that I wanted to go again. So I picked up this version when it game out (I think on the same day or maybe a few after I finished it the first time) and played it again. I finished it up and did just about everything that I could do in the game, trying to find all the hidden tomes, quests, locations, areas, etc. I had a blast. Then I did again! lol. I played it again through for the 3rd time, this time doing a solo speedrun of the game with a ftr/thf/mage (awsome combo), and had an absolute blast doing it again. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this game.  But anyways, on to the review.  The game is fun, challenging, and has a neat storyline. The graphics... it's a love hate situation; The digitally rendered backgrounds are all really amazing. They are beautiful and stunning to look at, especially after you have completely explored a place. The characters on the otherhand, they are so poorly rendered and animated that you can't even tell that they are actually 3D models and not crapily painted pieces. There are loads of places to go in the game, and a hell of a lot of quests in the game to complete (which is really nice that Beamdog added automatic journal noting so you can actually tell what's a quest and what's not). There are a lot of different monsters to face which eventually require a lot of tactical thinking and spell placement. The classes in the game (AD&amp;D 2nd edition) are unique and are fun to play, especially with the new class kits introduced by Beamdog. The game is fairly straightforward though with it's primary quest chain. Sometimes there's multiple ways to complete a quest (either from alignment, or just dialogue options or approaches), but the game ends the same way no matter what you do.  Now for the content that Beamdog has added. There's not much meat here to be honest. The three additional voice acted characters and their quests are cool, but that's about it.  I'd reccommend this game to any rpg fan. I wouldn't reccommend this to everyone though, being that the AD&amp;D ruleset is rather archaic hard to understand and comprehend for newbies.   9/10 Would speedrun again.",

In 2013, it feels eclipsed by more polished, faster paced, and better graphics games. The unforgiving difficulty forces you to replay a lot for seemingly random reasons. Also, it's size makes exploring a bit of a chore at times, and the number of quests with no real clue as to where to find them makes questing almost tedious. I actually completely forget I have quests sometimes and sometimes spend so much time on side quests I forget what was happening in the main story. Overhaul Games has done a great job of porting and upgrading the game. All the changes are subtle but valuable.

This is where it all began. The very name is famous to gamers and non-gamers alike. It is known by people that never even played the game. And for those of us among its fan-base, it will forever be the beginning of a franchise that holds our hearts and imaginations. It is the apex of role-playing games. Its game mechanics are firmly set within the D&amp;D rule book. The monsters, the races, the deities, and the world itself are all created from D&amp;D. But I digress, on to the game itself!   Baldur's Gate is NOT an easy game to play and it won't be for everyone. And depending on which class you choose, the game can be even more difficult and slow to start. You'll start out weak. A mere bear can kill you in 1 or 2 hits. You will be challenged at every turn. You will be frustrated and spit curses at your screen, possibly even throw your mouse at it in rage. There are dangers of invisible enemies, powerful monsters immune to magics or physical damage, traps, and curses that can and WILL kill you in the blink of an eye. You'll find yourself questioning every action you make. You'll press the 'quick save' button so many times you'll worry that it might break from wear. Almost every game session will cause you to question why you started playing this damn game in the first place. But just when you're about to give up and delete the game files from your computer forever, something magical happens.   You become powerful. Your fellow party members become assets instead of burdens. Instead of finding ways to avoid danger, you start sprinting towards dungeons with gleams of glory in your eyes. Your fame begins to spread across the land like wildfire. NPCs that once mocked you now quake with fear in your presence. Bandits that once harassed you become little more than cannon fodder. And that's when you realize you've become a GOD among mortal men! You smile with each foe dispatched, wondering why they ever caused you such frustration in the first place. You will start missing the game as soon as you hit the 'quit' button and long to begin your adventure again while you're away. That, my friends, is the glory that awaits you should you choose to brave the journey through Baldur's Gate.",

If, however, you never had the chanc to play Baldur's Gate before, let me tell you, you're in for a treat. Before BioWare made Dragon Age, Jade Empire, Knights of the Old Republic, and Mass Effect, they created a true work of art in Baldur's Gate. It uses 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons as the ruleset, and is to my mind, the closest thing that you can find to a true D&amp;D experience in video game form to date. This isn't a hack and slash, folks; it takes planning, party management, and depending on the characters, an inventive use of your available spells. But if you're smart enough to be up to the challenge, Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are enthralling experiences worthy of your time.",

It took many years and quite a few people to get me hooked on the dnd system so that I could eventually get to the point of being able to appreciate games such as this. Even in 2015, Baldur's Gate plays surprisingly well. I've never tried the original version to compare it to, but the enhanced edition has no issues whatsoever, and doesn't feel too dated in any way other than the 2nd edition dnd system in place.  Arguably the best part about the game is the new character additions. Neera, the Wild Mage, in particular makes the game a lot more enjoyable to play, especially for those who are hooked on the excellent Dragon Age but want to revisit the past. If she weren't written so well she might have seemed like a superfluous add-on, yet she is a delightful character and until I was made aware that she was a new addition to the enhanced version I simply thought she was one of the original cast and was just more developed than the others. Therein lies the enhanced edition's one potential problem. Neera does have a lot more dialogue with the main character than the others seem to, thus she stands out in comparison and makes the original characters seem wooden.  If you've been toying with the idea of playing Baldur's Gate for years, as I have, then now is the time to play it, and the enhanced edition is absolutely the way to go.",

This review will contain minor spoilers.  Graphics definitely shows its age and can be distracting for a newcomer who have not experienced such graphics before. Personally for me, i find it dated, but with a certain nostalgic charm. Environment art are pretty detailed however and are lovingly rendered in pixel art. Character sprites however look very generic and small.   The music consists of nice sweeping orchestral pieces. Sound effects sound good with the clashes of swords and the swoosh of a magic spell. I did encounter issues where the volume would suddenly crank up for no reason at all during certain events (Eg: when a trap got activated).  The main 25 hours story unfortunately felt rather generic although it has a unique way of presentation with a narrator reciting the script as if like a Dungeon Master in the pen and paper version. As such, I felt that the general feel of the game doesn't feel at all like a video game, but feels more like the pen and paper experience translated into digital form. This may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes.  I liked how organic and natural sidequests were presented. You could have a random NPC walk up to you for a chit chat which may lead to something more sinister or just wander around and help out along the way. I recommend not to slavishly do each and every quest, but rather play thru the game normally and just let your party randomly encounter these side quests. Also, because this game is old-school, do not expect it to hold your hand and show you your exact quest objective. You are expected to read the ingame journal which will give vague hints and you actually have to do some exploring.  The game has quite a high combat difficulty curve at least at the beginning when your initial party is low leveled. It will not hesitate to throw a tough boss or impossible random encounters (a crew of lvl1 characters against 8 higher leveled bandits. Really?!?) relatively early and wipe your party. Remember to always save your game before and after every conversation, and before and after every battle. Proper position and tactics are essential and vital to early combat.  If you persevere however, this difficulty curve will drop very significantly when your party members are around Level 4. At this point, you will find almost all non-boss battles to be a breeze where all you had to do is to select everyone in your party and just zerg rush mobs. Enemies do not scale to your level. I find this sudden drop in difficulty to be very strange and felt very odd considering how hard it was to survive during the early levels.  As for boss battles, its very easy to exploit the game by getting your magic users cast area effect spells before they even see an enemy to soften them up. This is particularly true for the last boss where I just lured his allies out one by one, zerged them, went out to rest and heal and repeat until he is the only one left standing. Needless to say he died in about 25 seconds to my zerg rush.  Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10 Criticizing this game almost feels like a crime considering that alot of people enjoyed it alot. I enjoyed this game for sure, but I felt it might have been a little too hyped up. My view is that it is a good game, but it could definitely be alot more polished. My main concern was that the story narrative was too overt instead of being subtle. You are literally being told a story instead of experiencing one (if that makes any sense)  For anyone like me who have played the original pen and paper version and also experienced older RPGs before, do give it a try if you haven't already as you might enjoy it.   For younger players who have never experienced older RPGs and never touched the pen and paper version before, i'd recommend watching some gameplay video previews before committing to it as this game does show its age now.",

In ‘98 you had a 15 inch CRT, so you’re not going to notice or care probably. Nowadays when you’ve got an HD screen, you’re like, ‘Oh, those are coffee beans.’ We had to render out new streets and then lay them into the original 2D art and then paint over it. It was this whole process.”   i didn't get the DLC SOD, so i dont have to see the unacceptable things they change to char personality's besides the fact, that it dose not even play like BG or BG2 its pretty much linear it has chapters of open world but once the chapters done you can no longer go to the previous areas.  but as for the gay or trans char its not really that forced and in the D&amp;Dfirst edition there's a gods who come to people as what ever gender they want so a trans in the game is no biggie or a gay but the personality's of set characters not the new ones being changed is unacceptable in my opinion also the fact that allot of your choices in the game mean nothing unlike the original BG1&amp;2 i really dont care that i can now see and play with 100+ char in a screen at once means nothing to me",

Only downside is I wish I had bought in bundle. Without Baldur's Gate 2 I can't experience the high level stuff.",

[though you may want to downgrade to 1.3 which is still available as:]  Can't comment on AI improvements as I've always used the SCS mod for that which still worked on 1.3 which you can still downgrade too if you want to use old mods.  Some love for the missing new BG2 weapon skills such as club.  I might have bought BG1 3 times over the years, but I don't mind paying make the process a lot more seamless than messing with the 3rd party mods.

I have been playing it since the early 2000's before the Enhanced Edition and thoroughly enjoy the series.  The original game was riddled with bugs, compatibility issues and multiple other large problems for modern gaming and a remake of the game was very promising. The Enhanced Edition added multiple new quests, classes and boosted the level cap whilst also acting as a major bug fix. This was very well recieved but it still wasn't perfect, just very good. The remake kept closely to the original with some neccesary changes and fixes. The repairment and ease of the multiplayer mode was the cherry on top, allowing for groups of friends to adventure together in a wonderful story and detailed world. The added areas, game mode and voice actors were unsettling at first, but easy to warm up to and even enjoy the variety before you.  The remake of the sequel had near enough the same changes allowing it to be a must-buy for owners of the first game.  However, Siege of Dragonspear.... This DLC came with a list of bug fixes, UI changes and all other changes that completely ruined my experience of the game. They somehow managed to make the game look uglier than a half-orc and act as smart as a goblin. The AI now is only useful in non-stressful multi-opponent fights, of which there are few in the DLC, and they destroyed the multiplayer mode to be non-functioning for a lot of people. This coupled with the completely game braking bugs that you can find within the first ten minutes of gameplay have essentially taking the Baldur's Gate that we know and love and turned it into a small pile of trash. Not to say it isn't a good game, the DLC's storyline is good and takes a large chunk of time, achievement hunting is both humorous and fun and a couple of the new NPC's are funny and useful. But it is far from the game we all fell in love with. tl;dr It is a great game but riddled with bugs, inconsistencies in most aspects and the DLC is only worth it for the achievments and die-hard story fans.",

I've consistently played these games, and the other infinity engine games, since I was a doe eyed boy of 12, jacking it over the sheer scale of everything.   PRO's: Great story that gets better the further you get in New NPC's that don't suck completely New class that makes druid spells almost useful New items that provide much entertainment (careful with those specs) I love the new UI Switch between dual wield and bow? At laaaaaast! Fills the gap in the story in a scale I wasn't expecting at all really, but was pleased with. More monsters! Better NPC banter   CON's The trans character was a bit clumsy. Fair play for the inclusion, but could have been better. Buggy as hell. Not unplayable, but annoying at times. There's no real distinction between the evil and good paths (that I found yet) Shaman is okay, but Druids and Clerics need a few more spell pages. Also, let's be fair, druid spells suck balls and the game needs to borrow a few from Icewind Dale 2,in which druid is the most fun class, to my mind (Thorn Spray? Rolling Wave? Static Field? Come on guys!) I saved a copy of every scroll in BG1 to dual class my fighter to mage in SoD and none of my scroll cases, gem bags, or potion cases came with me. Most frustrating. Quite a few spoken/script inconsistencies. Characters saying one thing when another is written down. Sometimes it's a little unclear on what you're supposed to do.  That's about it. Shaman is okay, but druid spells still suck nads and there's no stronghold in SoA. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed it and the ending actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off (in a good way). The series just got huuuuuuge and I'll be praying to Helm (giggidy) that there's a third. Something to do with the CHARNAM and Aerie's baby perhaps?
