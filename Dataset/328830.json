            "review_text": "A solid rugby manager sim. The core simulation is very good, the little extras need a lot of work for future titles.  Pros: - Large Database (Major Euro Leagues all licensed) - Solid AI &amp; ME (players seem to take the right options) - Variety of tactical options available  - In depth simulation (B-side, youth team (regens), training, facilities, coaches - similar to FM) - Helpful devs &amp; community (although still very small, positive start)  Cons: - UI is terrible (sorting through players in squad/transfer market can be a nightmare) - VERY limited resolutions available  - Rigid player valuation model  - No player personalities (or maybe Rugby players just get on with it?)

The game is fun and I feel like I can play it for ages.  Negatives: I can't seem to win a game, my team always fades away in the second half, even with a 5* fitness coach. The tactics are quite complicated to understand at first.  All in all though, this is a fantastic game imo, apart from those few negatives. I would probably give it around a 7.5/10",
