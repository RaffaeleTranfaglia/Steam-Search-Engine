There are lots of hidden object games in this one and I felt like the game took much longer than it needed to last. It overstayed its fun time. Other than that it was a good game, well made, and definitely entertaining. Easy achievements for those who enjoy chasing those.",

There's no way to change the resolution or switch to widescreen mode in the game options; you have to actually change your monitor resolution. I didn't feel like bothering with that, so I got a refund.",
