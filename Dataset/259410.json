It feels like an iPad game ported to Windows as cheaply as possible with no respect for PC gamers except as a revenue source. The actual gameplay isn't bad if you overlook the need to use a mouse to control it though.",

While eveyrone else was running the track in mario carte she would be the one going the wrong way stuck against a tree stump. This game was was able to play. Abolutley loved it. It's short, sweet, and fun. What's not to like.",

            "review_text": "Sneaky Sneaky is a top-down stealth game where you play as a thief attempting to make it through a series of rooms without detection/dispatching your enemies and picking up treasure along the way. Enemies move in a series of periodic steps, and shifts into turn-based movement if you are detected. In addition to avoiding detection, your character gets a number of items and weapons which they can use to take care of enemies. This actually gets the game to land squarely in that narrow range in between 'instant lose if detected' and 'too powerful so detection is meaningless' which is exceptionally rare in stealth games, and is the place where the best ones tend to reside.  It's rather short - I was able to 100% it in about 4 hours. However, the art style and level design lends itself to a sort of polished charm which is often lacking from games of this length.  It's a good bit of fun, and well worth the asking price of 5 bucks.",

            "review_text": "Almost a competent game, but the stealth elements are basic and the level designs are tedious, and even though the game has a nice visual aesthetic and even has good concepts, the game's controls will very often fight you by being unresponsive, which can lead to a lot of situations where stealth is blown because the game's engine seems to work on ticks, rather than in real time, so there are times where enemies will detect you in squares you aren't actually in, but have just left, or because the pathfinding is bad and you've walked into the path of an enemy, when you want to go in another direction. Most of the time spent in this game is either waiting for enemies to move into or out of position, or quitting and rejoining a map because of one of the previously mentioned problems.  Basically, good ideas, bad design and execution. 4/10",

            "review_text": "This is a funcitonal mobile port, but also a  lazy  port.  First, why are there only two item slots when you can easily fit the whole row? Also, why does the game not tell you that you can move the items around? It is very frustrating to use the barrel before I found out that I can move items in the inventory. To furthur the frustration, the game is  very very unresponsive : there are at least half a second delay between the mouse click and the start of the movement.  There are many inconsistencies amoung the game. For example, why does a healing potion take an action and using the barrel does not?    Conclusion :  The game is functional, but there are many better games like this one.",

Overall a super great game and I'm really picky with which games I like and I mean SUPER picky. If you like puzzle/strategy games with a very mild amount of hand eye coordination then you should love this game. I'd give a 10/10 but the small glitches were a little annoying and the game was very much too short. Amazing game for $5. Rating 9/10",
