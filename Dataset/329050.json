            "review_text": "When I got the original Devil May Cry 4....damn it was fun... The minute i got this...my whole perspective changed...  Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a Hack and slash adventure game with a beautiful story and amazing Soundtrack(although DmC Devil May Cry's soundtrack was in a league of its own :3) The combat in this game is more fluid and precise at 1080p 60fps than it was in the original game although the original had its own perks as well  The Changes they have made from OG DMC4 to DMC4SE are as shown:  -Graphics are more powerful and look better at 1080p 60fps -Includes 5 playable Characters now such as: Nero, Dante, Vergil, Trish and Lady all playable in the special edition of DMC4 while the original game only had 2:Nero and Dante. -More gameplay and story as each individual character has their own part to play in this game -3 costumes for each character, Their Default, Their Special edition outfits(Eg.Prototype Nero,Corrupt Vergil etc.), And Their EX outfits(only attainable after defeating a certain amount of enemies during credits)  The game is quite long with about 20 hours of gameplay for all characters, that is if you play on the default difficulty... There are all together 7 difficulties all with different set ups and enemies to fight Human-Easy difficulty Devil Hunter-Normal difficulty Son Of Sparda-Hard Difficulty Dante Must Die-Very Hard difficulty Legendary Dark Knight-Insane Difficulty Heaven and Hell-U crazy m8? difficulty Hell and Hell  -gg.com/uaregondiem8 ..  So as you can see there is pretty much to this game if you plan to 100% complete it..my advice:Take your time and practice, it's all worth it when you get good eventually :)  I do not want to spoil the story so i won't talk about it in this review  Rating: If you have a powerful computer then it's hands down a solid 9/10..why not 10/10 you ask?..well that's simple, The DLC is overpriced....but..there is a way around it *Cough Cough* If you do not have a powerful computer i suggest you turn the resolution down and change the graphics to low but even so the game is still enjoyable at a solid 8/10.  If you do however want to get the game, here are the system requirements :) Minimum: OS: Windows 7, Windows 8.1. Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo 2.4GHz, AMD Athlon(TM) X2 2.8 GHz. Memory: 2 GB RAM. Graphics: NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 8800 GTS, AMD Radeon(TM) HD 3850 with 512MB RAM or better. DirectX: Version 10. Hard Drive: 27 GB available space. Sound Card: DirectSound Support (DirectX® 9.0c)  So there you go if you are able to play it I sincerely hope you enjoy the experience :)  Final Verdict 9/10 Fantastic game",

            "review_text": "So when i first played DMC 4 in 2008 i finished the game 100% and before DMC4 I played all other DMC games and it became my No.1 game series. But lets talk about DMC4:SE. I love it but just like DMC 4 it is a bit unfinished. And im not talking about characters but rather about story.   I woul love to see DMC 5 (if CAPCOM finaly makes it). But comparing DMC4 and DMC4:SE...well you have 5 playable characters now insted of just 2 (Dante/Nero) you now have the oportunity to play as Vergil, Lady/Trish and of course Dante/Nero. You have 3 campains for each charcter but they are all ONE and THE SAME.   So iy you are looking for story based game with diferent campains for each individual character...well then go play something else like...ergh. But if you want a game that has (probably) the best combat system in Hack And Slash genre then dont hasitate and buy this game.   There are NO quick time events just the player and his pure skill. This aynt God of War or something. Just be redy to complete 20 exact same misions on 7 dificulties with 5 diferent characters in order to unlock everything (artwork, costumes, etc.). Oh and if you want to have Lady/Trish alter. costumes you will hawe to buy a DLC.  But at the end of the day this game is amazing. Its hard to play and imposible to master. So if you are loking to try something new i suggest picking up this game ant trying it out. If you dont like it you can always get a refund.",

It's just a DMC5 teaser. -No new stages. -Frame drop until i run it into NVDIA gc.   In fact, i don't regret buying DMC 4 SE. I just regret to buy it 24 boxes.

            "review_text": "While I don't think the additional content of Special Edition really warranted its own game (it should have been DLC years ago), the extra characters are worth the low purchase price.  Unfortunately, there are no new weapons, no new missions, only a few cutscenes and no new modes over the Vanilla DMC4. Basically what SE is, is 3 extra characters added into Vanilla DMC4. Lady, Trish and Vergil.   Lady offers almost exclusively ranged gameplay (which isn't good in a game like this) but she plays so differently from the others that shes worth a go. She is playable in Nero's missions.  Trish is mostly a frankensteined moveset from Dante and a couple of Vergil's moves. Her unique mechanic is to throw her Sword for a few seconds and use alternate abilities. She specializes in mass AoE abilities. Playable in Dante's missions.  Vergil is largely his DMC3 moveset with a few ques taken from DmC's version of Vergil. He is so completely broken (in the right hands) that the other 4 characters cannot even come close to his potential. Vergil can clear Legendary Dark Knight missions (which have a staggering amount of enemies) in the same time that other characters take to clear Dante Must Die missions.  At the end of the day, it is still the half completed game that DMC4 was, but the new characters are so much fun to play as and the extra costumes still keep me coming back to Nero and Dante.  My personal recommendation is to new comers, hardcore fans, or to those who never really put time into vanilla DMC4 because the entire roster of 'Team DMC' is here and every single one of them is awesome to play as.",

To call 2 less than stellar would be the understatement of the century, yet 3 still proudly claims its place as the absolute pinnacle of the entire freaking genre. Then just two years ago we recieved a very unnecessary and quite poor reboot in the way of DmC: Devil May Cry. And now we recieve the Special Edition of the last proper entry of the series with Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition. This is a faar better game than what we got the first time around. Not to say the original 4 was bad, far from it, but it's clear it wasn't the product it was supposed to be. While Special Edition doesn't fix that, it makes it quite a bit easier to forget that fact. The only real problem I have is the mandatory dash that you do outside of combat if you equip it instead of being able to toggle or something. Anyways. If you somehow haven't played this, you need to get on that. Like, right now.",

The extra content is nothing more then just character swaps and extra extra extra hard mode. This game feels cheap. What i mean by cheap is that nothing has really changed. It feels like they just added the characters and called it a day. There is no training mode to test out the skills you buy, the controls are not updated and just feel slugish compared to DMC:devil may cry remake and there is no new campaignfor the new characters. The same problems the original had are still in this one. That said i do really enjoy playing as vergil in dark knight mode, its amazing.   The worst part of all is that now the whole game is backtracking over and over and over. As Nero you play till the mid point and then Dante takes over and you get to play the same levels in reverse order, after that you get to do it again and again with the new characters. I would have loved a campaign for the new characters even if it wasnt as long as the main story.  Get this game if you are a big fan of dmc.  Wished they had updated a few things.

And the added features didnt seem that fulfilling. I couldnt have been more wrong. This game is simply worth the twenty pups on Vergils gameplay style alone. It was fantastic. Absolutely amazed at how stylish and fluid the gameplay has been polished to. PS. Jump still sucks ♥♥♥. I implore any fan of the franchise to buy it. There are a few grips for me which were. Fullscreen mode is buggy when you want to shift in and out of windows. The cutscenes. I didnt mind the original cutscenes being cut in vergil mode. But they brought the original voice actor in to do Vergil again. Why they didnt see fit to utilize this and add some juicy cutscenes of his own. I dont know. Overall though the game has renewed my love of DMC, (I hated DmC) I pray to god they give Vergil his own game or simply bring him back in a main story line. I also enjoyed the fact they gave each character in this a nice little ability that nobody else could have IE Vergil could collect orbs from further away ect. It added that extra little bit of versitility in each seperate gameplays.    Solid 8/10 for me",

Devil May Cry 3 set the bar extremely high for the series, and Devil May Cry 4 tries to reach that bar but just falls a little short. You play as Nero throughout most of the game and eventually play as Dante.    It's fun to play as Nero, he has the guns and swords similar to what Dante uses but more flashy. Neros' sword has a charge up attack that just does insane amounts of damage along with his devil arm which makes fighting most basic enemies a breeze. Nero is considered to be the 'noob friendly' character to play as in the series since he is so easy to control and his devil arm makes him slightly overpowered. Dante however, is a completely different story. Dante plays a lot like he did in Devil May Cry 3 with the different fighting styles though trickster is the default style most people will get use to very fast.   I've yet to play as Veril or Trish and Lady but adding those characters in to be playable, a new higher difficulty, slightly tweaked combat, and different costumes for your character makes this special edition version worth the price. The game is starting to show its age but it is still better than your average run of the mill hack and slash game. Definitely recommended to people wanting to try out the series and the veterans that can finish the entire game in one sitting.",

        {
            "review_text": "Devil May Cry 4 was a game I played directly after Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, and despite some hating the character of Nero, I quite enjoyed him. His style was a mixture between the power of Dante and the speed of Vergil, with the Devil Bringer giving him more versatility than the two.   However anyone who has played DmC 4 originally already knows this. Vergil, Trish, and Lady all maintain their own respective styles that cause of each of the new characters to be unique and have their own capabilities. In short, they are all fun and I enjoy playing as each of them and don't have a hatred of any of them. In long, for those who are curious as to how everyone plays, here you are:  Vergil: He plays similar to that of he did in DmC 3's Special Edition, he is a lot faster and weilds the same three weapons: Yamato (His Signature Blade), Foce Edge &amp; Yamato in a combination, and Beowulf (Gauntlets and Boots similar to Dante's Gilgamesh) Each of these weapons are situational for whoever wishes to play, however a few things have changed. Yamato has grown a lot faster, and now you can buy different combos with it using proud souls, yet it maintains its base power of being capable of being the only weapon you use the entire game if you so wish.  The Force Edge and Yamato combination attacks are also a lot faster, and instead of using Yamato during the latter half he entirely uses the Force Edge throughout the combo unless you buy a new one. It is a lot more powerful on the ground than in the air, forcing you to resort to ground gameplay if you wish to use it effectively, however it still is a useful weapon if you so choose to use it.   Beowulf is ripped straight out of Devil May Cry 3 combo-wise from Dante's perspective rather than Vergils. Other than the standard combo, he gains Dante's Thousand-Kick (at least that's what i call the combo) and Rising Dragon uppercut, as well as the Kick-13 from DmC 1. You can also now charge the attacks if you so wish.   The Main add-on of his gameplay is the Concentration Gauge. If you stay still while locked on to an enemy, land blows, or use his improved Air trick (which now is effectively Nero's Devil Bringer grab that sends Vergil Right to the enemy) it increases and the more it increases the stronger his attacks, however if you get hit, run, or miss attacks it will lower. (with getting hit effectively reducing it to almost nothing) When it is maxed out, he can use his ultimate attack (when you have purchased it) Judgement Cut with Yamato while it is maxed and you are in Devil Trigger, which effectively kills almost all normal enemies and devastates bosses. Overall he is fun to play if you enjoy the 'Speed Fighter' in video games.  Lady: Her gameplay rather than relying on melee weapons is almost entirely reliant on guns, (which is to be expected for anyone who has played DmC 3) the ones of choice being Dual Pistols, a Shotgun, or her Rocket Launcer Kalina Ann. Her melee gameplay is lackluster, however she makes up for it with exceptional ranged gameplay. Her Main combo's come from her pistols, while her true power comes from the shotgun and Kalina Ann. Instead of a standard Devil Trigger, her DT gauge is for a massive Area of Effect attack that deals great damage when you have a full DT gauge. Despite this she is still fun to play with, yet not as 'combo-riffic' as the other melee fighters. (Or at the very least I am not the best at Combo's using her guns)  Trish: The 'Dante' of the Lady/Trish scenario, her 'tricks' instead are powerful attacks with the blade Sparda. An opposite to Lady, she relies heavily on a combination of fast Bare Knuckle strucks and powerful Sparda slashes. Flashy and powerful, her great might comes from using the combination effectively. One of her most damaging and (in my opinion) useful combinations coming from her throwing Sparda much like the Round-Trip attack from Force Edge/Rebellion in combination with a bare knuckle combination causing her to (as I call it) break-dance across the area, dealing massive damage to enemies around within the round-trip tornado, or deal damage to enemies who aren't caught it its destructive spin.   Overall, the Special editions content of new Playable characters is entertaining to play, and in my opinion it was worth the re-release. The only downside is that they only have a different opening and closing cutscene, no other additional add-ons in that case. But for a Devil May Cry game, that has never truly mattered.

Vergil is too good in this game, all of his combo opportunities are insane if you know how to pull them off. I do recommend a controller to be used when playing this game because it will make the experience much better than playing on a keyboard. As of right now I do not have a controller so i'm playing this game on Human mode due to my lack of experience playing DMC using a small keyboard.  Haven't beat this game yet but I give it a 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "As someone who was initially reluctant to get into the franchise, it's saying a lot when I say DMC4SE is one of the best experiences with a game I've had in a good while, possibly even my whole life. I had heard so much hate about DMC4 and I never got why as I played. Maybe because I didn't know about the game when it didn't have all this extra content. To start, Plot is mediocre and it's not really a spoiler as you'll see it coming from a mile away: religion gone wrong. Nero, the game's protagonist, is honestly more like a lesser Dante voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch as you see how he's full of himself too. I once read someone joked Nero and Kyrie, the damsel in distress, were ripoffs of Ichigo and Orihime from Bleach. … With the same actors and Kyrie resembling Orihime, that joke... wasn't too far off. Dante and company in Devil May Cry are, of course, trying to deal with the problem directly. The interactions between the Super Cool Dude and the New Kid are pretty funny and endearing.  With that out of the way, gameplay is absolutely fantastic. It WILL get repetitive, mind you. But it takes awhile to actually feel boring. Nero introduces the Devil Bringer as opposed to a trick button or anything of the like. It simply reaches out and grabs. That simplicity adds so, so much for stylish combat, as integrating it with your techniques feels beyond satisfying. On top of that, Dante is playable. It's no surprise given how he's the face of the franchise. Dante has a total of five styles, and they're all on the D-Pad now. Dante is VERY hard to get bored with as opposed to Nero due to SO MUCH in his kit. Vergil's playable, as promised and plays as expected: you do better if calm and get more damage out of it. I didn't find Trish interesting, but Lady is the first in the cast to focus majorly on firearms, which was a really cool idea and one I'm glad they didn't think to change  Music is... repetitive, not as good as 3's. The Time Has Come gets old very quickly. Sworn Through Swords is really good, so it gets a mention. Graphics look nice and areas have just enough space to either feel open as they should, or claustrophobic like they want. Although, if you don't have a strong enough potato, you'll find yourself at 15-20 FPS. There's a fix that removes motion blur to help, but you'll have to find that yourself.   There's so much to do in this game playing five characters total, having Bloody Palace open for all of them, along with varying combat abilities for each of them. So many difficulties that I don't have the skills or heart to go through in any of the games unfortunately.   All in all I utterly adore this game. I even enjoyed Dante's portion which many found lazy understandably for reasons you'll have to see yourself. It's a really, really good game with glaring flaws that can pass. If you never got DMC4, get this. Even if you did, get this anyway. Vergil makes it worth. If you've never played any of the other games, pretty much everything involving Dante will confuse you. If you don't care and just want a good action game, get it.  Get it, get it, get it. I can't say that enough.",

So lets start off with the cons of Devil MayCry 4: Special Edition.  *New Cons* -You have to play through the dreadful campain several times with the good modes only becoming playable after you have beaten it once or twice Legendary Dark Knight difficulty is an exception to this and THANK GOD because its an amazing gamemode. -Level Progress does not transfer over to other characters you want to play. For instance, I can play Vergil all the way till level 12 and then deceide I want to play as Trish. I would have to start all over again on a new campain. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ but its not the end of the world. -The Special Edition looks better than the past version....but is incredibly more gpu intensive for whatever reason. I have not heard anyone complain about massive slowdowns or anything but instead people who would get 200fps on the old version no only average around 60~ or so. It looks slightly better but not enough to justify that level of intensity. -Couple of new underwhelming cutscences for the new chracters that arent even worth mentioning. *Old Cons* -Story is pretty lame even for a Devil May Cry tittle -Level Design loops back around....litterally -Same repetive music track over and over and over and...... -Bosses really arent that incredibly well designed   *New Pros* -ERMAHGAWD the new characters are amazing. The quality control of these playably characters are incredible. Each of them are absurdly unique with there own little niche and advantages. -Great Skins are great. Some are underwhelming and there arent that many but they look great and show up in cutscenes as well. -Legendary Dark Knight mode is just everything you want from the game. Hard as ♥♥♥♥ and enough punching bags that you dont get bored. -After you unlock Bloody Palace you can play all the chracters anytime you want which reduces a lot of complaints about the story. *Old Pros* -Game looks pretty decent even by todays standards. -Cutscences are interesting. -Nero is a great addition to the party which gives us a nice break from Dante's charming but over powered ego. -Great combat and leveling up mechanics. Essentially dont get hit. Button mashing might work sometimes on the regular enemies but button mash on bosses and you're gonner.  -Great varients of difficulty.  Overall Devil May Cry 4 is a great game that you may place once and enjoy it; or play it again because you have completly fallen in love with the game.",

I am a bit disappointed with the fact that Capcom wasted the opportunities to add new levels or a new campaign, and I would've liked to see more cutscenes with conversations for the new characters. The current cutscenes (at least with Vergil) involve little dialog (e.g. before boss fights), and don't have a lot of depth or things to make you even chuckle.

(bad new first)  As I thought when I first started playing there is no difference to the levels other then some of the blue orb placements are different, and the blue orbs missions are slightly changed. There is not much in the way of videos for Trish, Vergil, or Lady. While I would have loved for them to slap dash some what of a story as to why these three characters are smashing about his holiness kingdom. They gave me but a crumb. What can I way, I am a sucker for any lore.  MOVING Right along.   The Sweets... the lovely lovely suger coated cake filled madness that is DMC.  Vergil is nearly over powered, if not completely insane. But this comes at a cost to the player. Timing, much like nero if you want to smash everything in a chained combo of death and destruction. You have to have good timing. Vergils judgement cut, is just amazing and painful to foes.   Lady seems to be on par with the damage that vergil can dish out. With her skills centered around guns, the various ablitys that she has with them is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic to any pyromaniac or demolitionist. You will not be disappointed.  Have yet to play as trish... but from the other two characters.... I am sure she will be amazing.  I would suggest just giving capcom the money for red ords, and proud souls. It makes the play through so much more interesting and gets rid of the grind.  PS: Playing Trish in Blood palace.... also OP",

Nero, Dante, Vergil, Trish, Lady. - Higher difficulties is an extremely challenging and fun gameplay, especially on Lady - I fail so much. ;_; - Nero's devil arm mechanic is fun to play around, pretty satifying to throw things at bosses or even throw them. - Dante no longer uses the single-style system like DMC3 anymore, instead, you can switch between the 4 to create epic and stylish combos. You can still stick with one though. - All characters fit into the story somehow, not just randomly there killing demons for no reason. - Every character has a fun mechanic to play around, influences gameplay a lot. - Can run pretty smoothly on most PCs.  Cons: - Even though the extra characters are introduced, they still don't have extra cutscenes of their own; understandable though. - The camera angles can become VERY awkward. - Some monsters have unfair attack patterns, some aren't even telegraphed = mid-combo, can't dodge. - Like always, don't play this on keyboard - you can try, I just don't suggest it.",

The graphics and overall quality was improved. The gameplay is good, and even if the levels are getting repetitive, new characters are giving them the freshness. Costumes were something that basic 'Devil May Cry 4' needed and Special Edition provided us with three costumes per character. Game also allows us to change it into basic 'Devil May Cry 4' what is a decent option. I might even say, that this is the greatest game in the franchise so far and I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "DMC4 is really a good game. So many years after I played its original version, I'm still excited to see the release of special edition. Compare to many other action games, battle in DMC4 is always like a show rather than a fight. If you are an action game fan, this is a must have. If not, this is where you begin to love great action games.  Graphics: 9/10 It may not be that good compared to some games like witcher3 and dragon age. But consider it being completed several years ago, it is awesome at that time and even in today it still looks great. Minus 1 point for not making much progress. Story: 8/10 Minus 2 point for not having much story with three new characters. DMC's story script is always good among action games. But you know, it's action game. Action games usually have simple stories. Looking for some touching long stories? I'm afraid this is not what you want. Music: x/10 It's ok for me. But whether you like it or not, you have to figure it out yourself. Gameplay: 9/10 Great game experience. Every characters have their own style. Capcom has done enough optimization work to keep it running on fps. Never feel delay in game. Remember to switch to your discrete GPU. It lag as hell when play Dark knight with integrated graphics. One more thing to keep in mind is this game includes some puzzle. They are not that difficult, but if you don't know where to go next, use google.  In general, it is a great game to have. When you get used to it, you will find much pleasure in your show time. Such a Pity Capcom stop making good games like DMC4 these days.",

This 'edition' of Devil May Cry 4 would have been a lot more 'special' if the content cut from DMC4's initial development, like additional levels for Nero and Dante, along with a story campaign for Vergil (rumored to be a scrapped character from the standard DMC4), was worked on and re-integrated into the game.  But I'll give Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition a thumb up, simply because it is a good Hack &amp; Slash simulator to have in your Steam library if you haven't played or purchased the original version, and are a fan of the classic games. It's also a good counterpart to DmC: Devil May Cry, since you get to experience two alternating versions of the DMC mythos revolving around the sibling rivalry of it's warring protagonists (Dante and Vergil).",

By this I mean, you will be going through the same areas as Nero, the only difference? You play as Dante. The addition of the three characters is most welcome and I hope they do this one day with DMC 5 (if there will ever be one). It adds a lot more variety to the game and it adds something new to the franchise.  Verdict - 8/10",
