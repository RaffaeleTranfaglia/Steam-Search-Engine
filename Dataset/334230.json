A mask confidence, stuck to my face with the sinuous yellow terror of a hunted animal.  Tiny Box Tim claimed the same. But I had built up a rapport with the medium, and the dead were similarly deceived.  When we put him on the scaffold, he was calm. His defense came too slowly: 'But  I'm  the executioner,' he complained. A quick and uncovering apology.  'We can't both be,' I hissed. The medium's vote wavered.  And he damned us as we dropped him and our judgment broke like his own weight against his neck.  'Town wins!' I said, mocking, hysterical. The con was over. And as we turned to our beds I fondled the long knives in my pocket and wished the medium sweet dreams. She would be with her communicants in the grey and severed world beyond the scaffold soon enough.",

If I wanted ads I could've just kept playing the browser version without paying anything and that is what I recommend you do.",

I don't know about people outside europe, but here in europe was the game werewolving a real life card which was played on thousands of colleges, schools and friends parties.  This game is the same as werewolving and it's fantastic. I used to be a shooter gamer, but lately i'm only playing this, it's mysterious as a rpg games and so dominating as a poker game.  But don't get me wrong except that you bluff and see through people it's totally not like poker. This game feels so rewarding and it's worth it every cent.  It's actually a free-to-play game in your browser and you can play it like i said for free there, the cool thing is that you can play cross play with your friends on steam and vice versa. I prefer the steam version because i like to support this game, hunt achievements and the town points are a fun addition to this.  I hope they add trading cards though, that would make it more appealing for other people to buy this game. My motivation for trading cards is that i can buy all the backgrounds and emoticons of Town of Salem on the steam market to express my love for Town of Salem.  So let's get this game folks, it's worth every cent, and if you are not sure than go ahead and play it for free in your browser.  Seriously the best game ever.  I hope this game will be kept online forever, this is how good a game can be without graphics",

            "review_text": "Town of Salem is a Strategic Elimination game that's set the the town of, well, Salem, back when the witch trials were very much alive.  This was a browser game in the past for quite some time, but December 15th is when it's mark on Steam came along. I played the browser version pretty extensively, and it's a very fun game to play because the outcome solely depends on player interaction and decisions.  See, you have these various roles, all with different alliances. Townies try and work together to survive and find out who the bad guys are. The mafia are their own group, trying to eliminate anyone who isn't them. And then the neutrals are people trying to achieve their own goal, neither with townies nor mafia. 15+ roles exist in the game, and they can all have a huge outcome on any game.  What's the catch? You have no idea who is what, so you need to use your smarts and think about whether to trust the people you're with or not. Each day, there's a discussion, then there's voting. If one person is voted to be lynched, they have a chance to defend themselves, then the town decides whether that person is guilty or innocent. The game then transitions to night, where the action happens. People can be stabbed, moved, killed, distracted, just about anything can happen at night, as careful as you may be. The game ends when either the Townies or Mafia wins (Neutrals are rare cases.)  This is why I like this game so much. Like I said, it depends heavily on human interaction, which is what keeps every game fresh and alive. You're always given a random role at the start of a new game. You can pick classic mode where there's a set list of roles, and all 15 players fufill one, or you can do 'All Any' where you don't know what roles exist, and that makes it an even bigger mystery.  Overall, Town of Salem is an awesome game to play just for the suspensefulness and the fresh variety with every game, I really recommend this game.",

When the game starts and everyone has chosen their desired name, everyone gets a random role. Certain roles are meant to kill people while others save people. This can make for extremely close and intense games! Before you get into this game I would recommend watching some videos of the gameplay and read about all the roles.  This is because it can be a little overwhelming at first but it shouldn't take you long to learn everything.  Overall I highly recommend this game!  PS. There's an ingame currency which you can buy cosmetics with. Buying the Steam version gets you 5 dollars worth of said currency. HOWEVER! If you don't really care about supporting the developer or cosmetics you can play the free browser version. (Should be found with 1 quick Google search). The browser version is the exact same game and it's a nice chance to try out the game. If you like it? BUY IT AND SUPPORT THE DEVS! ",

Ranked queue is glitched and gets stuck once timer reaches zero; which means you have to restart the game, sign back in, and join the queue from the beginning.  Buying the game does not disable pop-up ads for in-game cosmetics! What the hell? I should be able to at least turn it off. If you want to put a promotional banner for new content on the front page, fine. But pop-up advertisements are NOT OKAY.  Updated 05/20/2016: This game has been flooded with...let's say less mentally capable people. Devs paid Youtubers to promote the game and now ranked mode is filled with people who can't reason simple things out. It took me a month to realize that this game is beyond repair. The devs are too busy raising money on kickstarter for a board game and refusing to create a ranked mode that actually requires knowledge and skill to participate in.  Short version: fun game to play with others, but don't bother spending money to buy it on Steam. You don't miss out on content if you play in a browser.   Updated 05/20/2016: DON'T BUY, DON'T PLAY.

I now have around 300 hours, and thought I would throw some more comments out there. The major problem with the game is people who leave at the start, because they don't like their role. In addition there are a lot of people who skype or otherwise share info outside of the game. It makes it frustrating for the real players. The addition of Ranked mode cuts both of these down tremendously. All Any is still my favorite mode tho, bc its really crazy.",

I would suggest trying this game out through the browser version first. If you enjoy it, play more of it and if you have extra money to burn, purchase the Steam version for extra in-game currency. However, the game is basically free, so it's up to you!   Town of Salem is definitely a game that is fun and gets even better when playing with friends (and lynching them)!",

People completely arbitrarily helping someone who is supposed to be their enemy, even when they have a good chance of winning. People refusing to learn most basic and essential mechanics (wills, invest clues). Almost every game, 2-3 people leave right at the start.  Perhaps it's different in ranked. However, I've been unable to join any ranked games. Client disconnects after about 30 seconds of staying on home screen without joining any games (some culling of inactive connections, I presume - just have to restart for it to work again) - not an issue in non-ranked play, but queues for ranked are long enough for disconnection to occur, so it can never join a lobby. Might just be a very specific issue only I have, idk.  The game itself is quite good and can be a lot of fun, but not with such a playerbase. I hoped it would get better some time after launch, when those who have more interest in trolling and derping around than in the actual game quit, but nope. Still the same, perhaps even worse.  It's still recommended if you have enough friends with some free time to play only with them. But not otherwise. Unless you just want to annoy and grief people or enjoy that being done to you.",

Why? because if you have never played a live chat MP game where paranoia and investigation (and ultimately survival) is key then you need to try this. So grab a random role and try to hide it away from others - until it's time to step up - or not - depending on your role and situation.   I suppose the biggest brilliance of this game is that it overcomes easily the '12yo XDXD le troles bringing the bantz' because a) they dont want to play this as they are the underdogs quickly. Players appear semi-mature atleast b) The more stupid you act the more likely you get random lynched which gives more time for others to form the real game ending.   i'd say this game is almost immune to trolling as fooling others is the name of the game. Gamethrowing aka people quitting is not much of a trouble either because even if half the people quit it still doesnt matter - epic and surprising endings are aplenty as games are decided in the last turns usually.",

Competitive play is feels relatively balanced, Devs are pretty engaging with the community.   Please, don't listen to the negative reviews on this game regarding the change in the currency of the game. [They made it so you have to pay money for gold, which allows you to buy certain skins. AESTHETIC skins that have 0 effect on your game (other than look, obviously) just like any other game that does this. They now have a SILVER currency, which allows you to purchase older skins/pets, as well as scrolls (which actually DO impact gameplay).

Just gonna put it blunt, it F*cks with your mind, this game has a lot of tricks up its sleeves.... From surprising plot twists to last minute turn arounds, the games in this could go ANYWHERE.  The player customizer is spectacular, the options are just incredible and with new update every holiday and so often, you can never have enough skins or pets. It may be hard working for it, but you can't help but grin when you walk into that circle with a doge or a huge dark horse descending down on your fellow townies.

But, sadly, i can not give a perfect 10 for some games being ruined as of cheaters in the games, and i know its nearly impossible to prevent at the start of the game, but me and squirrels alike have had mafia, sk or just any games ruined by other mafia members or cheaters.

The game is COMPLETELY free on the browser version, but if you want to support the game (like I did) you get $5 worth of currency (If you have ever played League of Legends, it is basically RP). This game is extremely fun for those who like mystery/mafia games and I reccomend it to people that are into using clues and decieving others.  If you want to try the game without a steam purchase, play it for free on the website. If you do decide to buy the steam version later, all of your unlocked achievements/skins will transfer over.  The game is great, it is a newly released game and I can see lots of updates rolling in eventually.",

In-game purchases do not affect gameplay, as most of what is offered are cosmetic items. Scrolls give the possibility of getting a role that is favored, however it is not guaranteed, and the strategy that the game requires is not affected, although it seems that many people are more willing to lynch a person who has an evil skin. Overall, this game is addicting, competetive, stategic, and fun. It is one of my favorites to play when I am bored, and it occupies most of my brain space in the moment. 10/10. Before purchasing this game, be aware that it is available for free on their website. However, purchasing through steam allows greater in-game benefits and faster earned MP for spending. I'm still not sure if buying it on steam was actually worth it, but for the time i've put into this game, I am sure it won't be a waste.",

            "review_text": "I'm new to this kind of games. I found this game through a discovery queue on 30th of dec. Reviews complained about a rather unappealing moves by the devs trying to get money for cosmetics. Reviews also pointed out that there's a free version on their web site and that's where I went. I was pretty confused while trying to figure out what's what's and who's the real McCoy for the most part of the day. Probably still have a LOT more to learn. I kept going for, “one more game” till the morning of 31th.  -The devs moves with cosmetics&amp;money DO look ugly. Check the update news though, they're not THAT “evil”. -The game IS 100% playable (and enjoyable, unless you're a skin junkie of some kind) for free. Only cosmetics are walled behind RM (not all of them btw). -Scrolls are the only item type that affects the actual gameplay. They affect your  chances  of getting the associated roles and don't work in Ranked mode. -Scrolls are NOT walled behind RM. -It's an enjoyable game, at least from my newbie perspective.  I get why some old players are irritated, yet it's a freely enjoyable game. I got more that it's steam cost worth of fun already and I got it for free. In my opinion that deserves a positive review/recommendation.  P.S. If my review has convinced you to try the game, feel free to put me (Reianor) as a referrer when registering. Try it for free first. If you like it enough to spend money then I'll have gotten a referrer bonus and you … well you'll have gotten to play a game that you liked enough to spend money on. Win/win, right?  P.P.S. I'd get into details about the game itself, but if that is your main concern than you're better off looking for info in some other reviews. There are people out there who have played this game and similar games for waaaay longer than I did, their input should be more valuable. Just mind the dates, and like I said, check the news to see if their info is still up to date. All I can say is that the gameplay feedback I've looked through was positive. Well, that and, for what it's worth, that my own inexperienced experience was positive.",

            "review_text": "Town of Salem is an intricate game regarding how well you can deceive, manipulate and trick other players. It is full with a profusion of stratergies and roles that a player can receive.  The player then has to act out the goal of these roles. Every game is full of different people and different roles accompanied by different stratergies so the game always feels fresh. You can play the browser version for free on the official BlankMediaGames website or you can purchase the steam version to support the creators and will be rewarded with 1300 coins for doing so.  There are different cosmetic items in the game so there's no pay to win aspect. You can easily get these items with the in-game currency and don't have to spend anything to get them. If you wish to speed up the process you can buy these coins but it's not necessary.  The game has multiple modes. Classic is basically the starter mode you should use. There are custom games you can create with custom role lists to have so chaotic fun. Also there are chaos gamemdoes which are basically a cluster♥♥♥♥ and really fun to Play.  Once you are sick of Classic and are eager for more you can try out the Ranked Practise mode. In this, everything is harder and has more roles. Once you get the hang of Ranked Practise you can try out Ranked. This is for more serious and competitive players and still is a lot of fun.  Overall town of salem is an intricate game and worth getting on steam or playing on the official BlankMediaGames website. Honestly one of my favourite games at this common time and there's no lag involved. Meaning you're not going to get ♥♥♥♥ed over because people in your house are downloading.",

            "review_text": "SERIOUS REVIEW  When i first saw this game on saw i thought 'eh, why not?', so i bought it. I can say that this game is worth every penny  You may be asking 'You can play this game for free! Why should i pay for it when i can play for free?' Well, first of all the servers are 10x faster than the brower version  Every single game you play is different, especially when you get roles like Serial Killer or a Mafia Member On the other hand you can play boring and 1 time use roles like Medium or Retributionist (Ret. can bring one person back to life (But most of the time they get killed right after again))  Once you play 50 games, you can play ranked which i havent gotten to try out yet but im getting there  To sum all of it up ill do Pros and Cons  Pros:  - Variety  - 3 Different game modes  - 31 roles  - you can play with friends (create a lobby)  - Worth the 4.99 (Would recommend buying on sale ;))  - Coins can buy cosmetics, houses, pets, death animations, and player skins/costumes (You can buy coins or earn them buy playing games over time)  - You sometime get deals that are very cheap Examples: Vampire Deal: Vampire Skin, Vampire house, 1300 coins, etc. FOR ONLY 0.99! NOTE: The buyable things in TOS is basically hats from TF2 (Money Grabbers ;) )  - STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS :))))))))))))) (GO GET SOME AND SHOWOFF HOW GOOD YOU ARE)  Cons:  - 3 gamemodes, im sure overtime they will add more gamemodes but for now what you get is what you got.  - GAMETHROWERS, although these are rare sometimes you will join a game with a guy who will tell who the entire mafia is and ruin the game for everyone.  - 4.99 coin packs for only 1500 coins, as i said before Coins are equal to TF2 Hats, they suck you in and steal your money. (If you lowered the price or gave more coins for 4.99 i would consider buying coins.   In conclusion, Town of Salem: Steam Version is an amazing game and you should support the developers!  9/10  PS: WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY THERE ARE NO POP-UP ADS!",

People who join a lobby and wait until the timer is at 2 seconds and then leave just to troll everyone else. Not to mention in game quitters who leave before the game even goes to the first night because they don't like the role that they got.  3. Town members who are killed that quit.... something needs to be done about that as well. It screws over the medium's role. What point is there in having a medium if everyone who dies leaves the game because they are sore losers?  This game is meant to be fun for everyone who plays it. But lately I have had the fun sapped out of it because of the above problems. The devs keep claiming that they are going to impliment features that punish people who quit and use offensive names... but nothing has been done yet. I have been playing this game for several months now on both Steam and Facebook. It's time for the developers to take care of the trash players in this game so that the REAL players can fully enjoy it!  I won't recommend this game to a friend until the above problems are fixed.

Noire would have had more detective skills involved but really it was a matter of looking at every clue in a certain area and moving on, not like this though.  You get put into a certain role, with certain conditions to win and certain abilities and you need to find the people who are against you, it sounds simple however there are good, bad and neutral roles and it's tough to find who's who in the game. It's a very well balanced game with honestly only a couple boring roles to play.   This is the most amount of fun I've had gaming ever. Seriously, I got a new mouse and I still play this one, which barely uses it at all, even though I could pop into another mouse heavy game and really try it out I've still been sucked into this game of thought.  Fantastic. Great job devs.  Honestly, it's free if you look it up on google, it's a browser game, I paid for some in game credits and the fact that it's now much more accessible, so try it out if you don't feel like buying it, just make sure if you want to spend money on credits for skins, pets, ect that you buy it on steam first, at least until they're added to the free to play list.",

I make my claim and the investigator backs me up saying that I was infact the sheriff. Instead of the mafioso going up, I went up as the investigator and myself were 'the 2 remaining mafia, trying to get someone else killed'.  Now incidents like this don't happen that often but there will usually be an idiot or someone who just doesn't know how to play in the lobby which will REALLY get on your nerves.

Each role (mostly) has an interesting thing to do, some roles are dull and are based entirely on luck and nothing else, but overall, you can develop your own strategy for each character and use it to the advantage (or disadvantage) of the group. Right, it is a really good game. Really engaged and good fun to play with...however...  What ruins the game is the sheer level of cheating and bad form displayed by a lot of players. I've had the good fortune to play with some excellent players and have great games. But on the majority of occasions, I end up stuck with some really rude, bigotted, spamming and sometimes peadophillic people. I report them of course, but the next game or so, there they are again, and aiming to ruin the game for me because I called them on it.   In some games as well, people actually cheat by telling people IRL who did what. For example, N1 as SK I killed the escort. Escort did not leave a will, ya know, the main way of communicating after you die (less the medium) and I got lynched because another person in the game was sat in the same room as the escort, and the escort told him. After trying to defend myself, as you would if you want to try to win, I was labelled a '♥♥♥' and told to 'go cry yu f***, b***** die in a fire' and so on...as if I chose to be the SK and then was totally in the wrong for trying to escape a lynching!   This is the only element of the game I find completely offputting, that this is going on, and it ruins games and throws it into complete bias. Everybody should have a fair shot at winning, and not get screwed over so easily by people who use their own mechanics to swing games. Adding in the fact that you get personally attacked by these people for actually trying to play the game. I know that monitoring a chat service is difficult and rely's on the players reporting, but the report function is not sufficient, especially when you can't give a reason for the report. And I am aware that there is no real way that the developers can stop this from happening, same as WoW can't really do much against gold farmers.  I would recommend it, but I do hope the developers are aware that this type of player ruins it for everybody else, and is, as such, the only, albeit quite seriously so, offputting part of the game.",

Everyone chooses a name, the game begins, and you're given a random role which no one knows but you.  There's a buncha roles. With each having their own ability and goal. Some need to lynch or kill the enemy team. Some just need to survive to the end of the game regardless of which team wins. Some even win by getting lynched.   Roles basically boil down to either collecting information, attacking other players, defending other players, blocking other players from performing their actions, or misleading other players. All of which are done in various ways.  This game has the effect much like Civilization. You keep deciding to play just one more game (or 'turn' in Civ's case) but before you know it you've played 10 more games.

They may cause some loss of immersion into the game, but the other 13 players will tend to for the most part remain immersed in the game along with you.

I strongly recommend playing this game for yourself on the browser first if you don't want to pay, if you enjoy the game, I strongly recommend buying it here. It's worth it.  Pros:  - Unique game aspect - Colorful art and fun music - Most people are respectful to each other, even in game - Simple UI - Not terribly grindy to obtain gold - Regular sales making certain expensive packages super affordable - Several roles to play as  Cons:  - Bugs here and there - Requires strategy, lot of people in Classic think pointing fingers on the first day is the best idea, it's not. - No freedom to swear, not a big deal but it sucks having to watch my own mouth - Can be difficult to maintain your role and your will at once, depending on your role. - Far too much marketing - Not enough gold rewards for playing the game  Again I strongly recommend this game, and if by some chance, my review led you to Salem, please use my name as the referal. :3 Name is kayanakoe in game. I would love to try playing a game or two with you guys as well.  Update: I forgot to mention something, the game tends to be heavy on marketing so.. any gold income you would try to gain legitimately is low, 5 gold if, IF you win.

We lynched him and everyone thought they were safe. And that night I ignited and watched every single one of them burn. I walked out of my house in the morning, and smiled at all the dead, charred bodies laying on the ground. I was the only survivor.  Then I walked back inside my house and played Town of Salem.

Game is actually a quick and fun social game. Addicting when its played right. Even after you die, its still entertaining to watch the remainder of the game as people play really well or screw up really hard because they're so dumb.  Unfortuantely this is a big fat 'no' for 3 main reasons.   as stated in the tl;dr, the game is free to play. I don't know why the Steam version isn't FTP, but the $5 you spend on the game gives you $5 worth of in game currency to buy garbage.  2nd no is nature of game being a social game. Every now and then you'll run into a group of x-chaners or some other misanthropes who sit there and type obsenities or they play as a group to cheat and throw games because LEL XD so funnay!  3rd no is based on principal.   To combat foul mouthed children and idiots, the developers of Town of Salem put in a word filter. It replaces all the vulgarity with inoffensive terms. You can type ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, etc, all you want no problem... But DON'T YOU DARE type any SJW or feminazi trigger words! You'll get banned from the game for sexual harassment you bigoted homophobe!  Seriosuly, words that aren't swears or offensvie even. Stuff like r-ape and molester are blocked and issue you a warning that can lead to game suspension. Homo, which isn't even an anti-gay slur, is also blocked.   The SJW/Feminist thought policing is weird given the subject of the game. There is a vocal group of idiots who swear lynching is racist. And that's what you do as a group in Town of Salem.",

Lovely game play,  Very funny game mods not always the same.  Cons:  if you lynch a mafia member he may call you all out, ( against rules, ban able ) Only 50 coins a day ( need 5200 to buy a theme pack ) Very bad hosts ( when playing custom ) thats very slow or cant pick anything balanced. A few bugs nothing game breaking playing it since pretty much beta only seen 4-10 and they were all the same. A few useless roles, ( framer , medium , surviver ) who could need some kind of buff.  Alot of leavers because they get a bad role in the game.   Neutral things which i think is good and can be bad.  You can change name as much y want You can leave without a penatly  Only heard one person got ban. Dumb townies ( good for sk and maf)  Trolls, trolls make a unique thing in this game, normally you would say trolls are bad but in this game its very nice! it makes Jester harder to find and people are really roleplaying as much as they can to be innocent!

First off cheaters\\skypers I can understand there is not too much that the devs can do on this one, skype is just a chat program after all. But I have had some games where it was obvious the majority of the people there were on some form of chat and working together since they could lynch and kill nothing but mafia or whatever they wanted with 100% accuracy and no other communication in chat going on.  Buffs to medium and spy would be nice.  I dunno if it's a game feature that I am unaware of or just more cheating but It seems like whenever I roll a spy night 1 the maf immediately know it and type it in chat. I have not said anything so not sure how they get that info unless there is some feature that I am unaware of that allows them to know... but i've played maf plenty of times before and am pretty sure it's just more cheating.  If it's a game feature - the spy needs a buff. If not then cheating is even more rampant than I thought... Medium is slightly more useful but I think could still use a small buff... immune to neutrals would be different and nice.   Cheating is definitely a problem though in one of my games they knew who every single mafia was day 1 without saying anything in chat. Then it was just a slow process of lynching them all. I don't even see the fun in that for them... I guess to farm for gold. Hopefully when all these cheaters get all their cosmetics they will play the game legit... it is fun when played that way.",

I recommend you to try the browser version first; you can use your account if you think about buying it later. Now about the game.   The game is a social game, similar to some board games like Werewolf, Mafia or Secret Hitler.  The gameplay will focus mainly around lying/deceiving and strategically eliminating targets. What I like most in this game is the fact that there are no 'empty' roles, ofc. you have some roles which are more Important/powerful than others, but you always have an ability to influence the game outside from talking.  The game offers some different game modes with a huge variety of roles which really shakes up the gameplay if your standard mode gets dull.  Positive:      entertaining gameplay    nice artstyle    mostly balanced roles (often a problem in these kind of games)    nice soundtrack   Negative:     horrible menus (you can see the flash past of this game)   no option to punish cheaters/leavers (cheating in talking with people outside of the game or playing with multiple accounts)   Final Words: Try it, decide later. This game has a great concept, if they released a recoded version with a proper Ui and Hd-textures as well as an anti-cheat system I'd say it’s even worth 10-15€, for now the solid gameplay (and cheap price) allows me to look over these problems.

In terms of pros I would say ;   + good variety of roles each with their own abilities and attributes +custom gamemodes where you can add multiple roles/ ban roles for added chaos  + stuff such as the will system, talking to the dead, questioning as jailor, etc. make it somewhat complex and more interesting +fairly easy to pick up +there is a cash shop HOWEVER you can earn free coins through acheivements and first wins of the day. These coins can be used to unlock cosmetics and scrolls which give you a higher chance to land on whatever role the scroll is for  However despite how fun this game is, it still has some flaws;   -for a mainly text based game with fairly simple animations it still sometimes lags which can be annoying considering the game revolves around typing so if you're about to be lynched and you need to type up something fast in your defense and a lag spike hits it's annoying as heck -the community for this game sometimes makes me question humanity. Not only will you get lynched for the stupidest things but also some of these people can't put two and two together. Also a lot of bad trolls such as mafia who will reveal other mafia members, vig purposefully shooting people like mayor, etc.   All in all it's a pretty good game. Keep in mind though that the steam version only unlocks acheivements and some points for the cash shop but you can play this game for free on their official website.

The object of the game is to win with your faction, Town, Mafia, or Neutral (dependent.) There are several game modes that affect the amount and roles of members in each faction, in custom mode the host chooses the roles and this can lead to some less than fun matches, BUT you always have the option to leave the lobby. Each faction has several members (Depending on the faction or allignment.) Your goals are displayed in the upper right hand corner of the game and it is very easy to learn the basics, yet the more subtle launguage and clever moves people use may take longer to learn.   The abilities differ from randomly selected role to role, you cna be a Serial Killer bent on murdering each and every member of the town, a crime boss leading a group of mafia members to become the last people standing, a kindly doctor whose goal it is to make sure your target survives the night, or even a madman whose soul goal is to be hung through the voting system in game, allowing him to 'haunt' someone who voted him guilty.   The game has two sections, the day section where members talk to each other through an implemented text chat function (No voice chat, sorry!) and decie if someone needs to be hung by the town and if so the members vote on who is guilty or innocent once someeone is sent on trial. The night phase does not allow comunication (excpet through special roles and mafia members) and allows roles to use there special abilites, such as choosing someone to murder or protect (Whilst avoiding detection)  Each game is an entire different experience, and the game as a whole is very rewarding and msot certainly worth its miniscule $4.99 pricetag.

These affect the gameplay directly. Roles used to be random. Now they seem to be highly fixed. It's a fun game to get hooked to. Fun game to play. I genuinely do enjoy this game. I'd recommend it to anyone that is considering it. I simply cannot play it anymore. Was fun.",

People CAN be irritating sometimes, but, come on, that's a given in any online game, am i right? As for ranked, it is a pretty pleasant community/environment from my own perspective.

While it doesn't quite have the social aspect of playing in person, the software version enables a number of roles that wouldn't be feasible in in person games (like the Jailor, the Spy, etc).  Everyone has their own role to play (with some people working towards the same objective), and most have some related power to use, so you're not just a generic villiager. There are still some roles are more fun/powerful/better than others (eg, Jester, Executioner and Survivor are probably among the least fun) .  Overall, a good game if you like Mafia-style games. I do wish they would improve the lobbies, though. There are a few lobbies with a set configuration and one thats user-defined, but no way of grouping people togethr who want the same user configured game , or grouping people together by how well they play. Hopefully this gets improved in the future.",

Their's townies, who are trying to rid the town of evil. The Mafia, trying to purge the town of all non-mafia. Neutrals who either straight up have their own agenda, or who want people dead. Currently about 30 or so roles, each with a different power to aid your side.  A small detail of note - each game you can take a different name so often people will do themes.. such as Marvel (everyone takes the name of a marvel chara.) well, not everyone, but hopefully most.. or family ( 'your mom' 'your dad' 'your son', 'Your sister' etc.) . I find if their's a good theme, people will start picking up some RP along with doing the game, which just makes it that much better. ^.^  Quick addition - it plays 15, could play with friends, or on your own, and the longest i've ever had to wait seaching for a game was 10 seconds...  The only negative i can think of is that some people if they don't get the role they wanted quit the game, which can break balance.

Third this game is easy to play but youll take sometime to master it, I have played 100+ hours and I still have a hard time though its really fun. This game is one the best games in my library.  9/10  P.S. this is one of the few games that can succefully ruin friendships oh and a tip is that when playing with your friends and if you are skyping them tell them your role but not your name, its so fun seeing them go crazy trying to figure out who you are.",

Pros -Huge variety of roles to explore -Many different game modes to play -A ranked mode for competitive and experience players (like me) -Can play with up to 14 other players -Very easy-to-use and simple interface -Ability to chat about your info (or lie about it) -Multiple phases of gameplay -Ability to have friends -Great background music -Very well balanced  Cons -Can be easy to get screwed by events out of your control -Somewhat steep learning curve -Sometimes your arguments won't work despite them being true   Overall, this game does have minor issues, but they are GREATLY outweighed by the good parts. This game gets a 10/10 from me and I would definitely recommend this game to you. Just don't spend your money on the Steam version and play it for free on your browser.

If you are mafia, of course you are going to frame and set up people so they don't know it is you doing the evil deeds at night.

Your role is generally random, and if you die, you don't have to stick around until the end of the game.  A unique game type I have not experienced before. Intrigue, bartering, mystery, manipulation; it is fun.

And it was worth it! First Impressions: At first I thought 'Oh no, I'm not prepared, what do I do when I get a role that's hard to have?', but after a few moments of utter anxiety I decided to just jump in: I joined a Classic, Classic Game, and the game gave me the role of the Sheriff. I kept quiet mostly, I didn't see anyone suspicious. Also I noticed you could leave a message on death, thus I simply filled in everything I found, everyone who was innocent. And I didn't die. At the end of the game, only 3 of us were left. And the Serial Killer was trying to blame me. I revealed my role and luckily the other townie believed me. We won because the only other townie trusted me.  The Second Game threw me right into the Serial Killer role. I managed to kill 5 people without even popping up in the suggestions then someone just declared to 'Randomly lynch' me. I was still happy, I mean, I learned from that.  The Third Game I was a vigilante. I didn't do anything and we won in the end by luck mostly.  The fourth game I was an executioner. They killed my target in the night though, so I ended up as a jester. Then I was killed in the night aswell. The fifth game directly spawned me as a jester and I was killed in the night but it was fun.  The sixth game then spawned me as a Veteran... and I wasted my 3 alerts cause half the nights, nobody would get killed.  The seventh and my last game so far, then introduced me to the role of the jailor. I didn't last very long, got killed in night two, missed the icon to take someone with me in night one. I still enjoyed it very much.  The people I met were surprisingly mature and also had a decent spelling, something you can barely see in some communities and not once did I feel unskilled or scared of failure. Failure is fun, it's amazing to see how it all plays out.  And I don't really have any complaints either. Every role is explained by some boxes on screen, there was no time where I thought 'Oh gosh, what am I doing?' The nights nobody attacked anyone made the game longer, sure, but those few minutes? Oh Please! I'm very patient.  If you're a fan of tabletop games that are like this game, e.g. One Night - Ultimate Werewolf, I can recommend this very much. It may seem silly but that sort of Tabletop game is something you need at the very least 6 people to play and have it be fun. Here? you can avoid the player count entirely because it's online!  Now that I think about it, I do have one complaint. I can't seem to stop playing. Heh~!  Yeah, this game is a fun title and I can recommend it to you. If you need numbers, here are some: 13 92 46 85.  And here are some of the other aspects I may have missed:  Sound: Nice Menu OST, but a tad loud, crank it down to 1% Volume and it'll be alright.  Graphics: You can see those in the videos and screenshots provided, Character models don't influence gameplay,  feel free to buy some for the looks if you want, but ultimately it doesn't change anything.   Gameplay: If you like the idea behind it, you'll love this game. That's all.  Community: Seems decent, except for a few lonely trolls who can usually be seen cursing and disconnecting, nothing worth mentioning. If someone goes on about it being their first time and that they don't get anything in the ingame chat? Most likely Jesters wanting to be executed, no trolls or griefers. Yeah, the community isn't abusive but half the time they are incredibly thick, could be frustrating if you play to win. I play for fun and guess what: That it is!  Overall (aka, the bit you skip to if this is TL, DR): I love it. I recommend it. That's it.  Edit:  After 20 Hours of playtime it's STILL fun! Take that as you wish.",

I have a far healthier relationship with this game now, and I believe I am better qualified to talk about it and its flaws.  This is without question my second most played game on Steam beating out other games like Skyrim, Mass Effect, Garry's Mod, Civ 5, Borderlands 2, Crusader Kings 2... the only thing I have played more is Team Fortress 2.  Town of Salem is a 15-player version of Mafia/Werewolf. It pits multiple teams and factions against each other to determine the victor, and unlike some of the more common versions of Mafia that you might play in real life with friends, EVERYONE has a specific power to get information, remove information or more generally influence the game. There is no one who is 'just a Townie' and that is perhaps my favorite part on this take of the game.  The second big twist is that there can be multiple bad guys who are competing against each other. It's not always just 'large group of innocents who don't know who everyone is Vs. small group of bad guys who know who everyone is.'  All of the different roles make any given game different from any other, but I've found that most of the fun in the game depends on the other players. A single jerk can utterly ruin a game as they deliberately draw attention away from gameplay and force the townies to waste time policing them instead of playing the game - this is made complicated by the fact that there are roles like the Jester and Executioner that take advantage of such behavior! Or a faction like Town, Mafia or Vampires can be utterly cripples beyond any hope of winning if a lot of players leave the game at once. There are penalities to discourage such behavior but that doesn't always make a difference.  All of this being said, you may wonder why such a variable game that is dependant on other people not being horrible wastes-of-space is getting a recommendation from me.  Well, what other game can you win as a Serial Killer named 'Cannot Lie' when you tell everyone from the get-go exactly what you're going to do, when you're going to do it...and they think you're just a really good Jester?

As a person who suffers from depression, this game has made an amazing impact on my life and so has it's wonderful community. However I obviously have to be honest when reviewing this game so here is the actual review.  Game mechanics are great, and work for the game. It clearly doesn't try to be something that it simply isn't. Graphics are pretty good and it even runs on my crappy laptop. It is fairly balanced is quite a bit of fun if you play on custom mode and associate yourself with people.  Now here comes the issues I have with it. I admit this game is pretty good considering how few of people are working on it, with this said I feel a few adjustments could be made. The graphics are great, however I feel there could be obvious improvement made to them (less like Minecraft preferably). The game is fairly balanced but the Vigilante is a bit underwhelming and at the very least should be able to defy night immunity. Next off is a small issue with the community. Cursing and spam is rather overwhelming in the game, especially for a younger audience. I of course am certainly not in that audience, but I feel there should be a way to at least limit it. The idea I had for it was to add a report bar in the lobby (though I know it will be misused for people reporting the host for... well, hosting).  Above all, this game is pretty amazing. It is worth BUYING the game rather than using the game on a browser due to the fact you get great coin benefits (In game currency)! You also support the people who make this game possible.

Town of Salem is a psychologist's wet dream. More specifically, it is the card game 'mafia' but online! With 15 people in a lobby divided between Town, Mafia, and Misc. evil roles all clamoring for different winning conditions, things get hectic. In that hectic clamor, human nature and power plays shine through in glorious fashion.  The game sports 30 distinct roles separated into different classes and alignments, most are as fun as the next. Granted, the game needs some balancing done on particular roles (Neutral killing and disguiser, specifically), but the game is PHENOMENAL at its very core. It is worth every penny. I have personally clocked about 460 hours and I'm still going strong. The devs are also looking to expand and cultivate the game, which will only make it even better.   10/10  -W&amp;H",

It's a fun game full of roles that take some getting used to game mechanics and the specific roles to fully understand.   A good game with good players is extremely enjoyable. Of course you run into a lot of people who throw matches, troll or just don't care who make some games less desirable.   The game is not very well explained. You're thrown into a game with real people with just a brief description of your role and have to figure everything else out. Ultimately it's not a big deal but I can see that being a big turn off to a lot of people.   The big draw for me is the ability to play a big party game with people and enjoy social interactions with them. Not having a whole lot of friends, this game fills that void. Also, you will end up with some real laugh out loud moments from people's reactions and how they deal with things. You'll also be left in disbelief as you totally explain to the other people how you know someone is a serial killer or in the mafia with all the evidence you have and then somehow you still end up getting lynched. Facepalm! All in good fun though.",

You have to think fast and be able to quickly adapt to game changes. Every role you can get has unique abilities, and how you play it can seriously impact your chances of winning.  I'd recommend watching a few YouTube videos before you get started, and to help you decide whether this game could be fun for you. I'd recommend the videos by Tormental.

            "review_text": "I didn't realize this game was free to play in browser until after i bought it, and to be honest I don't really care. It's worth paying money for it because you get $5 worth of the in game currency, which is purely cosmetic, in addition to faster loading times, although even in the browser version the loading times aren't bad at all. You also get to support the developers of this fantastic game. So even though this game is available for free, I really suggest supporting the developers and buying it on Steam, but maybe try it out for free if you're not sure.  Now for the actual review. I bought this game on a whim during the summer sale because it was cheap and had a pretty good approval rating. I didn't really expect to play it that much, but now it has more hours logged than any of the other games I bought during that sale. This game is super addicting, and I play a game of it almost every day. The rounds are fairly short, and usually last 15-30 minutes. If you just want a mindless game without a lot of thinking in it, or a game where you don't have to communicate with other people, then this game isn't for you. This game requires that you work with other people and strategize, deceive, and often try and mess with their heads. This does come with the downside of working with other people though, where there will be the occasional troll, and sometimes people can be fairly annoying, and offensive at times. There is a chat filter to block out some of the stuff people might find offensive, however I have noticed there are some words it doesn't block out that it probably should.  Town of Salem is pretty easy to pick up, although there is a bit of a learning curve. I was really confused my first few games, but I picked it up pretty quickly after that. While it can be pretty easy to play this after a few games, it takes quite a while to learn enough to be really good at it. You have to not only know about your own role, but you have to know about the other roles in the game as well. Knowing whether a role is town protective or town support can help weed out who's lying and who's telling the truth. I really recommend taking a look at the role list on  blankmediagames.com  to get a bit more familiar with some of the roles. There's also a bit of a learning curve in learning how to strategise and manipulate properly. My second round in this game, I was the jester, which is a role where you want to be lynched my your fellow townspeople. I claimed I was the serial killer on the first day, and it became really obvious that I was the jester. You have to think a lot about ways to manipulate the other people into doing what you want.  This game is definitley not one that was created by the developers and then left to die. This game was updated just recently, with a new role, the forger, and a bunch of new cosmetic stuff in the shop, as well as some bug fixes and a bit of a UI change. The developers also have more stuff they are planning for Town of Salem, so dont' worry about never getting anything new with this game, because the developers have shown they actually care about this game.  I could go into so much more detail with this game, it has so much depth and I've never played two games that went the same. I could talk about the pros and cons of each role and how they work, but this review is already too long, so I'll let you play the game yourself and figure it out, which really is one of the best parts of this game. I cannot recommend this game enough, everyone should at least give it a chance, especially because you can play it for free.  Pros: +Addicting +Lots of depth +You can try it for free +Easy to play, difficult to master +No two games are the same +Short rounds +Lots of strategy and thinking +Dozens if not hundreds of hours of gameplay  Cons: -People can be annoying -Confusing at first  The pros definitley outweigh the cons for Town of Salem, and I really cannot recommend this game enough. It's a brilliant and unique game that anyone can play and enjoy.  Edit: I previously had the reporting system listed as a con, however since then the reporting system has been significantly improved, allowing you to select an actual reason for reporting them and list comments. In addition, the chat filter, while still not perfect, has become considerably more humerous, switching out offensive words with words like flummery and tarnation. It automatically replaces 'You Suck' or 'X Sucks' with 'You are a great player' or 'X is a great player,' which is always funny.",

It such an obvious rehash of the arcade game but lacks roles, customization and most importantly balance the sc2 one had.   - The community is terrible - this alone has completely turned me off of the game in a little over 3 hours of play. People spam links, throw games, rage quit the first day or cheat via skype. It's actually so much worse than starcraft 2 I couldn't believe it. You can just make a free account if you get banned so there is NO incentive for this community to improve.  - The game exists for free, all you're doing by buying it on steam is purchasing gold for microtransactions (houses/character skins).

Little do they know is that among them, there is mafia, serial killers, and more. As the game progresses, more and more of the townspeople gets picked off, untill Mafia, or the serial killer, is the last men/man standing. The paticulars are these: Every person has a role. These roles include Sheriff, Jailor, Serial Killer, Godfather, and many, many more. Each of these roles has a special ability or trait: for example, the serial killer has the abilty to kill one person each night, unless they are protected by another role, such as escort. This simple mechanic of roles creates a game of lying, strategy, and tough decisions. The way you win is to basically either protect the town by killing the 'bad' teams and roles, or by picking off all of the 'good' roles. Another extremly important concept is the gallows. Every in game day, you can put a single towns member on trial. If they prove guilty, you can vote to execute them. In conclusion, this game has:     RPG aspects    Multiplayer    Strategy    Lying    Actually important roles   Even though this review has a lot, it doesn't even come close to the true fun, excitement, and glory that come from this game.",

Somtimes you get people in you lobby that just want to ♥♥♥♥ you over but other times its a deceit and enjoyable game. You can buy characters and different types of houses and pets. They even have different game mode. For example there is a russian rolette kind of mode where everyone gets a random character/type and no one will have a clue what you are. There is a mode were its just witches and veterans, that mode to me is highly entertaining :3, theres the normal mode, and there is even a hardcore mode but you have to have played the game for at least 50 hours. You can play the game online and on steam and the hours will all add up as the same hours and anything you buy will be avilable in either the steam or online version.

I have a far healthier relationship with this game now, and I believe I am better qualified to talk about it and its flaws.  This is without question my second most played game on Steam beating out other games like Skyrim, Mass Effect, Garry's Mod, Civ 5, Borderlands 2, Crusader Kings 2... the only thing I have played more is Team Fortress 2.  Town of Salem is a 15-player version of Mafia/Werewolf. It pits multiple teams and factions against each other to determine the victor, and unlike some of the more common versions of Mafia that you might play in real life with friends, EVERYONE has a specific power to get information, remove information or more generally influence the game. There is no one who is 'just a Townie' and that is perhaps my favorite part on this take of the game.  The second big twist is that there can be multiple bad guys who are competing against each other. It's not always just 'large group of innocents who don't know who everyone is Vs. small group of bad guys who know who everyone is.'  All of the different roles make any given game different from any other, but I've found that most of the fun in the game depends on the other players. A single jerk can utterly ruin a game as they deliberately draw attention away from gameplay and force the townies to waste time policing them instead of playing the game - this is made complicated by the fact that there are roles like the Jester and Executioner that take advantage of such behavior! Or a faction like Town, Mafia or Vampires can be utterly cripples beyond any hope of winning if a lot of players leave the game at once. There are penalities to discourage such behavior but that doesn't always make a difference.  All of this being said, you may wonder why such a variable game that is dependant on other people not being horrible wastes-of-space is getting a recommendation from me.  Well, what other game can you win as a Serial Killer named 'Cannot Lie' when you tell everyone from the get-go exactly what you're going to do, when you're going to do it...and they think you're just a really good Jester?

My favorite role to play is Jailor, which you choose who to jail during the day, then wait for it to become night where you talk to the target in jail, you have a option to kill them or not. but what it makes it fun is when I jailed someone later on the game and when they claimed a role that someone elsed claimed that is still alive or dead and Random Town is dead, I called them out and put a bullet in their head. It's ridiculous when they realised they messed up or they freaked the hell out.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game and still do, I recommend this game.",

The gameplay is quite balanced in terms of roles, as most of them impact the game a lot if you know what you're doing. I really disagree with the idea of scrolls though, which can be bought for ingame money (which can be bought with actual money..) to increase your chances of being that role drastically. This makes it harder to be an interesting class, but i still get mafia or serial killer quite often!  Town of Salem is a free game on the internet, which is where most people start off (and most just stay there), so i definitely suggest to give it a try",

Nothing can beat the feeling of knowing you have won!  Only he was the retributionist, he could have brought back an investigator who would have discovered the true identity of the arsonist. That night the arsonist burns the rest of the town to the ground... Guess you can't win them all?  Truely Town of Salem is one of a kind, taking the essence of mass hysteria and turning it into a fun replayable game which has you saying 'just one more round'. It combines the process of emilination you would expect from a game like cluedo and human intrigue, creating this beautiful mind game.  A good casual game to just pick up when you have a free 15 minutes or so, highly recommend if you are into psychological/investigative games.",

Now, don`t get me wrong, the whole demaret point system change almost everyone hates it, all they did was up the amount of coins you get by 4* and up the prices by 4*, and made the game more pay for perks that everyone loved which is making us all upset, frankly, I do see myself seeing a lot of people leaving because of this because of the problem in which the change has caused.    I do recommend the game, but play it once in a wail, or just not even pay attention to the town points (What ever the new currency is called) and don`t buy town points, all it is making the game devs think is that people like the change, I understand they did make the change probs due to lack of funds to the game to keep it running, but IDK if that is the reason.",

First off, the changes to currency system only really pay-gates the newest cosmetic items whilst allowing the older cosmetics to be purchable with ingame-earned currency as well as the premium currency. It doesn't affect gameplay much, except that you won't have that flashy skin that might otherwise convince people to kill you (which may or may not be a bad thing depending upon your role.)  Gameplay-wise, Town of Salem requires a sharp mind and quick thinking to master, but anyone can hop on and enjoy the feeling of choosing to make an attempt on another player's life -- or make an attempt to protect them from harm. Which role is given to you is randomly picked via a wheel-of-fortune-esque animation displaying the possibilities, and the percentage of recieving it.  I'm not especially good at describing it, but it's a fun game, but the community certainly can be immature, so I wouldn't call it a PG game due to how online interaction works. PG-13+, perhaps. Regardless, give it a shot, lose a few games, kill a few people, and have a laugh at the insanity you may experience.",

However, this recent update introduced a new currency that is a silver coin. Now town points can only be obtained through buying with real money. Nearly all if not all of the cosmetics can only be obtained with town points. This means now they are locked behind buying with real money only. Now i personally do not have an issue with that, if you need money to upkeep your game i get that. Making cosmetic items, some of them only obtained by real money is fine. You can also hide your appearance from other players as some will lynch or kill you based on your look and name. So this is not a major issue. You may be wondering why then am i downvoting if i dont have an issue with it? My reason is they made PRE EXISTING items behind the paywall, which i think is stupid. is it bad? no. But its stupid and not necessary. Had they kept stuff as it, and made some or all new items being released with that paywall i would be less frustrated. Not just that, but this type of business practive, having cool free items then saying 'nah we gonna charge you for it' Maybe they need the money, i dont know. But i dont like how they did it, and i think without real warning it just happened. That bothers me, they is not a business practice i wish to support.  However, the game is still really fun, and for 5 bucks its amazing. But i refuse to support the business practice they implemented. Even if they need the money, even if it doesnt hurt anyone. I will not support that. If you cant keep up with the cost of your game that isnt my fault, implement a different pay system, increase the game cost, make new cosmetics payed for idc, but the way they did it was not the way.",
