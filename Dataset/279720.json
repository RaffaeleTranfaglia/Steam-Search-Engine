    "description": "The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this &quot;being?&quot; deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr.",

When I have been growing up, have own Steam, and saw this game on Steam...I'm feels nostalgic a bit.   Too bad that I play this on Windows 7, everything is fine except for music problems, I don't care though. (I'm plays the musics on outside the game)  The control is able to fix, I have been trying out by myself, but you need to have some search... Yeah, it is like normally when I'm played on 10 years ago.  Well, you play as the Dragons. Fly around over the landscapes. Fight the Monsters. The humans are respect you! Also, I love the Dragons! :D  This game is totally worth for me!",

The steam store is flat out lying, this game does not contain any english audio, in fact it does not even contain any scripts to trigger cut scenes for the game to even properly start. If you directly buy this off the steam store and fire it up into a new game you will be met with a weird end game start, (You have access to end game areas right from the get go, which should not be the case). If you want to play it you will have to download a few missing files that are available on the steam fourms other wise it is in an absolute unplayable state.",

I really liked the look of it and borrowed it from him, most probably without asking first, I don't remember anymore. What I do remember however, is the fact that I absolutely loved this game.  And yeah, maybe I was stupid and not able to recognize faults in games (which this game has plenty of in gameplay, vioce-acting and many other aspects), but I would have recommended it for the sake of nostalgia alone except...it doesn't work. I sometimes get lucky and actually get to play the tutorial level before it crashes.",

It might seem to be a minor gripe but it really screws with the gameplay the dragon acts like a flying tank that cannot go backwards.  Just trust me that the controls are absolutely horrible and will sap every bit of whatever enjoyment you can squeeze out of this game.",
