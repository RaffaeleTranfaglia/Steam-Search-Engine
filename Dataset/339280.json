            "review_text": "I've played a handful of matches. As a LoL/HotS/Dota player, I know this is definitely not enough to appropriately judge any MOBA game, but these are my thoughts as a new player: If you want to play this game, you have to want to support the a game that is still iterating and that hasn't quite reached its full enjoyment potential yet.  In my matches against players and AI, none of my games have ever ended in a full 5v5 yet. One person in a game will leave, then this will be followed by the rest of the team. This makes it unenjoyable from the get go, since the team that has the greater amount of AFKs are made to play an uphill battle, and on top of that suffer rating losses for it (yes, you lose PVP rating when your team AFKs and the game ends in a defeat, even if you are the only person on your team who is still in the game. Your opponents will also gain rating for the victory even though you had no team except yourself.)  Bugs are also apparent, even in my few games played. The client has issues responding after accessing the Steam overlay in game; your game will occasionally not accept any commands except movement, and sometimes it will accept no commands at all, forcing you to hard restart the client; graphical issues exist, such as the Minerva skin from the CE package displaying an amorphous black-and-yellow blob for its Black dye texture in game despite the textures appearing appropriately on the customization screen.  For what it's worth, I genuinely like the hero design of the game's characters, but the issues with matchmaking, leavers, and game-altering bugs is severely hampering what would otherwise be a highly enjoyable game experience. For now, I am not recommending this game, as I cannot see myself continuing to play Strife if my experiences continue as they have been so far.",

            "review_text": "I played Dota 2 for 1500 hrs + so I think I am really in position to tell something about MOBA's  and I really can recommend this game, it is not that hardcore as DotA 2 is but it has the fast past combat from LoL and took some pretty much good aspects like the chicken (curier) from Dota and put it in to it. Well, I really like it and played the first time today. I just wanted to play like one short match to find out how it works and 6 hours later I still played Strife.. it might not be everybodys favour because it got that colourful comicstyle wich is not loved by everybody and if you played DotA 2 it will look a bit childish next to it but the fights are very funny and the matchmaking finds a match in like 10 seconds.. I really enjoy it, it is a lot easier then DotA 2 but still you can do a lot strategic stuff, like capture some towers in the jungle to gain temporary sight on that spot, kill a Bosscreep (wich is a lot stronger then Roshan from DotA 2) and steal his big a** monkeything to push a lane extremly or open some kind of black wholes on the map, wich will spawn some stronger creeps rushing to the enemy base. That all looks pretty well so far, balancing isn't a problem too as I see it. Even the bots are playing extremly naturally, I wouldn't believe that guys are bots if I would not know it better.  Sure thing that I there are some negative aspects like some low resuluted textures or a not that big pool of heroes/champions. But hey! It is a Beta and for that is is pretty much more a game then the most free games are after release.  I really enjoy playing Strife and I won't stop! Totally recommanding it. 10/10",

Of course in the community you get those few jackasses, they are here too. The map layout is nice, and I hope in time they will update it or give variations for game play experiences. I play Dota, LOL, and Heroes of the storm. This game is much better then heroes, easier to play then Dota, not as one sided as LOL, but also lacks in areas too. Its a fun game, have fun and you won't be dissapointed.",

Strife is a new MOBA that has new MOBA mechanics in it, and it has just a different gameplay than DotA and LoL, New mechanics in it such as out of combat regeneration, bets, and items crafting makes it just a new cool MOBA.  Here i shall put PROS and CONS.  -PROS  -Has new moba mechanics, (Out of combat regen, bets, personal couriers .... ). -Has a Well graphics. -Gameplay is Fun. -Items crafting system makes the game so great, and can make game so epic if used well. -Bets are cool, these little bets in a single fight can save a life and secure a kill. -Less toxicity than any other MOBA. -All heroes, and bets, are free to play, ( Bets still need to be unlocked by in game money that you earn when you play matches ). -Game is completely not pay 2 win. -Match length is about (30-45) Mins, rarely goes for longer. -Single player is awesome, i liked it and hope it gets more episodes.  Now we get to the CONS. -No mic chat, unless you are in party. -No all chat -You pick the hero before you start the match, so no counter picking or making a plan with your team. -Has a low playerbase. -The game gets Updates so rarely. -The game has many annoying (Non-gameplay) bugs and still not fixed. -Copied some spells and items from Other MOBAS like DotA and LoL. -No wards, they are replaced with some vision points that you capture.   So these are my thoughts about the game, and i give it 7/10. Deserves a try.   *Edit: This game doesn't get updated rarely, This game is abandoned sadly.",

Strife to put it simply, a game that factors skill most of the time. Gold is put into use but usually its either to help the abilities of the certain character or to add a item ability which benefits them. The community is not really toxic, there isn't an all-chat, also haven't seen a single hacker, probably because the player-base isn't really high, but enough to find matches with others. Ah, this ain't league where you have to buy all characters, but you do have to unlock all buddies. Your little buddy guy is in you with battle, and provides passive and actives that help certain characters. Strife does have bugs, not too many but there are still bugs that are noticeable. There's a crafting system, now wait what? A MOBA with a crafting system? Doesn't do too much, but it does tweak the item of your choice to fit your play-style. Servers are a bit buggy now and then but its to be expected, Strife has dynamic in-game music, but if you're in the heat of the battle you may not notice it, which is unfortunate but it is a good game. Visuals are overall colourful, &lt;- Normal English here my friends. I'll recommend it to at least give it a try it has a different play-style and its free. Yeah...get out League.",

Score: 9.5/10 (This is seriously a masterpiece)  This is the definitive next generation MOBA. The gameplay mechanics are so on par and not only make the game more fun, but also keeps the game way less toxic compared to other MOBAs I've played in the past, such as DOTA and League.  The heroes don't feel like cookie cutter generic 'insert name and price tag here' characters. Each one looks different, sounds different, and plays different. With the huge variety in the game from all the heroes (with more to come), every match is filled with intense action, as I always have to figure out a new strategy so that my main MLG 360 Crow Scoper (a.k.a Rook) can wreck.  CSing is shared between players, so people actually work together in order for both of them to boost their CS, which is great. Kills and Assists are generally weighed the same, so supports get all the love too now. Unlike League where you've got to wait all day for your Sona to get your Ardent Censer up and running, you'll be able to get all the items you need for your support character just as you would with any other character.  Overall, the community (although somewhat small) isn't toxic at all. I've yet to come across a single toxic player throughout my matches, and I know that it says I've only played about an hour at the time of writing this, but I've invested at least 50 hours into this game before it released on Steam.  The game also rewards you for playing with 1 Gem per match, so over time you can buy a free skin or an account boost, which is a great thing that the devs did.  Wait, why the heck are you still reading this? THE GAME'S FREE. JUST DOWNLOAD IT.",

You can get 'companions' which are basically just pets that get you killed, are designed to look cute but just annoy you, and play no REAL purpose in the game. I've played Dota, it's AMAZING. The only reason I don't play Dota is because none of my friends have it. I know the Dota map. But after playing Dota I don't NEED to learn the Strife map because they just copied the esact layout. There's even the same stream running through the middle. The objective is the same. Destroy the 'Ancient' but I dn't even know what it's called in Strife.

Also, Strife talks a little bit about how they have out of battle regeneration. It's so incredibly useless, it does nothing and the cooldown is so incredibly long. You might as well just go back to base except that there's no fast way to do that. In DotA 2, you can buy a TP scroll, in League of Legends, you cand use the recall ability, in Strife, I think there's some boots you can buy that do recall, but that's really really dumb. Also, back to mentioning the issue with movement speed, this is my biggest complaint about Strife. Everybody is so god damn slow, and I seriously think that it's the same movement speed. So if you intend to do anything quickly, just play another moba. I swear, it's more worth it to uninstall this game, and go install League of Legends or something. Poopy Game/0, would not reccomend.

Pros: - All heroes are free. - Each hero has skills that are simple, so they are easy to learn within 1-2 games. - Objectives are significant, forcing team cooperation. They dont give buffs, but rather give strong pushing minions that prioritize heroes/towers. - Many more interesting active items compared to LoL. - Shared gold among allies. - Neat and balanced item crafting system (uses in-game currency which is earned easily) to customize your items. Has option for temporary crafting for reduced cost or permanent.  - Reliable minion protection: any damage, even from abilities, will cause minions to aggro onto you. And they are much more reliable than LoL's AI (where they either chase you across the whole map or only attack you once). So harass wisely. - Everyone has a personal courier to deliver items to you. - No stupid P2W rune system.  Cons: - Not all pets are free or even viable. Although each pet has unique abilities, some are simply more useful in general. Also, they are not free. In fact, it will take quite a long time just to unlock one (after about 20 games, I still haven't unlocked one.) - Lack of wards/sight items leads to easy deaths. It is very easy for people to sit in a bush and wait for you to come near. Only 1 item gives short temporary sight, but is only useful for supports. - Not visually appealing. The client is even worse: it makes the game look like it was made in 2005, when the in-game models look a little better (or I'm just imagining it). The skins cost real money, but do not seem worth it at the moment. For the most part, they are just expensive recolorings.  Subjective: - Regen system allows you to regenerate HP/Mana while out of combat. This usually leads to one partner sitting back to regen while the other partner kills minions. May be frustrating to see enemies heal up after expending all your mana on harassing them. - Matchmaking system is automated. You select your hero and it will match you up with a team (there is no hero pick lobby). This may seem odd at first since you cannot choose your carries and what-not. Personally, I see no problem because the game makes it so anyone can fit a role, really. Someone can play support, but also wreck as a mage. Someone can play tank or bruiser or assassin. And so on. Also, I like it because I can literally leave for a while until a match is found rather than be forced to click a 'I'm here.' button.",

It's not that it's casual, it's that it's super easy to get into and some of the mechanics are designed to remove toxicity between players.   Pros -Easier to learn than MOBA's like LoL and Dota 2 -Gold earned through last hits is split between players. This and other mechanics help reduce toxicity in game between teamates. -Really polished for Beta -Art style, and story world have a pixar feel, with a little darkness. -New twists with neturals on the map like Baldr and Cindara and the white ape. -Pets, that's right! You can have pets that further allow you to customize the way you play. It adds abilities and attributes to your hero.  Cons (Keep in mind, it's still in beta as of the time I'm writing this review 6/8/2015) -Limited number of heroes -Heroes could differentiate themselves better with their abilites. Some heroes feel the same as far as gameplay is concerned. -'Ultimate' abilities could use a little more Ultimate-feeling to them.

WRONG!!) this was an obvious cash grab and utterly useless in game, crafting something makes you items cost 3x the price for a little extra passive like increased gold from assists. game starts of slow in more ways than one by this I mean technically and literally   THINGS I LIKED  It had a story mode which is okay a little childish but still ok the idea and concepts behind this game (everything looks good on paper though) to bad they didn't deliver.  This game has the potential to be one of the greatest MOBA's of all time but you people persist to create stupidity and not consider the situations you are placing your players in. I was just in a game of bots with new players (of course) and they were doing stupid things made the game last beyond an hour!!! they fed, they gave Krytos to enemy, all the usual scrub stuff and all this was acceptable. What I cant forgive is that I get penalised for leaving such a game.  #1  its a freaking game of bots why do I get penalised for leaving (once again its bots not the LCS)  #2  its a game of bots designed for new players veteran MOBA players are going to find problems playing with those who don't even know the basics of this genre but wish to learn the ins and outs of strife but if YOU LEAVE GOD FORBID they'll penalise you SERIOUSLY? #3 what gives you guys as content creators the right to basically hold us under duress and make us tolerate bad players. other game modes you suggest? well I don't know about you guys but I use bots as a learning material for new champs or new builds (been this way since DOTA 1)  #4  and finally we get to the kicker the biggest part of any MOBA game for me anyway is the character design and I cant find one original character to relate with there is a bad version of Jinx, Wukong, Garen and even Udyr Soraka ummm lady fortune so you seeing the pattern here? this game was designed (in my opinion) to be a better version of LoL but it ended up being a thousand times worse YH! you guys got rid of the toxic community and replaced it with a bunch of mutes SERIOUSLY no one communicates. so I ask you whats worse toxic community or NO COMMUNICATION? me? ill take the toxic abuse any day least I know that, that ♥♥♥♥♥y ADC is going to enter team fights together.  FINAL NOTE: yes I understand this game is still in BETA but that is no excuse if they have time to create new heroes and new items and updates to things that didn't really need it and not fix the major problems it says one thing to me and that's this ~WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE BUY OUR MICROTRANSACTIONS BEFORE PEOPLE REALISE THAT THIS IS A CASH GRAB SCHEME AND WE HAVE TO FIND A NEW PROJECT TO MILK YOU GUYS WITH~ this game will probably never leave BETA stage and I suggest not downloading it.",

You let people play it for free then charge 10$ for a skin so you can make your money. Everyone wants to make their Mortal Kombat to LoL and Dota's Street Fighter and Tekken. I even respect the desire to create as toxic free an environment as possible. I'm not sure how limiting chat does that. So instead of both teams being able to ♥♥♥♥♥ at you only yours can now? Kudos on the effort though.  But all the other bronze place MOBAs have something unique to them. Smite has the third person view making it feel faster. Heroes has the multiple maps to prevent stagnation and lack of gold and shared EXP to promote teamplay rather than solo achievements. Infinite Crisis you get the DC name brand to play with. Strife gives you nothing. Oh sure the little critter to deliver you items and better regen at towers is nice but is that your big ace in the hole? Staying in lane indefinitely? Your personal pet is just the summoner spell from LoL so thats nothing new. The crafting system? So the Strife version of Static Shiv has you buy three other items to build into it if you can't buy it immediately but doesn't LoL have you do the same letting you build up with Zeal and Avaric Blade?  As you can see by the hours logged I didn't play it very long. I did like four or five games and couldn't stand it. And not because the players were worse than Bronze LoL tier or every game had disconnecting team members (one of my games was 2 v 5 very early in). No, Strife felt like an elaborate reskin of League. I'm looking around going, 'There's Miss Fortune...there's Wukong...there's Garen...' Movesets were fairly similar as well. Like the Wukong clone in Strife for example. Instead of an attack modifier that reduces armor his attack modifier speeds him up (like Wukongs W). Wukongs gap closer hits three targets where Gokong hits whoever is in the hitbox. Instead of the clone sitting stil like with Wukong, Gokong's go out and attack people. And finally instead of a 'spin to win' move doing an aoe knockup Gokong's does an aoe knock back. If Riot were to do an update on Wukong and redo his kit it would be easy for them to accidentally make the same kit as Gokong.  Bottom line there is nothing about Strife that stands out. However pure the developer's intentions to create as toxic free a MOBA as possible that can cater to both casuals and hardcore alike it feels like nothing more than another company trying to get a quick buck from the most imbalanced form of competitive gaming.

I think that could be somewhat true but I feel as if the creators were inspired by the two and many more mobas, and bringing the best out of them into one game.  Strife features an 'out of combat regen' mechanic. Many players enjoy this aspect of the game while others are against it. Many who are against the idea say that it makes poking your opponents pointless. While this may seem true, it really isn't. Yes, you do have a significant amount of regen out of combat, but the catch is, you can't farm while you do. This allows the opposing team to zone you and your teammate (if you have one) from farming. Plus taking damage from any source inturrupts the regen.   I know this is a fairly short review, and mainly on one thing, but all around very good game. Keep up the good work S2 games. :)",

            "review_text": "I'm gonna have to say 'No' for now.   The game is really relaxing, and definitely a nice break from all the stress of other MOBAs. I like how the music changes whether you're in a teamfight or not, it's a really nice touch. A lot of the characters have really cool kits that you probably won't see anywhere else. The item crafting is a neat idea, allowing you to make items for a specific character. The pets are also a nice concept, basically a Summoner Spell, but as you Rank Up by playing games, your pets gets additional spells, some are really cool, some are just underwhelming. Everyone gets a courier, and after you stay put of combat for a bit your Health and Mana start recovering at a rapid rate, so it's not necessary to back.   The characters themselves are all really charming. For instance, a robot made from an old slot machine with a gambling AND smoking problem, named Bandito. And every character says their own unique lines when killing someone, under turret attack, taking big amounts of damage, survivng with a low amount of HP, out of mana, when an ability is on cooldown, and even a global emote they say when they multikills with each stage of multikill having their own line. All this just makes playing your favorite character that much better.  The reason I don't recommend this game: There's a lot of leavers. I had played 3 Vs. AI games, 1st game had 1 leaver, 2nd game had 3 leavers. And the 3rd game was special. it put me into a game with only Bots because no one else queued up. And when I tried leaving the game, it gave me a warning, but since it was only a Bots I thought it was fine. But when I left I got a Strike on my account, and was unable to join a game for 30 minutes. For leaving a Bot only game.  So I really only recommend this if you're playing with friends, who won't leave your games.",
