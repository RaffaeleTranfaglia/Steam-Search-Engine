I've turned off most of the help, like the guide line and steering assist, but still...In Forza that wouldn't be a problem. I usually find the guide line distracting. MotoGP 15 is a lot of fun. I appreciate the difficulty, I love motorcycle racing, the graphics are good, and I dont have anything to complain about. Especially at $10. If you want a game that's built around letting you win, skip this one. Otherwise gruel on.",
