            "review_text": "I am not much of a game player, but have always been interested in the shipping business and business simulation. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed playing this game. Some people will enjoy the docking of the vessels in the various harbors. As you gain experience you will be able to get to and from the dock faster. Some ports are extremely easy (Lisbon), and others, quite challenging (get one of the larger boats in and out of Vancouver). So people looking for a game that builds your skills handling various ships you will likely enjoy this.  There may be some small issues with the underlying rules. For example, was surprised I could pickup cargo from NY for Havana. Suspect that isn't a realistic route.--more likely such goods travel to an intermediate port first (like Halifax). Also, not totally sure the rules follow the Jones Act. But one can really spend time figuring out how to keep the vessels as loaded as possible, and efficiently moving the most TEUs for the most money. I didn't like it when my ships had less than 50% of the capacity in use at any one time. I found this more challenging then moving the boats around, and therefore I would sometimes just let the game dock the ship to save time even though it negatively affected my reputation.  Again, not a gamer, but surprised how much time I have spent playing and enjoying this game. If you like simulations, you'll probably find this entertaining, if not informative. ",

There seems to be a wealth of official and unofficial game remakes recently and I definately feel we are encountering another golden age of PC gaming. This game is unofficially similar to the old DOS game 'Ports of Call'. Even though I did find the storyline a bit weak, and the gameplay slightly tedious towards the end I still really enjoyed this game which I completed in under 20 hours in Normal mode. I may well attempt the game at hard level or try playing it with an erection at some point. I am hoping that perhaps add ons or a follow up game will be released to improve the game, but if you have fond memories of POC I am sure you will enjoy this.",

Another big issue, what to do with money? My account grows to 10 billion and I have no idea where to invest.

If you want something where your actions have direct consequences on global markets or you want to mercilessly drive your competition out of business, play the Partrician/Port Royale series, or get Ocean Trader, it's ancient, but an actual simulation.  TransOcean doesn't let you automate anything, everything is based upon one time contracts, you have to micromanage every sincle ship, which in the beginning makes you fast-forward a lot and later, with several ships, stops the game everytime a ship docks at a port. If a shipping company would actually work like this, they'd be broker faster than you can say 'Panamax'.  Still, for some reason, I haven't been able to pull myself away from it. It's not great, but it is enjoyable.",

And if you don't want to do the pointless docking minigame every time one of your ships enters a harbour you have to pay some of your revenue. And you want to skip it because it is completely unnecessary.   The Tutorial is alright, though the boss lady takes lots of your revenue all the time, and hands you contracts that you simply can not fulfill in time because you can't afford the necessary ships yet.  Probably I'm doing something wrong but playing on easy that seemed a bit unfair that I would've needed to buy ships that cost 60 million when I only just could afford a ship that cost 20.  And then there are these long-time contracts. They seem like they're supposed to bring in a slow but steady stream of revenue, but why can't I just simply automate my ships to do those for me?  Overall a bit meh.",

            "review_text": "Recommended overall if on sale, with some caveats.  I liked this game a great deal overall, despite the criticism I'm about to give it. It's been good value and good fun for me. Read on to see if it's for you.  This is a Tycoon game, not at all an accurate ship simulator. It's really more logistics oriented, and the financial aspects are weak. The simplistic mini-game of docking ships helps break the tedium, especially early on, but itself becomes tedious, particularly due to the lengthy loading times. I had no difficulties with the mini-game and I am decidedly not a twitch fast reflexes gamer. That said, casual or older gamers might not like the ship docking mini-game; fortunately it can mostly be skipped at the cost of some revenue. As the game progresses you'll likely be skipping it more and more.  I'd like to say it accurately depicts running a shipping company, but it really doesn't. The financial side of the game is incredibly weak and simplistic, with poor tools (no concept of a balance sheet or even a proper income statement, and some very strange criteria for a successful quarter. (e.g. there's an effort to calculate return on investment, but little concept of the passage of time, so back-loaded heavy ship purchases make your quarter 'unsuccessful' and you lose reputation.)  That said, the logistics (while simplistic compared to a genuine shipping company) are a nice thing, and piecing together company contracts and profitable semi-sustainable routes can be enjoyable for those who like that kind of thing.  Random events can be pretty irritating with wildly disproportionate penalties. More frequent cargo inspections with lower penalties would make more sense from a gaming perspective; as it is, the user is just tempted to reload when a potentially company-destroying penalty is applied randomly every couple of hours.  A couple of major downsides: some have reported major bugs, particularly in late game. While I've not yet encountered game-destroying bugs, I have encountered extreme slowdowns in the interface later in the game, especially with several ships in port. These lead me to suspect the coding to handle shipping consignments is at best weak and poorly optimized.  The final negative point is this, and why I cannot recommend paying full price. It's a quite good game for the first little bit, but the endgame feels very rough and unfinished. The tools to manage a large group of ships (50+) are quite poor, and the developers have indicated they are focusing all efforts on a version 2. At this point the game is more-or-less abandoned. This doesn't mean it's not worth buying; it does mean I don't believe its worth paying full price even if you love tycoon/financial/business games.  TL;DR: Good if on sale and you like tycoon/financial games. Seems rough and unfinished late in the game. Very enjoyable for what it is.",

            "review_text": "Pros - Great economy system - Impressive amounts of ships - Great Casual game if you don't want to pay much attentio to what you're doing, and can be an amazing in-depth game if you want to plan out every job with how much the fuel costs and maintenance compared to the payout - Even has a feature of taking illegal jobs which pay much better, but there is always the off chance that you're boat is checked by customs (I have yet to have been caught) - I love how hard you have to work to get to the next level of ships; to be able to sail the next biggest ship is just so gripping - I have yet to find a bug  Cons - Multiplayer is pretty much useless, the only thing it does is change the price of gas based on who goes to what ports, which creates a multitude of useless notifications on the side that I would forfit the feature just to get rid of - The docking system gets very boring and time-consuming. If you just want to play it as a econ sim then you can skip it for a very small fee - Reputation system is a useless addition - Can be grindy  Conclusion (tl;dr) A truely excellent economic simulation game, may be boring to those not interested in simulation games (if you found rct and the older simcities compelling, you will like this game) 8.5/10",

The world map scrolls with the mouse wheel when the Fuel Price list is open, it gets really annoying. It would be cool to be able to see the status of repair for ships in the List of Ships menu, maybe with a mouseover.

You can get contracts which give you a certain amount of money when you finish them, but it's usually a hasle to re-route all your ships to these docks. Plus sometimes these docks are too small for your ships so onlly your smaller ♥♥♥♥♥ier ships can go which get f'ing annoying and take forever.   Then there are the big contracts whenever you rank up, you'll get 2 or 3 and you can fail them and it doesn't matter. Then on the 3rd or 4th you'll get a mandatory one. If you don't fulfill that one it's game over which I was getting bored with this game and I didn't read this fact. So game over... I don't understand this mechanic... It should of been quite clear with a secondary warning if this kind of thing is implemented.   I won't be going back to this game, nor will I be recommending it to anyone. It's really basic, The mini game of docking is not fun and is very repetitive.    I got 15 hrs out of it... good enough I guess but I was expecting more depth to this game.   ",

You start the game, buy a ship at your home port and select one of the available contracts to ship goods across the globe. You watch a little graphic of your ship go from port to port and when you dock at the other end you earn your money (or not as the case may be), sound fun? Well I hope so because you're going to do that thousands and thousands of times. You buy more ships and bigger ships and upgrade ships to carry different cargo but it all boils down to selecting contracts, sending your ship to sea and watching the moeny roll in.
