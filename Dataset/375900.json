            "review_text": "Note: If your biggest problem with TrackMania Turbo is the Uplay implementation, stop reading now. I'm not a fan either, but this review will do nothing to challenge your opinion.  And so we begin...  Read through the negative reviews and you'll begin to see a pattern emerge. A depressing, banal pattern. A group of people so deeply ingrained into their own cosy society they fail to see the forest for the trees.  TrackMania Turbo does not let you customise your avatar. Shocker! Nor does it let you customise your car, your name, your horn or your server. I mean, strictly speaking, it does let you customise three of those things, but not in the same way its predecessor, TrackMania 2 did. You'll unlock new skins and stickers as you progress through the game, and hosting a multiplayer session supplies you with more or less all of the options you'd reasonably expect from a game of this type. Happy times, right?  But wait. This isn't good enough for the snivelling elite. 'Why can't I choose my OWN avatar?' they cry. 'What if I want to assault players' ears with some Katy Perry while they drive?', 'Why am I unable to smear their screens with ugly and pointless UI elements, just so I can enjoy a modest sense of authority?'. The previous TrackMania game was undoubtedly far more open in terms of customisation. The reality is, however, that most of it was trash. I'm sorry, but custom horns and car skins are NOT that exciting and the majority of private servers looked as though someone had just eaten a phone book and promptly thrown up over the screen. Enough of that bullcrap about consoles dumbing down PC games, TrackMania was in desperate need of a clean up.   And that's precisely what Nadeo have done. They've scraped off the scum and revealed a sparkling core underneath. Let me describe said core.  Put simply, TrackMania can be described as a hotlap racer. The aim of the game is not to outwit your opponents in a head-to-head battle, but to master the track. This goal is enforced by the fact you're not actually able to collide with other cars at all. In both single player and online, other racers are essentially ghosts, forming vague representations of your opponents and their efforts to set low lap times. To put it simply, your biggest enemy is yourself. You'll repeat tracks over and over in quick succession, tapping the reset/restart buttons whenever the slightest mistake is made and slowly but surely, edging your way ever closer to perfection. Once you complete a lap (or several, in multilap events) your time will be awarded and your position displayed; bronze, silver or gold in single player and your rank versus other players in online matches. Then you'll hit the restart button for the thousandth time, because you know you can do better.  In many racing games, this style of play could rightfully be considered dull, but not here. You've probably noticed via the promotional material that TrackMania tracks are out of this world cer-ay-zay. Drifting? Check. Blistering high speeds? You got it. Twists, loops, ramps, quarter pipes, magnetic tracks, jumps, wall rides and nail-biting close calls with brick walls? Par for the course, my friend! This is the true essence of TrackMania. The beating heart. The reason you came. And the same can be said for all TrackMania games. They're fantastic. The single thread that runs through the series, the one unifying theme that ties the franchise together... is the track design and the ability to create your own tracks. That hasn't gone anywhere. It's present in TrackMania Turbo and quite possibly better than ever.   On the subject of unity, another point of contention seems to be the apparent separation of the player base. This is probably going to come across as patronising, but... yeah, that's kind of the nature of sequels. The general idea is that most players switch over, new players join and only a few stragglers are left behind. If you really want to whine about separation, direct it at the previous game. You know, the one that split each environment into individual releases. The truth is that TrackMania Turbo has done more to fix the separation issue than it has to worsen it. The more people move forward and pick it up, the more unified the community will be.  Now, I'm not saying this is a flawless game. I have a modest, slowly growing list of issues I'd like to see addressed with a patch, but I had a list for the previous game too. A fairly sizeable list, if I'm honest. However, stepping back, taking a look at what really matters and focusing your attention on those central suppliers of enjoyment is all it takes to prove that ALL TrackMania titles are games worth playing. TrackMania Turbo being no exception.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR: In any case, the game is highly recommended. The gameplay remained the same and has even been improved in some aspects, while some restrictions have been applied that ultimately don't make the game less fun, no matter how much the community may want to tell you otherwise. The new of the four enviroments, Lagoon, is awesome. Simply said, it is a streamlined trackmania game that kept all the fun parts and threw out the unnecessary ones - like lean meat that is still delicious. Don't listen to the others, buy it if you are interested in Trackmania.  Long version:  I must say, I am very disappointed. No, not in the game - in the reviews.  I should first say that I have been playing trackmania for a long time - since around 2008, both online and offline, on LAN's and even one tournament.  There are a lot of 'supposedly' Trackmania-Veterans giving reviews here, thumbing the game down. They say that it sucks that the game has a lot less costumization compared to the other Trackmania games. They say it sucks that there are no dedicated servers. They say it sucks that the limit is now 100 players per server. They say that because of all of those reasons, it is a bad game. None of those reasons, none of those reviews, talk about the game itself. Why? It is great. And that the customization is gone is so bad?  I say, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This was never what made Trackmania a great game. Sure, it was neat to customize your name and car in great detail, import new models, honks and even SFX, track graphics - all of that is gone now. And it has a reason it is gone - this is not supposed to be a successor to the old Trackmania games. It is it's own game, simply because it got a console release at the same time - it isn't connected to Maniaplanet, so that means a new community will form that is supposed to span consoles too.  Yes, it sucks that a lot of community features are gone, but what does it matter? What makes Trackmania great - always has and always will - is the GAMEPLAY. And the gameplay is top notch. Racing online or offline is fun, fast, fluid and feels even more improved than it already has in the previous trackmania games. The trackbuilder is as varied and versatile as ever, allowing you to make some great creations and upload them for everyone to play. 4 Enviroments are there - Canyon, Valley, Lagoon and Stadium, all with different properties that require you to learn them and, even more than that, learn how your car behaves. The game is - simply - fun. Online play, even without dedicated servers, is still great - especially if you go to a server that plays random maps (the random trackbuilder isn't that great most of the time but it does provide some laughs and - most importantly - a somewhat even playing field. Still, Trackmania is and always has been about skill no matter what.) All of these negative reviews drive people away from what would otherwise be a great game - just because of Uplay and because the customization is largely gone? (You can still choose how your car looks and the choices aren't even that bad - the more gold medals you unlock, the more choices you have.)  And this is what is funny to me. For years now Trackmania-Veterans have complained about the lack of players. They wanted a game that could bring new people into the trackmania series and provide them with an entry point, considering that most of the other Trackmania games have been seperately sold based on enviroment, aside from United (Trackmania Valley, Trackmania Canyon...). THIS GAME IS AN ENTRY POINT. And what do they reply? 'Oh no, it is too dumbed down, so much stuff is missing bla bla bla' Stuff that only matters to someone who DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TRACKMANIA IS ABOUT. In the process, they drive players away. And then they start complaining again, about how Trackmania doesn't have enough players.  This is a great game. Buy it. If you are new to Trackmania, you will love it and I urge you to also try the older games. If you are a veteran, buy it anyway. A lot of the customization is gone and the game as a whole feels more streamlined - but THAT IS OKAY. It is not supposed to be a successor to the PC-trackmanias. It is it's own game. And what made trackmania great, the gameplay, the fast and fluid racing, the surprising courses by the community - all that is there and it looks better than ever. All that has changed is that you can't assault people with customized 'Let the bodies hit the floor' Honks or race around with your ♥♥♥♥ing Hatsune-Miku painted car. If this is all that ever mattered to the community, then well - maybe this community isn't as welcoming as they would always want to be. But this is it's own game, it's own community. It is up to you to shape it to become less elitist than the old one.  It does everything it needs to well. The only negative point I can see is Uplay and even so - Uplay isn't as bad as a lot of people may want you to believe, though I do agree it is useless in this context, considering this game is sold on Steam. And while I do not absolutely love Uplay - let's be honest, it is okay. Just okay though.",

But apart from that, the game is lacking so many features compared to previous Trackmania games on PC that I cannot recommend it. In particular, community-related things are almost gone, while this was one of the strengths of the series.  Worse, the game developers are banning people who express a negative opinion on their forums, preventing any honest discussion. So if you are going to buy this game you'd better like it, do not dissent or you might find yourself banned!",

            "review_text": "First impressions:  It's an incomplete (very basic) TM2 with nicer graphics and sound.   New environment is not that great, feels like Valley, but it's a bit better IMO. It's not even close to as good as Stadium or Canyon.  Definitely not worth AAA money. Get it on sale.  14 hours in:  I hate Valley with a passion. Controlling the car on dirt is really difficult and most of the time you are fighting the car, not the track. When you initiate a turn it jerks a lot, and it's really difficult to straighten it up and keep it on the line you want.   The multiplayer aspect of the game became boring really quickly, because the populated servers host the same campaign maps over and over, that are not that great anyway.  The custom maps are available through a 'Worldwide Challenges' menu where you can find a list of tracks that are built by other people. I haven't tried it out yet, but I have a hunch that the good maps will be burried deep in piles of amateur ... stuff.  Going to the campaign, I played up to track #96 and got gold on all so far. The campaign has some nice and fun tracks, but I'd say most of them are average and forgettable so far.  What really turns me off in the campaign is the fact that you need to play all environments to advance to the next difficulty level. This meant that instead of playing environments that I love I spent most of the time trying to beat Valley maps. I did insist to get gold on all of them because I thought maybe I hate Valley because I suck at it. I didn't find the fun in it so far, and I am ready to give up.  Regarding the pathetic argument that this game was made for consoles and we should give it some slack.. Ha! They can do whatever they want on consoles, but I was sold a PC game for 40 euro and I am reviewing it like it is. There are other PC games out there that give you a lot more value for less than 40 euro.",

            "review_text": "I have very mixed feelings about this.  I did some reading of reviews. I did my own testing. Both solo, multiplayer (very little) and local multi with friends. Like many I played since the very first TM, and the Turbo was an early purchase because i knew it would be fun and refreshing.  First of all, please stop with these '1hour played' and 'i want a refund'. The reasons given are not important enough, it's all tiny ones that'll be fix soon. It's been the same people making the game since the very first, and i have hope they will listen to us and provide fixes and solutions. I've been reading a lot of complains about controls, i had none. But i understand it can be frustrating not to be able to customize them. Horn? I didn't notice, but indeed it should be an easy fix. Two cameras ? Yeah... that could be improved as well!! All these things are very minors though, and could be fixed in one single patch.  Quick note about local multiplayer. Because from the video i had hope of having a new micro machine type of game... no it's not. It's quickly messy, and if a players skill are too different, the game won't be fun anymore. Unlike the solo campaign, you can't have any sort of continuity in the game such as 'next track', and you have each time to exit and select a new track... simple stuff to fix !! The two players in one car is original and fun. But afterall, we ended up playing hot seat. One after the other to have the whole screen for ourselves.  Something else now that i haven't been reading anywhere, is the gameplay itself. We now have 4 environnements to play with, each with different cars and roads and grips. They are fun to drive, and the small differences between them makes it interesting. But. To be honest, they all pretty much very similar and come to handling high speed. There is no more of that technique you could find in the first one, with the snow level for example or the mediterranean one; where the challenge wasn't so much the speed and fast tracks but more towards the specificity of how the car was behaving. And now i feel like all the different cars have come to the same thing: too much speed. Maybe it's what made the game famous and fun, but i think they should have put a slower one in the middle to have some variations in gameplay, and more challenges for gamers. See my picture profile ? I need glasses and i'm getting too old for such speed!  Ah anyway, in summary:  PROS: - Lot of content in Solo - Inifinite content thanks to editor - multiplayer looks stable - interface is simple and nice to use - nice to have split screen - funny and interesting two drivers seat - sound, atmosphere &amp; graphics  CONS: - lack of variations in gameplay between cars. They're fun to drive, but repetitive - messy one-screen mode micromachine-like - local multi lacking of queue/playlist option - No horn they said - uplay... :( (although it's fairly straight forward and not annoying too much)  If they'd fix all the little annoyance, the game would be perfectly recommendable. In any case, i'll keep playing and beat times against friends, and see how bad i am in my hometown ranking :)  Have a good one",

If you ever liked the customizability of previous installments in the series, or the convenience of the track editor, just buy TrackMania 2 instead.  After trying to get accustomed to the track editor for 30 minutes, I gave up, because I'd be faster creating a track if I had to place each block by writing the code for it in assembly.  Also, the random track generator is absolutely useless. Its results suck, and it doesn't seem to have any intelligent design programmed in at all.  The one positive thing I can say is that the UI looks gorgeous. Should you buy this game though? No.  EDIT: I found out the classic track editor is in the game, just a bit hidden. By moving the cursor to the top-right in the editor you can switch - I'm not sure why they wouldn't just make it the default, or at least let you choose it in the menu where you choose which editor you want.  This brings every trackbuilder's experience with this game up by a lot, given how much more convenient it is to use. However, you will still be underwhelmed with the lack of customizability if you've been used to older TM games, so I still recommend waiting for Lagoon to be released on TM2 over getting this game.",

The graphics are good enough.  I have played most of the Trackmania games from the very beginning. And the main issue with the games is that they can't get the car handling right. I want the car handling in games to be realistic or fun. Trackmania has only succeded with the formel 1 car in Stadium. In Stadium it's great fun while the other modes are boring.

            "review_text": "Trackmania Turbo is fun, I'll keep it that simple. But there's something that needs to be made clear:  This game is not made for creative players who enjoy getting the best out of trackmania. This game is made for the more casual side of players who want nothing more than pure gameplay. If you want a larger range of customization (car, map and replay-wise), more community focused events on anything Trackmania, you should get (one of) the individual trackmania² environments, or Trackmania Nations/United. If you're here for racing on all environments into one, simply beating times and having a mere joy on several maps. This game might be the one for you.   Trackmania's latest installment has a change of focus when it comes to customization. Instead of giving the player the full capability of being creative with their car, the player has a limited customization range which he or she has to unlock through playing the campaign. This is rather disappointing to the people who enjoy the change of car models, skins and horns (not in this game) at an instant. On the bright side however, for players who do not care so much about this: everyone will have their paintwork visible to each other. You won't have to worry about witnessing a grey skin of someone's car, because there is no issue with temporarily downloading the skin from every player on a server. This new feature of unlocking customization items also heavily improves the joy of the campaign map. There's actually something to achieve now, rather than just a good time.  Trackmania Turbo's offers what they call 'semi-dedicated servers': players host their own lobby, but the lobby is hosted through the servers of Ubisoft. This is bad, but not too bad. On launch day I noticed quite a painful delay in button pressing. I've tried to reset my car on some online servers, to have nothing happen. Then after pressing 5 times in a row, I was launched back to the start, to notice the countdown stuck on 2 for a short while. This would probably not have happened if the servers were all purely dedicated, or I shouldn't have played on launch, but the fact that people can still launch a lobby from a list of games where a hundred people can join at once is still pretty okay in my book.  The track editor is focused on making it easy for console, but the legacy editor is still available. Put your mouse on the gear icon and click on the legacy editor option in the dropdown menu.  The thing I hate most about the game is not having the ability to disable other cars on a map. When you're with a hundred racers, you will not be able to focus on the map when you're racing. All you can do is disable the names, which.. kinda helps? It'd would have been better to keep this ability. Hopefully they will add this in.  This game may not be worth the full price, but it's definitely a lot of fun if you can get it for 25% off. I heard the devs wanting to give Turbo owners the Lagoon environment for free. So if you want this, but also the lagoon environment. I'd give this game a shot.",

I do have positives:  - It is absolutely astonishing what they have done with the music experience - Physics very similar to previous games - Familiar environments with a cool and themed spin - Freaking Helicopter drop-ins  To the negatives: I cannot emphasise how much I want to love this game. However, I always end up frustrated and rage quiting. Granted, this is mostly due to my personal preferences not being met. That being said, I will list my grievances, and you can decide what you care about:  1. The camera that follows the cars is too 'sloppy'. Most notibly in the rally environment. the car will rotate about the vertical axis and it takes entirely too long for the camera to 'catch up'. I use the camera view to have a sense of where my car is pointed, but this doesn't work out so well when they are so loosely correlated. While still better than many games that even move the car from the middle of the screen, it is not up to par with previous games in this series.  1 1/2. I would use the in car camera, but I have a harder time getting a good feel for the extents of my car, and end up hitting things. Guess I just need to git gud.  2. The loops and walls in the stadium are translucent. I really don't understand why this is. I like to see my track while I drive on it. Plain and simple.  3. I CAN'T RE-MAP ALL OF THE INPUTS! Seriously, don't tease us with so few options. Do it as you have in every other game and let us pick which buttons we want to press for confirm, back, etc. It is quite literally the opposite in turbo as it is in EVERY OTHER TRACKMANIA GAME I PLAY. Also, it is rather misleading for it to say, 'Press A', when I need to press 'X' on my controller.   4. Can't hide or dim opponents. This one is just silly. Why would you remove this feature that has been in every other recent major release? I can hide people that are right beside me, but that doesn't mean that people 20 m ahead of me aren't just as in the way. I need to have the option! I really hate racing while I can see other people. They are just a distraction, and are only most helpful while I am learning the track.  5. WHY DO I NEED A NUMBER PAD TO PLAY DUEL? Seriously? Did they just completely forget that some people don't have those? I had to bum a friend's keyboard so that he and I could play the duel mode: Me on my controller, and he on the keyboard. I just don't understand why the arrow keys weren't supported. Or why I couldn't just re-map them easily to other keys. The customizability that use to be a staple of this game has been completely wrenched away.  6. Uplay... I don't know who asked for that  7. The only modes worth playing for me are stadium and canyon. So, I guess I'll just stop playing turbo, and go play Stadium and Canyon... Makes enough sense to me. Just wish I hadn't spent the $40 on this game.",

SIMPLY SPEAKING:: if you like Trackmania.....BUY THIS GAME!!!.......if you are still thinking about buying this game just think of Hot Wheels, with a hint of Trials and F-Zero.......how does that sound?!?!?!?  dont let other peoples opinion affect yours, if you like Trackmania or racing games n general, buy this game its honestly a good solid game with good controls, an easy to use editor, and UI if you come from consoles or are just a universal gamer is decent, there are 200+ levels and a random track builder if tou dont feel like being creative....its a good game.   Longer Review:  wa wa wa all the PC trackmania players are complaining about the lack of costomizations and leaderboards and other stuff stuff like FOV, etc......but just remember..........  ...........this is a PC port of a console port of a PC game so its meant to be played with a controller, as long as you have one of those you hould be good to go....so far this game its one of the funnest Trackmania games I have played, the editor in my opinion is easy to use with a controller, I feel the controls feel good and repounsive and arcady in a good way not too realistic and not too stiff, the graphics are Amazing (just dont slow down !!! lol, there are alot of levels to keep you coming back.",

Disappointing, I find that you have to work all during the game. I have purchased the game as a whole, and not one by one ...  The Level Editor is cheese. Would be nice if there's little that is worked off. For example, everything what lies beneath the soil is destroyed when filling the terrain. A grid is also missing. The selection of parts used to be better when you have entered only the number combination.  Why you can not change the settings for a route in retrospect, it is not clear.   ",

The previous installments felt a lot snappier, everything seems to have been set aside to make it look cool, at cost of the games mechanics. The effects added in the game have a very unnecessary look to them, a bit like those stereotypical Japanese ads.  The multiplayer is a joke compared to what it used to be on pc, and the singleplayer forces you to play every environment, you can't only play stadium or canyon, you would have to play valley and lagoon aswel. The customization is a total let down, creative freedom has been removed.  And finally, the single most popular part of Trackmania, the track editor/creator, had been swapped with a cluncy, downgraded, console-friendly version wich doesn't suit pc-controls in any way.  But the cherry on the top remains 'Uplay' (short for: 'U won't play long'), Ubisofts' version of Origin, not as bad.. doesn't stop it from feeling like a cancer growing in your testicals: unless you're Randy Marsh, you don't want it, you know you don't want it let alone 'need it', EVERYONE BLOODY KNOWS NOBODY WANT'S IT!

But you are forced to finish tracks to unlock other tracks. So if you don't like Valley or Lagoon (which are the worst types) you'll have a frustrating experience unlocking the Stadium &amp; Canyon maps you actually are going to enjoy.  - Game has great music, but the music resets each time you reset the track. I hope you enjoy listening to 10 second segments of songs. - They added a commentator, but he gets annoying real quick. You can disable him.  I strongly suggest to skip this title and buy a different version of Trackmania. I suggest: Trackmania 2 Canyon, Trackmania 2 Stadium and Trackmania United Forever.",
