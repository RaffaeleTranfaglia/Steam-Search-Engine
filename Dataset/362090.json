The game is very deep, there are more than 300 different creatures your character have lots of unlockable perks. The game is very addictive, i just cant stop to play it even tho that the graphic is very retro. My only problem with the game that the fighting could be a bit faster, i think this game will kill the E button on my keyboard:-)",

            "review_text": "(Update for 2.0.25) Both issues have been remedied. The new auto scrolling feature makes battles not require many clicks just to get through the messages. Very nice to see the developer responsive to feedback!   (Review as of version 2.0.19) A lot of options, tactical decisions are important. Very much open ended as you can go as far as you like.  Bonus points for fully functional demo (limited to only level 15) - I recommend trying it out to see if you like it.   Pros:  - Lots of creature, items, abilities, things to do  - simple to learn, difficult to master  - Similar to Dragon Quest Monsters  - lots of fun to try things out  - low end graphics means it is not resource hungry, most computers should be able to run it.  - Developer actively supports the game - regular patches and new content.  Cons  - (fixed with 2.0.25)Some UI issues remain - leaves a sense of button mashing in combat since some actions can result in 5 or 6 messages being generated, and you have to press a key to get past each one. (You can hold down the action key to zip through, but then you have no chance to read the messages...) - steep difficult curve. You will get wiped out occasionally. Just don't get frustrated :-) - (Fixed - can play without steam) Steam version is not DRM free (it requires Steam to run). Not a big deal unless you want to have a mobile version. Which you could get for android or iOS. Just not Windows...  I'd recommend it, but give the demo from the developer website a try first (it is DRM free) - save games from the demo are playable on the full version.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing on Android a long time and I felt compelled to come make a note - this game is really *not* like DQM/DWM, and if you're a fan of those games that's actually a great reason to buy it.  I say that because when I first saw Siralim early on, I saw the graphics (which have changed since then!) and the description and immediately though oh awesome, a procedural DQM for my tablet! This was wrong, and while I bought it after the demo end (because the demo was rather short for me), I soon became disappointed. I mean, monsters only have one ability, and you can't breed, so what the heck, right?  I came back to it later, after a few updates (there was a bug that kept crashing my game once I was around lv 18 or something anyway, so that combined with my disappointment made me put it away). I realised that my initial HEY DQM! was really not giving Siralim a fair chance. For one you can't really dominate in Siralim after a few hours like you can start to in DQM. For two, you can't just haphazardly throw things together and just expect them to work (which you can for like, 99% of the DQM content, haha). For three, fifteen levels is like a drop of ♥♥♥♥ in the ocean for this game; I'd never gotten into Nether monsters, I'd not even gotten into artifacts, much less synergizing monster teams ... I'd even considered spells absolutely useless trash, hahaha.  This game is *very* deep, and if you're looking for a quick nostalgia trip or a replacement for DQM/DWM, I think that you may be disappointed initially like I was. It's definitely a fair comparison of inspiration (monsters, randomly generated maps), but honestly while there is a good level of complexity in the old DWM games (I'm not up to date on the very newest releases), I'd have to say Siralim has a lot more depth going for it.  It also takes a lot more time to ramp up actually needing to get into that content, and it's really something that you discover by accident - it doesn't hold your hand, and things like party synergy aren't just told to you. It requires experimentation and really playing around with things to get a good feel for what works together.  Well, that or reading on the community suggestions. I have to say replacing my Minotaur Warrior with a Brim Smith (after a restart, so pretty early team) has definitely increased my win rate. ;p ",

            "review_text": "Siralim is the satanic Pokemon experience that your parents warned you about. You take control of a wizard, select one of the five magic schools to specialize in, and summon an ever-expanding team of creatures to traverse a rogue-like RPG full of retro pleasures, but also rife with rage-worthy pitfalls. Your team caps out at 6 creatures, and you lower the health of enemies to capture their cores and resummon your own creature in the comfort of your castle. Despite the obvious allusion that almost everyone will draw to Pokemon, Siralim truly is a game entirely of its own. Will it work its magic on you? Or is it completely unholy? Let’s find out as we take a deeper look at Siralim.  The controls are extremely dialed back, WASD to navigate the world and menus, E to confirm, Q to cancel. This can lead to some wonky moments when trying to sift through multiple screens to get the right piece of equipment onto the right monster, but overall it works well enough. This extremely simple control scheme allows the entire game to be played with the left hand, which is great because my right hand deserves a break. You are able to construct your own equipment to power up your monsters in battle, as well as building construction projects. These construction projects consume the same resources used to summon monsters, however they will let you travel to new realms and meet more powerful creatures to tame as your own.  Finding the correct synergy between hundreds of different creatures is hard, but necessary. Once you reach the 5th level of this infinite dungeon you’re travelling into, enemies will begin to outlevel you in a big way. Creatures need to maximize the usage of their abilities if you hope to see it through. There is an option for permadeath for the extreme masochists out there, or for the maso-curious there is an option to reincarnate a dead creature with a fraction of its former experience. I find this option extremely intrigued by this option, and for most games I end up leaving it on. Dungeons contain plenty of buffs and loot, but you also might find yourself trapped in an event fight before you’re ready. Hence why I usually leave “real” permadeath off.  Siralim is a game with a lot to love, but it also has its fair share of troubles. The sound is troubling, and replayability is hurt by the lack of differences between the magic schools. It is always nice to see how a new combination of creatures will fare in battle, but wizards should get a unique spell or something, not just a power-up to spells from their chosen school. Still, for the low price of $10, lovers of dungeon-crawlers are sure to get their money’s worth. Just restrain yourself from picking the permadeath option, and enjoy collecting them all. Siralim is a quality game, but in my opinion it needs a spot more polish to be truly great. Big thanks to Thylacine Studios for allowing IndieGameBundles to but this game through its paces. We hope to see more extremely soon!

Summary: A team-based RPG about collecting and summoning the ultimate team of monsters. Verdict: If you have an eye for RPGs or monster-taming, you’ve found your match.

            "review_text": "I looked at the game description and thought..Hmmm...is this really as good as that..? Well I can honestly say that it really is ! Dont be put off by the retro graphics. There is really so much to do in this pixel rpg. So much so that I have a great big headache. In a good way.  You start of as a very inexperienced mage commanding one creature and slowly work up to being in command of up to six creatures who fight for you in turn based battles.  The battles themselves may seem simplistic but you sometimes have to decide between attacking an enemy or attempting to steal a creature core. Steal 3 cores from the same creature and later on when you return to your castle you can create the same creature to join your ranks in your spell chamber.  All dungeons are randomly generated which includes the quests. No game will ever be the same. Also there is no level cap. All your minions level up and so do you. You can for instance be a 387th level Sorcery mage or a 2497 level life mage...(Yes I know this will probably take a very long time) you really can do this.  There are so many rescources to find to cast spells , craft items , level up gems...and probably others but I cant be bothered to mention those.  Also you can add buildings to your castle to gain new options such as an arena to fight in and an enchanter to do all gem and enchantery stuff in...ahem...any way what im trying to bloody tell ya...(Yes I know I said Bloody..I am British you know..) is buy this game...IT DESERVES YOU....  There is so much gameplay here for a measy £6.29 I feel that I have ripped of the devs. I hope they keep on adding stuff to make this the biggest rpg/beardy/weirdy game in the world !!!...yes my friends and you will have only paid a pathetic £6.29.  No I dont know the developers and im not in anyway connected with them...although on a fundamental level we are all connnected my brothers and sisters and...er....anyway I got to go and play more...I need to play this more...I must play more...must not sleep...sleep is for losers anyway.....hey is that you ron ?!!...oh sorry its my mum...anyway gotta go now for real.  10/10 Would lose myself in this gem of a game forever...  P.S On their website the devs said one of their goals was to create a game that you can play forever !!!...yes forever !..the fools I thought...dont be silly...erm well I think they were not kidding...you can play this game forever....and ever...so much stuff to tell ya but im off now to play some more...farewell for real this time.....",

Cry in terror when you realize that your unstoppable monster army has become a victim to YuGiOh levels of special effect chains by monsters that outclass you. Beaten and bruised, get stronger with a deep item creation and monster strategy, as well as some good ol' grinding.   +Lots of Monsters with excellent pixel art +Monster collection is intuitive and strategic; much less luck based then DWM +Random world generation and fixed # of battles per level is brilliant +Easy to play for hours or minutes; excellent save system. +Each monster has a special effect...eg, a certain dragon can lower an enemy's _max_ health.  +Great music +6v6 Combat with every monster having different specialties makes for some unique fights.   All in all, I'm very happy. The game feels unique, and there's tons of content as it stands today. It successfully builds upon the DWM formula with what I've found to be a ton of improvements. Great job devs, and I can easily reccommend this to anyone who likes the idea of monster collecting JRPGs. ",

            "review_text": "Imagine a classic, 8-bit RPG in the style of Dragon Warrior or the original Final Fantasy gamees, combined with elements of the creature collector/monster hunter genre, then add depth that matches or exceeds what we have come to expect from modern games.  That's Siralim.  The amount of things you can do in this game is staggering: Initially you start off as a fledgling mage-king, with only one creature at your command. As you win battles and encounter new creatures in the wild, you quickly reach a point where you can summon a second creature to fight for you. Then a third and so on, until you can summon a total of six creatures to form a fighting team.  The abilities, attributes and fighting styles of the creatures vary wildly, and the game rewards innovation and experimentation: You'll quickly learn that various combinations of creatures can amplify each other's abilities, or work in synchronicity. Some creatures specialize in heavy direct damage; others have wide-ranging attacks that can hit multiple enemies at once; some have limited offensive prowess, but severely punish enemies that attack them; others are mimics, taking on the abilities of their enemies; some can turn enemies to stone, put them to sleep, confuse them into attacking their own allies, and so on. There are others that defy categorization completely.  There are more than 300 creatures, including various types of demi-gods, angels, banshees, dragons, wyverns, giants, flying fortresses, nature aspects, hunters, unicorns, scorpions, giant sand worms, demons, elemental priests, necromancers, ethereal warriors, Lovecraftian horrors, storm incarnations, and more.  Once you've assembled your team (or teams -- you can keep as many creatures in the stable as you like), you've only just scratched the surface. There are a wide variety of 'artifacts' which function essentially as weapons and gear, with customizable enchantments, and stat attributes that can be upgraded and leveled. There are rituals, which can expand your castle and allow you to construct chambers for blacksmiths, spellcasting, enchanters, etc. There are Nether Orbs, which can be seeded with as many as 40 gems of varying types to create Nether Creatures, more powerful versions of the game's monsters. There's a Gem Temple, where those gems can be customized and tailored to the specific creature and role you have in mind.  All that, on top of various realm types, various types of quests you can pick up in the realms, special packs of powerful enemies that can be summoned with Sigils, gambling dwarves, rival mages who challenge your reign, mysterious items that can grant a range of buffs and debuffs, an emblem/token system to purchase additional items, merchant NPCs, daily quests, and an arena.  In addition, there are several hundred spell types, augments, special abilities that can be added to weapons and armor, and 'legendary' crafting materials that can grant powerful abilities to your creatures. All that, and I haven't even scratched the surface of the leveling system that allows you to upgrade your character and creatures with a wide variety of perks, skills and stat bonuses.  As of writing this review, I have 110+ hours in Siralim and I still have not explored everything the game has to offer.    PROS:   - Absolutely fantastic creature design reminiscent of old-school, classic NES roleplaying games, in all their pixelated, nostalgic glory.  - An intuitive combat system that feels familiar the instant you begin your first fight. It's just like playing Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. It's easy to pick up, difficult to master.  - Varied realm types that are much more than just different skins: Each realm type has its own quirks, items unique to that realm, destructables items that hide loot, and NPCs to encounter.  - An extraordinarily deep team system that encourages players to experiment with different creature lineups, creating endless possibilities for synchronicity and creatures/abilities that complement each other.  - Opponents that are truly crafty and difficult to deal with in the later levels. Even when your team becomes exceptionally powerful, there are points where you'll have to carefully consider your plan of attack, your defensive strategy, and the spells you cast.  - Extraordinary depth in every aspect of the game. If you're into min/maxing, experimenting with set-ups, finding new ways to accomplish goals, and coming up with your own strategies, Siralim allows you to do that.  - NPCs and dialog that have a sense of humor and wit. There are barmaids who are willing to throw themselves at you (you are the King, after all), rival mages looking to usurp your thrown, dozens of creatures walking the halls of your palace, gambling dwarves, and pet kittehs ready to greet you with a meow.  - A very friendly developer who engages with his players and is always happy to get feedback. A lot of that feedback was incorporated into game updates, and that feedback has informed design choices for the sequel. Siralim received several signficant patches and content updates that also helped smooth out the game.    Cons:   - The music is charming at first, and certainly helps with immersion and the nostalgia factor, but you will probably find that your adult ears are less tolerant of repetitive tunes than your kid ears were. After a while, I turned off the music and started listening to podcasts while I played Siralim.  - While sound effects can also be disabled, there are no volume sliders. It's all or nothing, which means that if you're listening to something else while playing, it will be drowned out in regular increments by the sounds of attacks and spells.  - While the Nether Orb and Nether creature system is an awesome idea, and the reward is definitely worth it, the process by which you ultimately hatch Nether creatures is long and needlessly confusing. Siralim's developer knows this, and has plans to streamline the system in Siralim 2. In any case, it's a good idea to visit the in-game library and/or read the Wiki and official forums to learn about Nether orbs, eggs, gem types, and orb colors.  - YMMV, but I've experienced an odd bug that arbitrarily slows my character down as he's walking through the various realms. Sometimes I'll play the game and everything is fine, then the next time my character will walk slower for some reason. I have not been able to figure this out.  - The 'extraction' system can sometimes be frustrating. In order to summon a particular creature, you need to extract 3 'cores' from that specific type of creature during battles. But later in the game, it can become a lot more difficult to predict your attacks, and sometimes you're forced to kill creatures before you can extract them, because letting them live could cause you to lose. This is only a problem later on in the game, and it's not a problem for all builds. ",

There's really no story but  DWM  didn't either and it really doesn't need it. It's all about building up new and interesting teams to face stronger enemies to me.  The port from mobile is pretty good and functions well enough. It's available on iOS and Android as well, and I'd suggest considering the mobile version, since the game is good for picking up on the fly (and is cheaper when not on sale).
