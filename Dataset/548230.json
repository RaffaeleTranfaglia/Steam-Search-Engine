It's very addicting if you're into hardcore games (not that I'm hardcore. I'm just an averager) with the global ranking encouraging you to keep playing and try harder.  There are many game modes as well, in which all of them look interesting. I would like to try all of them soon.  PS: My right wrist hurts. There is no better control for me for this game rather than the arrow keys.",
