The anime girls are mere window dressing...I would have bought this with or without any additional content. To put it simply; don't buy this if you're looking for porn, but do buy this if you're looking for a real Japanese/Chinese majong experience and already know how to play.",

            "review_text": "VERY highly recommended for this price ($1.49/2.49 bundle) if you ALREADY can play basic level riichi mahjong. It is a port of the best android riichi mahjong game (trust me I have played every android mahjong game), 'Nagomi Mahjong,' but it has kawaii girl-chans added in. Fair AI, there are about 20 characters with different AI but you must unlock the characters. Progression is good, it is not a grindfest for unlocks like other Japanese games (eg. get 1st 3 or 5 times with character).   In the bundle the two games are exactly the same except for the characters, however the schoolgirls characters are not as good. Still worth getting the bundle.  Game can go up to 1440p but is locked at 20fps. Does not made a difference because the game has no fluid motions. Game is singleplayer-only. Has very little fanservice. Family friendly tbh.   daburu yakuman out of 5",

I've been stumbling my way through using a guide to Mahjong in general but since I'm not sure why certain things are happening or how to adjust the rules to something that might be easier to play some games I end up more frustrated than anything else.  This game desperately needs a tutorial mode. And I will admit I should have read the reviews before purchasing because of that fact.  The music is alright. I've only unlocked one of the girls so no big info on that. So far I don't find the voices hard to listen to.  I do like that it's very easy to play through a full game without a lot of time being consumed so it's a fast play if nothing else.  The tiles are very easy to read and the ability to 'view mode' simply by holding down the cursor on the table and moving the mouse helps see what has already been disguarded.  Not a game for beginners unless you're willing to do a lot of trial and error.",

            "review_text": "This is perhaps the most poorly designed games I have ever played.  And no, it's not the mahjong that is poorly designed. Mahjong is an unimpeachable of spectacular fun.  It's the literal design choices in the user interface and the pacing of the AI.  Every single ♥♥♥♥ing transition in the game whenever a CPU 'pong's or 'chi's literally breaks the game's flow. Every single screen that gets in the way between each round. The inability to check the table after a match ends. The need to drag your mouse around in order to see the other player's melds. The shoddly 12fps animation in the title screen. No animation for tile's being placed down. They just appear out of nowhere and it's distracting. Annoying music. Unresponsive interface. The scrollbar in the settings screen for screen size does not correspond to how you drag the scroll bar, but rather the inner window. Whenever you resize the window, the window literally freezes for a good 5 seconds. How hard is it to render mahjong tiles.  And not even 'pretty girls' can save this game. The characters literally have no character. While yes, they do have voice acting, but for what reason? They aren't animated and furthermore, they have absolutely no backstory. Honestly I would much rather play faceless bots. I won't have to deal with the high pitched squeals, a transition in whenever a pon or chi happens, and comically oversized proportions (I'm looking at you Rui and Ayumi). When you unlock characters, there's honestly no sense of accomplishment.  Couldn't even deliver a mahjong experience, let alone a character driven game. If you understood Japanese I would direct you to the free ones that are available.",

Plus the opponents seem to have ridiculous luck at times, winning in like 2-3 turns and other times will make a complete turnaround when you are 1 tile from winning.",

I bought it as a bad joke and wasn't disappointed, but I still need to recommend you save your money.  This game will help you learn the professional art of 'one-handed Mahjong'. Yyyeeeeaaahhhh.....  Ok so basically this game has like 4-5 normal characters and a lot of chicks who honestly should not be able to stand up with watermelons like that. This game becomes a lot better if you don't take it seriously, think of it as a parody of all those dumb 'online strip X-game' things. The art and UI are all really polished and you can tell a lot of effort went into them, regardless of how that effort resulted.  In terms of actual mahjong the games pretty good. You can alter the rules to the best of my knowledge within most typical variations. The AI takes it's turns very quickly which is good since it makes this game feel more like a small time waster and less like a board game simulator. Note that this uses Japanese mahjong and not solitaire mahjong or Chinese mahjong.",
