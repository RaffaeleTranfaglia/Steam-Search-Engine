            "review_text": "As an avid Turn based tactical games, there's a lot of great things in this game. The RPG part feels rewarding in solo, and most of the game mechanics are fun.  From specific skills to each unit that you can upgrade during the battle, a speed stat for dynamic turns, dynamic terrain, a heat system when you use your skills too much, there's a lot of interesting mechanics here to play with.  Aside from the good things, the game still needs a whole lot of polish. On the top of my head: - Resolution handling is really messy. You cannot have lower than 1280/720px res, and anything higher than that will clip the loading screens and UI. - The general UI design is, honestly, bad. A bunch of things work correctly, and that's generally usable, but it's clearly not at the level of the models and especially their artistic direction.   There are other usability issues, but nothing preventing you from playing, and I'm sure they're going to fix most of them. Overall, I just wish there were more players to be able to play in multiplayer online as I crave for it. ",

            "review_text": "While this game is fairly fun it has some fairly major and glaring flaws.   First off are the bugs that will randomly move the actual mouse pointer up or down in relation to the pointer on the screen, then sometimes the UI will just fail. I have saved the game and then the entire game freezes until I hit esc (im guessing that the next screen that should show up is invisible or some such) or when im trying to select my robots in the 4 wide screen to change out their chip sets and when I hit the arrow to view more it goes to the farthest screen and wont let me go back. but those are fairly minor and I can save the campaign and reset the program to fix them.   What finally got me to stop playing was when I was playing the campaign and every 'mission' type was a hijacked robot. not only do I lose the most useful robot on the team (the healer was ALWAYS chosen to be the hijacked robot) I also have to fight a game of 4v5 because they dont have a hijacked robot of their own. and on top of that the durability of my hijacked robot is effectivly reduced to 1 so that if it dies even once I lose the match. (aka. I was playing on easy and despite killing the other team aproxamatly 2x over, they 'won' because they finally did enough damage to the robot that was hijacked and I couldnt even tell it to stop playing around the enemy base)  the bugs are bad enough that I would not recoment the game, but with the campaign the way it is I would not recomend it unless the person I am recomending it to enjoys mismatched games.",

            "review_text": "When I first run this... I saw the Unity splash screen. Bad sign.  Next, it kept crashing on exit (tested). Another bad sign.  Then, I saw how horrible the English was.  Not playing this.    So this review got downvoted so much in under 24 hours. Probably friends of the developer... who sucks pretty bad. Don't buy the game, there are a lot better out there. There is a reason nobody bought this. Wait until it's 90% off or more. I regret getting it at 50 off.",
