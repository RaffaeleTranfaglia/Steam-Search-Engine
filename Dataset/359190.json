            "review_text": "Rituals is very lovely little game that really surprised me. If you like point &amp; click games, I can definitely recommend this game to you, but I think it can be enjoyable even for people who are not very big fans of point &amp; click games - like myself. So, let's talk about few things.  Let's start by movement, which is slightly unusual. While the whole game is in 3D, you don't actually move by WSAD keys like you would probably expect. You are moving by clicking on white direction arrows instead. So, you could say the game is on 'rails', kind of. This whole moving system looked weird from videos and screens, but it's actually a really nice idea once you get used to it.  What about puzzles? Well, there are some puzzles in almost every level, but don't expect anything that will really challenge you, because all puzzles are pretty simple and straightforward. Which is nice, if you want a game where you won't get stuck. But if you're looking for something challenging, this is probably not the right game for you.  The whole game uses very lovely low-poly graphic style, which is obvious from screenshots. I'm sucker for low-poly, so I absolutely loved it. There is just something very adorable about it. The whole low-poly style is very well executed and colors were picked really well. It's very simple, but it works!  Story is mostly told by gameplay and it's up to you to figure it out. There are some hidden notes expanding the story, but most of it is up to you and your imagination. If I had to describe it without any spoilers, I would probably say that you will find out WHAT happened, but it's up to you to figure out HOW it happened. I would also say that there are some major themes going on, especially environmentalism and existential crisis. Sounds good to you? It is!  What else is there to say? Don't expect some huge soundtrack, because the game uses only minimal sounds and music while you're playing. It's also pretty short game overall. If you play without any guides, you will probably take hour - hour and half to beat it. But if you wanted to finish it as quickly as possible, it would probably take 10 - 15 minutes. It's pretty short. Achivement hunters will be pleased, though, because achievements are very easy to get and it shouldn't take more than 2 hours to 100% this game, if you're playing legit. If you're not, then it will take significantly shorter time.  Overall, I really liked this game, its theme, its atmosphere and its graphic style. I'm not very big fan of point and click games, but I really enjoyed this one. It's very simple, short and maybe even relaxing. If that sounds good to you, then you should definitely get it, you won't regret it!",

            "review_text": "Very well done. I was somewhat reminded of Haruhiko Shono and Hirokazu Nabekura's 'Gadget: Invention, Travel, &amp; Adventure' that I had played back in 1994. Many of the online reviews I read of 'Rituals' were disparaging because the game doesn't completely fit the mold of a classic 'point and click' graphic adventure. While I enjoy these types of games, I believe their greater lies in providing an occasional oppoprtunity for somthing like 'ritual' to develop. The fact that this experience was developed singlehandedly is impressive. Pricing this product must have been a difficult struggle; if it were priced very low, users might assume it's a negligible offereing. As it is at ~USD $9, many might consider 'Rituals' to be too brief - particularly if they rush through and treat it like a game to be won.",

It goes for that indirect obscurish storing telling method where you need to figure out what's happening based on the things you observe throughout that game. The story telling is done well because I could actually figure out what was happening and there was no typical open ended ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like alot of these 'walk around town' games. The puzzles were all common sense/non-cryptic, you don't have to maccguyver anytihng like some point n clicks. I would say this is a solid game but it's defnitely not worth more then a dollar as it's only an hour of gameplay, maybe more if youd decide to 100% it.",
