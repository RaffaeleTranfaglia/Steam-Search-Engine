The game itself was pretty fun at the time, I used to play with a good friend of mine and was quite an intresting campaign going around with your friend and riding hovercrafts and APCs and so, I didn't take much out of the game it isn't really that impressive otherwise the graphics are expected of that time and the gameplay except some times is just stale, your run and shoot game with no real millitary aspects, I disliked mostly on how you had to go to ammo crates to get ammo for your gun since you was locked to just these two guns. Other than that it's really all I can remember but I'll state again.  Game isn't worth it with the AI partner and now since the multiplayer has died sadly it's nolonger good to play.",
