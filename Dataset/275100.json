            "review_text": "When  Shelter  first released in 2013 it took players by surprise with its melancholy tale of maternal struggle in the animal kingdom, told through incredibly vibrant picture-book styling and riddled with heart-wrenching moments. With the appearance of a long teased sequel, evolution has taken place and the series makes a daring leap from the confined and contained linear path of the first into much wider and open-ended horizons.  Shelter 2  brings us back on a trip through the shifting of the seasons in a natural landscape that breathes with life, ditching the more narrative driven path for an open adventure that encourages free exploration of the many plains, rivers, and forests of this habitat.  The shift into an open-world style of gameplay feels as natural in  Shelter 2  as the setting itself, and puts a higher emphasis on the previous hunting mechanics from before for our carnivorous Lynx family. Starting out on small prey such as rabbits and other critters then working your way up to large and powerful deer when your cubs are large enough which must be brought down with a well placed jump, the bounty of the forests reaches far and wide as you search through snowy woods, swamps thick with reeds, and rocky plains with little vegetation. The astounding hand-painted style that had fans in awe from the first game really shines now with an open approach to level design from the colorful stretches of leaves, grass, and winding blue rivers reaching out miles before you leading to mesmerizing patches of intricately colored trees and mountains.  Given the open-ended nature and longer progression  Shelter 2  is a slow-burning gem compared to its predecessor which shined bright and fast like a shooting star. Instead of shorter scenes the player is now free to roam the wide and open land at their own accord with very little in the way of limits or stress on time. Aside from keeping your four lynx cubs alive and healthy by paying attention to their behavior and the vividness of their color, your goal is simply to exist and explore being a part of the ecosystem around you. The only threat you face in the game comes in the form of surprise attacks in the dead of night from packs of rabid wolves, which admittedly caught me by surprise and got my heart racing as I feared for the life of the cubs I had just spent so much of my time doting on. Only the swiftest of Lynx mothers will be able to avoid these attacks and carry their cubs to safety, mostly ending with the harrowing realization that one of your cubs has disappeared while trailing behind you in the chase.  Swedish musicmakers  Retro Family  make their triumphant return with another effective soundtrack of fitting folk tunes. Just as before there's a wide variety of melodies here to accompany the different areas of the game and the range of emotions fitting each one, acting as a huge driving force to this wordless story. With uplifting acoustics in the brightness of the spring to the heavy and ominous percussion in the cold dead of winter where wolves loom in the dark, the music is what really crafts the atmosphere surrounding  Shelter 2 .   Might and Delight  come from humble beginnings, from smaller indie games that place a higher value on artistic design than anything else and work from a considerably lower budget than most.. and what they did with  Shelter 2  should impress the pants off of anybody, effectively taking all of the fantasies and all of the 'what-ifs' players presented while playing the first game and turning them into an open-world reality. While most smaller indie studios would scoff at the idea of turning their artistic pet project into an open-world experience with serviceable hunting mechanics,  Might and Delight  went for it and actually pulled out with very satisfactory results.  In the end the imagery and the message is much more positive than before, with a concluding scene that is much less about death and more about life, creation, and thriving as living beings. The openness of the world and lack of 'game-y' objective might linger a bit longer than previous players anticipate, but with a real appreciation for the art, the music, and the positive message being portrayed  Shelter 2  is rewarding in the end and the kind of experience you remember in the same way you do a childhood picture book.",

            "review_text": "Had this game on my radar for a while now. Considering it was on sale I thought now would be a good time to buy it. Sadly, the game is lackluster and way too simple.   Pros:     Absolutely beautiful art style.    You can start a family as one of your grown kits.    Fitting music. Though sometimes it would abruptly stop in a very weird way.    For those who like collectibles, there are plenty.   Cons:     Camera can be annoying.    Gets boring quickly as the only thing to do is feed your kits.    To hunt animals all you do is smash your face into them.    Can't do anything to defend your family except run/hide.    The game gives you no reason to leave the starting area other than collectibles. With plenty of rabbits there, and from what I've seen, no predators, it's the perfect spot.   In other reviews people say they're very attached to their kits, but I don't know how. I'm a very devout cat lover, but the cats in game don't have any emotions or personality. You can't interact with them in any way except feeding. I would've loved to see a way to play with them, teach them to hunt, fight, etc. but there is none of that. You'd be better off playing Wolf's Quest.",

            "review_text": "The first Shelter game was definitely not a bad game, though it had some flaws and left me on the borderline of Yes/No. As I said in that review, I wish there was a middle ground choice in some way for Steam.  This sequel, however, leaves me confident with the No response. I felt more attached to the badgers in the first game, and even though I complained that the first Shelter didn't really have longevity, I don't believe that this game does either. Even though the developers added the capability to play it for an arbitrary amount of time, the gameplay does not work with that.  There does seem to be a good amount of people who enjoy playing this game over and over, but for me, calling it 'minimalist' is an understatement. You start off the game with 4 cubs, and literally must play for a couple of hours feeding them in the same overall map area, with almost no unique events occurring, along with predators almost not existing (unless you buy DLC which really shouldn't have been DLC).  The default game just has wolves which are set in a specific zone of the map. Besides that, the rest of the game is hunting rabbits, vole, and deer, for the most part. The repetitiveness is actually quite crazy. I was more satisfied picking fruits and vegetables and hunting foxes in the first game, because at least there was a general progression into the new areas, albeit short-lived.  This game, the progression is literally the time - how long do you want to run in circles, catching rabbits and deer?  The cubs will grow, and you can 'finish' the game within 2 hours or so. But that's all the game is. You can technically continue the game as one of your cubs, as many people say, and there's an achievement for surviving 5 generations, for instance. But nothing new is added to the game at any point. It's running around and hunting the exact same animals, performing the exact same actions.  Boring is the single word I can say to this game, which I never would say about the first game.  The only other things that exist are collectibles, which are literally generic branches and leaves and flowers that the developers decided to drop around the map, as if they think it adds to the playability of the game.  This game is easily one of the most disappointed games I've played recently.",

I see a lot of people talking about that all their cubs died or straved and im stading here like what?   I didn't even know they could die, haha. I just kept feeding them, still I was holding an eye on their growth. If one cub looked tinier, I feed that cub more vice versa. I didn't rest much, kept moving(Maybe thats why I never saw any predetors.) Suddenly they were teenagers, they sarted hunting for me. Haha, that was nice for a change. Then adulthood and spring came, and they all left me(Yes I cried when they ran off)   Beautiful from start till ending!",

Then they have more babies and the pack gets larger and larger. If that could happen, I would see myself playing much more of this game in the future...",

I am very much a cat person, and as a result I ended up getting incredibly attatched to all my lynx babies. -First time playing, lost 1 to the wolves, then 2 more started starving and I couldn't find them in the snow. Had to stop playing because I was bawling like a baby at my dying pixel-kitties. -Subsequent playthoughs; got the hang of hunting and eventually raised all 4 to adulthood successfully- bawled like a baby again at my pixel-kitties because I was so pleased.  I have never been so attatched and emotionally invested in a game before...  10/10- would break my heart over this again and again.  Now, can we have a 3rd one please?",

At some points your heart may be filled with joy then the next second sadness. Keeping you on the edge of your seat and leaning to the screen. Constantly making you hope that prey is around the next rock or that a flood dosen't happen as you walk in the feilds. But in the end, when it is all over. Whether your cubs survived or not, you feel like you truly have acheived something in the end. Like you truly were experiencing the whole game through Inna's eyes.",
