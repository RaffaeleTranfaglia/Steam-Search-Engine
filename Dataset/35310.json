            "review_text": "There is alot of carnage in this game and alot of blood. The animation when you run a zombie over is really funny as they cling onto the car. The gameplay is well done and keeps you engaged. Some of the game modes feel repetitive but overall it was a good experience. There is racing and free roaming in this game which makes it fun to play around with. This has everything a good horror driving game should have and more. I really enjoyed this game and if you want some crazy carnage and want to kill zombies at the same time then this is a game to definitely pick up.",

            "review_text": "I used to play Clutch when I was a child. I have reinstalled this game recently- it appealed to me. Let me present you my short review:  Gameplay: Zombies included. Cars included. There should be more enemies on the map to make a real slaughterhouse.  Graphics: The game looks quite nice- partly destructible environment, zombies can be dismembered in a variety of ways. Heads-up display is nasty in my opinion- too many indicators on the screen.  Soundtrack: Pleasant music, but slaughtered zombies scream like normal people.  This game is worth buying: it can provide you with lots of fun- this mix of zombie slaughter and racing is really entertaining.",

            "review_text": "At the moment Clutch is only 2.99 Euro and at this price, buy it. But the normal price of 9.99 Euro is too high in my opinion.  The story is simply stupid and it does not help at all that the short story snippets are triggered by particular missions, which you can play without any order.  But apart from that, for 2.99 the game offers quite some fun. What is not to like about a car that eats zombies?   PROS   + the various racing modes are fun + pimping your cars for maximum zombie destroying (and eating) power is fun + great soundtrack + wreaking havoc feels very satisfying    Cons   - ridiculous story, which is barely there anyway - a bit repetitive after some time",

        {
            "review_text": "Underneath Clutch's snarly, indie, East Euro exterior beats the heart of a very average racer that gets repetitive quickly. Sure, the races take place in a zombie-plagued future, but your tasks are essentially the same as in every other arcade racer out there, just with a 'STALKER-ish' paint job. There's fixed checkpoint races, (semi-) random checkpoint races, demolition derbies, 'ram the other racer' races, and variations on these themes. The fact that you're mowing down zombies between point A and point B is kind of exciting at first, but then you realize that there's far better arcade racers out there (say, the first GRID) and far better mow-the-peds-down racers out there (the old, but still vital, Carmageddon). If you absolutely have to motor over zombies I'd recommend the top-down 'Zombie Driver', which, while still an indie eyesore, gives you actual missions and guns. Clutch: 2/5 stars.",
