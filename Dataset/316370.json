            "review_text": "Right of the bat some classics like Diablo or Titan Quest come to mind, however, this one is a bit different. Quite hardcore as RPGs go, with elaborate crafting and creating recipes for all sorts of stuff from spells ans potions all the way to weapons, gear and equipment, loads of ingredients as well. The world is more or less open, plenty of lootto go around and stuff to slay, feels oldschool with its own twists, also challenging as well.   Hardware specs are not ludicrous so it should run just fine on dated machines. Still could use some polish at this state, but it's still being developed so I believe the devs can only improve it from here.",
