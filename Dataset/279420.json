            "review_text": "Summary: Pros: Frantic gameplay after the first couple levels. Great art style. Pretty challenging to get gold for more gamer-y gamers. Not as 'linear' as some might make it out to be in terms of gameplay.  Cons: Soundtrack is droll and repetitive (turned the music off after 3 levels). Could have added a little more identification of clickables in the busy background art (I might just suck at the game as well and blame not having an attention span).  For a casual game it is actually pretty good. The basic mechanic is that you have to decide in which order you are going to click things in order to achieve maximum efficiency. It sounds like this might be rather simple and the first couple of levels are (tutorial levels essentially). But after a few levels the difficulty ramps up if you are trying to achieve a gold rating on each level. I have only managed to get a gold on the tutorial levels &gt;.&lt;.  I was actually suprised at how frantic the game can feel. You are constantly looking at the time and trying to speed things up in order to get that gold rating.   The reward for completing levels is money which can be used to fancy up your house, though this felt rather lame as it is essentially just a still frame picture that you are slowly turning from a crap house into a decent house with a good garden. I have not finished the game yet so maybe you get some super cool cinematic at the end, but I don't think that this was necessary and I would rather have had a little bit in the way of story instead of making a prettier picture.  As far as gameplay I only have one real complaint and that is the fact that it is hard to notice when the resources come out. Maybe it is just cause I suck at the game and don't notice but there isn't any flashy visual cue that shows when your tools or wood have restocked. What happens is that the little guys working at the huts stop moving and the resource appears but this is usually lost to me with all the other running arounds and what not. I just wish they had put in a glow around the clickables or something as more of a reminder. There is a slight audio cue but it is lost in the extremely short repetitive music that gets stuck in my head, but in a bad way.  I recommend this game for slightly more than casual gamers because of the frenetic nature of it, but I would recommend turning off the music after a couple of levels as it gets too distracting while trying to listen to the audio clues. All of the downsides are rather small quibbles and I would still recommend picking this up.",

            "review_text": "As a lover of time management games I was a bit unsure when purchasing this one. From reading the description and other reviews I sort of expected a kind of farm frenzy style game. While it has some elements of that style of game play, it is much more in the style of the build-a-lot games. I've completed around 15 levels all gold so far in 3-4 hours game play. I can't see much replayability with this game but with the price (especially while it's currently on special) it's definitely worth it if you love these types of games.",
