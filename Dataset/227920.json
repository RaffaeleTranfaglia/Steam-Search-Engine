One of the best games to pass time with, and it is much quicker to play than the board game. This game does have 'Hot-Seat' local multiplayer for those who are interested. Easy AI is easy, medium AI is a little tougher and Expert AI can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ if they get to choose where to start before you.",
