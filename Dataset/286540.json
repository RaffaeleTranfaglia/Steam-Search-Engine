            "review_text": "Wow, I wasn't expecting this kind of beauty in display and quality in gameplay when I got  Nearwood  - a FROG, or fragmented object game - in a bundle some time ago. I was bored and looking for a 'snack' game, which I'd be able to play with minimum mental capacity. Aside the story being purely lame and the ending being anticlimactic,  Nearwood 's been a feast within its genre.  The curtain opens up for us to meet Jane Lockwood, the only daughter of Nathan and Elizabeth Lockwood. Apparently, Jane's mother died out of a sickness and her father disappeared mysteriously just after, leaving Jane to be raised by her aunt. Growing up with many strange dreams of a magical realm, Jane finally decides to go back to the house that she lived with her parents when she was little, to learn more about her past.  There, a strange little man - either a gnome or a goblin - named Fey welcomes her back and invites her to the mysterious realm of Nearwood: a fairy realm that apparently little Jane and her parents lived in when she was younger. As a quite expected outcome, Jane seems to be the hero that Nearwood's been waiting for. Only she will be able to reveal the mystery of her past and mend the damage done to the realm!  Okay, after swimming in the sea of clichés that stands as a storyline, we should talk about the display: OMG, visuals are plain marvelous in this game!!! Beautiful effects, gorgeous backgrounds in vibrant colors and lovely character designs as if it's all just out of a fairytale book. Environment design being always unique and imaginative,  Nearwood  manages to set a light and magical tone for you to experience. Added with quite elaborate character designs and good voice acting, this silly magical realm is worthy for you to experience even for the sake of art only.  Nothing stands out much for the gameplay though, but we wouldn't expect anything imaginative from a HOG/FROG at this point. We know what we are getting ourselves into when we are buying a HOG: we run around in a predetermined area, collect items, solve some puzzles and call it a day by completing a cheesy story. Oh, wait: puzzles ARE imaginative and interesting, most of them being quite challenging! If you'd refuse skipping puzzles and complete the brief bonus chapter,  Nearwood  offers you a 4-5 hour gameplay which is quite fair.  This is a lovely game for you to kill a couple of hours, admire some lovely scenery and call it a day. Hey, if you have kids, I'd vouch for the game being kid friendly too. After your second hour and 40th snoopsee - a fluffy and mischievous creature that infests all  Nearwood  - you'd feel that you are 8 years old again.

Ironically the Hidden Object scenes are few and simple but the rest of the game makes up for it, even if it's short (4 hours at the highest difficulty). After the main story there's an extra playable chapter and some nice bonus tracks and wallpapers. Interesting character design (some monsters look just like Totoro!) and very detailed backgrounds.",

It was enjoyable, and I'd recommend playing the game to anyone.",
