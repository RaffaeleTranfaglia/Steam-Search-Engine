            "review_text": "I've only played the game for an hour thus far, but besides the annoying tutorial hologram that keeps interrupting the game, this has proven to be a nice throwback to simpler strategy games. It's almost like RISK in real-time, except it includes just enough elements to keep it from being mind-numbingly boring. Despite this, it remains simple enough to be a decent way to relax.  I almost see it as the conventional (Non-nuclear) version of DEFCON. Yes, there are tactical nuclear weapons, but they're not the focus of the game like nukes are in DEFCON. (Or at least from what I can tell with a mere hour of play under my belt.)  I tentatively give it a strong 8/10, with updates sure to follow.",

            "review_text": "War, the Game (WtG). It's an RTS about war on a global scale. Strategy games are probably my weak point when it comes to gaming, I put this down to increasing complexity and a decrease in my abilily to focus. Fortuantely, WtG offers short missions that you can replay over until you beat them, (or not in some cases). The simplificaiton of units to 1:1 hardness ratio gives you a good idea of whether you're going to get kicked hard, or, preferably the other way round.   So far, so straight forward, except it isn't like any other RTS I've played, you rotate the globe using the mouse, zoom in and out with the wheel, It's a smooth flow from say CoH, or (cough) dune 2. The consistancy in motion and the ability to skip forward a day/week make for a fast action strategy game. The whole interface makes targeting units a joy. That is once you've got your head round the basics control-wise, because there really are only a handful of controls, and that is all that is needed.  Finally, what really made this game stand out, was the atmosphere created by the glitched up view of the planet, coupled with the glitchy tutorial AI and the almost glitch-hop soundtrack, which went down very well with my ears.  What I didn't like about the game (and this is probably my own ineptitude) was the lack of direction after the initial 3 battles. It felt like there should have been an order in which to do them, but I failed to see it, and pretty much failed every mission afterwards, until the AI started to hand out advice seemingly randomly.  After giving the single player missions a good go, I decided not to get my back side fedex'd to me on a platter in the multilplayer.  Do I recommend? I reckon this game is good fun, not too frustrating, and lovely to look at. So I'll be going back to it.",

            "review_text": "War, The Game appears to be an attempt to create a very easy to learn, simplified grand strategy game that still offers challenge and meaningful content. Unlike many games that try to dumb themselves down to become accessible, War, The Game is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn, but harder to master. The control scheme is very inventive and while counter intuitive to what strategy gamers may expect, once you get your head around the system it works reasonably well. Many of the control options feel very touch screen orientated, for example selection is not driven by a box drag, but rather a click and hold, dragging the mouse over the units you want to command. Panning of the map is done automatically as your cursor approaches the edges, and the effect is amplified if you zoom further out. While I’m not sure the nonstandard controls really add to the game, once you get used to them they work nicely and in my opinion don’t detract from the experience. Game flow is built around a set of scenarios. Build units at cities, move them, if they encounter enemy units then a fight breaks out. As is common in GSGs, you don’t have direct control over the fight, but you can help by piling in extra units. In a very interesting twist units all have the same combat strength, but differ in terms of mobility and special abilities. For example one armoured battalion versus one infantry battalion will end in near stalemate. However armour can move much more quickly and so can be used to pin other units in place while the bulk of your forces arrive to tip the balance. This means positioning and control of multiple units is important. Infantry on the other hand double their strength when dug in at outposts or cities, and are also the only unit that can capture them. Sadly without transports they are also very slow.  Another interesting departure is that the game is in real time, and there's no pause option. Instead space bar accelerates time briefly so that your slow moving units can be shifted quickly. I’m not sure on this decision, as I like time to carefully consider my options. That said the rest of the game’s design very much feels like it’s almost rushing you. The goal seems to be rather than playing a game that lasts hours and hours, you pick up a scenario, play it, and if you want to keep playing you just play another. As such while I don’t like the absence of time controls, I will admit that the decision does seem to further a very intentional design choice, rather than being omitted by mistake. And for the most part that design choice can be summed as minimalist, and quickly paced. And that's pretty much War, The Game's watchword- minimalism. Despite being very much a GSG, it's the bare bones of what one is. This makes the game quite hard to call for GSG fans. On the one hand they may enjoy the very basic yet functional and satisfying gameplay for a while, or it can be enjoyed as a deconstruction of the genre. On the other hand there just isn't the mechanical complexity to keep someone who's logged 200 hours in HoI engaged. That said it's £6.99, so you'll probably get your money's worth. The mission based structure is also an interesting touch. While many GSGs do offer various scenarios, War, The Game takes this one step further and some of the missions are more like puzzles than anything else. They put me in mind of those trick decks from the Magic The Gathering videogame campaign modes. For people who don't like strategy games, there isn’t much pull here. But I think the group that really benefits from this game though are people who want to get into GSGs. War, The Game is very basic and while the control scheme is very different, the core concepts and ideas are the same. It's about meta game planning and positioning of assets, with the occasional bit of micro management when the war needs it. There's a total domination mode that was added in after release, but for the most part the game consists of a sequence of unrelated scenarios. Again, this seems to inform a very careful choice for how the player is supposed to approach the game. Plus, the fact the developers added in something the fans really wanted is also a good sign. The game's presentation is also worthy of note. Obviously it's not a AAA polished 4K treat with advanced rendering and lighting effects- but it has a charm of its own. The fact the game takes place on an actual globe is a nice touch, as is the fact you can navigate around without needing to actually press any buttons. There are also three different map projection modes- there's monochromatic for people who enjoy gaming on what looks like an IR display screen (admittedly it does look cool, just not great for actual gameplay), there's colour which is what you see in most of the screenshots, and finally there's unstable. Think the technology in the Alien movies and you won't be far off. Basically it switches back and forth between monochromatic and colour, as well as adding in occasional scan lines. All in all War, The Gameis a solid little title, well-conceived, well designed and well built. It's not going to be for everybody but I'd say anyone with an interest in the GS genre should at least check out the store page. ",
