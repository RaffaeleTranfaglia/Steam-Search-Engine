Great graphics, sound, lengthy and thrilling campaign, awesome units (laser tanks FTW!), interesting story and setting. It's a pity that the sequels got progressively worse. The last iteration of the series (2160) was a complete disaster and the 2150 was just meh.",

There is no tutorial or anything like that to help new players, although watching Lets Plays and walkthroughs on youtube was helpful. Once you get over the original 'WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON' phase on first start up, it turns into an enjoyable, fast-paced RTS, even if the AI is a little dumb on normal difficulty.   My main criticism, though, is the story. It's barely there and it does a poor job of letting you know what's actually going on. The text screens also show you a blink-and-you'll miss it mission objective, so make sure you give them a proper read.",

            "review_text": "Earth 2140 is old lesser-known Real-Time Strategy that was released in 1997, with Command And Conquer-like approach to design, not unlike many other RTS back then. Released only on computers, original version was DOS version. It was later ported to Windows, with a huge flaw: AI wasn't working properly.  So, what Steam version has going for it? Steam version lets you select if you want to play Windows version of 'HD' version. Main differences are quite simple, HD works more reliably on modern systems. Intro movie was changed as well, scenes mixed around. Multiplayer isn't available in both, you have to search for DOS version for that. It also already comes with 2 mission pack, with 14 missions in total. Got to say, intro movie in the first mission pack is cool. And supposedly, HD version fixes WIndows AI bug. Yet it doesn't, thus you still have a screwed up game.  Plot is quite simple. It's that you don't understand anything in intro movie, but it's cool, for it has androids and terminators. Ok, more exactly, it has United Civilized States, which is nation where robots do absolutely everything and people turned into complete 'pigs', and it has Eurasian Dynasty, which is more of dictatorship using outdated technology of tanks and such. And all of them fighting to take over Earth surface for recources. Pretty much both sides are 'evil' in their way, which is quite unique. And that's pretty much what you will get, just war, with no real story between missions.  And yes, mission objectives are quiet varied, even though majority of them is 'build base, destroy enemy base'. It got you destroying all enemies in map without your own base, finding lost machine, capturing bases, or even has you in the center of the map, with limited recources and surrounded by enemy, making you go offensive immeditly. Also, no skirmish, campaign only. But once you get to more classic 'destroy enemy base' mission, that is majority, the AI problems will surfrace.  Earth 2140 playes like a C&amp;C era game, having you press left mouse button to order units and having building/command/menu commands bar on the side of screen. And a very clunky one at that, controlling with only mouse is quite a chore, better learn some hotkeys. There is no good tutorial, so thsi game will require effort to get into. And yes, it got power plants, it got resources, which you can by building mines (and refinery and then have trucks move boxes around) over the yellow-painted parts of grounds, that you can see only on minimap (or when placing mine)... Jolly. Another unique thing is how research is done. You just build research center and it gets done qutomatically. Can't say that it's a good idea.  Both factions get to have their own units, which are kinda different, in looks and a bit in stats, but otherwise fill same niches. There are 4 types of units: soldiers, who are good at dieing in numbers and capturing buildings, venichles/mechs that are the main part of army, water units and air units, which zip around fast. All of them have various weapons, rockets, napalm bombs, laser... though laser ones are the best. But they all seem to be balanced stat-wise. Or not exactly balanced, it's hard to tell. There are no strategy guides and nothing in the game explains what is best for what situation. That, and it may turn out that best tactic is to spam most effective units anyway, seeing game's age.  And so comes main flaw with AI in this version, that ruins most of mission into dumb unfun session. He can't go offensive. He will not build new structures. He will repair though. He can't go offensive. He will only attack you once, as if scripted, if you discover him out, but once you do, he will remain defensive. And most importantly, he will produce a huge army for defence without stop, from what I gathered. And that isn't exactly fun, as you have to try to build a bigger army before AI does. Otherwise it will be a continuous attempt to kamikaze your way into, wall onto wall. I will be honest, I didn't figure out how to beat some of these missions.  Earth 2140 even had an unique feature that was dependant on AI: Virtual Generals. You could select a bunch of units and then put them under 'General''s control, making them scout or even attack through the map without you paying attention. I doubt that it had much of use, but in Steam version it doesn't even work at all.   Graphics and setting are quite nice for it's time, nothing fancy though. Music on other hand is worth mentioning. It doesn't exactly fit the game. Tracks are nice, but they don't blend in. It got one or more jokish peaceful or jazzy tracks in it, with bird singing. Nice idea, but hearing it among one of few tracks in a game feels quite weird.  I can't really say if original DOS version was bad or not, quite possibly I didn't understand this RTS yet, I didn't manage to beat whole campaign after all. And I did have fun here and there, on small maps at least. But what I can say is that it's unfriendly and Steam version's AI refuses to give a fun kind of challenge. If you want to get familiar with this title, you should find it somewhere else, aiming for DOS version.",
