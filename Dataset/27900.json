            "review_text": "Twin Sector is a strange game. Not because it's bad, but because it's pretty underrated and pretty poorly done AT THE SAME TIME. I will try to explain it.  The Story: I think that was actually a good point in this game. While i thought it was somewhat pretty generic, it had some hidden potential. But i really think the story is more conceptual than a thrilling exciting story. It follows the same pattern of Portal 1 (which i will be using as a main comparison for this game). But...Worse. The voice acting is bad. I mean, BAD. Look, i can't ask good voices on a indie game but, at least, couldn't they put a little of EMOTION? I mean, the voices looks like robotic. And not robotic like GLaDOS or something. The characters just doesn't have any trace of personality or anything that make us feel attached to them. Not even the main antagonist or the general that tries to help us. And guess what? We have been following the machine instructions when we shouldn't. We should fight the machine and escape from its rage. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. Story was a good point because i see they tried to do something here with things like only putting talented people to sleep for years and about what future the humanity will face, but i just couldn't be bothered remembering the characters nor the story. At all.  Graphics: For an indie game, they are actually pretty well done. But since the texture variation is not present, you will see more white or grey rooms than anything (again, exactly like Portal). And i swear that i could see more focus on doing models like Turrets and 'the balls of death' (as i call them) than anything else. And i have to admit that it's a bit strange when you look and see something is more textured than another. If feels a bit strange, but i can forgive that.  Music: Non-existent. Aside from the game's menu music, there's no music. They tried to follow Portal and put you in a linear path with an narrator, with no song. But as i said, since the characters have no personality whatsoever, it just feels empty. And even Portal 1 had music often. This game just doesn't have AT ALL.  Gameplay: Now, here's the big deal. The concept of Twin Sector is pretty simple: You have gloves that pull and throw. Pretty simple. You also have limited energy, so you have to make a fair use of your gloves to get through puzzles. In puzzles, you will have lasers, explosives, fire, turrets and etc. And that's where things gets pretty bad. This game is like 'I Wanna Be The Guy' in 3D. You die from fall damage. You die if the 'death ball' keeps touching you. You die from explosions if you are not too far away. And mostly important, YOU DIE FROM FALL DAMAGE. That was the worst thing they could've done to this game. Sometimes the falls are not THAT big and you die anyways. And that wouldn't be bad if the checkpoints weren't a mess. They're just too far away from one another. And there just like 3 or 4 checkpoints per stage. And that wouldn't be a problem if the design of the stages WEREN'T A HUGE PILE OF CLUSTER♥♥♥♥. Seriously. Dying in this game is WAY TOO EASY and FRUSTRATING. I can think why games like Binding Of Isaac or Super Meat Boy are frustrating too, but at least they are fun frustrating. This game is PAINFULLY FRUSTRATING.  ANGRY. Angry is the definition of this. Your character is slow and it's easy to ♥♥♥♥ up. Puzzles are bad because the physics in this game is bad. 90% of times you will die because of bad physics. And the other 10% you will die from the enemies that had to be, like, the worst enemies ever. They kill you with 3 hits and only die with 3 hits too. Easy, right? WRONG! Hitting them with objects is painful. They have a 'recovery time' and they recovery way too fast. And also, if you don't grab them in time to hit them a second time (which makes 6 total hits to kill them), you WILL get hit by them. They are just boring to fight and are a pain in the ♥♥♥ most of the time. Mostly because there are times when they are ENDLESS. YES! They keep spawning again and again... Now, i think they wanted to give you a challenge. But then i ask: in Portal, did the turrets needed to be endless to make sure you die to them at least one time if you ♥♥♥♥ up? Couldn't them make the enemies like 'if you ♥♥♥♥ up and don't play the game in the right way, you lose'? Because, the enemies are just something YOU CAN'T WIN. It's frustrating and keeps you away from getting past a mission, and so, from progressing the game. I never finished Twin Sector because it's way too hard from the half of the game on. I just can't win. Really. I gave up. I finished Super Meat Boy 100% but can't do the same with this game. I just can't win it...  But, remember: i said it's underrated and very unpolished. Why? Well. I liked how this game was supposed to work. The puzzles, enemies, and even the story. All of them could've worked better if they spent a bit more of time polishing it. It COULD'VE been a good game. But it just isn't.  Now: I like challenges. And for me, Twin Sector is a good challenge. It's like playing Spelunky from SNES all over again. And for me, it feels great. I like raging. I like failing. It means that i'm not perfect. But i'm almost sure that almost no one is like me. Believe that.  So, my final warning is: if you want to challenge yourself, buy this game. If you want to find a good puzzle with a medium challenge and a great community and stuff to do, buy Portal 2.",

The generic looking title, tepid looking screenshots and low metactric score taunted me to play this to see just how bad it is...  In the emerging genre of first-person-puzzlers enters Twin Sector. Sporting a 49 on metacritic, Twin Sector wishes it was Portal, but it's not. Twin Sectors sins are numerous but chief among them is it's lack of inspiration. Filled with flat voice acting, second rate graphics and a theme that's about as generic as you can get Twin Sector simply fails to motivate the player. Twin Sector does pace the mechanics reasonably well but the actual gameplay is average as best. Twin Sector's metactric score is deserved  (Also - this game crashed-to-desktop about every 30 minutes)  A dedicated few say they like this game, but for first-person puzzlers there are better options. Try the Portal games or Anti-Chamber.  Score: 4/10",

Graphics are crap though the main chick is rather hot. Mechanics are iffy considering the game is based around her gravity gloves. Sound is fine, though its really not atmosphere, just the girl and the Ai talking back and forth like shes a complete idiot and he is an amatuer Spark(Destiny). Fun Factor: Depends on your level of aggravated annoyance and patience for retrieval and obstacles. Only have to play the first part to know the layout, repetitive. Get it for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles or pass on it,",

The good:  - nice 3D - interesting puzzles  The bad: - humorless - boss drones that are nearly invincible. I got killed a lot by the drones. Maybe players who are quicker, have better hands, and a faster system would fare better. Defending against the drones was way too hard and ruined the game for me. - you can die from low falls.  - mediocre physics: not bad enough to hinder you but it's distracting and it breaks the immersion when objects don't behave realistically.  I would only recommend this if you can get it cheap and the above shortcomings don't bother you too much.",

The puzzles were challanging to say the least and it was fun to use the gloves. The only major drawback is how long it takes to load saves. Just dont buy this game for more then a sale, since its is only a poor spin off of portal. Still, if you liked portal, you'll enjoy this game.",

It reminided me a little of 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent' as far as the physics go. Granted, it was frustrating at times with all the re-loads, but it worked my mind over and challenged me. I pushed through it and finished the game, and glad I did. If you're looking for something different, I would definitely give it a try. It's worth it for 5 bucks or less.",

The voiced cutscenes and dialogue between Ashley and the computer are a bit dry at times, while altogether palletable. Now, some of the puzzes in this game are rather unintuitive. I feel that well designed puzzles generally aren't intuitive and cause the solver to dive into some deeper analysis, which this game does rather well.",

            "review_text": "Twin Sector was a fun game. However, if one were to purchase the game here are some things to know. The game isnt as bad as many people have made it out to be. The story is interesting and the voice acting is indeed terrible, but the gameplay is fun. The levels all take place in a specific area not unlike Portal and the player uses left and rightclick to pull and push objects with gravity generating gloves. Also, the player can crouch and jump as well as pick up an object without applying force to it which could be better than having to pull or push. Walking instead of running can be utilized against turrets and allow the player to control their sound. One IMPORTANT thing to note is the player can QUICKSAVE or QUICKLOAD which is very useful if you die and do not want to start from the last checkpoint.  Using a combination of the enviroment and mechanics from many enemies including: motion sensitive turrets, homing bombs, floating orbs of doom, lasers, and much more the player can overcome obstacles and progress the story. Small tactics like using barrels to block lasers or throwing an object to hit a button become key to passing obstacles or solving puzzles. Some puzzles even have multiple solutions. The difficulty can be anywhere from easy to ridiculous depending on progress into the game. Overall I was impressed and enjoyed getting turrets to fire at each other and strafing with canisters to shield myself from lasers. The final boss was a challenge as well.  Why has this game had so many bad reviews? First off, I dont believe the game was meant to run in fullscreen mode. The screen flickered madly and I had to edit a specific file to return it to windowed again. Secondly, the voice acting is terrible! I could somewhat understand the emotionless voice of Oscar (I kind of liked it actually) but Ashley's voice did not fit at all. I couldn't give an example but once heard you do not want to hear it again. It is too cutesy and princess-like. Unfortunately, I had to listen to it all game. The cutscenes were a good length, short and sweet. They were not very interesting though. Also, I would like to mention the enviroment. Half the game the player is navigating through a dump, literally. Personally I do not mind a game that has metal interior walls the whole time but I can see it being annoying for other players. Another thing to point out- the game is ambient with little soundtrack. This allowed me to hear what was going on beyond walls, such as approaching enemies, but it may be annoying to hear silence in the background for some players.   In the end, I would not recommend this game to another. It was fun and challenging. It had a story that made me keep playing and wanting to know what happened next. Also, the game has good graphics and I enjoyed the physics.   If you are looking for some challenging puzzles based around fun mechanics then this game is for you. Just endure the voices and short-length. Also don't expect an explosive ending and DO NOT put the game in FULLSCREEN.",
