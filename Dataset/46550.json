I found myself enjoying the game a bit more than I thought I would have, though I do strongly reccomend using a walkthrough while playing otherwise you'll just end up frustrated and confused most of the time. The graphics are bad, but not nearly as bad as I thought they would be, the voice acting could have been better, but it is certainly not the worst I've experienced ( Here's looking at you A New Beginning), there is some slow parts, but the ambiance is really nice and I don't regret that I bought it, even if it was on sale for dirt cheap and in a package deal. I hear the two sequels are much better installments so I look forward to more polished logical game with those.",

I would gladly pay $5 for this game...but anything above that is getting too pricy.  I really really wanted to like this game, but there wasnt much too it. mostly conversational. I enjoyed it for sure, but it was not immersive, i found the story kind of ridiculous/hilarious instead of dark and twisted. A couple times i got frustrated enough where i just shut the game off. Not bad but certainly not up to other Microid game qualities like Syberia (greatest game ever :)  So in short, it's fun, but not REALLY fun if you know what i mean. It's a 'eh that was fun' kind of game.",

            "review_text": "So....I've poured about 5 hours of my life into this game, so far. I rather enjoyed the interface, the way the environments are presented, and the voice actors are pretty good. Getting lured in by a good old fashioned murder mystery was pretty much all I needed to want to try it out, and I suggest the same to anyone that wants something different from a hidden gem of a mystery game.  HOWEVER.  For anyone that wants to play it, you should totally read a FAQ walkthru for the part where you try to break into the crime scene at the Hotel Orphee. There are actually two methods for getting in there, but at the time when i was playing, I thought I was supposed to use a lockpick. Should you use this lockpick on the door to the hotel room, you literally will not be able to beat the game.  Now then. To the game designers, what the hell do you have to say for yourselves? You do know that gamers are generally not very understanding of spiteful game design that leads to a dead end, right? Even Dagger of Amon Ra would at least let you see an ending where your character gets gunned down in her bed, if you made a certain mistake during your investigation. But here, I don't even get the small gratification of having at least won and seen a bad ending, I'm just plain stuck. That's kind of a sign of lazy, incompetant game design. As it stands, this game gets a failing grade, but if you can post here and provide an intelligent explanation of why you thought this was a good idea, I MIGHT cut you some slack and reverse my recommendation.",

            "review_text": "There is some good stuff in this game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it.  The story has interesting elements, and some of the characters are very interesting too. The game is old, so it doesn't look fantastic, but artistically speaking it is ok and rather atmospheric.  The problem lies in the puzzle and dialogue structure. In relation to the puzzles, if you miss one hidden object, you are stuck. And some puzzles are extremely illogical (e.g. a puzzle with two dial wheels where one wheel is not being used at all). But the even bigger problem is the dialogue: Most conversations simply don't make any sense. Some times you can ask people about things they still haven't mentioned. Other times it would be logical to ask them a relevant question, but you can't. And some times you are stuck with saying something that doesn't make any sense at all; e.g. blaiming right in the middle of a very friendly conversation. And it goes both ways. For instance a hotel manager might end up getting angry and banning you from the hotel. But the next time you meet him, he's friendly and you are free to ask questions and to enter the hotel. The next time you meet him he'll ask you to leave once again. The dialogue structure is simply awful and it wrecks the game. You end up just clicking some random statement because all the options are equally meaningless.  Sad, because the game had some potential when it comes to atmosphere and some story elements and characters.",

I can forgive a game for being dated or unpolished, but not for being so disinteresting or badly presented that I don't even care how it ends.  At present, I seem to have sprung plot triggers out of order and am unable to continue in the story, but that is more of a relief than an annoyance. The story and characters are so predictable and shallow, the so-called puzzles are so dull, that I can't even be bothered to consult a walkthrough. I can only hope the rest of the Still Life series will be more engaging.",
