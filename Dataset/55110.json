            "review_text": "It's easy to see why a lot of people didn't like this game - Guerilla gave you an open-world and some really cool weapons to play with whilst this puts you into a corridor/tunnel and throws insects at you pretty much constantly.  As a linear shooter it's actually pretty decent - the enemies aren't just dumb targets, you'll need to move and use the right weapons at the right times etc. - but all of the demolition from earlier games is a sideshow here and whilst the nanoforge 'rebuilding' stuff is a really cool effect, it's role in the game is even less central (it's a minor puzzle element at best)  So as part of the series it's a let-down, but as a 'bug hunt' shooter it's actually fine - expectations adjusted, you'll probably enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "Ups:  -Terrain destruction is amazing -Infestation Mode is intense and can get challenging  -Variety of weapons (however some of them feel useless compared to others) -Aliens are generally fun to fight -Some of the guns are freaking hilarious to kill aliens with (Magnet gun anyone?) -In the few short missions that you use a vehicle, you feel unstoppable and badass.  Downside: -Quite Short gameplay time, no openworld exploration (apart from free mode, which is just a tiny map) -Can be repetitive in some areas, especially when the same aliens keep popping up. -Game crashed once or twice when I pressed a button in game. -Can feel like it's all going way too fast (might not be a bad thing in your case)  Conclusion: I've only ever played Armageddon and Guerilla from the Red Faction series. I found Guerilla to give me more entertainment since it was open world and the destruction you caused wasn't limited to a level. However, Armageddon still gave me a solid 8-10 hours gameplay offline, which only included the campaign, a few infestation levels and about an hour mucking about in free roam. I have not tried Online and there are plenty more things to do in offline mode (achievements, secrets, harder difficulties, etc.) Graphics wise the game was OK. I was playing the game off a new-ish laptop and everything ran fine, however I don't think graphics are on par with games that came out around the same time. But hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right? I definitely recommend this game to any one looking for intense FPS destruction game. I payed $5 when it was on sale, however I think the original price of $20 is worth it, especially if you can get some friends in on it. Rating: 7/10",

            "review_text": "Red Faction: Armageddon is the Fourth game in the Red Faction series and the first game of the series I have played. The game is played in third-person, both as a single player campaign and in multiplayer mode. The story revolves around Terraforming operations on Mars and hostile Martian creatures who attack your Terraformer. The environment is destructible which is a departure from a lot of shooter-type games, and makes Red Faction particularly fun to play. Visually speaking, Red Faction: Armageddon seems pretty average for a shooter, though it was released in 2011. The story doesn't seem all that deep, but you do get to blow stuff up and rampage out, so I suppose like a hollywood movie, if you can't win them over with story, just add explosions. I give it a thumbs up, though I think there are better Shooters out there with more depth.",

            "review_text": "Red Faction: Armageddon is an action packed third person shooter which follows up from the previous Red Faction: Guerrilla game and continues the Red Faction story line. However, this time the game sticks with the third person view from Guerrilla and also drops the open world concept and is linear like the first original two games. The storyline and missions are still fun as ever and works out well even though the amazing open world from Guerrilla is gone. The gameplay is pretty standard, but lots of fun and you also have a new nifty magnet gun and some powers with the Nano Forge which sometimes make you feel like a superhero or a Jedi. Once again the highlight of the Red Faction series is blowing stuff up, and you can blow up all the structures and also repair things since enemies will often be attacking you and stairs and other things you need to access will be gone. Lastly, there's an Infestion (Horde) mode which is tons of fun where you have to stay alive and fend off all of the enemies. Overall, this game is a lot of fun and is not like the previous game, however for what it is - you'll have a blast playing by blowing things up and fighting off evil cultist and aliens. I spent around 12 hours beating the story and also the DLC campaign (super short) and playing around in Infestion mode.  Note: If your game crashes during checkpoints in DX10/11 Mode, turn Shadows OFF. This worked for me and the game never crashed again since I did this.",

Guerrilla was the better game, but this is by no means worse because it's not an imitator. For what it is, it's just not very interesting. It's pretty obvious that the fun factor in Guerrilla made it so well liked, because this isn't nearly as interesting.   Most of the game is spent fighting repetitive assaults of alien insects. In fact, other than the first mission, it takes you literally half the game to fight human enemies again. I really liked fighting humans because using the destruction against them was actually fun. Enemy on a ledge? Bring the ledge down. Enemy holed up in a building? Bring it down on him. This was when the game was most fun. However, it's only the minority.  Also, the game will crash if you start a new game. There are save files you can find online that start after the first cutscene. Drop them into the save data location, restart your PC, then you can just hit continue.  If you really want it, buy it on a really cheap sale.",

This game is really good, not perfect but great enough to enjoy almost every moment of it. The action is tense and the enemies diverse and fun to battle against. I mean how can giant alien bugs not be great enemies to blast?  The weapons are super cool and great fun to use, the super weapons in particular are frigging awesome, especially when they eat away at the environment. The storyline, world building and level design are second to none. Also it’s not a bad looker either.  It might not be the best game it is worth every penny and when on sale it is a MUST BUY.

The story is very captivating and I love the large array of weapons that you can choose from. This game seems to always keep me on my feet, shooting aliens here, one there, it is constantly making me energetic. I have only put 2 hours into the game and I have only reached 20% of the entire story mode, which means that there is a fairly long story. Even after I get done with the single player campaign, there is 2 OTHER multi-player modes that I can play. The graphics look very crisp and nice. I like how (most) the world is fully destructable, using my Maul I can tear down walls or any various obsticles that stand in my way. I will probably find myself playing this game when I complete it again because this is a very nice title. I am concidering playing the other Red Faction games because people have said that this was the game that ruined the entire series. I don't know what made this game so much worse for the Red Faction series. I like to play shooters and adventure titles, this was a very nice game for me to pick up, it is a 3rd person action adventure shooter title that takes place in the future years. I am not extremely far in the story yet so I don't exactly have a really good standpoint as to what's going on in the game's storyline. I would reccomend this to someone who hasn't played any other Red Faction titles because it seems to me that Red Faction players seem to hate this game. The game really doesn't seem that repetative to me, but sometimes it can be. It's not as bad as Dead Island but it can get that way sometimes. I don't die normally, I have only died once and that was on accident. I have the difficutly at Normal setting so if it were me, I'd set it to hard or something above Normal for someone looking for a little harder AI to fight against. I'd give this game a rough 8.9/10 it's a great title if you want a 3rd person shooter kind of like Gears of War.",

Their technology looks just plain wrong. It looks terrible and boring. Even the vaunted destruction physics are utilized poorly. Driving a tank through a wall never felt so boilerplate. And the enemies are even worst. Who honestly thought that using monsters would be a good idea? The Religious zealots you fight look ridiculous. They look like rejects from a GI Joe cartoon and act like it, too. It all looks like they were made to market a toy line.  But, is there anything wrong with it other than that? Not really, it's solid, sure. It's just so unimpressive. Sure, there's fun to be had bashing down walls to kill enemies, that's definitely a high point. But, really? That's it.

The answer, it would seem, is yes.  Those coming from Guerilla and considering giving this one a shot, here are the important points:  - Destructible environments abound. Fortunately Volition knew they had a great thing going with that in Guerilla and decided to keep it for this one. - The list of foes has been expanded to inlude both humans and vicious aliens of the Dead Space-ish variety. Gives a bit of a horror element, and a definite change of pace from the ol' EDF army. - The arsenal covers the essentials and then some. The sledgehammer and mining charges are back (the latter are fired from a gun now but work essentially the same), but are eclipsed by two things that are even better: the magnet gun and the ability to repair structures after destoying them. You don't just tear down buildings in this game, YOU USE THEM AS A WEAPON. AND CAN DO SO AGAIN AND AGAIN. The other guns you get are focused on either killing baddies or breaking stuff, sometimes both.  - Like Guerilla, there's salvage to collect and weapon upgrades to purchase. Capitalism, ho! - Environments seem to have switched to lots of underground tunnels, with the only direction though levels being straight forward. Some folks will be fine with that, others will miss the open world of Guerilla. There is enough variety in the level design to keep it from getting stale, however. - The story, unfortunately, has gone from 'simple but serviceable' to 'needed a bit more proofreading.' Those who twitch when they see story-breaking plot holes are advised to proceed with caution.  So yes, a mixed bag, and the genre shift will attract some people and repel others. Still, I cannot stress enough how much fun I found the magnet gun to be; the weaponry alone is enough for me to recommend this game on. Yeah, it's bit of a shame we don't have an open world to use some of the nifty new ideas in, but I guess they wanted to do something other than just make another Guerilla, and what we got still holds up to me as a good bit of inspired fun. Just, y'know, don't play it for the plot.",

The plot is rather average, but the possibility to interact with almost every object in the game makes up for it, at least to me. The Infestation mode allows up to four players to have fun together while killing aliens wave after wave. Also, after beating the game, there is a legal way to use cheats which can greatly amplify the entertainment. There is also a mode created for someone like me, who gets ecstatic every time he blows something up called the Ruin mode, in which you destroy everything around you to unlock more maps. Highly recommended!",

This conclusion is not only wrong, but stupidly wrong.  Red Faction: Guerilla was an engine in search of a game. Its Open World aspects were well-realised but uitimately I became bored before I'd even liberated its second zone. Piles and piles of optional missions - all nicely filed in their discrete categories of 'rescue' or 'defend' or 'bake a nice cake' - do not a fun gaming experience make.  Armageddon is almost the polar opposite of Guerilla - it's linear, scripted, almost on rails. But, crucially, they took the best things about Guerilla (descructible scenery, entertaining and predictable physics) and made them the core of the game. The Magnet Gun in this thing is truly a thing of awesome beauty.  This is a proper game, in all the ways that Guerilla wasn't. Pretty, exciting, engaging, brutal, entertaining physics porn.",

Personally, I was part of the crowd that didn't get the game and I will say that anyone who is a fan of the FPS genre needs to give this game a try. Most people say that this whole series ran on a gimmick but honestly, which game doesn't in some fashion? At least Volition tried something different in terms of destructible enviornments.

Red Faction 1 had aliens, and in fact many of the aliens in RFA look like modernized versions of the RF1 aliens. Additionally, RF1 was linear, just like this game. Like it or hate it, RFA is more like the older games in the series, not less, and it's not some sort of betrayal or unfounded design design.  On another note, the game is well optimized, good looking (I find the screenshots actually undersell it in most places), and has responsive gameplay. The series' signature destruction is also intact, so the switch back to linear gameplay hasn't changed much in that regard.  It does get tedious after a while, and may not hold up to a second playthrough (keep that in mind when you're deciding how much you're willing to pay), but it's worth the current price of $20 to people who've played other Red Faction Games.",

Effectively this means that even in the heat of battle you have a bit of a chuckle and this just adds to the whole scene. The term 'Holy Crap how am I going to get through this?' I am sure will come to mind often, it certainly did for me.  Reasonable story line, but where that may fall down some it is well and truely made up for with the fun aspect of the game.  Would recommend for anyone looking for something fast paced and interesting as well. They use some amazing little lights (GPS Indicators) to help you find your way around which are brilliant. Without them you will never find your way around and through buildings or tunnels. Couple this up with some excellent weapons and you are ready for action and will be able to take on anything.

This game is fun, but alien shooting is annoying. And there are too many for you to survive. They swarm on you. Great combat, weapons keep this game fun. And love the main voice actor, he's from FSW game! :) Nonetheless, this is a fun, explosive, destructive and did I mention blow up stuff?! 7.5/10 for the destruction and not alien fighting. This is a good decent game.",

The games got a nice array of weapons, some very chaotic scenes and a nice use of the magnet gun to really use the terrain to your advantage (basically dropping everything on the enemy). Stories a little reliant on previous playthroughs of the other two games but its not very neccessary. Give it a go, its cheap by now and the game plus modes are pretty good. Especially Mr Toots, (whos a good boy, yes you are yes, now blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of that building). Oh and ti comes with an additional story after one playthrough from the enemies point of view (however I havent played that fully yet).",

Sure, I guess I'll recommend it, but it's a very lukewarm recommendation. It's a good shooter, sure. Occasionally it'll take you through set pieces that are mostly destructable and sometimes lets you demolish buildings. But mostly it's Just Another Shooter, which it does competently enough.  So, sure, if you want to play through Yet Another First Person Shooter, this game provides that. And it works in 4K too, which is nice.",

It was a ok closing game for the series. However, the big problem was it didn't focus on what made the RF series the RF series which is Geomod tech. Other than that it's a great game and worth putting on your wishlist.",

But be warned, the game is currently broken, and in order to start a new game you need to download someone's save file, and the DLC may not work period. Until it's fixed be aware that you'll need to go to the Steam discussions page and find the correct files  Gameplay is built around physics and destruction, and it's awesome. The environment and your weapons are built around breaking stuff, which so far the game does superbly. You can magically repair stuff, which is useful even in combat. Game is easy and I'm playing on hard - not such a bad thing because it lets you have more fun with features like the magnet gun  Magnet gun. My favorite weapon ever. First shot marks the target and second shot is the destination. Target is thrown to destination. Since receiving the MG in the second chapter I've hardly used a different weapon since (although there are other great ones and MG isn't good against some enemies). You can make enemies shoot to the environment, shoot enemies at eachother, or shoot the environment at enemies. Immensely satisfying and entertaining so far  Just wanted to mitigate some of the negative reviews. I'm going back to play now",
