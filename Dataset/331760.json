            "review_text": "Its a refreshing point and click game. You can't really take this game seriously but that's okay. It is fun in its own weird way. I'll try to sum up the pros and cons for you:  Pros: + the story is goofy + the character you play makes you feel relieved that you finished high school + nice background music  Cons: - the graphics for the characters could be improved - too much dialogue at certain points in the game which can be frustrating, especcialy if you have to talk to mell in order to find out where objects might be - no flow in the game play. You have to talk to Mell a lot which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ with the amount of dialogue  Overall the game is fun to play but I do wish they would change some things:  * Moving around using ASDW * shorter dialogues * improved character graphics * easier access to items while investigating/using them  * improve the main character's IQ so you don't need Mell for everything  If you like a goofy point and click game than this game is for you :)",

            "review_text": "PROS: - Nurse - Decent voice acting. - Decent and rich dialogues. - Decent visuals and graphics. - Comical and vivid caricatures. - Lots of stereotype jokes but done right. - Many references to real life stuff (even the tutorial is worth playing.) - Unexpected and blatant swear words and ad hominem remarks make the game funnier.  CONS: - Somewhat slow, inconvenient, and clunky utility belt and inventory system. - Way too frequent hints given by Mel during a momentarily pause. - Not for juveniles for many reasons (see for yourself.) - Fake Russian accent. - Lack of puzzles.  - Linear story.  Final Remarks: I can't wait to play the next episodes! Actually I can wait because I already have so many other games to play in my backlog. But I really look forward to playing the entire series for a complete experience in the near future.  . RECOMMENDED .",

            "review_text": "Holy mother of God, have the creators of this game ever heard the term 'immersion'? Because they seem to be under oath to break it as hard and as many times as possible. Whenever a character speaks (which is very often), the music volume goes down, the screen goes dimmer, the character appears in the foreground, and the dialog happens. Dialog over, game back to normal. After 10 seconds, dialog mode again. You get the picture. I like the visuals, the music is superb, the setup is promising, but the game dynamic described above simply freaks me out within minutes. Looking for anything is so incredibly annoying that I didn't get as far solve the first task. Obviously a lot of effort went into this game, and it just saddens me that it's all wasted due to a handful of horrendous design decisions. Thumbs down.",
