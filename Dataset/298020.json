            "review_text": "Terrible hidden object game - some items were oddly-named and most were extremely difficult to see due to soft blended graphics and often being partially or almost wholly obscured (sometimes by the game's toolbar!)  The click targets for the items were extremely small and given the game has an accuracy meter, this can be extremely frustrating (and as it turned out, was completely unnecessary as getting 10% accuracy as opposed to 100% accuracy differed not at all to the outcome).  Also a ridiculous premise: no one comes to help you except your inept husband, and all the while you are searching for your child, your boss gives you a list of valuable artifacts to collect along the way such as bowling pins, buttons and other random junk.   Was glad when it was over.",
