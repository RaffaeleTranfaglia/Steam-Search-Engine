            "review_text": "TL;DR: Meadowland is an 'artsy' exploration game with interesting but ultimately shallow game mechanics that rides with its dreamy expression.  Placed inside a dream, you are a faerie who can fly around and sing in the serene, mystical dreamland. What's going on? Game shows you and immediately gets to the action of finding out yourself.  User interface is minimal, only telling you how to move and how to sing. As there are no special maneuvers to attempt, the controls are sufficient for flying around: the faerie goes where you click and hold and then sings when you click the faerie.  Singing is the main thing you want to do all the time. Singing at right places (and times) induces special events like e.g. rain or flower blooming. There's also a story that only progresses when you sing at the right place at the right time. Flow of time is seen in the celestial motion but all events nevertheless happen exactly at same times each day or night.  Unfortunately 'the song' gets old pretty fast. It is this echoing sigh sound and spamming it doesn't make it any better. On the other hand the music is nice enough not to be annoying but too forgettable to leave a lasting memory.  In addition to moving and singing you are only introduced to a huge book, the grimoire. It acts as both the menu (telling you e.g. that F is for fullscreen) and as the clue for progressing the story. You can read the whole (short) story at one time and then just come and refresh your memory when you are stuck and bored of exploring the world. Your job is to accomplish the story as depicted by the mysterious tome.  Story is hard to explain without spoiling it, so at simplest it could be described as a love story. Your experience may vary as it can be interpreted as a tale of companionship or longing. All the same, it only takes about an hour to figure out the story to its end while looking for the other secrets. That is, if it works correctly for you: on my second try of playthrough I was unable to trigger the story events for whatever reason.  While not necessarily partial to the story itself, the secrets are the hidden things to try and find while exploring the dreamworld, many of them worth an achievement. In addition to its namesake, the meadows, you can find ponds, trees, a mountain, a floating island and a sea as well as a couple of celestial and atmospheric features. It's fun to see what you can do and find the various secrets of the dreamland, that is, until you have found the few there are.  There's also a mysterious puzzle that took an additional hour of my platime, because I missed it in the first playthrough. These transparent pieces are floating in the air and disappear quickly if not grabbed immediately. For me looking for the puzzle pieces was a chore because they are difficult to notice and they appear only at random times. This being my second playthrough, the progression bug prevented me from experiencing the story for another go so I was even more bored just trying to stumble upon the pieces.  Meadowland is a beautiful but short exploration game. It managed to evoke both happy and sad thoughts in me at the end in its presentation of the fleeting nature of dreams. While it's short and gets boring after a while if you can't figure out the way to progress, it's fortunately also very cheap: I'd recommend waiting for at least -50% sale and my recommendation of the game is partly based on the small price. After all, you'll probably get only 1-2 hours content of various quality out of it, less if you are not going for 100% completion.",
