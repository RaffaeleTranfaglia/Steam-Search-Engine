            "review_text": "As a game from my childhood, I may or may not hold some bias in favor of this game. However, this will not be evident in my review. Let's answer some questions.  'What is this game?'  Rollercoaster Tycoon is a franchise where the player becomes an amusement park owner with the power to create tracks, customize everything from the terrain and decor to the ride names and colors, and even charging people to use the BATHROOM. Great idea. Think the sims, but without families and more workers and rides.  'Any ACTUAL skills I can get from this game?'  Yes. Balancing out a budget is seen by the money amount you are given in loans. These allow you to buy rides, stands, construct in general, advertise, et cetera. These loans CAN be paid off so you can run the park and not have your money taken away every month for loans. Also, there is keeping things cleaned/organized. The park gets awards based on how you run it, ranging from 'Safest Park in The Country' to 'Worst Looking Park'. In order to keep good PR, you want to hire some handymen who sweep up all the vomit and trash people leave lying around.  'Anything popular come out of this game?'  I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE  'Why not just RCT3?'  RCT3 is just, eh. It's hard to explain. RCT3 is not a bad game at all, trust me, I own that one as well and its fantastic. But, it will never have the same bouncy feel the early ones do. RCT3 is more calming and orderly. RCT 1 and 2 are bouncy, chaotic, and generally more enjoyable. In the earlier games, you get more of a RCT feel and less of a Sims. The gui in RCT3 even looks like the Sims. Still tho, try both and see which is your cup of tea.  'DLC?'   get out   'Any bugs?'  The game is being updated constantly due to being on steam, mainly in language support from what I've seen, but that doesn't mean its lost some if its old bugs. Sometimes, mechanics pay no attention to rides and they just get fixed on their own by some means. Guests still just wander off park when you delete the path they're on instead of finding another path. RCT was made in 1999, so its not really a suprise when these things happen. You just have to push them in the right direction and it's all figured out (by that I mean pick them up and throw them at the ride's enterance until they get it RIGHT).  'Is the music good?'   Holy ♥♥♥♥, yes.   You can set music differently for each ride, so if you don't appreciate one song, just pick another!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Basically, get this game. You will not regret it.",

            "review_text": "As a kid I would always start off every park I made by hiring 5 or so handymen, in preparation for the onslaught of puke and overfilled garbage bins the park would soon be plagued with. And yet, I always made sure to remove the 'mow grass' from their job descriptions; keeping it meant your handymen would be off mowing instead of doing everything else. And yet, I always felt bad for the grass; was it really right to neglect it, simply because of a minor inconveniance to my park? So I always hired one more than I needed, and made his only job being to mow grass. 35$ monthly, earned solely through his sweat and his lawnmower. Off in the unexplored regions of the park, where nobody can even see the grass he's mowing. I always made sure to give him a absurd name.  Around 10 years later, I find myself tracking Dorkle's adventure through the wilderness, chronicling his neverending battle against the grass, as I try to find a good spot for the next ferris wheel.  10/10 would relive cherised childhood memories again.",

            "review_text": "For me, a person who has play this back during it's early release, this game does not lose its fun easily. The scenarios may be very easy for awhile, but overall it is very fun and enjoyable, and a good learning experience for those who like to build their own rides within the game! Anyway, let's get to the breakdown for it.  Gameplay: 7.5/10  This game holds a simple but fun hold of its gameplay. To keep it short and simple, it takes the standard overview 'god' role to building things, and allows you to monitor everything and do as you will. While it is a relatively common style, it fits well.  Sound: 8/10  The roller-coasters available in this game for the most part have very good sounds built around them, as is the music of the rides you can choose. However, the smaller rides (minus the Haunted house and rides without a cart and/or moving vehicle) like the Ferris wheel and the Merry-Go-Round have no sound around them if the music is turned off. Whether it was intentional or not, it's not really that big of the deal, the sound still is very good.  Graphics: 9/10  For its time, the graphics were built very high-end, especially the rides. The detail put around the scenery and the texture of the land is pretty amazing for its original release, but the people seem to have been left out of this small loop, like they have gotten just a tad bit lazy. It's not really that bad though, and is truly a great sight for its age!  Controls: 6/10  The controls consist of a simple click-and-go kinda game. For the most part that is it, but you can hot-key many things, like closing windows, screenshots, opening the tabs available and even for seeing through the ground. The hot-keying is almost a necessity for those looking to do things very quickly, as the clicking can be very burdensome when doing many things you are trying to do. The hot-keys save it, though.  Overall: 7.6/10 (Pretty Good)  This game certainly holds its head up high for those who look into tycoon games from many angles. A few things here and there can get a little bothering, but overall it's a solid slate, and I would recommend it for anyone willing to try it out!",

The game is basically management of a theme park, which you build, either from scratch or from a starting point, depending on the scenario. You add rides, rollercoasters, eateries, facilities, etc. You must recruit handymen (absolutely vital as the park guests hate the site of sick on the ground!), engineers (your rides will breakdown regularly) &amp; security guards (vandals exist you know).  The best aspect though, is the designing of your rides. Some are set, such as the Merry Go Round, but others, such as all the rollercoasters, the log flume etc, you can either accept pre set designs or have a go yourself. Piece by piece. There is no better reward than the self design of a monster rollercoaster that the crowds love.  I use Windows 8.2 and this game runs smoothly.  Buy this game.",

            "review_text": "Don't let an abysmal final entry draw you away from the series. RCT1 is as good a game as it always has been, and I daresay it's one of the greatest ever made. When Steam offered the nomination for the 'Test of Time' award, I thought very briefly of X-COM... then ignored that thought and went straight here. Then I took that award back, so I could give it to the game again.  ==  Made by a single person, and with NO ENGINE (the entire game is written in Assembly), Chris Sawyer's Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 fall under the definition of a masterpiece. They play well, run smoothly, and have all sorts of great features that other tgames wouldn't catch up to for years. When SimCity 2000 and 3000, and even 4 were simply running cities with fake-people sprites occasionally walking around, RCT had something only Bullfrog had succeeded in-- a management game with AGENTS.    Every single one of the people in your park are active.  When they're idle and bored, they find something else to do, and the guest count can reach well beyond even 1000 guests. They're never inactive, the performance never tanks; it pulls off the simulation of thousands flawlessly. IN 1998!  What makes this game stand out so much from older titles, however, is the clean interface and visuals. The isometric graphics still hold up rather well. The performance is at a stable framerate constantly, and while I'm not sure where this cap sits, it's at least 40 FPS and never drops. The interface is neatly organized, and every time you click a menu, it IMMEDIATELY pulls up that menu with an accompanying sound. It also behaves like Windows, with windows appearing per menu that can be dragged around the screen freely. It actually LOOKS like a game instead of an alien interface, something that can't be said about other classics like X-COM and Theme Hospital.  Perhaps what draws me to the game the most, however, is how you're genuinely building a world in it. It doesn't have much in terms of background music, and at first, the park  feels  empty; however, you start placing your rides, give them selective background music, and extend your park. This music adds up to build an atmosphere. Then, your new guests will make noise. You'll hear the clanging of capitalism and greed every time a customer buys something, and your guests are louder depending on how many there are. Coasters going downhill with passengers will have them scream. You'll also see them very well-animated-- they'll walk around, they'll pull out umbrellas   if they bought one for $20 at one of our kiosks... heh heh  , they'll throw up if they get sick. Yeah, their 'tasks?' All based on their own selfish desires. They'll want to be happy, need to be awake, need to use the bathroom, and can't take motion sickness. Their actions all change based on these stats, and it's in your best interest to accompany them all.  In reality, I'm making the game sound more complex than it is to play. These mechanics are slowly introduced to you, and I played this at a very young age without a tutorial; it just doesn't suffer from the usual complexity problems of these old games. If you need it, there's a tutorial that consists of watching someone play in real time, essentially a demo of Chris Sawyer taking over the mouse and playing for you. You can hit Escape to take control at any time, but assuming you don't you'll get to see where all the options you need are. In reality, however, the game won't take too long to figure out for the most part.  As far as replayability value goes, you just shouldn't be concerned. There's several challenges to go around, playing with the game rules in various ways by giving you a task and either a piece of land to build on or a prebuilt park in its early stages to improve. You will NOT run out of content-- in all my years of playing this game, I still have yet to clear through all the scenarios, and Forest Frontiers will always be a special memory to me. ==================== BUY THIS GAME. It hasn't aged at all. It's still better than any modern sim... SimCity 5, Cities Skylines, and Planet Coaster all fall short in some areas that this game nails, despite all being good games themselves. Its compatibility is near-perfect (and if by some odd chance you run into an issue, there's a lengthy guide detailing workarounds and solutions), and a hexeditor widescreen hack is out there if you need it.  If I don't end the review here, I would ramble endlessly about all the things this game does right, but as it stands the best way to do that is to experience it yourself. The Steam release is a simple port, true, but nonetheless the game looks and runs perfectly. It still  is  a highly innovative and organized game, and few things stand in the way of showing off its strengths.   Pick it up, for your own good, and try it yourself; whether it's the full track editor allowing you to build custom rides and coasters, the atmosphere-building sound design and gameplay design decisions that help it feel like a living world, the management of your finances and distribution of staff to keep the park at max efficiency, or the morbid prospect of drowning panda-costumed staff and throwing coasters into the lake, or perhaps any combination of the two, this is a game you simply must play.",

In all seriousness, nostalgia does cloud our perception, and I don't play a lot of simulation games, so I may not be the best person to review this game since I don't have much to compare it to. I haven't played more than a few minutes of the sequels and games by other companies inspired by the series like Planet Coaster. Those are probably a better option if you're looking for a modern experience, as this game definitely is a bit dated. Still, for its age, I don't feel that the UI is too clunky or the learning curve is too steep. Fun to pick up for a couple hours exactly once, or to dump days into, if you have that kind of time.  I never did fully understand a lot of the roller coaster-specific mechanics, like intensity and excitement, which can be limiting when I'm trying to make a park the best it can be. The track builder is a bit clunky, too. Still, I'm a lot better at the budgeting and management aspects than I was when I was a kid, and the game can still be easy or challenging depending on the scenario. The quirks and flaws are a drop in the bucket of nostalgic goodness. Or lake. Lake of goodness, which your guests can fall into and drown.",

RollerCoaster Tycoon is about a game where you make rollercoasters or more specifically amusement parks who have rollercoasters in them. Your goal is to reach a certain amount of guests or park rating, among other things.   The gameplay is simple. Make attractions, like rollercoasters, Go Karts, Log Flumes, etc., so your park can become more popular. You can charge people for many things, including to use the bathroom, which can be hilarious when they really need to go, but don't want to. However, doing things like that can make completing your objective harder, because people will complain about it, which will bring your park rating down. However, you can drown the unhappy people, which will bring your park rating up for some reason.   However, there are some downsides. For example, on my laptop, almost EVERYTIME you close the game, my computer doesn't recognize any touches and FORCES you to shut down by using the power button. Also, the guests are WAY too scared. I made a rollercoaster that just goes down by not that much and it had an intensity meter of 11 and nobody would ride it, even though I made it free and advertised it. Also, NEVER save on the same save file. I did that and it stopped working, which was a world I spent 6 hours on.  Final Verdict: 8/10 +Fun +Replay Value +Years of entertainment +Addicting -Guests way too scared ",

Honestly, many of the parks only come into their own after the objectives have been completed because if you stay with them, what you can research and what you can build is just great.

Some start you from scratch, others don't. Anyway, it's a simple but complicated game as most Management type games go. For instance, can't make a roller coaster too scary or hardly anyone will ride it but if it's too weak, no one will want to ride it because it's not intense enough. Just be sure to Test Run your ride first to make sure it isn't a death trap. I've accidentally killed some people because I forgot to do that first. &gt;_&gt; Sometimes it's really hard to know if what you're building will appeal to your guests, but once you've got it right, advertise the crap out of your new ride, and watch the dollars signs fly up.

I bought the game at the full price of $6 because I decided I couldn't wait until it went on sale, and honestly I regret it.  Immediately upon launching it for the very first time, it caused my laptop's video driver to crash. I was a little alarmed as my laptop is stronger than many gaming desktops out there, but brushed it off once a restart of my laptop got it working. Immediately I was reminded why I loved this game: it's fun and reminded me of everything that I used to love about the RollerCoaster series.  Downloading and launching the game on my desktop the following day, I was pleased when there were no problems... except why can't I play it in fullscreen? Ah well, I'll deal with it, at least it didn't crash funny on me like it did on my laptop.  Well then I encountered the horror story that I had read in a review - the 'save crash'. Upon saving my game after playing for two hours it crashed on me. Immediately the idea of logging back into that game and re-doing everything I   had just done   was frustrating.   But ultimately the part that really bothered me was Steams support for the game - read the supreme   lack   of support. Going through the support site here on Steam just wanted me to contact Atari.  Looking back, I feel that these were probably bugs that had been present in my original RCT, I vaguely remember problems with fullscreen mode working, and I definitely remember a video crash or too - at the time I had assumed it was my very, very outdated computer (it was classified as outdated in   2000   so it was definitely rather basic). The fact that these errors actually continued on to Steam was disheartening. I currently have an old scratched up CD of RCT; the reason I didn't shove that into my desktop and download it there was because I'd wrongly assumed that the one here would have these errors corrected. That was my fault.  Now, I'm not saying that the game is horrible - At the time of writing this I've put 4 hours into it, and I will continue to play. However, I would   highly   recommend waiting until it's on sale.",

I would like to say that this is the type of game that makes you sit back and think 'I havn't played a game this fun and simple and really enjoyable in years', it is made to be fun which is a word not usually heard in video gaming these days.  As this is a game that you can buy on disc i will compare it to the disc version but first lets talk about the game on its own: It is a very happy game and definatly cheers me up, running a theme park is wierdly enjoyable and when you win the guests all clap for you (which is so cute, also if they are holding a balloon they let go and it fly's into the air (simply joys)), it has many different parks with a lot of variety in goals and map types, the graphics are still decent and the little sweeping activity the handmen do is very sweet, and if you are a phycopath then forcing the rides to fall off the rails makes a great explosion.  Now lets start comparing Pros of Steam version: It has a lot more variety of maps includng real world parks, there are more variety of rides, making banners is fun, also (only fans of the disc version will understand) you can set the price of all the burger stand to be the same price and not have to go round changing them all. Cons of the steam version: It may just be with my version but you can't see what the rides will look like untill they are built (except for the original rides that were on the original disc version) this is very annoying as i don't know what the ride is at all or if it will be similar to previous rides i have or if it will be too extreme for my guests.  Also, most of the new rides are far to big for any park and are too exspensive to be able to build. It is a shame that they have this variety of new ride designs but it is impossible to use this feature.  If you liked the original disc version when you were younger then get this, it will be quite the nostalga ride and I look forward to seeing you at the exit saying 'Rollarcoaster tycoon 1 was great!'

Once you figure out the system its easy. Definitely have ended scenarios with 200k company value. Great game.

Nothing about this game is particulary challenging, and building your own coasters from scratch is tedious as hell, but it's all rewarding in it's own way. It's stupid fun even now, over fifteen years after it's initial release. I just wish I didn't have to mess with my resolution settings every time I wanted to play.",

IMO the first in it's genre to set standards for how a base RollerCoaster Management/Sandbox game should be.  Graphics are top and don't age I think, solid color palette for a 2D game.  Gameplay is repetitive to an extent but you're playing a Sandbox RollerCoaster Tycoon game... if this isn't what you are looking for it's your fault.  You can waste tons of hours at this game but always feel accomplished if it says : Congratulation! Please enter your name here.  Buy it if you like this type of stuff, or buy the 2nd one in the series, but I have not played that so I can't say if it's better/worse, for me this game is good enough and feel satisfied.",
