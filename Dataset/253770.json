Just wanted to get my opinion out there and I'll write it out tomorrow :P  Good: - One of the more 'real' simulators that I've played - Starting up is great! Everyone I could imagine an actual bus drive would need! Just remember all the numbers or remember to write them down beforehand :P   Bad: - The controls are complex - Don't know how to reverse - there is no shortcut when looking at the screen thing - makes me want a touch screen monitor :L - The default steering requires a lot of effort to make sure you don't crash",

            "review_text": "Imagine shooting up heroin whilst riding a roller-coaster made of crystalline excitement which is going through gargantuan hoops of fire over a swamp infested with three-headed sharks which have lasers for eyes and chainsaws for fins. That is exactly what Bus Simulator 2012 is not like.  You are initially offered a choice between two settings, 'Beginner' or 'Expert'. Beginner mode is essentially expert mode with more prompts and sunny weather. Even on the beginner setting there is a steep learning curve, I ended up watching tutorials online and consulting the manual due to the inadequacy of the limited in-game prompts and lack of help features.  On the plus side the simulation is incredibly in-depth. Every single button on the bus is functional, including for example, all the switches for the blinds, windows, roof hatches, door locks and suite of climate controls. You also have the capability to fine-tune many aspects of the bus including brake and steering behavior, such as the brake speed and delay.  The environment and its dynamic effects also add to the sense of realism. For example, if you have the heating on when it's raining outside the windows can fog up; this can be remedied by turning the air circulator to the defrost position. What's even more realistic is everyone whinges about the rain as they get on.   On the downside, there are only 2 bus models (articulated and standard) to choose from which I found to be a bit of a let down. Perhaps a better game title would be 'Very-specialised-urban-area-of-Germany-Two-Buses-Simulator 2012'.   The game-world is expansive and has a great level of detail. I really felt like a bus driver in Germany which was mildly depressing. The only thing which detracts from this sense of immersion is the handful of minor AI bugs, but they are rare. Occasionally when turning a tight corner a car will ram into you from behind which is annoying. On the other hand, it's quite amusing to see an overturned AI bus - it makes you feel a bit better about your driving abilities.   Overall graphics are average to decent but require abnormally high specs. It seems far too taxing but it's still playable on lower settings. The current price of $9.99 seems about right considering the simulation is very in-depth but the game feels unfinished in some areas.  If you think you will find no enjoyment in driving a simulated bus for an hour then obviously don't buy it, otherwise give it a shot.  Overall:  6.5/10 ",

Very bad compatiablity with Game Controllers such as Windows Live Controller (xbox 360 controller for pc).  2. Laggy, shouldn't be lagging considering I have a GTX 680 and can play quite a lot of games max settings which are way more graphical than this. Probably to do with optimization?!  3. Gameplay sucks, the bus flys up in the air if you crash and signals don't work with sound sometimes. Many other gameplay flaws.  Just would not reccomend this game, going to give OMSI a try maybe. Played games such as London Undergound simulator which were brilliant.",
