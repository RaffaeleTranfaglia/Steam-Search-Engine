            "review_text": "If you've ever been a student and/or had a teacher, you should play this game -- especially if you've had an inspirational teacher.  This game will make you THINK about the academic system in a different way, since you get to BE the academic system, and appreciate all the hard work teachers put in in spite of the system.  Also, it's got a nice, catchy theme song.",

            "review_text": "No Pineapple Left Behind is a challenging simulation/management game which puts you in the place of a school principal. It's a simple concept: turn students into pinapples to make cash money, but the complexity and difficulty of turning a profit makes it challenging and engaging.  All in all, the game resonates with me deeply due to its overall message about how messed up the American education system is. As a high school student who has come to loathe the overbearing workloads of classes which slowly turns students brimming with personality into mindless 'pineapples', I believe that this game speaks volumes about the truth of our education system.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to turn human beings into fruit to make a tidy profit.",
