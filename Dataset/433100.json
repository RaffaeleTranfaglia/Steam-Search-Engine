            "review_text": "When i first started up the game i didn't expect too much. I have to admit i've already grown a bit weary of the horrorscene in gaming with their endless, cheap jumpscares, gory and bloody scenery and running away from monsters to stay alive, another jumpscare and rinse and repeat. I'm not saying i don't enjoy those, but after the game is completed thats about it and it didn't offer me that much of anything new as experience and i'll just start up another game.  Then there is The Town of Light, if you're looking at something that will leave an impact after you've finished the game, you don't have to look further. A fresh view as psychological horror in first person view. You'll be forced to deal with humans for a change. More specifically, very rarely handled subjects of mental health, child abuse and institutionalising to a psychiatric hospital. On this you really have to give praise on the research and storytelling. One aspects where this game really shines.  Story goes around on just that, you're wandering around on an actual abandoned psychiatric hospital as Reneé, our maincharacter, picking up grim pieces of your past and trying to discover what actually happened. Flashbacks, pieces of medical journal, letters all adds up to the story which you'll want to finish in one go.  However. Eventhough this personally for me is one of the best i've tried out so far in 2016 and while the story, soundscape and graphics are just astonishing. It basically falls in the category of walking simulator and if you do not enjoy a good story, there isn't much else to do in this game and it might not be suitable for you.   All said, the story on it's own makes this one of the better if not best psychological horror games i've encountered in my life, it will make you crawl in your chair and feel uncomfortable from time to time, and i can suggest it to anyone who wants to enjoy something new.",

Apart from that &amp; the fact that it also does the 'slow down even more when the character is talking' thing that some games do, this game was pretty much flawless for me. The graphics, art, sound, lighting, voice acting, cutscenes, story, the fact that it gave me a flashlight but it wasn't pitch black; I was interested all the way through. I'm playing through it a second time, right after finishing the first time.  Well worth it.",

No jump scares, no spooky things chasing you around. Its a psychological thriller, more of an interactive story than an all out game with some very cool (albeit a little disturbing) hand drawn style flashbacks/cutscenes. Plus an ending that hit me hard as over the short time span of the game I developed a strange attachment for the player Character, Renee.  It looks good and runs well. Takes about 3 hours to complete but I still found it worth the price of admmision.  It's not all good of course, voice acting isn't exactly up to Rise of the Tomb Raider standards. As mentioned earlier it is a very dark game and your flashlight is pretty terrible and it has very basic mechanics. graphics aside you can tell this game had a low budget and an inexperienced dev team.  And yet I enjoyed not enjoying every second of it and would do it all over again. I recommend it to anyone who puts story before running around pewpewing stuff.    ",

This is more like reading a book, much is left to the imagination, while the beautiful urban exploration-like environment is providing a truly immersive atmosphere.   For similar experiences, 'Dear Esther' comes to mind. However, I feel that The Town of Light is a much more satisfying experience.  I really enjoyed every minute of this thoughtful masterpiece for grown-ups. ",

I'm having some difficulty coming up with the right words to describe my feelings after finishing this. Emotionally drained, maybe? Angry? While in a lot of ways the treatment of mental health has improved over the years, places still exist that operate not too different from this.  This gives a fairly accurate insight as to how mental health was viewed back then, and the asylum exploration is pretty on-point. Too often the subject of various afflictions is viewed from the outside, with the usual stigmas. Most don't even stop to consider what the mental process must be like for someone having to deal with these issues on a daily basis. There's still a lot of people who don't even take depression seriously.  I'm glad this game was made, and I hope people take the over-arching story to heart.  Edit: removed possible spoiler statement. Steam reviews seem to be very buggy...for me at least. I've tried updating it like 6 times over the past few weeks before it finally took...and the edited version still isn't showing on the store page XD",

            "review_text": "The Town of Light is a psychological horror/thriller game that recreates the events of a teenage girl who gets placed into an Italian mental asylum in 1938. It's a point and click narrative style game (aka walking simulator) by a small developer but don't let that deter you. The storyline is captivating, the atmosphere it creates is eerily haunting and it makes you want to keep playing, even after learning of the horrors that occurred and when you know you should stop and you don't really want to know what happened, the game draws you in.   The game tells one of the best stories I've ever played through in a walking simulator game, and it keeps you engaged, wanting to learn more throughout. Definitely one of the best games I've ever played and certainly one that got to me at a couple of points, making me feel sick from the gruesome details. For the price, it's practically a steal, you have to play it. I didn't think I'd like it when I saw it but I bought it based on a friend's recommendation and I don't regret it one bit.",

            "review_text": "The next Deadly Premonition? I think so. Conceptually, very interesting, original and previously unexplored. Executed with a lackluster yet neophyte touch, this will be a polarising game for years to come. I recommend this game with caution as I feel this isn't a game for everybody.  The Town of Light is an indie effort at showcasing mental illness through a 16 year old girl who - without spoilers here - develops a growing sexual interest towards a certain somebody. This co-exists with the way the patient is treated and the game pairs this with visual and audible effects. If you're a fan of walking simulators, heavy exploration and 'sit back and relax' driven games, give this a shot. If you need puzzles, multiple developing characters and an arching story, you'll probably lose interest fast. However, this game seems to mix both sides of the field to create its own formulae using an original, but bizarre, setup it has going for it.  Gameplay is rather quite weak I have to admit, there's invisible walls and locked doors galore. Performance is hit and miss, mouse sensitivity and FOV are an issue, so are certain post-processing effects such as SSAO which, at lower settings, create this ugly black-spotted screen lay-over. Moreover, there's a lack of inventory, player responsibility and fail states, which disappointed me. You're given a flashlight, though is completely and utterly useless as no area in the game is ever dark enough. Anyway, as previously stated, this game isn't exactly well polished. Generally the game feels sluggish, uncared for and untested. Movement speed randomly changes, clicking can be finicky, mouse navigating feels heavy (especially on a directinput controller) and your characters' arms/body can be seen as its unfinished model at high FOV settings.  Now, conceptually: is where this game succeeds. Let's get this out the way; there's adult themes, full nudity and implied ♥♥♥♥ (NOT ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥). Beyond that, it was intriguing going through what the game throws at you, the symbolism drawings on walls, scene-switching from the then-and-now asylum, and the voice acting isn't actually that bad. This game has alot of derp, but derp that will keep you wanting to see what happens next - that is - if you're willing to put up with the poor gameplay. If you've played Rule of Rose, it's a similar setup here in how the game is presented.  It's a really short game, unfortunately, but is doing things other games don't even dare to. I say bring on a sequel to this, keep the clean, tasteful and appropriate adult themes and even turn it up a notch. But for my sanity, you need to improved and expand on the general gameplay and exploration aspects. Make ALL areas and items of real use, cut down on filler, improved performance and put in more modern touches. Also, a much needed better hint system.  Give this a go if you're willing to support a developer taking risks with original, adult concepts not seen before.  Oh, and this game has one of the most brutal, cringe worthy scenes that had made me look away. ;)",

The game world is PRETTY, but totally lacking in atmosphere and any kind of tension. The few shock-factor moments are robbed of their impact by the long periods where you do nothing but walk around.   This game is only going to impact people who don't have a clue how these places used to operate, and how bad things were. If anything, I'd say this was a pretty tame interpretation. If you're looking for an actually disturbing psychological horror game, I'd say you're better off with The Cat Lady.   I was so ready to like this game, but it just doesn't deliver.",

I wouldn't say there was any horror to it but it was plenty disturbing.  I looked into the 'real facts and places' this was based on and found Ospedale Psichiatrico di Volterra - a psychiatric hospital shut down for malpractice and cruel conditions that people called 'the place of no return' because of patients that would never be released. So the game's writers did their research, and pictures of the abondoned hospital show how spot on the game's art and design work really is.  The narrative was weak though and marred by what I thought was terrible voice-acting, and any choices presented in the game seemed pointless, but the documents pieced most of it together and the cut scenes brought the drama. All in all it delivered a good story - by good I mean painfully depressing - and an accurate glimpse into a harrowing bit of history, which is basically everything the game promised. It can be hard to justify the price though for what was essentially a two hour movie.",

I can't imagine a better way of telling these stories about the old asylums, but it just doesn't work with this girl who reads everything as robotic as possible. This combined with the fact that she's supposed to be written as a patient makes for some painfully cringe-worthy dialogue.  She uses the word forbidden in practically every sentence and with very awkward placement.  If you want a story-driven game with some horror elements, get Layers of Fear instead.

Some of the 3D models are interactive but they serve no purpose and you ask yourself if the developers ran out of motivation or money to actually complete the game as a *game*.  The playable area is small and due to bugs you sometimes end up outside of that area - trying to find your way back in represents actually the biggest challenge the game can offer. The textures, the character models as well as the animated cartoon-like sequences are of disturbingly low quality and scenes that are supposed to be emotional are completely destroyed by bad animations of arms and legs.  The only really positive aspect of the game is the story, but taking into account the 'state of the art' of treatment methods for mentally ill patients in the 1940s in general, this story is nothing special or out-of-the-ordinary (but still sad and shocking, don't get me wrong), especially when compared tho what happened in Germany at the same time in history.",
