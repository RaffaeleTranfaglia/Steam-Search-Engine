            "review_text": "Before Halo, Call of Duty, and other new-school shooters that currently saturate the FPS market, there was the old school. I’m talking about games that kept the same spirit as Wolfenstein 3D, like the Doom series, Duke Nukem 3D, Half-Life, the Quake series, and Unreal. If you lived through this time, you know what I’m talking about. These games are representative of a peak in shooters in that their challenge, length, and fun depended on gameplay alone—no cutscenes that pad the game time, no predictable plot elements, and no exploitative glitches that most new school gamers use in games today. Controls were fluid and customizable, combat was fast and furious, and the games were almost exclusively for PC. It took skill to play and if you were killed, you had only yourself to blame. This was when multiplayer was on the rise, before mods and cheating took hold to as great an extent as it does now, and before cheap tactics like quick-scoping were often the deciding factor in encounters.  Aliens vs. Predator Classic 2000, as it’s currently known, in some ways represents one of the last examples of this FPS golden age. It was released in 1999 in the wake of the game-changing Quake (1996) and Half-Life (1998). Its main selling point, of course, is that you can play as each of the three different species, the Marine, Predator, and Alien. There are three different campaigns for each, and beating each on successively harder difficulties unlocks up to five bonus levels for each, which also bestow additional equipment to the predator and marine. Additionally, if you complete certain challenges, you can also unlock new options that may classify as “cheats” in single player. You won’t really see much of a storyline progression between levels because there isn’t really a story. As with most developers of old school shooters, Rebellion focused on gameplay more than anything and the result is excellent.  Being a game now available on Steam, you’re probably thinking about multiplayer, and yes, that is one of the best reasons for this game’s existence. In fact, it seems almost designed as a tournament fighter, given the vast differences between species. If you were to never play the story missions at all, you would still have endless amounts of fun. Of course, I’m referring more to this game in its prime (early 2000’s) rather than now, because as you might expect, not many people still play this game. But when you find a game, you will see that the multiplayer is still very good and holds up today, even if it’s under-populated.  The perfect word to describe this game is balanced. Each species has its own advantages and disadvantages such that you never really feel like one is significantly over- or under-powered. The alien is the fastest, can jump the farthest, and walk on walls, but it’s the weakest physically and only has close-range weapons. The marine is slow and relatively weak, but can resupply through medpacks and armor and has access to the motion tracker and the game’s strongest weapons. The predator is the physically toughest, has strong weapons and cloaking device, but is kind of clunky with its limited energy, limited speargun ammo, and species-specific vision modes.   Now for the gameplay. This game is fast, incredibly fast. Like other old-school shooters, you have to react quickly and precisely or you’ll end up dead. Start spamming your weapons and you’ll just leave yourself open to attack and die. This game can feel relentless but never unfair. As stated above, it’s the product of a more refined and merciless age, before button-mashing, quick-scoping, and button-combinations became as prevalent as they are now. Like the alien itself, this game goes back to the roots of what makes a great shooter by stripping away all the hand-holding.   Need I say more? If you’re a product of the nineties, then you were probably into either the Aliens or Predator series at one point or another. Even if you’re not, this is a great game solely for the gameplay value. And for $4.99 you can’t really go wrong. In my opinion it’s the best AvP game ever released (better than AVP2 and 2010). And honestly, I don’t have any gripes or complaints about it, which is pretty rare for me.   For those of you interested in the more technical aspects, the Steam version is the 2000 update by Rebellion that allows for saving (yes, the original did not allow saves) and has two new weapons, the Skeeter missile launcher and the dual-wielding pistols, both for the marine. You can get graphical updates through what’s called the Redux mod, which you can get at  moddb.com . You can also pick up extra multiplayer maps and other refinements for this game there as well. Happy hunting.",

            "review_text": "Arguably the beginning of asymmetrical online FPS.  Each class is varied and very different to play.  The marine is a glass cannon, the Predator has to make smart choices about when and where to expend energy and is not as invulnerable as one would think and the Alien is nothing but a Tazmanian Devil of claws and teeth on speed.  This game is hard...as it should be. If a Xeno gets within 5 feet of you, you're done. The way it should be.  No meleeing the Predator or Alien...you just die quickly and pitifuly.  The graphics do detract somewhat from the experience...but everything else was done very very well.  Fans of the series...this is a no-brainer.  Colonial Marines, are you listening? This is how you do it.  Now if only they'll put out AVP2 on Steam...",

            "review_text": "Alien versus Predator Classic 2000 is a first-person 'shooter' made by Rebellion. As being both an Alien fan and a Predator fan, I bought this game having little to no knowledge about the game. My results... well let's take a look shall we:  Pros: +Amazing Gameplay - Each character (Alien / Xenomorph, Colonial Marine, and Predator) has a different play style. Example: Xeno. = Stealth &amp; Speed, Predator = Michael Bay everything, and Marine = Survival. This variety of gameplay makes the game more diverse gameplay-wise. +The Campaigns - The Campaigns are done very well. None of the Campaigns feel the same. It's almost like playing three games in one. Alien campaign = Alien: Isolation Xenomorph's point of view, 2. Marine campaign = What Aliens: Colonial Marines should've been, 3. Predator campaign = The perfect Predator game (Come on Terminator wheres your game) +Respect for the source material - The entire game respects the source material from both the Alien and Predator franchises. Locations like Fury 161 and LV-426 and weapons like the smart gun and the shoulder canon are faithfully recreated.  +Facehuggers - Thats all I'm going to say... +Not made by Gearbox or Paul W.S. Anderson  Cons: - While playing as the Alien, the Alien's fast speed does cause the camera to go all over the place. This may cause motion sickness. -Level design may cause some confusion since there are no maps and some parts of some levels may look the same as other parts. -Objectives can be tedious as sometimes you may or may not know what to do / where to go. Objectives are given by messages that pop up on the top of the screen, but they can easily be missed. -Graphics have not aged that well, but their decent for the time. The graphics kind of look like Half-Life 1's graphics.  Overall, (8.5/10) AVP Classic 2000 is a really good game. However, this game does have some flaws and is a bit challenging at times (but it can be completed if you have a lot of paitence). If your fine with the cons and are an Alien / Predator fan, then this game is for you.",

            "review_text": "Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is an absolutely excellent game.  This game (On normal mode) Is very challenging on all three species to play with. I personally enjoy the Marine missions the most, due to the terrifying atmosphere and fast, tight, and frantic First-Person-Shooter gameplay. This game doesn't rely on simple jumpscares to be a scary game... it has real atmosphere. The Aliens are so smart and every time I hear one of their famous screeches... (nearby or far from me) I frantically spin around and search all over. (And believe me... when you turn around and unsuspectingly find an Alien behind you... it's a real treat. You'll fire your pulse rifle with such intensity... This game just really draws you in. If you (Like I was at first) are nervous about the game being too scary, just know that it still is a brilliant blend between an Action Packed First-Person-Shooter that even a real scaredy-cat like me can enjoy this game thoroughly.   The other campaigns are... you guessed it, GREAT.   The Alien missions are all centered on some stealth and puzzle solving, and you will move at near BLINDING speeds, taking out anything that stands between you and the end of the level. I love being able to attack in a variety of ways, including lashing out your tail or slashing at your enemies with a swift scratch from your claws. The multiplayer with Aliens only is incredible. It gets really competitive as you dash toward your enemies... instincts set to kill. It feels awesome to overpower every marine (Or Predator for that matter) with the Xenomorph class.  The third campaign, focused on the Predator is very focused on stealth (Turning invisible, sneaking up behind enemies, etc.) You have many ways to attack your enemies. This campaign is pretty great, you will feel very overpowered as you hack through your enemies. There are many fun to use gadgets to take out your enemies, and you can zoom in and snipe or just go all out close combat with your opponents. This class is really awesome to play with during multiplayer, always silent but deadly as the Predator class.  This game really nails it's atmosphere, despite the somewhat dated graphics (Hey, it's from 1999-2000!) The sound is excellent and the dramatic music comes at just the right time to keep the game tense. This game was great for it's time... and still remains a classic that any fan of Aliens (Or any newcomers to the franchise) MUST pick up. At a very affordable price point of $4.99 this game offers so much, including Campaigns, Multiplayer, Survival Mode, and hours and hours of pure ALIEN FUN! I enthusiastically recommend this game.   Now... I need to get back to work on fighting off hordes of Aliens...",

            "review_text": "Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is one of my all-time favorite first person shooters. It does tremendous justice to the source material upon which it is based and is one of the finest examples of an excellent game based around movie licenses.  The alien, predator, and marne campaigns all play very differently from one another. The strengths and weaknesses peculiar to each species really make the online multiplayer experience something special, although predators and marines do move absurdly fast during deathmatches. It seems like the developer was trying to balance movement between the species, but doing this by artificially speeding up marines and predators to move as quickly as aliens just seems wrong. Movement speeds are normal in skirmish matches, which I prefer to deathmatches.  Although AVP's online netcode is peer-to-peer based, it is easily the best impementation of P2P netcode I have ever experienced. In fact, it consistently outperforms dedicated servers for other games - even when I play AVP with players from across the world while stationed in mainland China (which has some of the worst internet anywhere).  There is still an online community for this game, and the regular players tend to be very down to earth and friendly. Unfortunately, you may encounter the odd cheater from time to time, but the Steam port allows you to set up private games with your friends. It would have been better if players were given tools to kick and ban cheaters from their games by way of vote, but considering how well native netcode was incorporated into a game this old, it's hard to complain about that (or the lack of native voicechat.)  As great as the online experience is, it's hard for me to say enough positive things about the single player campaigns. While there is a very minimal sense of plot, you do feel like you have purpose to your actions and that all the carnage the unfolds does so for good reason.  The atmosphere and tension in the game are incredible. When ambushed by aliens, you can easily die a sudden death. Aliens pose a very real threat to the player and do not strike exclusively during scripted sequences (like in the game's sequels). What that means is that you'll need to be on your toes at all times while playing this game. Its hard but fair, and that's the way I like it. AVP has treated me to some of the most startling moments I've ever experienced, and it's nice knowing that I can experience those kinds of moments again and again despite how much time I've spent enjoying the game.  If you're going to play the alien campaign, be aware that the very first stage is probably the most difficult one you'll encounter. That's because is so easy to be nearly burned to death from the moment you encounter the first human carrying a molotov cocktail, and there are many of them throughout the stage. Not only are you very likely to be slowly incinerated by their concoctions if they are thrown anywhere in your general vacinity, but also if you kill a human who happens to be carrying one.  As an alien, it's also very easy to get mowed down by stage 1's automated machine gun turrents unless you can find a way to sneak around them. A viable - but also very challenging - alternative to overcoming those obstacles is to crawl on ceilings and dart past the turrents at a 60 degree angle.  It took me many, many replays before I was finally able to develop a good sense of how to overcome stage 1's cocktail-wielding humans and automated machine gun turrents. Had I known that you can enable unlimited saves by saving a command line in the game's launch options, I could have saved myself a lot of frustrating but strangely fun chalenge while trying to beat the first alien stage.  While doing business abroad, I was able to play AVP perfectly with full settings on a friggin' netbook. Not even the original Doom or Heretic can run on that kind of hardware without occasional slowdown when launched with Zandronum or zDoom.  In conclusion, AVP Classic 2000 is one of the very best puchases I have ever made, even though I owned the retail version of the game prior to buying the Steam port for convenient online multiplayer access. Get this game now, even if there is no discount at the time you are reading this review. The game is worth it, and then some. I tip my hat to Rebellion software for this great game.  MY RATING FOR AVP CLASSIC 2000 (ACROSS VARIOUS KEY FACTORS):  Graphics: 7.5 / 10. They were pretty good at the time of the game's release, and there are moments when the game's visuals still inspire awe, like the waterfall at the end of the predator's first stage.  Sound: 10 / 10.  Single-player content: 10 / 10.  Online experience: 9.5 / 10. The native matchmaking system that was incorporated into the 'Classic 2000' port of the game is very good, and the game's netcode is - in my experience - unparalleled. Even though the netcode is P2P-based, it consistently outperformes many dedicated servers supporting other games. The main reason why the game doesn't get a perfect score in this category is because the absence of dedicated servers means that sometimes you have to wait a while until someone joins an online game that you host for lack of being able to find an online match to connect to. Other than incorporating native voice chat and giving players a voting system for banning cheaters / jerks / etc., there isn't much more that I could ask for from the game's excellent multiplayer component.  Plot: 6 / 10. This is the game's weakest link. There really isn't much of a plot to the game, but there are videos that play on monitors as you progress through the single-player modes. You can ignore the videos if you like, but Rebellion deserves credit for incorporating these clips into the game without slowing it down for those who want to focus on action. To be fair, the game intended to showcase atmosphere over plot and really did a fine job in that regard. (It's like the original Quake, albeit with scripted FMV playback that gives purpose to new challenges you experience.)  Gameplay: 10 / 10. Incredible! Play the game and experience the terror, the suspense, and the frantic action for yourself!  Overall: 88 / 100",

Before easter eggs and achievements and shiny objective markers guiding your way, you cursed a game as you first hugged the left wall of a level, and then right, all while furiously pressing 'e' and dodging enemies in the hopes of finding that last switch needed to progress to the next portion of the stage.

It's cheap, it's retro, and you know what? It's good too.  I was surprised how similar the mechanics were to the enjoyable 2010 version, and the reason is, I believe, this game hit the nail right on the head with gameplay. You can choose from 3 campaigns: Marine, Xenomorph and Predator and each one is very very different. And what's more, it's challenging, which is great. With each character you play as you must adopt different strategies based on their strengths and weaknesses to successfully hunt each character you fight based on THEIR strengths and weaknesses. For example, as Predator, while you can tear through Marines, they can easily overwhelm you so you adopt stealth. But then, stealth won't work on a Xenomorph because they always know where you are. So you end up having to deploy about seven or eight different strategies across the game to beat your opponents. This is much more in-depth than I expected this game to be.  Having said that, it still holds that arcade feel to it, you can pick it up and put it down whenever because the game knows what it is. Gruesome, stabby, shooty, sneaky, face-munching action.

It's got good controls and an almost QUAKE style of movement where you can almost outrun the aliens without any serious impact on accuracy. This is very much an early 2000's shooter, and still retains the charm of games of the era while still being appreciable for the modern times.  The problems come about when it comes to the story mode, primarily. The Marine is probably the best character with a wide array of weapons to choose from, very little platforming necessary, and with probably the minimal amount of save scumming required. The predator come second, because again, diverse weapons and limited platforming, but with the bonus of being able to cloak and use genuine stealth tactics appropriate for the early 2000s. But then comes the Alien. The xenomorph is undoubtedly one of the most unplayable characters, and this seems to be a trend among games featuring the Alien because platforming is a huge deal, which can be a problem. When you're a marine or a predator, you can find your way around because you're only limited to the floor. The alien, meanwhile, can go everywhere there's a surface, which means you'll spend a bunch of time crawling on walls and ceilings and ultimately end up lost without a walkthrough. While all the characters necessitate a walkthrough, because this did come from the age when video games hated telling the player things, it gets even worse when you can literally end up lost in the vents for a good thirty minutes going in circles at about 100 miles per hour.  The combat is pretty solid for all characters. Enemies become easily detatched from their limbs, flames and explosions are catastrophic, and when you hit some dude with lazer forged wristblades he's not gonna have a good time. The marine is exclusively ranged, the alien is exclusively melee, and the predator contains a mix of the two.  The graphics are actually pretty nice for a game made in 2000. Imagine Oblivion or Fallout 3 but with super primitive articulation. The textures can be a bit of a problem, as they never seem to mask when a wall or a floor is outright flat, making it especially hard to find a switch that just blends into the graphic.   All in all, I'd recommend checking a playthrough of the game played in Skirmish mode before actually buying it. It'd be good to get on sale to try out, as it stands on the combat alone, but if you're going to do any of the stories make sure to have a walkthrough available because one can not be faulted for getting stuck in the story.",

            "review_text": "RATING: 6/10  Aliens Versus Predator: Classic 2000 is exactly how it sounds. It's a reenvisioned version of the first AVP game with an enhanced engine and intuitive combat. The xenomorph and predator designs are beautiful despite the aged graphics.  THE GOOD: The game does a stellar job of showing off the ferocity of the iconic xenomorphs. However, they don't seem as threateningly intelligent as those in the movies. Most of the time, they simply rush at you heedlessly and are little more than average cannon fodder for those weilding a pulse rifle. Combat controls are responsive and easy to handle, and a wide range of weaponry and attacks are available to each class.  THE BAD: The bad part is the story, which truly killed it. Although the level design is good, the storyline in itself is horrendous. In fact, I didn't even know what the story was for any of the campaigns. All I know is that some fat guy on the televisions was telling me where to go and what to do, which was basically kill this, kill that, get here and complete the level. Another demoralizng part is the fact that each campaign starts and ends with a beautifully detailed CGI cutscene, but then immediatey transitions into the hideous textures of the actual game. The lack of direction as to what you should do forces players to save constantly, as you will inevitably see many cheap deaths in each campaign. Not even the extra levels beyond the main campaign are very good, as they have little to no dialogue and just give you an extra gun or a jetpack to shoot more xenomorphs. As no one ever plays the multiplayer, I can't say anything for that, and every time I try to play the other game modes, it doesn't load, which is odd considering that I have a very good computer. The part that annoyed me the most, however, was the terrible musical score, which was just annoying and nonsensical.  VERDICT: If you're a fan of the xenomorphs or the predators, then you may enjoy this game. But if you like story, prepare for frustration, because this game has none. Graphics are hideous in comparison to other games made in this era and the enemy AI are simply stupid and kill you in cheap ways. Overall, you aren't missing anything by not playing this game.",

Graphic are not the best but come on, it came out in 1998 give it a break (they are not that bad for the time). Gameply is very fun and unique for each race. As the Alien you must run fast, be sneaky and take out your foes. As marine you go guns blazing. I am not a fan of the predator however so sorry. The campains (even tho i have not beaten them yet) are vey fun and have a decent story to them. Only problem is that there is no objective marker so you can get lost easily. Multilayer is also Very with many kinds of gamemode you can play (you will mostly fine DM, SDM or coop survival.)   So overal i give this game a 9.5/10 only reason not a full 10/10 is cause of the few glitches and the VERY OP predator in mutilpayer. Other than that this is a must have any AvP fan! :)",

AVP Classic was one of the first games to allow players to manipulate the timeframe and spawn enemy models into the game at will. The atmopshere is tense and the lighting adds a brooding sense of menace that the aliens and predators make even more startling when they appear. In terms of multiplayer, this game will offer a nice look into what evolved into the modern COD games.

Though my current time on Steam may be a bit lacking back in the early 2000's as a young lad i put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game. Back when i had the physical discs and had to jerryrrig it to run on my gateway pos family pc. This game exists in a weird spot between the old guard of Doom, WOlfenstein, Quake, Unreal and Duke Nukem but before Halo, COD (as a non ww2 shooter), CS and TF2. It's difficualt without being too punishing, a great story for each race without being verbose. And each campaign feels unique and handled with care staying true to the source material of films and comics. Overall if you are a fan of the franchise this is as good as it gets really. Sure the graphics arent that great anymore but all in all this truly is the best AVP game ever made in my humble opinion. 10/10",
