            "review_text": "Okay !!! After quite an extensive run and being stuck at the moment ( and refusing any outside help). I thought it might eb a good idea to write a review of this game as a sort of catharsis after hat I went through.  First thing first, if I had to describe Labyronia, I'll say that the game lives up to its namesake, because this is a god damn MAZE !!! No really, I've never felt that lost in a game, you'll spend hour trying to figure out the exit of an area with no reliable way to keep track on where you're going. You'll bash your head in frustration on your keyboard and pray David Bowie to get you out of here, but the only thing you'll get will be an ankward glare from your roommate. To make the matter worse, this game really likes backtracking ... and it'll make sure that you must return multiple time in the same location to get in a SPECIFIC area (odds are that you'll find it randomly most of the time).   Devs say they took inspiration from pokemon for their game. That statement is quite true, type advantage is key for winning battles in this game. They even brought you memorable feature from Pokemon such as 'the run in a cave without Flash with Zubats everywhere'. Unfortunately, no escape rope or dig, which I think would have been great features in this game considering the lenght of certain dungeons without a shortcut to the exit when done ( from what I've seen you get a blimp later on in the game, but you'll have to get through 8 hours of walking to get that reward, and I hope you can actualy use it to fast travel the world map). An other thing regarding the battle system and which pained me is that it seems that some fights are neraly impossible without a specific item or spell. And I'm not talking about quest item or plot spell ! No I'm taling about easely missable features that will bite you in the ♥♥♥ later if you don't have them for the battle. A sound exemple will be for the Chimera, if you go unprepared, you'll find that this fight is impossible no matter how much you try because of one ability that prevent your character from doing anything during the fight (you're bloody petrify). Of course there is only one way to go around that ability, but it's NOT in the dungeon ! No it's some special boots that make you immune to stunt and petrify ailments and are sold by only one merchant that happened to be on the other side from where you standing, and that you came by 2 hours ago !!! Needless to say, the reason if I'm currently stuck in the game is because I just happened to bump into another creature like that; and I can't defeat it because somehow I missed again the missable item that I need to beat it ( and it's not even a boss !! ) .  Other than that, I'll say battle are pretty challenging and rewarding when you do have the key elements needed, ennemies actions are not randomize but follow a pattern of actions that they repeat over and over in the same order, alloing you to play around these actions to take minimal damages from punishing blow while destroying your opponent when his guard is open.  Now regarding the story, so far there is not much exposition, which is a good thing ! The story is your to discover through books and dialogues which are quite extensive and well written ( despite some being forced and cringe worthy, trust me you'll understand me when you get to the desert level). Unfortunately I've failed so far to find the main character interesting ( granted I don't find him annoying and it's kind of reflreshing to have a mature man for a lead character), I feel like the dev were focusing to much on his backstory ( which is great) to give him actual character traits, so far none that he'd displayed stroke me as memorable and some were kind of contradicting themselve ...  I don't have much to say about the supportive cast considering I've not seen much of them for now, just that I recruited my first party member after 7 hours of gameplay which is kinda long, and it seems like you have to a GLORIOUS amount of backtracking in past areas if you want to unlock new power for them (and again there is no way to tell if any of them is going to prove MANDATORY in the future).  Now despite, all the backlashes, I still don't hate this game, it's like dark souls playing with your nerves and pushing you to the limit of self-destruction. It's quite remarkable that I'm still able to enjoy a game that frustrating. To be honest, the game is quite well made for an RPG Maker game. Sure it doesn't go overboard and use it's own sprite our illustration (hell even that thumbnail for the game lokks like vergil from Dmc ) but it's still quite charming with the world their proposing.  To top it off, the game is not expensive at all, you'll have a run for your money so no reason for not buying it.",

            "review_text": "For the price of Labyronia RPG, is a fun game made with RPG Maker. Good story and easy to follow. Basically, the 4 Gods of Labyronia created labyrinths with a magical pendant that caused a bunch of monsters to appear. Arres, who is a very talented mage, sets out to see why this was done and if he can put a stop to it. Along the way to save the 'world' you will encounter all sorts of enemies that will try to stop you.  After the Intro you are forced to explore the world. But it helps you learn the map and know where to go quickly. Lots of puzzles / labyrinths to solve. Good music and map texture. The game will open in a small window size but you can ALT + ENTER on the keyboard to run any game or program in fullsreen mode and it works here.  I normally watch people play these RPG games. But do enjoy playing this game myself.",

            "review_text": "If you've played the old Final Fantasy titles, Shining Force, or old school RPGs - this game will feel very nostalgic.   It gives the same sense of reward for being attentive, thorough, and patient. I finished it in one go, split between 2 days. Was it a game worth the time? Definitely. Otherwise I wouldn't have put in the hours. Was it a game worth for the price? (I paid half because it was on sale) Yes. Easily 18+ hours if you're a fan of puzzles and exploration.  But be warned, if you're the kind who likes being spoon fed on where to go and being strung along on every game mechanic - this game is not for you.  This game literally throws you in with no tutorial. There is a story that progresses, but its minor and most of the time you'll be too preoccupied on trying to find just that small bit of information, or clue, to help you proceed. The story itself isn't polished. I myself cringed at a few script dialogues and cliched instances. But it is one that was unique in its own and one that carried me towards the end.  Overall, it is a good game for its price and the effort put into it. Just don't expect Square Enix level of content because it isn't. But it does have the soul of one,",

            "review_text": "♥♥♥♥♥ water shrine   EDIT: Okay, here is the real review xD.  Pros:  This game has very simple controls and you don't even need a tutorial to learn how to fight and control your character, it's that simple.  Hours of gameplay in store. I know that I don't have very many hours, but I still tell that there is a lot of game in store for me.  Very cheap for what it is worth. This game is masterpiece and I think that the developers should bump up the price. I got it for around $2 on sale, and it is at least $5 - $10.  Cons:  Some parts are slow and take a lot of patience. But really, is everything in a video game going to be action packed all the time? No.  You have to grind a bit. This isn't a huge problem in the game, but you just need a little patience.  ♥♥♥♥♥ Water Shrine. (It really isn't bad or a con, I am just impatient when running through it xD).   Overall, this game is very enjoyable to me and I love playing it. I would definitely recommend this to people who like the Final Fantasy Series 1-6, Chrono Trigger, and any RPGs.",

            "review_text": "Recently having finished Labyronia RPG, this classic game is one of the most challenging and yet enjoyable RPGs I have ever played. Upon first glance, it appears to be a basic RPG where you have the opportunity to explore areas, engage in battles, etc., and although this game does have those elements, there are other elements that make it unique from other such similar games.  Basically, you start off with your one main party member (Arres) who doesn't appear to have much of a history. All he knows is that he has a mission to complete although he doesn't know the reason (which, of course, is later revealed as you progress). As you get to explore new areas, you'll find out that the way to learn new magic skills is unique. In most RPGs, you learn new skills by simply leveling up. However, in Labyronia, you learn new skills through cues. Basically, these are items that you have to touch as you explore new areas and certain cues can only be used for certain party members.   As in most RPGs, you have the chance to earn money by defeating monsters and that money can be used to buy better weapons and equipment. Also, there are two additional party members that can be recruited although that happens quite late in the game. I did find that aspect to be a little annoying although considering the storyline, I can understand now why that had to happen.  A very noticeable element of this game is the implementation of labyrinths (or very complicated mazes). They make the game challenging and although I would consider myself to be pretty adept when it comes to playing RPGs, the labyrinths were quite confusing so I had difficulty at times figuring out which way to go. However, as I have completed the game, I was able to figure them out eventually.  There is a lot to explore and figure out in Labyronia aside from simply following the main quest. I took the time to explore the optional elements such as the   fire labyrinth, which wasn't required to complete the game but doing so gave me additional useful items  . It's definitely worth it to take the time to explore as many areas as possible, to get the most out of this game.  For the price, Labyronia is definitely worth adding to your Steam library, especially if you're a fan of RPGs and you want a challenge. Also, this game cannot be completed quickly so it's worth taking a look. ^^",

            "review_text": "Has some problems. Aside from standard issues I see in a lot of RPG maker games (repeating conversations that are meant to happen once, inability to use WASD for movement, out of place slang, and minor grammatical issues sporadically throughout) this game is very confusing.  The opening scene is meant to be dramatic, but I was just left with the feeling that large pieces of the story were missing. Then there's actually navigating the world. The entire story is based on Labyrinths, which can lead to some frustration, but my main problem was figuring out where I was supposed to go next.   I finally stopped when I got to a point where everywhere I went was either blocked by rocks, or full of instant death battles. I got this game in a bundle for what amounts to 18 cents, so I'll keep it and come back eventually to see if I can make it to the end, but I can't recommend it. There are better RPG maker games available for free.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Labyronia RPG with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.   Before I even began playing, I already had a gripe: Labyronia was not built for HD. Yes, I know that the art style mimics that of old SNES RPGs but that is no excuse for looking absolutely janky when in fullscreen. Following up the poor initial presentation was a story that was... cheesy? I find it difficult to accurately describe it. There are Gods who have a super power ancient artifact, non-gods are at war with them, non-gods lose and the world is fractured into X number of factions/regions, etc. It’s not quite “cookie-cutter” but very generic for these types of games.   Speaking of broad stereotyping of RPG maker games, the opening scene-as if following the cliche template bullet for bullet-begins with you waking up in your bedroom. At least others give some quasi-convincing exposition for why you of all the inhabitants of the world are going to begin a journey to defeat the prior specified evil. Labyronia opens with “Time to fight this evil, which I am qualified to do because I have magic and skills. Let me get my sword out of the chest.” I don’t think a game has ever motivated me less.   So what was my gameplay experience like? I wandered around the room and clicked on things (like you do) bringing me to the first straw: the default key binding for interacting with anything is O (B for 360 pads). Yes this is a almost pointless gripe, but I was curled up and comfy in bed with no desire to get up to the keyboard to remap it. I sucked it up and headed out side, using the button ubiquitously responsible for cancel/escape to talk to people. In the process I managed to open my inventory, a critical RPG feature which I have no idea how to access since the only button pressed thus far has been O/B. This led to the acquisition of straw number two. I got out of bed determined to figure out all the buttons once and for all via the F1 menu. This was the most horrendous mapping interface I have ever seen; gamepad buttons were mapped to random letters with no explanation as to what they actually did. I couldn’t be bothered to decrypt this menu so I returned to the game for the final straw. I COULD NOT leave the inventory screen. For those who are thinking “Oh, you just don’t have the button mapped to the controller correctly”, you’re right. Do you know where else it wasn’t mapped? ANYWHERE. I pushed every-and I do mean every- button on the keyboard and mouse and nothing did more than give me a rude buzzer.   RPG Maker shovel-ware is a dime a dozen (often literally) and unless you offer something mindblowing out of the gate, any small flaw or defect can become a dealbreaker. I have a key for Labyronia RPG 2 which is next on my roster; here’s hoping they have polished it up considerably.",

            "review_text": "Well... that was certainly an adventure.  Labyronia is obviously similar to Finaly Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger as it states, though it has taken inspirations from these games, it is its own game entirely and I reccomend playing it.  Lets start of with the negatives: -Lack of Story until the end - For the most part you're just gathering these crystals because of a hunch and the story doesn't start unravelling till the end  - No Directive - This game doesn't tell you where to go from the start, it just puts you in and if you end up going to Ferdel Forest, like most people do, you'll continuously die no matter what you try and get frustrated, this almost made me quit at the start  - All mobs are extremely hard without grinding - If you want to be able to easily get past monsters, grind your heart out because thats the only way you're going to travel through with a breeze. I reccomend fighting random monsters around Jenise until you're level 12 then go to the deep grotto past Ferdel Forest and farm were wolves, when you get the baloon go south of the desert to a dirt island, the monsters there give you 15k exp per kill.  -The love story just happens - He meets the girl and is like all of a sudden 'I wanna hold you in my arms, I love you' with no real conversation besides complimenting each others eyes.  Now the Pros  -Nostalgic Feel - it has the clasic rpg feel and it brings back memories from the days of playing Final Fantasy  -Rewarding for your hard work - The harder you work to complete this game, the more cues, levels and gear you get, the better you feel afterwards when you can kill mobs that you couldn't before with ease.  -Good Story - Even though the story takes a long time to develop, it is a good story.  -Good Gameplay - Its got the classic rpg gameplay, the gameplay that made RPG games the games they are now.  I reccomend this game to any of you RPG enthusiasts or RPGMAKER fans.",

            "review_text": "This game is surprisingly addictive, offering a good blend of story-driven content, regular fight scenes, hidden loot and the ability to trade in towns. If you are a fan of Ultima and other early fantasy titles, you should enjoy this game.   From the start, the encounters with monsters prove quite challenging. If you choose to fight rather than escape, it is worth saving often to avoid death.  In my opinion the graphics look best when playing zoomed out in a window, rather than full screen (toggle using F5/F6). The soundtrack keeps things interesting and, at times, the music choices really add to the atmosphere of the scenes. The controls are also very simple to use.  The only downside I can foresee is that once the quests are complete, there is limited replay-ability. On the plus-side though, there is Labyronia 2 and Mysteria to follow.   At such a low price, Labyronia is really worth exploring.",

            "review_text": "I'm a person that loves RPG Maker games; my avatar's the Batter from OFF, for crying out loud. I enjoy going on  rpgmaker.net  and seeing the things that some people can make. A lot of people stereotype RPG Maker games to be low effort when there's just as many games that have care put into them, with original graphics and everything.  But this game - and all other games by the creator - symbolizes that stereotype.  Labryonia just seems to use the default assets provided by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine along with some resources that seem to be pulled from resource packs. The only original things seem to be those book pages you find lying around every now and then, but even then they all just seem like text pasted onto a page template. As for the story, it's pretty much humdrum elemental stuff. If you're in for an incredibly basic JRPG experience, sure, it's fine, but as some games like To the Moon demonstrates, RPG Maker could be used to tell incredible stories, and sadly Labryonia is as bland as it is uninspired.  My play time looks short, yes, but the beginning parts of the game looks like an omen of mediocrity to come. Allow me to rant. The first, real dungeon of the game is the Water Labyrinth. The first dungeon of a game should be easy and interesting (though not overly interesting - the real fascinating stuff should be saved for toward the end), but this dungeon is neither. It's like the Hell Maze from Yume Nikki except somehow worse, and it's real easy to get lost an/or hit dead-ends. The whole dungeon is blue. It's an eyesore. There is little varience in dungeon design as well, save for the occasional red crystal. See, you're supposed to find all these red crystals to open the door to the boss... but of course these crystals are hidden all throughout the dungeon so you'll be stuck with the tedious and eye-killing task of walking around the badly designed dungeon. There are two reprieves though, I'll have to admit. Thankfully encounters in dungeons are on-screen and not random encounters; if they were, I would have dropped the game right then and there. Secondly, there is an item that gives you regenerating AP (the game's version of MP), so you'll be able to heal off any damage you take. If you're sincerely playing this game, I recommend picking this up. Meanwhile, the actual boss fight is manageable - if extremely tedious like everything else.  Now that is not a good way to start a game off. Games should ease you into the experience, not bore or frustrate you into senselessness, but Labryonia did just that. I'm honestly shocked that this game has such a good rating on Steam. If  rpgmaker.net  had more users and momentum, I'm sure that the game would have gotten completely savaged like most other low-effort works. In all honesty, the only reason why I picked this and the second game up is because it was dirt cheap and I'm a sucker for easy Steam cards.  Do you want a good RPG Maker game? This is not one. I recommend going on RPG Maker sites and poking around for anything good. I personally recommend Grist of Flies and HOME if you're looking for anything recent-ish. Want to throw your money at an RPG Maker game? Why not give Lisa: The Painful RPG and To the Moon a go instead of this?  But then again, this game is dirt cheap, so why not?  (If there is one thing to praise about this game though, I like the idea of gaining skills from certain sources. If this was a good game this would push the player to explore, providing incentive beyond a chest full of gold or items. Too bad this isn't a good game.)",

The characters aren't particularly impressive, but as this is the first game in a series, it can be expected that they will be further developed in later games. The exploration (which is almost always rewarded with rare treasures) and the lore (books to read are scattered throughout) are, in my opinion, the strengths of Labyronia. The combat isn't particularly impressive, but there are certain fights that will require strategy, usually in the form of utilizing a specific 'cue,' the game's version of spells/arts.   Criticisms include the aforementioned lackluster character design/development, a few glitches (specific interactions with a few choice NPCs that essentially freeze the game), and the confusion that comes from navigating a few of the game's looping areas (namely Alathar and the Desert of Illusions).

This games combat uses much of the defaults included in the software with noticeable changes such as parts edited on enemy battlers which were not too bad, no playable character sprites on screen and the usual Attack; Defend; Magic; Item actions. The problem with combat is that I had one character the entire time and it was mostly me using the same attack commands unless I had to heal. I can only say that the good thing about enemies is that they are run-into except in the over world.   Another problem is movement. I was never sure where to go to progress the story and I got stuck twice because I was navigating through mazes rather than dungeons with multiple paths that are easy to identify if your are going the right way or have already been there.  I do not recommend anyone play this game even as to view an example of the execution of peoples creations with RPG Maker VX Ace. There are other games made with this software that can be played for free and if you want RPGs that may be worth it, play those that are over 10 years old like those this game claims to be inspired by or what I recommend: Suikoden II.",

If you want a nice and easy retro style RPG with updated graphics then this isn't it, it requires alot of waiting but when you finally hit a certain point in the game that you have been working towards for ages it is so rewarding for example hitting 1,000 gold, reaching level 10, having your inventory stocked with superb gear.  If you want to spend hours in a game and have fun with rewarding gameplay then BUY this game!! if not move on.",

Then without any kind of directions you are just 'left' there to find it all out for yourself.  At some point you come across an ice area (where you can be stuck for hours if you do not systematically search the place.  To make matters worse there is a similar area, but this time it's a desert..... which is even bigger it seems.  The game is fun, until you are forced to comb every inch of an 'looping' area to find GOD knows what, so you can move onto the next.",

That way if somebody has no clue where to go, they can get a push in the right direction. I tried the forums, but no one ever replied to me. -_____- so I'm stuck. but maybe a guide will come out sooner or later. Hopefully, sooner. fun game so far and cool storyline/concept.",

The story is solid and i really digged the 'Cue System' (perfectly complimenting the perfectionist in me).  Definetly going to play every game of this Saga. :)",

In the end, I still completed the game and I have to say, the continuation of the story, it does keep you interested just enough to keep playing and find out what happens in the end.  I quite enjoyed spending countless hours reading through the 'books' within the game, and exploring everywhere to try and gain the best items.

He was suffering from memory loss, sense of self, and random behaviors so it was hard to get to know him. So much about him felt like a mismatch.   The story felt somewhat typical with the twist being the labyrinths. I did not like the labyrinths most the time. They were tedious and frequently I was at a loss on what to do or where to go.   The turn-based battles, when they weren't over the top random, were enjoyable. We never got to see the enemies hit points and as a strategist I would have liked to see those but now I'm just whining.  Game has promise but due to unappealing storyline and mindless wandering I can not recommend.",
