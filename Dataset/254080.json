They are rather large skirmishes, and I mena LARGE, I was honestly surprised to see the number of AI you could add, it was this feature, really that made the game so much fun for me, the large scale rts battles made this well worth the, less than a dollar, I spent on it. In terms of gameplay it is rather standard and sometimes tedious, though despite all its short comings, I'd say if it's on sale, pick it up if you want another rts, nothing too special but for less than a dollar you get your money's worth.",

I see some games made in 2015 that are terrible; just because it's outdated don't tell yourself not to get it.",
