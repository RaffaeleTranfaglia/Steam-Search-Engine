            "review_text": "Take parts of HoMM 3 and Kinds bounty, make a few changes and you got Braveland.  Not very complex battle stratagy, and other then a few battles, you don't need to change tactics. The best feature that shines above other grid turn-based is the units killed are revived at the end (you just lose gold) so you don't have to hold your melee back so the archer/mages can wear the enemy down.  There are 10 spells, but found just one worth using 95% of the time, ice bolt. 7 different troups, can use 5 at a time, but not very many good (in my opinion) combinations.  Play on Hard if you want a bit of a challange. It is a short fun game, it would be great if it could be expanded with a lot more variaty of troops/enemys with different skills. For just $7 it is fun.",

            "review_text": "Unlike the first game, I found this one to be more complex, if ever so slightly. For me, that's a good thing. I would say Braveland Wizard is great for both kids/beginners to the genre AND more experienced players who want more of a challenge by playing on the hardest setting.    PROS   - Hardest difficulty is actually hard (unlike the first game) - New leveling system, slightly more complex with more choices to make - Minor choices to choose your path (unlike the first game) - Can go back to certain levels to play or grind again and again (unlike the first game) - Two endings to the game (unlike the first game)  - Family friendly, good for kids - Cute graphics   CONS   - Game layout and style are much the same as the first - The achievements are mostly the same as the first game - Forced tutorial the first time playing  Overall, this is a much better game than the first one was, and I wish I had just begun with this and skipped the first entirely.",

        {
            "review_text": "Dear developer, I really enjoyed the first game, but grinding low level dungeons is not how you increase the gameplay time. If I have to finish a dungeon 20 times to proceed with more battles, at least make dungeon monsters level up with me so it will give me more and more money.",

            "review_text": "While this game is okay, possibly even good, it is some much worse that the pervious. You get a standard reward for each stag quest level. In the pervious game you got a gold and XP rate based on how well you do, making upgrading worth while, here however if you can just scrape through a level or win it outright you get the same reward.   It is also very inimaginative after the Pirets game that game you different islands to explore, this game has gone back to the one world verison we saw in the first game,  it offers more level from the first game but i feel it is a step back even from that (and I was so looking forward to playing it!).   If you are considering buying one of these games forthe first time i would say just go for the first two, if you feel you want to play all three i'd recommend playing this one, then the first, then Pirets.   I'd have rated this mixed if it was an option, but thumbs up or down I've gone for down.  Overall...  Sadly disapointed (though still playing the game)",
