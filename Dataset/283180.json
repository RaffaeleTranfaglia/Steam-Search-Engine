The game is a standard point and click affair, and has very little replay value. With that said the game was better than I thought it would be. The puzzles were challenging. The artwork was nice, and for what appears to be an indie title the English Voice acting is great. The story was a roller coaster right till the end. I enjoyed the ending. It is worth the price of admission. If you enjoy point and click adventure games I reccomend this game.",
