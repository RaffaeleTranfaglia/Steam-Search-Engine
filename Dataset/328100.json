            "review_text": "Gunspell does its best to give us an experience suited for PC users, but sadly fails in doing this. Let me get one thing perfectly clear; there’s nothing wrong with the port itself, but you can clearly see that the game originates from its original platform, the mobile phone.  If you’ve ever played Puzzle Quest, or basically any match-3 game, you should exactly know what to expect. The gameplay consist of matching three or more of the same gems and where you normally score points by doing this, in Gunspell you’ll be doing damage with these gems. Or you can earn energy to execute a skill. All you have to do is match the correct gems. In this case you have gems with purple ‘hearts’ in them that will reward you with experience, silver gems that will earn you money and skulls that will damage your opponent. The other colors will be used for performing your own moves, like shooting a gun or using a shield. Nothing groundbreaking here, and it works the same way as any other match-3 game. In fact, Gunspell is pretty much a copy of Puzzle Quest and while there are subtle differences the majority plays exactly the same way. The game starts off pretty easy and you’ll be completing quests without any trouble, but after a couple of hours things will pick up and opponents will then sometimes have twice your health, if not more. The difficulty then ramps up, because your enemies can do tons of damage if you’re unlucky. Luck plays a big factor in this game because the gems are randomly generated and you never know what you’re going to get. Of course, this also works the other around. But your skills usually aren’t powerful enough to execute more than 200-300 damage, especially in the beginning. Quests are generated by following the story. Playing the story usually unlocks sidequests as well, and these can all have different rewards, ranging from experience and currency to items. When you’re not battling enemies you can use the world map to get to a different destination. There are stashes, caves and portals to find. Stashes reward you with items and portals allow you to travel to other parts of the in-game world to battle even more enemies. Caves are used to gather loot and occasionally fight some more enemies. Using in-game currency you can often banish these creatures, except if that creature is part of a (side)quest, of course. Which brings me to the following: as you may have already read the game originates from mobile phones and it’s obvious that the can was made as some sort of free-to-play game with the option to buy more currency and items with real life money. This version is absolutely 100% free, but you can still unlock and buy things with in-game currency. Your inventory, for both normal items and magic, is limited to one slot by default. You can unlock more slots by buying them. But this just doesn’t work in a PC version and it makes the game feel cheap and, above all, repetitive. After a couple of hours you probably don’t even feel like playing anymore, because progress is slow and you don’t want to buy every little thing you see. These things should unlock naturally, by doing and completing quests. I don’t want to perform mind-numbing tasks in order to be able to buy better gear. Quest rewards were made just for that. And while defeated enemies also drop loot these items, with the exception of a few, are most of the times worthless. It’s actually painful to see a game like this appear, because it definitely has potential and to this day there are still plenty of people waiting for a next Puzzle Quest (PQII was a-ma-zing !). Just not like this. If it was made with PC in mind then a game like this could be awesome. I’m just saying.  The graphics are a bit blurry, and seem upscaled, but they’re created with plenty of detail; I was impressed by them. There are some small animations going on from time to time, but nothing big. The HUD is crowded, and there’s too much going on sometimes, but overall it was designed pretty well. Same goes for the soundtrack really.  Gunspell could’ve been so much more, but instead it feels like a cheap attempt at making some money. I don’t think there’s a way to fix it now, it would need too much tinkering for that, but I just hope that their next game is made with more respect than this. That is, if it’s coming to PC. Because God knows we all need a new, proper Puzzle Quest game… even if it’s a carbon copy with a different theme.  [Rating: 69/100]",

Easy to start but it becomes more and more challenging while hero gets new levels. I can't say there are much games in this genre that worth playing, but Gunspell surely does.",

            "review_text": "Decent match-3 RPG, but it's a mobile port of a freemium game, which they have not managed to balance out properly when porting it to a b2p desktop game. There are clear paywalls they haven't balanced out, the premium currency should probably have been removed completely..  The core game is not bad at all, but I cannot recommend a game that is clearly suffering from being a freemium-port.",

            "review_text": "Gunspell is social network/mobile kind of Puzzle-RPG. I mean there are a lot of redundant interface elements and features which originates from there and they do nothing besides standing in the way and annoying you. At least they are rebalanced to avoid annoying you as much as in the original version of the game where you had to pay real money to get rid of this nonsense. Well, at least part of them since all equipment is way too fragile. Later on you may found yourself in a situation when you need to repair something after each 5-10 enemies (equipment usually have 20-40 durability points, you have 5-6 pieces of equipment, -1 point after each battle to all equipment, have fun). The game will give you loyalty present every day as many free to play games does even though it is not free to play anymore. Additionally there are a lot of various interface issues which makes it rather frustrating to play. It's not like the interface doesn't work. It does. It just doesn't help to play or actually it standing in the way. Also, I don't understand why this game has to show a loading bar in between everything. Is it so hard to just load these 366 Mb into memory and just keep them there all the time? I can't imagine any modern PC which is not capable of handling this.  Battles isn't fun. Mostly due to one hit killing most of the enemies in the game. Later on you will encounter better enemies with enough HP to survive 2-5 turns and equipped with some items which deals extra damage/effects and may even kill your character if you will deliberately avoid healing yourself. Maybe. Since chain-reactions happen way too often. Most likely you will heal yourself and kill your enemy with one of them. At the same time. Your active equipment can deal some extra damage, but I came to the conclusion that it's mostly useless since base damage is the only important. Damage from 3 skulls usually a few times higher than any of your weapons is capable of dealing. Well, if you want to have some fun and make battles a bit enjoyable then try to deliberately avoid dealing damage with skull combos and use only guns for this purpose.  Art style reminds me pop sci-fi book covers. Flashy but if you look for more than a second you will notice how mediocre it is. Also, enemies and locations doesn't look like they belong to the worlds where you encounter them. It's especially easy to spot in icy worlds.  Background music doesn't worth to be mentioned. It does exist and that's all you need to know about it.",
