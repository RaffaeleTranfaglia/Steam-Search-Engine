Full screen only and no seen plunger if you care about that.  I played this with Windows 10 at native 1920 by 1080, no problems.  You can turn off the music, which I did, some graphics options, and the ball noise is optional.  It's a fair pinball game, not up to the quality of more expensive ones, but worth their price, sure.  Not realistic pinball style, if that is what you are looking for, see Pinball Arcade and Zacarria Pinball.",
