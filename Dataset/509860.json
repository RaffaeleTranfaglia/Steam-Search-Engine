            "review_text": "Simple platformer, reminds me of Mario, but there are some differeneces.   This game puts you in control of Adventurer who is looking for relics, there isnt much backstory, just few pictures at beginning and end of the game..  Gameplay is platforming mixed with bit of tricky puzzles. There are 2 tools, both collectible, dynamite and throwing knives, which are necesarry for completing instances.   Pros: - Low system requirements - Low download size - Simple, kids friendly - Collectible secrets - Has few interesting puzzles  Neutral: - Game is pretty short and can be completed in around 1-2 hours, maybe even less  Cons: - Few parts require pinpoint precision in order to complete them/ dodge attacks, but you'll get used to it   I didnt want to give this game negative rating because it isnt bad, however it doesnt offer anything we havent seen before and is very short on content..",
