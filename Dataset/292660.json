            "review_text": "The game is pretty standard fare within the genre, but has a few unsurmountable annoyances that damn it to the bargain bin.  The sound design is unrefined. The music often overpowers the dialogue and there are a high number of repetitive loud noises to announce the smallest advances or simply the changing rooms.  It is very random which dialogue or scene is unskippable. Usually you are forced to watch or listen to the most repetetive ones.  The 'assistant' you get is not only graphically distinct from the game, but darts all over the screen to pick up objects you find or if you even slightly touch an interactable area.   Incessant popup notifications on certain collectables, even though the information is already on-screen and available via a menu.",
