            "review_text": "Rating - 76/100 Recommendation - Campaign makes Michael Bay look like Woody Allen  Disclaimer: I have zero interest in the multiplayer campaign. This review specifically covers the single player campaign, and is specifically FOR people who only want the single player campaign. There's co-op horde mode too, apparently, but I haven't gotten to try it yet. Oh, also, fair warning: Default FoV is VERY narrow, and is only changeable in multiplayer (which doesn't carry over).  Call of Duty is often at the center of video game controversy, and you would be hard-pressed to find any other series that can elicit such strong reactions from people. Reviews are usually either 10/10 or 0/10, and you will likely have friends groan at you if you claim to be a fan. There are no series other than sports that get pumped out with such regularity, and with so few innovations from game to game. It seems like sales of one game haven't even gotten a chance to cool off yet before another new one is announced. By all outward appearances, this is a terrible terrible series.  You know what, though? I have a soft spot in my heart for Call of Duty. It's a big dumb oaf of a series that you just can't help but smile at. It's very much a Hollywood Summer blockbuster movie, with non-stop action and explosions from the outset, getting your blood pumping while you're in the moment, and then making you go '...what was that?' when you're done.  Case in point, Ghosts. I played through the entire campaign in 5 hours (with very minimal repeating of sections), and was in a town that was getting bombed, then in space, then back in the bombed town, then on a military base, then scuba diving, then on a ship, then driving a tank, then doing bombing runs in an airship, then in space again, then fighting on an inverted high-speed train. While all that is going on, I was switching back and forth between past and present, and controlling probably 5 different characters (or at least it felt like it). The plot and action literally do not stop to even take a breath. How can you not love that!??  You should know what to expect when you're looking at a CoD game, and this one delivers.  I'm not fully up to speed on all the Call of Duty games' campaigns, but I have played a decent number of them, and this is one of the best if you're looking for a shallow, explosion-fueled adrenaline rush. If you want to feel like John Rambo, John McClane, and John Woo somehow had a baby whose life is being directed by Michael Bay, then look no further.  The graphics won't win any awards, but they're good and well-optimized (60fps at 4k maxed with a 980), sound design is solid, the gunplay is as good as ever, and there are tons of little one-and-done gadgets you get to play with throughout. If you're just here to hate all over Call of Duty, then downvote and move on, but if you're looking for some mindless action, I highly recommend this one.  It's hokey, it's fake as all get out, and it may represent all that is wrong with the video gaming market, but damn it all if it isn't fun.",

            "review_text": "So I heard that this was debatably the worst Call of Duty game out there, so I bought a key off of a site and decided to give it a whirl, and to be honest, I actually kinda like it.  This review will center around the muliplayer specifically, as I havent played enough of the Extinction and Campaign modes to form a solid opinion.  TL;DR: It's a fun MP experience. It has some upsides and some downsides, but I have enjoyed it thus far. Buy it on sale or from a site though, because $60 is way too much.  MP Pros: 1. Fast-paced as hell 2. The guns are cool and fun to use (especially the snipers). 3. Strike packages are back 4. It's just plain fun. 5. Lots of custimization 6. Squad Pts are now used to buy guns/attacthments, meaning you no longer need to wait to unlock everything, as nearly everything is open for unlock from the very start, be it guns, attachments, new killstreaks, Squad Members, etc. 7. Field Orders are interesting, to say the least.  MP Cons: 1. Guard Dog KS is douchey and unfair 2. I.E.D.s EVERYWHERE; they are hard to spot and you'll only know they're there once they kill you 3. Large map size and design heavily promotes camping 4. TTK is pretty fast, resulting in the afforementioned fast paced gameplay. This is fine on smaller maps (i.e Strikezone), but on larger maps (i.e Stonehaven) it becomes annoying to roam the map, find one guy, maybe get killed by the guy, rinse and repeat. 5. Sadly, not too many people online, usually 500/600 tops. You'll usually find a TDM or Strikezone 24/7 match with ease, but other modes are deserted, which is a real shame, as I heard that Ghosts' Gun Game was awesome, and nobody plays it. 6. The squad points are cool, but for some people they could disrupt the whole ranking up process.  Overall, I recommend this game. There are some good things and some pretty screwed up bad things , but I still have enjoyed myself thus far. I have only played a bit of Campaign and Extinction, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions about the two, more so with Extinction.This is a pretty solid MP experience, but I don't honestly think its worth the hefty $60 tag. I'd recommend purchasing it either during a sale or off of a reliable site that sells games for cheap, as I was able to get the key for this game for about $7, which is a pretty good price. Just keep in mind that the playerbase will unfortunately only shrink gradually from here, so see if your friends want to play with you in case you can't find a game. There's also the occasional cheater, but nothing that we haven't seen before about 2,000 times, and I haven't run into too many cheaters so far.  Verdict: 8/10",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game, I loved it. Great graphics and heaps of action with location variations from 'Outer Space' to 'Ocean Operations' and of course on 'Dry Land Battles'. You also have a variety of shooting modes from 'Helicopters', 'Operating Tanks', 'Swimming Missions' and plenty of city based stealth operations which all offer a great deal of action variety.  Topping up ammo is not an option for your original weapon, but when you get low just pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy. Thing with this is that not all of them carry like items between themselves, so if you want to pick up extra ammo you will need to find another gun the same or swap again. I didn't find this to be a problem but it helps to keep an eye on the situation and not run too low before it is too late. You also have the use of a very effective dog who at times can be controlled by you for attack and recon duties and this is a lot of fun.  I finished it in 7 hours and that was not rushing through, was hoping for at least twice that so as to have decent sized SP mode. Unfortunately as happens with too many games these days, Multiplayer Rules which also means all DLC's for this game support MP only. As I don't do MP, I (and many people like me) miss out once again on expanding the base game with extra missions......This is my only complaint.  Would I recommend this?.....Most definitely and rate it 8/10 and mainly due to the shortness of SP gameplay. It left me with the feeling of 'I want to play this again'....And soon.",

No logic whatsoever in weapon characteristics. In multiplayer you can only see a few weapons that everybody uses (AK12, Honeybadger, MSBS and Bulldog) i havent seen anyone use anything different in a while. Graphics problems on MP are enormous and it doesnt matter what kind of PC you have, cause it can LAG like hell on high-end PCs. Campaign is EPIC and i love it, the story is not as good as the story from the MW series, but much better than the BO series. Poor optimization, low average IQ of the community, lack of weapon usage in MP, lack of game modes, lots of campers....

This game was judged too early before anyone gave it a chance to work out the bugs and kinks. If you are a fan of the Modern Warfare franchise, you'll also be a huge fan of Call of Duty: Ghosts!  The Call of Duty: Ghosts online community is still alive and kicking, and what's cool is there's no Exo Suits, the character customization isn't shiny and absurd-looking, and every gun in the game exists in real life (except for the Ripper and the Maverick). This game maintains much of the realism of a Modern Warfare, but with a subtle hint of the realistic futuristic warfare. It's perfectly balanced in both gameplay and art-form my opinion, as the fantasy and futurism is at a minimal.  I bought this game originally in November of 2013 and didn't like it, mainly because the game was brand new, laggy, un-optimized and full of bugs, so I put it on the shelf in my Steam Library and let it collect dust in disappointment for years up until now. I've developed such a craving to play a new Modern Warfare lately, so I decided to start re-playing MW3 at the start of 2016 (First time playing on PC, orginally played on Xbox in 2011) and prestiged 3 times. I started to get somewhat bored of MW3 again after couple of months of grinding and experimenting in multiplayer. My craving to play a new Modern Warfare had not subsided even after playing MW3 so much, so I decided to give Call of Duty: Ghosts another shot on April 1st of 2016.  What I've found is that both the Multiplayer PvP and the very fascinating Co-Op Extinction Mode (Like Zombie Mode, but with Aliens, and way better in my opinion!) are still full of people who play everyday! I've found that the game is better optimized and isn't laggy like it used to be, the weapon handling for almost all of the weapons is excellent, the perks and weapons are numerous, interesting, easy to unlock and very balanced, the maps are incredibly detailed, balanced and not too small, the killstreaks are fun, and the character customization is comprised mostly of realistic and tasteful options.   I'm completely addicted. I now play this game every single day. I almost regretted not playing it sooner, but I remembered that in November of 2013 I was busy playing Rust with my friends. I feel like I got to let the game optimize and balance itself over the years, and now in comparison to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Black Ops III, this game really truly blows them both out of the water.  Play this game. Give it another chance!",

This game tries to break out form the other CODS some what sucsessfully. The single player story is ok..not the best I have seen but what call of duty game has much of a story other then go here and kill every one in your way. It lets you play the game from diffrent point of view durring the same mission, such as on foot then suddenly in a helicopter, or on foot then your controlling a dog. As far a multiplayer is concerned more then likly dead see how there is another COD game out now and every one is playing it. Hope this helps a little.",

It had great tempo to the story and was easy enough to follow. Sometimes these types of game look great on paper but once your adrenaline gets pumping you forget what the point of the story was.

The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS with all settings at high / ultra in both single player and multiplayer.  The single player campaign, though short, goes a long way towards putting you into the feel of a special operations team member with missions ranging from underwater combat to base infiltration to space combat. While the story itself is fairly straightfoward and reminiscint of a hollywood summer action flick, it's still enjoyable.  The multiplayer is where the game stands out compared to previous call of duty titles. The level designs are larger and much more complete in terms of accessibility and realism of buildings as well as other objects. Firing through cracks in objects will not cause bullet collision with invisible walls which is quite nice. Another major bonus is the removal of a large portion of the aerial kill streak rewards, bringing the fight back down to a groundwar rather than constant map bombardments by overpowered rewards.  The people who are complaining about the performance of this game are putting on display a fault of their own machine hardware rather than a fault with the game itself. Because this game was designed for so-called 'next generation' hardware, it is odd to expect it to still run smoothly on outdated setups.   While the game is not extreme in it's innovations within multiplayer, the addition of more movement possibilities such as sliding and vaulting allows for a deeper level of immersion as the usual bunny hop and run and gun mentality which is too often seen in CoD titles has been all but eliminated. In it's place are players willing to take a more serious tactical approach to gun combat. While this does lead to a slower pace in matches, it also adds a better sense of realism and immersion which is seriously lacking in previous Call of Duty titles.",

The new squads mode is always a treat to play, your either against an AI squad of someone else's or your up against someones squad with the creator of the squad in the game.  Extinction mode is what you would expect from an alien survival gamemode; try not to get killed by the aliens and protect a certain objective, simple.  In short Call Of Duty: Ghosts is not a bad game, but its also not the best game in its franchise, Ghosts does not deserve a massive amount of hype, but it also doesnt deserve a massive amount of hate.",

They did a good job with the new gametypes but what is it with the hardcore, why not put every gametype in there, I just hate wasting an entire clip on a guy to get him to die.They added Domination but they should add CTF and all those other cool gametypes.  Listen, I still play COD4 everyday, but Ghost ...not as much. Servers are a pain but this aint going to change anyday soon. This is the way they found to make money, no more modding, no more dedi servers, no more custom mapping. Do you still play BO ?? I don't , ne more new maps, people switched to Ghost. They are making ton's of money like that, 120$ if you get the map packs, that's a lot of money period.",

However i felt that they were trying to impress too frequently and at times rather than stcking to a story, only has certain scenes to say 'LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE NEXT GEN CONSOLE EVERYBODY' , the gameplay is very linier and at times i felt like i was playing an arkade game in how i was ment to stick to the path in sutch a set way that if i fell to far behind my squod ( who you do not lead, they lead you ) the mission would fail however the arkade feal was not necacaraly a bad thing.  8/10 for the story as some scenes were added simply to leangthen the gameplay   *MULTIPLAYER Unforchanatly i have never been a fan of cods multiplayer but rather more of a battlefield player, COD along with this game are very 'arkade like' rather than realistic and this reflects in the multiplayer, the movements seem to jolly and set and the online community seem more focused on 360 degree twists before killing you.  i only played one life so far on multiplayer but when i play more ill updade by adding a comment to this recomendation if necacary  on gueswork personally id rate it as a 5-6/10 for multiplayer id reccomend battlefield   *EXTINCTION MODE This was something looked forward to when i was installing the game but so far just seems like a spin off of zombies, which is likely what it is. the aim is to defend a drill that you set at certain locations to destroy an alien threat ( some sort of alien beehive / plant ) from aliens and verious critters then move to the next location and do the same, gradularly getting harder and more challenging. I very mutch enjoy this mode however have only seen one level so far, to which i have failed to complete.  6/10, this would recieve an 8 or 9 if it wasnt so repetative   *DLC - i dont own any of the DLC as of now and likely ill not own it as it seems very multiplayer based  *************overall 7 / 10***************  *note - this is my first COD game ive played so any 'repetition' in th ceries im unaware of  - there are many problems with the game for many users, some remain unfixed, i was a lucky one in that the bad port didnt seem to hinder my pc, however caused some lag spikes at the 1st few seconds of some single player levels",

Ghosts will take you even to space, with a very nice gameplay mechanic.  Did I say the game is visual? I couldn't say that enough. It does have some visual glitches on the latest update (and for you reading out there, you should just change the variable seta r_usePrebuiltSpotShadow from Enabled to Disabled on your config.cfg and config_mp.cfg files), but once you fix it it will look superb.  The one problem I see with this game is that it is short. You complete the story mode too fast. I am more of a single player, so I won't review the multi player part.

            "review_text": "The good: Ghosts new formula of how you prestige, the squads, weapons/attachment slots etc... is a great combination.   The weapons are fairly well balanced, (better than both MW2 and MW3) save for the Bulldog shotty and M27-IAR LMG being far and above the best of their respective classes.   Most of the maps are fun to play and flow well, with the exception of a couple that are just a mess IMHO.   The customization options for the characters, including female characters, is a welcome change, and the operations to get the different camos, patches, headgear, etc... work well since the patch that no longer required that operation to be active to receive the bonus (before that patch, it wasn't worth the effort).   The bad: Rampant cheating that has not been addressed has yet again spoiled a fun and addicting game. When this game was launched, they promised a new game engine which ended up being a revised Quake engine, and there were already working hacks available the day of launch. Why you don't get a few people to review game footage of those with TDM KDR's above 3.0 and start banning them when they are found to be cheating is beyond me. It would take minimal investment and effort, and you would reap the benefits by making a fair playing field for all. The fact that less than a year after launch, you only have between 1,000 and 2,500 people playing is testament to the fact that everyone is sick of this garbage.   Matchmaking is not the greatest. Lag is an ongoing issue due to the large geographic dispersion of the lobbies, where a more localzed matchmaking formula would be much better than what is in effect now.  Conclusion: Dispite it's flaws, I play this game A LOT, so I guess I would recommend it. That being said, I will NOT be buying Advanced Warfare at launch due to the lack of the game developers dealing with cheaters. Deal with the cheaters, and I would not hesitate to buy it. Without support from the devs on the rampant cheating in every Modern Warfare game since MW2, I will be showing my displeasure with my wallet.",

Just caught this on sale so i would def recommend buying it during this autumn sale for 14.99 that comes with the first DLC, too good to pass up, though if you are planning on buying this for $60, i would say you are crazy, and should probobly get your head checked. mostly because activision and places an absurd price on the old CoD games......BLOPS 1 is still like $40 regularly i think. so do not buy for full price, do like me and wait in the shadows for a good sale.",

If they fix the spawns it might be worthwhile but even then I'm not sure. Everything unlocks with squad points now so there isn't a rank system that you are shooting for to get that next gun since you can save up and buy it in a few rounds of play. Extinction is fun the first few times and if they added some variation to the levels like Left for Dead then it would probably be a better experience. Squads....useless. Again, the ♥♥♥♥ over the hardcore multiplayer with a laughably small amount of play modes but the one and only bright side is, in the regular modes, it no longer takes you an entire clip to kill someone as with previous Call of Duties.

In addition, the PC version was ridden with technical problems which is totally unacceptable in general and even more so when it affects one of the most respected and lucrative franchise in the industry.  So why do I recommend this game?  Simply because when you put technical issues aside, COD Ghost is amazing.  -a very interesting setting : the game universe is a post-apocalyptic America at war with a powerful south american federation. the game environments are rendered in great details and have a desolate beauty to them that I find almost poetic   -a great diversity of design (SP) : all missions include a nice twist on the design formula. You infiltrate a compound, you navigate underwater, you take part in a full scale tank assault. It's still COD but it shows that the designers went to great lenghts to keep the game exciting   -a good story (SP) : the game focuses on a small group of elite units. It is a more personal theme and although there are plenty of action, it drops the bombastic tone of former entries for something more subtle and grounded. You feel part of a unit playing a small yet vital part on a bigger war front.   -Great multiplayer (MP): the conventional MP is great and packed with amazing maps which are a blast to play and still convey that post apo vibe. In addition, there is an extinction mode which is more or less COD meets Left4Dead. You are a team of soldiers fighting beast-like aliens and you have to use special abilities to stand a chance.  All of this makes Ghost my favorite entry in the COD franchise. It's just a pity that so many people seem to dislike the game. It makes me wonder if they even gave it a chance...  ",

            "review_text": "As a competive gamer that played alot of FPS and have played in about 50 lans over the years i thought to give cod ghost a chance. I have played alot of Q1 Q3a quakelive but also warcraft 2 starcraft and starcraft 2.  So is cod ghost a game that can be used in esport. Quite simply my answer is no.  What reasons?  1. the game doenst seem to be in real time. What i mean is i shoot at people i see myself shoot 3-4 times. I die, In the kill cam i do not get one shot of. There a a few vods on youtube demonstrating this. That player a see opponent for 12 frames and wins. player b only has 5 frames and dies while they are in direct vision with each other. Can you imagine quakecon finals Evil vs Rapha and the game is not in sync? Its unbelieveble that this is possible never had this with other fps games. There even vods on youtube where you look one direction. Suddenly opponent appears not around the corner but already 2-3-4 meter in open sight. While you are focused on looking at that corner.  2. No ping, you have a clanwar lets say you equal to each other but you cannot check if a server has fair ping. No point in playing ping matters. even in public with the random changing of servers one game you go 40-1 next game you go 20-10 cause ping changed.  3. FPS no way to measure fps or to go above fixed amount. Discussed quite alot on the forums. Its widely accepted in quake community that 125 fps constant is a standard for proper play.  4. I have a computer where I spend 2700 euro on. Top of the line. I can play with max settings. But you do not want to play with max settings as its very hard to see your opponent then. You are forced to use low settings in order to make it playeble.  5. Rushing in this game is possible vs noobs but vs equal opponents you die easy defenders bonus is huge.  6. Every weapon so strong you die very fast. if first 3 points where no issue maybe this would be okay but with al the issues its makes the gameplay bad and frustating.  7.You cannot spectate a game you will be kicked for being idle. after about 1 min.  8. Community not able to make there own maps. I even got e-mail for IW saying they made new cool maps please pay 16 euro and you have 3 extra map possible to play in multiplayer. I mean WTF? IW you serious?  9. Game is designed for Consule there is a sort of skill cap that is reached fast. very beginner friendly perhaps explain populairty?  10. 65 fixed fov. just LOL. you need to download a 3rd party program to get bigger fov how uniteresed in esports most IW be to do this?  11. Auto joining severs. And auto rejoining other servers while playing. I want to be able to scroll in what server to join. I want to see ping and i want to see what players on that server are they any good or not? quakelive has such a good function for this.  12. I loved it when playing i could go to spec mode. I find someone better then myself. I like to see how he plays usually duels but also could be tdm or ca i spec and look how he plays see what decision he makes. not a possibility in cod ghost.  13. Dieing doenst give you a disadvandtedge in the game you just spawn with full health and full ammo and your primary weapon. there is no farming of weapons or armor in the game. Ofcourse this is a cod ghost and makes it more noob friendly. I remember how much you had to play in team games in my old q1 and q3 clans to lock down a map properly control the main weapons control the armors. Know where the spawns are it was magic when you locked map down and went on kill spree. Opponent really had to play smart and take over area's one by one to get back in the game.   14. No duel. But in cod whats the point to it. without any of the farming element.   15. Is it me only or do bullets make no sense. I can stand behind stone wall and bullets pass. I stand behind a tree and bullets cannot pass. It seems very random in how bullets penetrate wall elements. On top of this the same wall in an other map bullets dont go trough so this should be standardisded.   16. Cheaters my god there alot of them. There players i reported 3 weeks ago that i see shooting trough 3 buildings on far side of the map killing people. Going 60-0 in a TDM match having K/D ratios of 30+ I reported these people as there is a function in there you can do it what i thought was really cool. 3 weeks later i see the same person still doing it being in top 100 of the ladder by now. IW doenst seem to do anything with the reports.   17. Connectivity issues. Sometimes you can play 4 hours not disconnects. Then suddenly 1 or 2 hours longs you just disconnect after playing a minute or so in the game.  Is the game fun to play?  I thought it was fun for about the first 100 hours of multiplayer till above issues where clear to me and started to anoy me to much to enjoy the game. I think IW should look how to make a proper FPS game and look at ID Software and creators of half life.  Anyways i am back to playing starcraft 2 and quakelive. I hope there is a game devolper out there willing to make a new proper FPS game that is fast paced like quake. Designed with the goal of multiplayer and esports.   Update. 29-6  Somehow i keep playing this game. Fortunantly the lag, fps and drops have been fixed. Gameplay is strangely atracting me:) Still alot of thing can be improved to make it better.",

            "review_text": "I know that this review is gonna get me a lot of flame, but I believe that this game, aside from the bad optimization and low fov, actually has some value to it.  Let me put it simply. The singleplayer is not bad, although I ran into the game crashing on one mission and I wasn't able to progress past that point. That's a big problem and isn't acceptable for a next gen game. But what I want to focus on is the multiplayer.  The multilayer has 3 aspects: normal PvP, Squads, and Extinction. As you can see from my hours spent, I have quite the amount of time spent in it, and all of it thanks to what I think the saving grace of this game is: Squads.  What is Squads exactly? Squads mode is bassically a multiplayer mode that allows ou to level a virtual squad that can be used in the regular multiplayer. This comes in three flavors: Safeguard, Squad Assult and my personal favorite: Wargame. What this allows you to do is to play the normal multiplayer BUT against bots.  Now, A lot of people might think of it to be vitriolic to play with bots, but for people with a slow internet connection and who live nowhere near where games are being played it's the only option. The bots are smart, fairely competent and are quite fun to play with due to the fact that they dont flash bm or yell at you for stupid reseaons. For people like me who don't have the ping to play compeititvely online, this was a saviour as it gave me the Call of Duty experiance that I wanted without having to suffer from terrible lag.  Yes, there is optimization problems, yes, the fov is bad, but for me, as a person who loves playing by himself the squads mode was enough to fill my 100+ hours of multiplayer experiance. And I'm still not done with it.  The other mdes, such as Extinction and Safeguard are really good to solo, where Safeguard actually gives you an extra AI squad member to play with so it's not insanely imbalanced.  So if you are like me and love playing with bots (I know your out there), then this game isn't a bad choice. Mechanically, it sound and the graphics, although dated, is not exactly hideous. But I recommend buying it with caution, esspecially if you have fov problems.  So not a hearty recommendation, but if you just want to play by yourself and don't mind 30 fps and the fov, then it's a safe buy.  EDIT: I realize that my review doesn't show how many multiplayer hours I spent, but as of today, I have spent 155 hours in the multiplayer. Quite amaing for a crappy game, no?",

Although in the modern day of warfare dogs play a major part in the field and although this really *****d o** a lot of games but as you played the game you actually got used to Riley being at your side.  The dog cam was another aspect of the game which annoyed gamers. I liked the dog cam I thought it was really good. great for taking down baddies. On the whole the game is great, I found the start of the game a bit on the weird side, but once you get past this it flies through and you’re thrashing your way through the levels.

I have updated the mainboard and the cpu and game is running real good on i7 4770K along with 690 gtx.   I really like the game now. It is very advanced, and the levelling works like anything else before it. I can only recommend this if you have a FAST SYSTEM WITH A FAST GRAPHICS CARD. OTHERWISE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",

Well, i'm really glad i bought this game. Check your pc can run it. (i only say that because it was in the top10 of graphics intensive pc games in a list i saw). The graphics are brilliant. i'm enjoying the Single Player storyline and is very forgiving on low difficulty so if you're rusty or just don't play many fps and want to give one a shot i'd definitely recommend this. Many different side elements have you in space floating and jetpacking around shooting enemies, repelling down buildings, controlling your attack dog to stealthily attack enemies, flying helicopter gunships to take out targets, using long range sniper rifle, using a silenced pistol with movement locator to take out enemies, aswell as normal assault rifle stuff in different stages of the sp storyline. still playing through the sp storyline so probably a lot more. All i can say is it's fun and coupled with the forgiving aspect, i'd definitely give it 10/10. If you're an experienced fpser i'd probably suggest you read another review for a more relevant opinion on the higher difficulty settings. I normally prefer multiplayer aspect of games (theres something sterile to me playing against bots but being a story its different) and have only tried the extinction mode mp with bots and for a very short time so cant really comment on the mp apart from saying its frenetic-i'll get round to playing mp with other players when ive finished sp storyline(campaign) i expect.. if i'd known the game was like this i'd have bought it full price earlier. there's lots of dlc mp i believe but not bought any yet. only had this game a relatively short period but loving it. jfi i'm using a 360 controller on my pc. it's a great, fun game.",

I delved in not knowing much about what was going or knowing the origin of why things were happening. However I soon found myself immerssed into the story.  The story follows mainly around Logan, as he trains up ready to join the Ghosts towards the start of the game and continuing the missions alonside with your brother and your father. Not to mention, quite a new feature was that they added a loveable npc/character - Riley. He's a great attack dog who helps alongside a few missions, although dissapointingly you only get to use him in a couple of missions and that's it. I felt a great amount of companionship with this animal in the game as well as the companionship of the other soldiers.   The missions during the game can be very intense and are jam-packed full of action (who doesn't love that?!). This game has seen some bad and harshly critical feedback (maybe more so towards the multiplayer) But honestly, I loved the campaign from start to finish, with only a couple of times me feeling annoying at some parts of a mission that didn't make sense what to do (I.e the penultimate mission)  The visuals are stunning, the sounds are intense, the story is gripping and the gameplay is.. well honestly no different to most of it's predecessors - yet still the campaign was fantastic - and I'd highly advise to keep watching the credits through... (you know, like Marvel movies do? With that little twist or added clip at the end!)  I would highly recommend this game to fans of the CoD series, for those who want a fairly interesting and gripping single player game full of action and high octane gameplay. But honestly - this game is not worth the full price of £40/$50. You'd be wise to pick this game up cheap on a sale or reduced price!

I do like the private multiplayer option. there i get to pick my type of game play, the map i wish to play, the number of bots i want for enemies the level of the bots, and i can also pick the number of friendly bots and their level, if i play team deathmatch.  in the private multiplayer area, there are quite a few maps. some are very large and small maps as well. you can set up to 17 bots to play during your session. that leaves you and up to 17 others in the map. small maps i like to set the player numbers to about 8 max. either 4 for each team ot me against 7 bots.  but don't be fooled, the multi-player games are all 'run and gun', there is not much time for camping. you stop for a second or two to catch your breath and bam there is an enemy.  all in all the game is NOT worth paying $60 for, but I got my copy for 1/3 of that. it's worth $20, but I wouldn't pay anything more for it.",

I was at level 1 the others were level 14, level 20 something, and level 40,,yeah my level players. i wont be wasting much of my time playing these.  you do NOT get to choose your room. you do NOT get to choose your map. you do NOT get to choose your side.  like all of the Call of Duty games since modern warfare 2 you get forced into a server that you may or may not want. if you leave the room and think you can enter a diferent room, think again you will be put right back in the same room.   I do like the private multiplayer option. there i get to pick my type of game play, the map i wish to play, the number of bots i want for enemies the level of the bots, and i can also pick the number of friendly bots and their level, if i play team deathmatch.  in the private multiplayer area, there are quite a few maps. some are very large and small maps as well. you can set up to 17 bots to play during your session. that leaves you and up to 17 others in the map. small maps i like to set the player numbers to about 8 max. either 4 for each team ot me against 7 bots.  but don't be fooled, the multi-player games are all 'run and gun', there is not much time for camping. you stop for a second or two to catch your breath and bam there is an enemy.  all in all the game is NOT worth paying $60 for, but I got my copy for 1/3 of that. it's worth $20, but I wouldn't pay anything more for it.",

TECHNICAL ASPECT: ---------------------- The game is bad optimised and you gonna get low fps if you haven't a good configuration; I played the game on my laptop, 4GB ram and 2GB ddr3 of dedicated memory on gpu and even if the game can be launch w/ 4Gb ram, you gonna get freezes, lags,...: I recommand 8Gb, w/ a good graphics card, like w/ 2Gb ddr5 memory.  ---------- MULTIPLAYER: --------------- -&gt; I saw a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about the multiplayer, and to be honest he isn't very bad. Sometimes u meet campers, but I don't found hackers. The multiplayer had a great potential but now only 400 people play the game and there is a lot of noobs who plays with shotguns ect. -&gt;The CoD: Ghosts multiplayers isn't bad and you can take good time on it, it's very funny to try all weapons ect.. Even if some noob's ♥♥♥ the game.  SOLO: -------------- -&gt; I haven't finish the solo yet, but there is a good story and pretty good effects, can't wait to continue :D  CONCLUSION -------------- CoD Ghost isn't a 'very' bad CoD as my opinion. He suffers of a bad optimisation who stops players who wants buy the game. The multiplayers isn't very good, but I think there's some good time to play on it and solo looks impressive, can't wait to finish him. = Don't buy the game for 60€, buy it on a website for a little ammount, like 6-7€  I don't think I gonna stay on this game eternally, but he's good :D  6/10   ",

I never expected   Ghosts   to be spectacularly joyfull game, however I had good expectations on multiplayer and new cooperative mode with those cryptids.  Now, it could take a very long time to describe how all these expectations were ruined by actual gameplay in both of those modes. If you ask me for a review, I would tell you that it's better to head over Steam Discussions in game center and read few of those ' I regret buying this '-posts, because it's the best review you could get. Someone thinks it's a waste of money and time, I agree. Surprisingly, there are quite a bunch of lads who tryin' to... I don't know? defend this poor product for some uknown reason.  Speaking of me, I only could tell I like to play Extinction from time to time, maybe some multiplayer hardcore modes (without that awful HUD) but that's about it. Singleplayer campaign doesn't really interest me. Seriously... Dogs? Whatever.  Not recommended. Between   Modern Warfare 3   and   Ghosts  , pick   Modern Warfare 3  .  Now, for the last part of my essential essay, I already know there is a lot of people who enjoys to disagree and become a kind of 'combo-breaker' out there, and I don't really think it's bad. How they say on interwebs? 'Haters gonna hate'. Well, if you think you would feel better if you put a red vote on here - go on.

While I haven't had the issue, I know many others have crashing/stuttering issues in-game as well.  Well lets get into some pros &amp; cons about the game.  Campaign: +Pros:  -Cons: - Story is possibly the weakest of all Call of Duty's - Voice acting is god awful and cringeworthy - Slow and dull, the 4 hour campaign makes it feel twice as long with half the fun as the older usual campaigns in comparison - A step backwards from Black Ops II, no custom loadouts, no side missions, no choices to be made. - Fish A.I doesn't seem to work all the time :/ - The dog 'Riley' they advertised so much is hardly in the campaign. Maybe 3-4 levels total and completely irrelevant.   Multiplayer +Pros: + Gunplay is good as usual + Plenty of soldier customization this time around, including female soldiers. + A far better gun and attachment unlock system + Improved prestige system + Kill time is faster which I enjoy a lot more. + Larger maps which I liked but some may not + New game modes are fun but unpopulated  -Cons: - Rank grindings take much longer - Unlocking soldier customization can be a pain -Spawn system is terrible - Less than a month after release and Multiplayer lobbies are nearly empty - New game modes are fun but unpopulated  Overall: +Pros: + Graphics look fairly nice on ultra, a bit better than Black Ops II but nothing too amazing + Gun sounds are good + Gamepad support  -Cons: - Volume options lacking - Lack of dedicated servers - No FoV slider or mouse smoothing on/off - Extinction game mode is rather boring (I don't like horde game modes usually including nazi zombies)  Game is rather average a 6.5/10 rating seems accurate for this title.

For me its like 90% of the time when i start it first time. I have to kill it in task-manager and restart to get it working.  - It feels like the game gets pay to win. Everytime they release a new DLC it comes with overpowered weapon(s).

Yes, they've made a few cool changes to the perk-system but honestly once you get used to that, you realize that the perks you can choose are pretty much the same. The second largest problem is their way of designing maps in multiplayer. In the older games (here I think mainly of MW1 and MW2) the multiplayer maps were taken right out of the campaign and put into multiplayer to be used in different game-types. For players like myself, who loved playing both the campaign and the multiplayer that gave the maps a kind of 'homely' feeling. The maps back then had better design and felt more intuitive.

[EDIT: Their is now a anti-cheat, and it does work, to a degree]  Second, the hitreg is at its all-time low, with being shot around corners and bullets disappearing into nothingness commonplace, even at seemingly low pings, which you cannot even tell since the game no longer displays that for you.  Thirdly, the map designs in this game are absolutely terrible, with them ether being too big (Stonehaven), or too small (Strikezone), with only 2-3 maps being a reasonable size for the average 6v6 TDM match.   For the fourth point, gun and equipment balance is out of whack in this iteration, with Assault rifles essentially beating every other weapon type in all situations, even snipers and SMG's, and explosives like IED's (the new Bouncing Betty/Claymore) being nigh impossible to see without a specific perk, which really drags down the experience when you just randomly die due to a IED placed somewhere you cant even see.  For the final nail in the coffin, the game has horrendous performance issues, even on beefy computers. With framerates dropping below 60 even on the smaller levels, it disrupts gameplay quite a bit when your framerate drops in the middle of a gunfight, causing you to die when you should have lived.  + Character Customization +/- Updated engine adds prettiness  - Hitreg - Lack of Anti-cheat [EDIT: Their is a anti-cheat in place, it works to a degree] - Poor map design - Poor weapon and equipment balance - Poor optimization   Overall, If I didnt get this game as a gift, I would not be buying it, but if you got it for free, its a good bout of fun.

The game can look great, but run poorly on most hardware... like BF4. Or it can look bad, but run great like State of Decay.

Turning everything down, I could finally muster out 70-80fps... but zoom in with any scope, and I'm down in the 30s. I can run Battlefield 4 on higher settings and get more frames.

While some users can play the game just fine on rigs of varying power, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what causes the game to lag, stutter, freeze or otherwise graphically glitch for others. However, it is prevalent enough that the community has made an outcry as to what needs fixed and how little fun they're having until it does. Patches that have dropped thus far for the game have had results across the grid varying from fixing some players' problems to causing problems for another whom never had any to begin with.  It's not to say that the PC version of Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't fun, or even that it's terrible, but until further patches may alleviate the issues plaguing this port, it's best to steer clear and play on the consoles for this game.",

The game is a waste of internet download time, since the game is around 40 GB, but the game itself doesn't look any more grahpically intensive. The FOV is locked at a nauseous 65, though the gaming community has unofficial FOV changers.   In Ghosts Multiplayer, IW tried to copy Black Ops 2 style of weapon loadouts and class editing, but instead made a huge mess with too many split up perks and guns with forced attachments (like a silencer). Customization was thought to be increased with the new player editor, but this game has far less customization than before. Each Soldier can only carry six different loadouts and you can't customize them much more than their skin color until you play Multiplayer and complete certain objectives to gain clothing. You are only able to change the soldier's outfit as a whole, except for the headpiece. There are no more custom emblem editors in the game, you now have to use premade patches created by IW.   Multiplayer itself could have been a fun experience, but I wouldn't be able to tell you since the game is broken and not playable for me.

Multiplayer needed 2Gb download on release date, why the ♥♥♥♥ to i buy a gamebox with 4(!) DVD's? To NOT have to download stuff. Either you release a game when its done or you delay the release, this was just bad. Graphics are worse than Black Ops 2, Audio options are nonexisting. Game kept crashing when loading into a multiplayergame due to grphic issues, had to go through all options one by one to find out which blocked me out, only to find that with all to max it still looks like from 4 years ago.   While Playing my first 15 hours I found that more often then not i had very bad pings (you shoot people, die, see the killcam, find out you never fired the 8 shots you know left your gun). Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Infinity Ward appearantly thought that setting the maximum ping for a Server to 800ms would be a good idea, and since there are no ping indicators ingame you wont even know. After changing the value manually by manimulating game configuration data the hard way (means with an classic editor/notepad) i had a harder time finding games (had to wait for about 3 Minutes for a server at times) but at least the gamequality was better. The promissed dedicated servers were nonexistant, some websearch gave me an Infinity Ward statement that they will be comming soon fter release. I haven't seen one of them by now, but hey at least IW will save some server money as the number of players willing to put up with this are falling by the minute.  Last but not least this game is a funfest for cheaters and hackers. And while you can try your best to ignore it, once in a while you may land in a hacked lobby. Of cause you wont know that till you try to capture a target in Domination or get a kill and gain 300 times as much exp as you should get. While that can be seen as a kind of boost on your way to max prestige, it pretty much sucks when you find people that are invulnerable, wallbang with an LMG at 50Kills 0Death rates, find out you just got a server where every weapon has amagazine capacity of 2 shots, where scores get manipulated or people run and jump at several times the normal speed like CoD mutated to some kind of Arena-Shooter. All i saw IW do to prevent this was as follows: Ignore for 2 months, try to grab more money by offering a new skin for a slightly overpowered killstreak (seriously? dogs kill before they even touch you? what happend to the good old time where you at least had 0.3 seconds to cut their throat before yours in ripped out?) for one month and now posting a message of the day saying 'Mimimi, please dont use their party Programs or we will report you to steam.' For me that read like 'When you hit me i call my mom' and sadly that is how the cheaters see it too.  The game was a massive disappointment, i am glad i did not get the season pass and burn more money on a technically old, at times laggy and hack and cheater ruined game. ",

IW seems to have tried to make the game playable with 1 or 2 patches, but its too little too late. The game has literally no player base on steam anymore. The game launched with the promise of dedicated servers, which were never implemented, but at least we got additional dog fur textures, fish AI and PERFECT CIRCLES on our scopes!  The single player is fun for what it is. If you played any CoD campaign you've played Ghosts. Story is weak at best, but still fun. Dog mechanic is interesting and unfortunately only used once or twice. The single player runs just as badly as the multiplayer, but seems to look slightly better. The levels are diverse some being fun and memorable.   Extinction mode however is fun. Its essentially zombies from Blops, but with aliens, and more objectives.  If this game ran properly and cost $15 it would be a game you could buy and not hate yourself for. Currently the game isnt worth buying, even for the single player/extinction mode.

            "review_text": "This is for the multiplayer as I don't buy the game for a short single player. The people who play the game make it bad for the most part. The game is lacking a few features like a FOV slider, a FPS counter, a server browser, something that shows ping, ect. The maps are way to big, unfortunatly the developers don't care to listen to the community, it's clear people like fast paced gameplay yet the devolpers put in big slow paced maps. I think snipers and shotguns need there own game mode because you cannot make two weapons realistic and the rest of the guns unrealistic. There is also a lack of people playing it so you only have a few game mode choices (Team Death Match and Domination the rest have very few people playing them). Compared to other recent Call of Duties it take a lot longer to level up which is not good in my opinon. The leaderboards are hacked already and I would not be suprised if they never got fixed. I have only ran into 1 hacker so far with around 25 hours on the game. IEDS need to be nerfed or there needs to be a way to avoid them besides using a certain perk. I hear a lot about this game being badly optimized but I get very little lag with a FX-8350 and a GTX 660. The game is locked at 91 FPS so 120hz monitors are useless. I liked the older way of class set ups (Cods before Black Ops 2). This prestige system is not good in my opinion either, there was nothing wrong with the old prestige system. Most of the presige icons are plain and not very well thought out. I will admit the game can be fun at times if you don't take it seriously which I highly reccomend you don't as you will just get mad. This game honestly does not feel fresh like a new Call of Duty game should. I do not reccomend buying this game unless the price tag was cheaper.",

            "review_text": "I'm hoping we can look back on this game as the tipping point, when the oversaturation of growly military FPS games finally hit its peak and started to roll back.  The single player campaign is passably entertaining at best, and at worst it's just boring. The only interesting thing about it is how much it oscillates between the two.  The beginning sucks to an almost impressive degree. There's zero actual characterization, you're on rails the entire time, and the plot is ridiculous to the point of it basically being impossible to care about even if you genuinely want to.  The plot never really improves. The game, however, does.  The middle of the game is far and away the best part, where you do a series of 'Invade this base, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, escape' missions. At this point the maps widen out and there's less of a feeling of you being herded from place to place so you can rotely stare at the next explosion. These missions actually get legitimately fun, although it has less to do with good level design and more to do with the fact that those kinds of missions are just inherently fun in and of themselves, and well suited to arcadey shooter games. One of Half-Life 2's standout levels is the assault on Nova Prospekt; Moden-day Wolfenstien's best level by far was an assault on an underground Nazi base; hell, even Quake 1 was full of these kinds of levels. They're just fun to play, and thankfully those missions in Ghosts stand up as being quite fun, if not exactly super-memorable.  Things ramp up in bombast near the end of the game (which is saying something considering this game has an impressive explosions-per-minute rate even on its slowest levels) and it dumps a lot of variety as the narrative starts to urgently jerk around to different people in the same stage, so at the very least the final stages aren't as dull as Act 1, but they do bring back the funnel with a vengence. The final stage, while technically very impressive to look at, is almost literally a straight line from point A to point B; admittedly this is because you're on the back of a moving train, but it still means there's only one direction to go and only one way to do it.  The Multiplayer...Well, it's Call of Duty. What do you want me to say. Did you play pretty much any of the other ones? It's more of that. Whether this is a bad thing or not really depends on whether you like that kind of thing. Honestly, modern-day CoD is basically what Counter-Strike/Day of Defeat was back in '99-2002, and Quake/Goldeneye/Whatever before that -- I played the hell out of Counter-Strike back in the day, so it's hard for me to hate on the CoD MP. It's either a scene you're into (in which case you already own this game) or it isn't (and you may spend a lot of time mystified as to why it's popular). Either way, you don't need me telling you anything about it.  Final Verdict: If you don't have it already (read: You don't care about the MP), wait for a deep discount. Otherwise pass. It's not the worst thing ever, but if you really want to play a Call of Duty game for whatever reason, just go for Black Ops 2. It's a much better in virtually every way.",

Lots of hiding places for campers who love to use the thermal scope to kill you across the entire map with ease. Dogs are annoying because it takes what feels like an entire clip just to kill them, yet one shot to your own leg and you die. They added sliding in the game but it doesn't help avoid being killed since you still die even when you're not aimed at, and the reaction time is screwed up. This game is just not as fun as the previous. Infinity Ward always makes pretty bad Call of Duty games. Later this year when Treyarch releases their new Call of Duty, the franchise might be saved unless they destroyed that, but Treyarch are the kings of Call of Duty, so fingers crossed.",

Optimization The guns look good but everything else doesnt really look that great n its scale is nothing compared to some games i have played yet i have fairly long load times and random fps drops  Latency Due to the game not having dedicated servers multiplayer can often leave you thinking 'wtf just happened?' when you find a legit server with no hackers, there are moments where u will be killed through objects without getting a chance to fight back leaving one to think 'maybe a wallhacker?' then u see the killcam and on their screen they were in position a few seconds before your game caught up n in a game like this those for miliseconds count. also had a few moments where everyone sprints on the spot for about 10seconds then you lag back about 5ft  bugs: The major one for me on singleplayer, im on the first mission where u need to shoot down a helicopter, yet when i pick up the laser bazooka, the chopper never comes.. ive restarted the mission 5 times n everytime he doesnt show up, just a faint sound in the background that never gets any closer so i cannot continue.  Content: Im not a big player of COD games but i do own most of them as i quite like the reward n customisation side to it. however this game feels like they have removed alot n just added a fairly lame soldier customisation, gun / equipment choice is fairly poor as is the killstreak choices. perhaps they are planning to add alot more in DLC which i would not waste my money on.  That being said, the guns available feel quite powerful n enjoyable to use so if you can find a server with no hackers and a decent host Call of duty Ghosts mp makes for an enjoyable pick up and play title if your short on time. Single player just seems like the same old 'america is under attack. Lets get patriotic!' but i suppose they didnt have much time after sorting out the Dog which has its own graphics option 'dynamic fur'.",

America is caught in a middle of war which is staged by one man named Rourke who was a former Ghost gone rogue. So how is this game ? Overall this is game is not good. Now overall COD has been know for over the top action sequence that make you feel like youre in a movie. But ghosts feels almost like Infinity ward was tired and didnt even bother making it any good. So the game is excatly the same as previous COD games so you know the not much diffrent. Overall there are a few problems that i have with this game in particular. The game is sloppy. The Pc port is garbage, the textures are garbage and dont look anything like next gen and they barely look last gen. The games combat feels slopier while it feels more fast paced. The game adds a slide mechanic which doesnt do all that much just lets you get to cover quicker. The game has a few plusses but nothing too much. The sound quality is great and it has a few fun missions. But lets cover the reason why people play Call of Duty the multiplayer. The multiplayer is probably the worst one yet. The server issues occur often and really just draw you out of the game. boring maps. broken spawn system as always and extinction mode which is Blops zombies with aliens instead. Overall i didnt enjoy Call Of Duty Ghosts at all. I really suggest you stay away from COD in general because this franchise is dead and we all know it. I give Call Of Duty Ghosts a 4,5/10",

There is nothing redeeming about this game in any capacity, and that doesn't even include the performance. On my system which is running a GTX 780, an i7-3770k, and 10gb of Ram. The game experiences frequent micro stuttering, weird mouse issues, while providing a level of graphical fidelity that can only be described as lacking. While by this point they had tried to patch out some of the issues by adding an FOV slider in the multiplayer, no such improvement was implemented in the single player portion of this game.

I do not recommend buying this. In fact, you should just buy Black Ops 2 with the money that you saved towards this game, or wait for the upcoming one made by Treyarch.

I'll be talking mostly about the Mutliplayer, 'cause it's the reason why most players buy the game, and single-player, oh well, enougly said with the first mission, being same as last in CoD: MW2...  So, I played game for a quite sometimes, and I just can't forgive it. It's totally different from what other CoD games used to be... (talking about the ones, I'll really likely remember, CoD2...)  Speaking of Multiplayer, I found it really boring, bad, and even disturbing in some case, I'll say all I think about Multiplayer, things I like, and things I don't...  Things I mostly enjoyed about Multiplayer: -Guns, number of guns, their look, attachments... -Perks, and Customizing function are pretty good... -Maps, they aren't bad at all, there are bad ones, but also, there are good ones...  Thing I dislike so much about Multiplayer: -Unbalanced guns, I get killed by same gun I have, but by one hit... -Lags, I got suddenly killed, and in replay screen, I see that guy from other edge of map killed me with knife... -Dogs, I wish I can have dogs like ones in Multiplayer, srsly tho, I can't kill them with 2 bullets of 'sniper rifle'... -Gadgets, the ones like I.M.S. , whole magazine can't kill it, same with satellite (it takes less shots, but still)... -Empty Modes, game has many of game modes, but mostly played ones are Team Deathmatch, and Free For All... -Campers, this should not be a bad thing, CoD always had this players, who makes us all rage... -Unfair kills, usually when I got killed without any explanation, who, and how... -Random spawn, enemy may spawn right behind you, from nowhere, that's why BF is better I guess... -Invisible gadgets, may be bug or something, but I seem to die from I.M.S. that wasn't below me... -No report function while playing, you can report only while in lobby, which is useless... -God like players|OR|Cheaters are everywhere, one shot kill from assault rifle, grenade that somehow caches you no matter where you are... -Strong armors, the one I especially hate, when I spend way so many bullets on enemy, but he don't die...  -Snipers, special skill, that makes player know where you are, and kill you within an bullet... Instantly...  Well, there are really many bad things, In the end, I don't recommand it, especially not for it's price. And one more thing (I TOTALLY WON'T COMMENT) that I said before... Last mission in CoD:MW2 is same as first in CoD:Ghosts, seems like someone has no ideas for their game...  Also, this is WORST game I ever played. So, if you are BIG CoD fan, you should get it, and if you are PRO, otherwise, this is not a game.  In the end, It's all my opinion, I dislike it, and I DON'T recommand it.",

MW3 IMO is a better looking game. As for Valves Anti Cheat Software the hole that was used for MW3 hacks has been implemented in this game as well I'm sure all the hackers from MW3 migrated to Ghost and are not shy about being caught. Why? Good question I suppose nothing is ever done to those who cheat. This is just from what I have seen maybe the cheaters are being removed and they are coming back again and again with new steam accounts I don't know for sure, but I see them the same ones over and over. Unless you want to run a private match and just play with a group of friends who you know don't cheat then you will enjoy the multiplayer part of the game. The game shutters in the lobby and isn't constant some days its fine and others are real bad. Certain video card drivers are know for their display drivers to crash. So my rating for this game is a negative rating. This maybe my last Call of Duty game I'll buy unless I see a change in the fanchise. Dedicated Servers ! Punkbuster Anticheat Software !",

The Verdict: This is a really weird game to review. The story was terribly bland, there was no special feature or change about it from other Call of Duties, and it’s multiplayer is pretty much dead. Usually when I write a review, I can make a pretty good arguments for how it is good or bad, and add my personal 2 cents for the verdict to let you know if I think others should play it or not.

This is just lazy and yet another middle finger to the consumer from Infinity Ward. Not to mention that the requirement for DX11 is not highlighted in the least.  With a requirement that is unheard of, as in I don't know of a single game other than CoD: Ghosts that requires you to have a DX11 video card, Infinity Ward should face some serious penalties monetarily for sneaking that in. I can list about 50 games that absolutely blow CoD: Ghosts out of the water when it comes to graphical requirements, and not a single one of those games even require DX10 to play. Sure you need DX11 and an awesome card to experience those games to their fullest potential, but you can play.  The Radeon HD 6850 I am using won't work with CoD: Ghosts. The reason? DX11. The card supports it, but you have to flash the bios to update it to work with DX11. Flashing a video card bios, even to extremely avid gamers, is not something that is easy to do. Most people just don't have that technical skill. Not to mention that flashing your bios is a dangerous task even if you know what you are doing.  Overall I give the game a 6 out of 10 for the single-player campaign. I give it a 2 out of 10 for multi-player, as there is nothing new or innovative about reskinning some weapons and making some maps that take about 20 minutes. Factor in the required DX11 and I give it a 0 out of 10 for one of the most ridiculously idiotic decisions to have ever come from a major game studio.",

Here it goes:  We tend to forget the pain we experience. Until we are reminded of it. This latest installment of the COD franchise reminded me of the pain I experienced a year ago when the previous installment was release with much fanfare. This latest release is so bland, so linear, so constricted, the great graphics(when they don't stutter) cannot offset game's single player shortcomings.  Yes, the game graphics are impressive but so do many its contemporaries. Just take a look at Metro 2033 or BioShock Infinite! Both games run circles around latest COD franchise installment!  If you are looking for a smooth running game, this is not the game for you. If you are looking for a good storyline, this is not the game for your. If you are looking for game that gives you options in how you accomplish your tasks, this is not a game for you. If you want a mindless action game, this game IS for you.",

Although I`d would have been nice to have the option to make different choices like in Black Ops 2.  Now about the multiplayer, I think the main reason most people, including me, buy this game. The performance of the MP is very poor, a lot of lags which still have not been fixed so far. Also most of the maps, compared to Modern Warefare 2 and Black Ops 2, are way to big and so the gameplay gets very boring for my opinion. I also think the perk system is way to overload this time.  In sum, the multiplayer feels like a big beta, which is not to recommend at the moment. I hope this will get fixed soon. Also pre order bonuses like the 'Into Deep Player Pack' from Amazon do not work and the Activision support has no clue how to fix anything. Bonuses form Call of Duty Elite do not work for Steam players and so on. The app is crap! That is all to say about the new Call of Duty app.  Update 03.03.2014: The game is still very laggy, you can`t find any lobbys in HC and russian hackers are everywhere!!!

The only thing these lieing theiving dirtbags are supporting would be their lawyers and offshore bank accounts.  I've tried 3 times, months apart, to play this and it's just constantly disgusting at every turn. Yay, there's a weakly generated dog that only serves to be a pawn to pull emotions from gamers that never got that puppy growing up. There's the typical loosely connected storyline with terrible (And still currently broken) cinematics and c-list movie quality dialogue. So single player is out.   Multiplayer... Wow, someone should have locked away the guys that pulled this garbage pile together so they could walk away and pretend it never happened. It feels like a console port that doesn't work for mouse and keyboard and Not at all for gamepad. The acceleration and cluttered thoughtless keyboard layout is horrible with the mouse and keyboard (I even tried recently again with a g13 gameboard) and the gamepad doesn't support aim assist to bring up controller players to 70% of the mouse/keyboard players' capabilities... I can definitely play with either input as I have no issues with GTA V, Titanfall or CSGO. I'll stick to the original Blackops on my PS3 (Which was a bad enough ripoff as it was) and write off this horrifying franchise once and for all.

Understanding the loadout system took a while to learn as well as it is not user friendly, the grenades and tatical items will also take some getting used to as they do not conform to realism i.e. motion detector which you start with does not show them on your mini map but instead will explode like a mine and then allow you to see them through walls for a brief period of time. Killstreaks have also changed in this game some for the better and some for the worse but this will be more of a personal opinion. Game requirements have recently been lowered so that is a major improvement. Maps while it was said they were larger in reality they are still the size best suited for run and gun playstyle than sniper nests and the enviroment is more suited for constant movement rather than 'camping' an area or section of the map. However on the other hand the maps have several layers to them 2-3 most of the time so they have more depth and passageways to areas so creating a choke point is much more difficult. In this respect the maps could be considered larger.  Overall this game feels like more of an updated version of counter-strike where you have a small team to complete your objective. The responsiveness of the game is still very good but suffers from the lack of a server it still uses the p2p system.",

Thats not even the start.. Now the genius idea was to increase the damage so everybody dies faster. Good idea in retrospect but very poorly excecuted in this game, because if you mix the head glitchers with extra damage its damn near impossible to get them. I have come to the realization that Infinity Ward does not make a new and exciting game. They take past games they made ramp them up a little and call it a completely different thing. An example of this is after the success of Modern Warfare 2 'IW' tried to create a sequel, which felt like Modern Warfare 2.5 but 'IW' called Modern Warfare 3. Now 'IW' makes Ghosts but they should have called it 'Modern Warfare 3 and some filler'.   Closing this rant the last couple things I'm gonna say is  - I will NEVER be buying another Call of Duty game if it is made by Infinity Ward again. Giving me crap on a plate is one thing but don't put sprinkles on it and call it cake, in the end its still just crap.   - I feel that giving this game a Metascore of 68/100 is giving this game a huge round of applause. personally i wouldnt even have rated it more than 60 but thats out of my control.",

From the minute I first launched the game (PC platform) the gameplay was terrible - the interface screens all stuttered (most online user reviews will point this out), even eight months later no smoothness is in sight. The spawns are designed to keep your deaths as high as possible. The guns are breathtakingly weak, put a silencer on them and you have cool looking backscratchers. Motion in this game is anything but smooth. The one thing that really bothers me is how the game reacts rigidly when you are turning corners, passing through doorways - you will run into and be blocked by these things, along with pebbles, boxes and anything that occupies space in the gameworld. This makes the game feel like a product from 2004 and earlier. How the game scored such rave reviews on day 1 is a mystery; luckily the true game reviews are in place now. Even 68% is an overestimmation. Poorly designed game - poor game engine for 2014 - poor support (they still haven't fixed most of these things for PC) - false advertisement.

Single player multiplayer squad team and alien horde mode. Singleplayer is nothing new there is a stupid plot about black country attacking america which now is almost only populated by white people huh. You know the routine find bad guys hideout kill him and kill black people on the way. But now there is a twist you can play as a dog :O but it almost dosen't matter because you can only play as the dog in 2 levels and after that its just hiding in helis. Yeah the games says its suppose to be about stealth but one of the first things you do is driving a burning fuc**** truck into a enemy base. So the singleplayer is just there so don't buy the game on console if you don't have xbox live or a internet connection. So multiplayer dear lord the multiplayer is just so so meh. Theres nothing really special about it other then you can call in a dog to help you and if you pay 2 dollars you can get a wolf skin to him. But its not worth it and it has no other animations so don't. squad mode is a game mode where you can team up with up to 3 other humans and fight it out 4 vs 4 players or 4 vs horde ai enemys. Alien horde mode is pretty cool the first 30 minutes after you find out its boring. So conclusion the game looks outdated and ugly singleplayer sucks multiplayer is nothing you haven't seen before squad mode is just team deathmatch with only 4 people and alien mode gets boring quick. But the game is at least working compared to battlefield 4 at launch so theres that.",

And then you ripped off the dark night rises on the beginning of the hunted and elias kept asking rorke questions instead of killing him which is what he was supposed to do! Then Elias dies and he shouldve died in the sequal or a later part of the game then Riley is now usless and you ripped off battle feild 4 in all or nothing.Then this is what im disapointed at most of all, Rorke dosnt die after he drowns,get shots and well other things, so unrealistic. next time make rorke actually die instead of being to lazy to make up a new villain, then he drags away Logan into the same hole in the amazon.PART 2 Oh and multiplayer sucked as well.First of all the match making was terrible this game is full of russains and instead of zombies you had to put the crappy extincion and make crap up.In multiplayer theres laggers,hackers,trolls and spawn campers and to little hackers get banned and at least give us a ping chart.Dont buy this game unless your a russain or canadian that likes making people mad!",

Maps like Stone(d)haven, Prison Break, and Stormfront are downright atrocious. This is Call of Duty, a fast paced and fun arcade shooter. Why do you make these giant maps with no flow where you can literally be shot from anywhere and die so quickly you have no clue what happened? Who thought this was a good idea?  And of course we have Space Cats and Weed camo DLC. Seriously? Are you high? And then you have Snoop Dogg doing voice overs, so you can take this game even less seriously. It's like this game was so bad, even the developers gave up on it.  Now this review may just sound like a broken record (and it is), but I tell you the game is even more broken.

I knew this game wouldn't be that great because Black Ops 2 was starting to be unappealing, which a friend bought for me because he wanted me to play with him. I have always enjoyed the single player campaign more then multiplayer since I started playing the Call Of Duty series back in 2005 in the WWII setting, I've actually ended my Counter-Strike career and shut off my servers along with bringing some of my clan-mates with me to enjoy the COD games with the release of XBOX 360 in November of that year. Lately there has been much dissapointment in the development of the series, and the multiplayer action just doesn't feel the same as it used to, it has nothing to do with playing skills, or the skills of others, it's simply graphics and overall gameplay. I am speculating Advanced Warfare will be the end for COD, just not enough good development and technology breakthrough, the games just feel cheap, and the DLC's are getting out of hand. Look at what happened with CryTek, they made an awesome Crysis game, then came out with an ok sequel, then a crappy game rushed after that one. If the corporate COD gold diggers would come out with a game worthy of a PC upgrade rather then degrade a game so a 2005 spec computer can play it (ignore minimum requirements, game runs fine well under it), they will win my heart back, as well as many others. I want to feel that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic eye candy again, no more of this pixelated garbage, we veteran gamers have computers more then capable of running way better games. Make me upgrade my PC!",

Usually two of us have to go into a game and third person will have to join after and hope he gets on our team which most of the time does not happen. I do like the bigger maps and the graphics look better. New game modes are really nice too but i never get to play them because not enough people play them. If we had true dedicated servers with a server browser like COD 4 it would make joining games so much easier. There would be servers dedicated for the less popular game modes that you can always join and actually play. This would also bring down the ridiculous amount of cheaters in this game. I never seen a game with more cheaters that go unpunished and actually brag about it in the game. If you NEED to play a COD game while your waiting for Treyarchs usual better game (BO 2 has more people playing than Ghosts) then go ahead and get this game.

A patch has been put out for the game which resolved some of the problems but it is far from perfect. I for one will not be purchasing another game Activision or Infinity Ward pushes since they obviously are geared toward console gaming. To sum it up, no dedicated servers (this is absolutely the most important to me), very poor PC support, constant gaming issues, weak implementation of anti-cheat (like reporting does any good) and the best parts of the Ghosts preview videos do not exist in multiplayer.

For starters, this game is an absolutely TERRIBLE port to PC. You need practically a super-computer to run it and get good FPS. Another big part of why I don't recommend this game is that there are very few people playing it, and the few who do are usually master prestiege tryhards who will melt you with their seemingly magical headshot powers. Authough many people say that this game makes a new low in gaming, there are alot of things that this game actually did right.  PROS: -Many perks to choose from -Player customization -Good hit detection (even though you usually get melted by the time you ads) -Able to play as campaign characters from other Call of Duty Games -An astronaught suit  CONS: -The maps are bad -Hackers  -OP dogs -MTAR X -Very low player base -Hard to get into a game   Overall, I would not spend your hard earned money on this game. They just didn't care about the PC players this time around. I would spend my money on a game like Black Ops 2 or Advanced Warfare instead of this game. The final question is: Is it possible to have any fun at all playing this game? The answer is Yes, you can.

Also hilarious how much extra content they are trying to sell to 'da kids' eg new guns, camos, ski masks etc ie useless bs....65/100 as per common rating is about right. MW3 and BO2 still the recent best for COD, with MW3 being more for the purist... fast, clean, hi res, smooth, fairly balanced, all round hella good fun. Do i recommend? well 'kinda', but can easily skip it, no probs (such a shame as the maps are pretty good). Perks system is over complicated. Ah well, it was worth a try, just didnt work out ;*( (lets not even start on the rampant hackers from day 1, omfg, cant they detect/prevent that yet?) Too much to be disappointed with overall.

            "review_text": "This review is specifically related to the game's optimization (or, should I say, lack thereof). I have a Lenovo Y510p laptop, with two NVidia GT 755M in SLI configuration (not an impressive hardware configuration, but quite respectable). I've managed to play 'Wolfenstein: The New Order' on it's highest settings (on 1920x1080) which is an amazing game by today's standards, but 'Call of Duty: Ghosts' pretty much dies/crashes if I try to do the same. This is, of course, because the game is poorly optimized. I contacted support (btw, amazing support team, Activision) and they asked me to downgrade the resolution until the game would stop crashing, which I found (after a couple of tries) was around 1366x768 (which I later confirmed with NVidia's GeForce Experience tool): This is almost 720p, which makes the game horrible to play due to heavy pixelation. On the other hand, the latest Wolfenstein incarnation was incredibly well optimized, so well that it takes a trained eye to realize where optimization happens (e.g., loading and adapting textures on-the-fly as the player scans the scene).   For a game on this price range, I would have expected a bit more attention to detail: Since not everybody updates their rig every year, optimization should be a non-brainer for developers such as Activision to reach more end users, who would happily pay for a game that works on a decent piece of hardware. It doesn't take a product manager or marketing person, nor an epiphany, to realize this is important.   It's not all the game's fault though : I hope Steam had offered a demo of the game, so that I would have realized about this before buying it (and don't tell me to read the “Game hardware requirements”... they are worthless when there are a gazillion combinations of hardware components in a PC that can alter the performance of a rig)",

And yet, I'm walking down the same corridor shooting the same 'bad guys' with a machine-gun I can't remember the name of. It's abysmally mindless, and I'm left wondering how this could possibly be the most popular, best selling bunch of videogames on the market. What if something intelligent had this sort of budget? What if Vampire Bloodlines, Armored Core, Deus Ex or S.T.A.L.K.E.R (to name a few more interesting games from the top of my head) had this sort of money to blow on grandiose environments and production? Sure, it's in the name of accessibility, but I feel like I'm being treated like an idiot by the game.
