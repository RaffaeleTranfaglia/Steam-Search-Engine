            "review_text": "When you hear people on Steam lament about 'another RPG Maker game,' it's because of stuff like this.   The writing isn't bad, no. It isn't even worth referring to as 'writing.' This may have been made by some youngsters or something because this reminds me of the kind of thing I wrote with my buddies back in middle school because of the absurd lack of depth to anything and childish dialogue. EX: Main character walks into a monastery and comments, 'This monastery is s**t!' or some such. He just uses profanity and yells at things I ASSUME so that he sounds like some kind of cool dude with a 'tude or something? That's half the time. The other half he's just blandly helpful. He loves his girlfriend (or I guess you could choose to not tell your girlfriend you love her?). He's mostly helpful, but he complains a lot. Which is probably supposed to be some kind of parody of RPG tropes and their bland fetch quests and such. Maybe he's supposed to be bipolar? Regardless, there are a ton of easily avoided spelling and grammar mistakes (EX: use of the word 'abandonned').  I'm not just ragging on these guys for choice of words and typo's, though. Oh, no. The story itself reads like a kid wrote it. Seriously, it's like Axe Cop only not hilarious or creative. For example, at some point you enter a village and are asked to go to a cave to stop... bandits or something (?) from attacking said village. A mercenary guy joins your party to help you as he is emotionally invested in helping this village, I think. In the cave you fight some kind of ghostly knights and an ogre. Then you stumble upon a time travel amulet for no reason. The main character goes 'Sweet!' and finds out how to go back in time. The whole reason you came to that cave (remember the village being attacked?) was completely forgotten the moment you stepped into that cave and the warrior who joined you silently sticks with you for the rest of the adventure, given no characterization or lines of dialogue again (save for maybe pointing out the amulet is a time travel amulet). Later on, after you're done using the time travel amulet, a pop-up tells you the amulet is now broken. I can only assume this was some kind of afterthought when someone asked, 'Why don't they just travel back in time again?' Maybe it only held enough magic for one use, but where does this place you in time? And why was the demon you were chasing exist in the same time line? It seems like when it broke you went back to the future and yet he's there with you. What kind of sloppy nonsense is this!  The whole game is like this. The first town has you start in a prison that you break out of. But then it's said the prison guards somehow hold the town hostage. So, doesn't that make them warlords or something? Not just 'prison guards?' Why do they bother running a prison? Did they turn the castle into a prison? And they all live there? What?  How about the combat? Well, it's overly basic. I guess some people think this is par for the course for RPG Maker games or JRPG's, but I think it's plain lazy. Sometimes you have to heal or manage your mana, so I guess that's something. But there's so little strategy and so much overlap between the classes.  If there's one consolation it's the music. Sweet Christmas, this person poured his/her heart into it. I mean, it's not that it's outstanding. You know? Like I'm not rushing to get the MP3's onto my iPod or anything. But there's actual composition, effort, know-how, and emotion in it. There's even a live (I think) guitar in there! I'm a sucker for metal, true, but those boss fights were intense ONLY because of this chugging distortion and orchestral synth-work. Composer, please, whoever you are, ditch these guys. You actually have some amount of talent and skill! These guys can't even piece together any kind of semblance of a game.",

However, the game is rather short. The story is mediocre at best and the dialogue is poor. The combat is not very compelling and fun and gets boring immediately.   At its core the game is a classic turn-based RPG and throws you back to the good old role-playing games. ",

I was disappointed right off the bat when the controller input did not work correctly, but I am a trooper and decided to play it with the keyboard. That minor glich aside, I was truely enjoying this game. The storyline, although cheesey, was good, the mechanics seemed natural and the dialog was pretty decent. I was two hours in very invested and then poof, game over. I realize this was a $5 purchase but i expect a little more. It's true you can replay it as different characters or play the game+ after one playthrough, but knowing the story was so short I didnt feel interested at all. If you don't see this title on sale I wouldn't recommend it.",

The game itself was not long as I beat it in 3 hours and all the side quests. I will be going back to play the other classes and modes. The music is well done and very nice to listen too, basic turn based fighting, and a few diffrent type of monsters and bosses. There is crafting but not really worth it unless you make a few bombs here and there to get some secret chests. There is fishing, dosen't really do much except for a side quest. Mini game if you want to call it that called 'the trials' a few rounds beating monsters and getting some better loot.  Hopefuly we get a dlc or update, they could take this story farther after what happens in the game (won't spoile the game for people), maybe add in few more islands, cities, some more side quests, items, monsters, refine the crafting system a bit. I'd pretty much take anything.  Good: -good concept of a game -great music -side quests -crafting  Bad: -way to short -not enough content (items, spells, locations, dungeons, mini games, achievement, ect) -$4.99 (should be free) -story to clich√© (needs a twist)  overall it's a good game to me, I love rpg's but to most I see that they wouldn't get into this. 6.5 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "There are two main reasons I   cannot   recommend this game in its current state.  Firstly, the text is swamped with grammatical and spelling errors. Though easily fixable, they exist in such numbers that documenting them all and reporting them is more work that the task is worth; I honestly did not expect to buy a game that still required extensive proofreading and copy editing.  The second point nearly drove me to stop playing this game altogether -- during the opening of the game and all through (what I am assuming is supposed to be) the intro, your main character's name is simply 'Hero'. If the intro was quite short, this would not likely be much of an issue, but when you add the generic hero 'Hero' to the error-strewn text, this part of the game becomes, well,  boring  and feels extremely long.   (For example, playing through this 'intro' took me three (real-world) days over what had to have been only 15 or less in-game minutes.)",

First off, this game is NOT the game you want to play if you have not played any 'old' games.  Why? because this game has the mechanics and graphics of an old game. If you are not that old enough to play those games... Well let's just say you will definitely not enjoy this game at all.  Now on to the game. Story is relatively easy to predict up till this point of the game(2HR or so) but at the very least it's not THAT easy to predict. You still can guess what will happen later onwards, wonder what is happening, and so on.  Not really that bad if you just want to try a random new game out, plenty of quests and apparently an world map very large. 2 hours in the game and I've just completed my first city, along with a dungeon and a quest from another city.(By first city I mean I finished all quests in that city)  All in all I personally would recommend the game to a friend, but due to it's mechanics and graphics, not everyone will like it for sure.

These aren't orginal ideas, of course -  Planescape: Torment  did all that first - but they're unusal enough that it's nice to see them being used here. Even so, the class switching and skill honing seem out of place in a game that doesn't last long enough for the player to fully take advantage of them. Also, the game seems weirdly unbalanced in some ways (maces are OP, and magic is both more costly and weaker than physical attacks, to name a couple). What really kills it, though, is that the writing is so bad it's almost funny (and peppered with typos). If I play an RPG, I want to be playing it for the story, and this one was just one big cliche (girlfriend gets abducted - check; demonic big bad - check; nebulous plot for world domination - check... I could go on, but I think that's enough). Don't let that stop you if you're one of the many people who got it for free - who knows, you might actually enjoy it, and it's only 5 or 6 hours long anyway - but I wouldn't recommend buying it.",
