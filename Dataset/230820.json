The graphics are good, the hero is enjoyable but there is a lot of backtracking required. In the end I would recommend it if you are a fan of the genre or of the games created by Deadalic. If you are not, maybe it is best to look elsewhere. Good game but not the best in the crop.",

This game shows humour, puzzles, jokes, riddles, emotions, a nice story and a nice twist to those.  I got this game on sale. Honestly i don't think it is the pricetag worthy, put it is pretty damn close. Gameplay time: approximately 8-10 hours depending on how good you are at puzzle solving, or if you'd like to explore and find every little hidden gem in the game.  7/10 Try it out.  ",

            "review_text": "Created by Daedalic Entertainment, this is the actually the first click and adventure game I have played from them and it appears that this game doesn't receive quite a lot of attention as the other more popular series (Deponia, Edna &amp; Harvery, etc.) but The Night Of The Rabbit stands nicely and here are my thoughts on it:  (Edited 19th November 2014)  1.) Graphics (9/10)  Ah, this section is where the game truly shines. The background environment is really beatiful with a mystical charm to it and almost every parts of the game are interesting to view. No doubt that they have heavily emphasize on the artwork that compels you to explore further into the world of anthromorphic inhabited world of Mousewood.   As for the characters, they are drawn in 2D graphics which works well for the beautiful background and simple to look at them. Quite a large amount of characters in here and most are based on animals.  Despite all that, they are some minor problems I have seen in this game, in a sense with the dialogues that appear on screen does not match with the voice acting. However, it isn't really bad enough to ruin the experience.  2.) GamePlay (7/10)  As for this part, it is a simply, straight to the point clicking around until you make progress story wise game. It is a nice of them to include in a short tutorial on the controls and it was done in a fun way. As you continue on, you are required to solve many puzzles along the way, which requires you to combine items and using them. There are also some puzzles which requires to be done in a certain order that would only work. No doubt that some puzzles can be challenging and you have to think hard in order to solve it.  Unfortuntely, some puzzles can become cumbersome, back tracking involved routine and rather vague, despite the fact that you can refer to your journal which sadly offered only minimal help. There were a few several times when I got stuck completely and had no choice but to end up relying on a guide by other players, which I have to admit this is a bit disappointing and it may cause some players to shy away. All in all, the puzzle part could have use more thought and polishing to it by the creators but still the job is done well enough for an indie game.  3.) Sound / Voice Acting / Music (8.5/10)  Oh boy this is another part where the game shines too, whereby most of all the characters (Except for a few particular residents of Mousewood) had their own voice acting that fits their personalities and appearance very well. From the main character to the most minor characters, it is nice to talk to them and listen to their various quirky and serious dialogues altogether.  The music is really good too, even the main menu for a simple click adventure game can sound really mysterious when paused. Every parts of the game had their own distinct music and in my opinion it fits well on every mood.  However, the most annoying part of the game is that during the process of solving a puzzle and if you made a mistake, you are forced to listen many of the same lines over and over again but thankfully this can be easily mitigated by simply skipping with clicks of the mouse.   4.) Story (7/10)  The main part of the game, hmm to be honest I have mixed feelings about it. You play as a young boy by the name Jeremiah Hazelnut or simply called Jerry, a very tenacious and curious boy who would one day strive to become a famous magician. He is currently on a summer holiday which will end in two days and so Jerry decides to spend his two remanining days looking for adventures in an innocent child perspective right nearby the comfort of his home that lies at the edge of the town in a forest. As time passes, a strange mysterious letter appeared inside his mailbox and in it contains an magical incantation and an invitation for him to come over into the world of Mousewood.  Jerry then gladly follows the instructions on the paper and with that it summons a very strange yet interesting character which happens to be an anthromorphic white rabbit namely Marquis De Hoto. The marquis turns out to be a magician and also a TreeWalker, who is capable of traversing through various portals found at certain places only and their main job is to help its inhabitants, protect and restore the balance of many worlds. Being a naive minded yet excited typical of a boy, Jerry agrees to be his apprentice in order to become a great magician and from there the story continues.  The first part of the game starts off pretty slow but as the game moves on we start to dwelve deeper into the mysteries of Mouseworld and other worlds that Jerry will visit in his quest, which picks up the story. But sadly, towards the last part of the game feels kind of rushed, sloppy and the ending, in my opinion was a bit lacking in its punch and left a few things unanswered. I'm not sure if this was intended by the creators to open for a sequel which I hope it may bring a closure to it.  There is also the bonus content if you purchase the premium version of the game, it brings some stories which sets in the same universe of Mouseworld that you can see and unlocks along the way in your game play which brings a bit more content of the game  Conclusion (8/10)  In short, The Night Of The Rabbit excels in its Graphics and Audio department but slightly spoiled by certain tough puzzles and the lack of proper conclusion to the story as well as the quality dropping towards the end. Still, it makes for a good experience and I am certainly looking forward to seeing a sequel being made for this game.",

            "review_text": "What can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed this game; it exceeded all my expectations, and then some. (This is especially right after having played A New Beginning, a game which I probably wouldn't wish on anyone.)  Pros: - Very captivating storyline; the game is mysterious throughout, and succeeds at maintaining suspense - Voice acting (English) is truly exceptional, especially for a game which doesn't have English as its native language - Art style, cutscenes, and music are all utterly beautiful and very fitting; reminded me very much of those cartoons I used to watch as a kid of talking animals in enchanted forrests - Main character is likeable, which makes the game all the more a joy to play - Fairly interesting mini-game (Quartets) - Unlike most other point-and-click games, this one has several different types of objects to collect along the way (e.g. dewdrops, stickers, cards, stories) which make you pay more attention to the environment; personally, this made me appreciate the art better - Generally solid gameplay, very decent amount of content  Cons: - For most of the game, there will be concurrent side-missions or objectives available for you to do (e.g.   constructing a net to catch a dandelion seed  ) which you will only be able to actually solve towards the later part of the game; the fact that these objectives can still be activated by the character early on in the game makes it a bit confusing for the player, because it is unclear what should or can be done first, especially since the main plot is still linear - Rather strange mini-game in the finale  Overall, this is a very beautiful and captivating game which I would recommend to anyone. It even comes with audiobook stories which, if you'll excuse me, I shall go listen to now.  To Daedalic: Please produce a sequel to this game! Especially with the way it ended.",

The amazing soundtrack and the hand-painted art style (as you might know from various other titles that were created by the German developer studio 'Daedalic Entertainment') complete this awesome experience and caught me from the very beginning. I might even say this is my favourite adventure so far.",

            "review_text": "This is game is sort of an odd one, but I loved it. A slow, seemingly child-aimed point and click adventure game opens up to a bit more wonderous story with some great depth in lore and setting, but like an origin story it ends before it can really get into that enticing depth.  The story follows one Jeremy Hazelnut as he finds himself whisked away on a wizard apprenticeship in some alternate dimensions. As stated above, it opens a bit slow but a bit less than halfway through the game the background and world building that has gone into the game begins to show itself. The puzzles are occasionally a bit confusing as is always the case in P&amp;C games, but as the game goes on that problem pops up much less often. My only real grip with the puzzles is that as you progress you learn spells as part of your apprenticeship, but you end up barely using them for the importance it is presented with in the story. German voice acting is robust and enjoyable, and some of the music is downright amazing (although sadly not on the soundtrack). The ending of the story opens up a much deeper setting that sadly this game does not get into exploring, but if Daedelic ever makes a sequel I am very much looking forward to seeing more of the story.  The game comes with some some audio stories collected as you play the game that add a bit to the world building. While they are relevant content, unfortunately they can be a bit... difficult to listen to. Listen to the one with the deer who can't sleep, and pass on the rest.  Game performed flawlessly, no audio or performance glitches. I played about 14 hours (minus one or two for listening to the audio stories and away). I really enjoyed myself, its one of the better P&amp;C adventure games I've played. I'd recommend it.",

Especially with the hint of the Ninja shadow bunny planeswalker!!! So cool. Definitely a thumbs up.   Note : I had to complete the game with a walkthrough. The hints were really lousy.  PROS 1. Story So interesting. It's great to see all the little details in the story slowly get unravelled as the game progresses. The blurred overlap between a boy who is dreaming up his own imagination and a real fantasy world is fantastic.  2. Artwork Fantastic. The details of Mousewood are so intriguing. The level of creativity is something amazing.  3. Secrets Dewdrops. Need I say more?  4. Card Game Very cool. It's nice to know that there's another game designed within a game. It's the hallmark of the good game to have mini-games within the main game. E.g. Final Fantasy series. Do note that The Night The Rabbit is a simple game of Go Fish.  5. Credit Ending Nice to see that there was so much more. I won't spoilt the ending but there's a lot more to do. It's much better than the standard boring credit roll. I must admit that I didn't really pay attention to who's who in the credits though.   CONS  1. Frog Clicker Very tedious method of travelling. Can't you just blow on the horn to call Plato, the frog.  2. Spells Not really useful except in specific circumstances. I was hoping for the spells to interact more. E.g. Stone Whispering spell was good as you could use it on all the statues, Green Growth and Fox's Cunning were a little too limited.  3. Items Way too limited to be used only for specific locations. It would be great to use them on non-quest objects and Jerry would tell you if it was not important.  4. Hints You need better ones.",

This is a pretty solid, likeable point and click game and I liked it so much that I decided to write a review. But the point I want to underline is, the story of the game. At the beginning I was like, 'Ok, the looks good' but as I proceed, I liked the story more and more. And at the end, I really felt satisfied. I mean, it really felt like a proper endind. The characters were detailed and entertaining, adding the gameplay more fun overall. The atmosphere is simply captivating. If you are an achievement hunter, some of them might be boring to obtain but compared to other games with mind-melting achievements, they dont look that frightening. At some points, outsmarting the game may be difficult because some solutions were hard to think of. But these strange solutions aren't so frequent and not so frustrating. TL DR, this game is a really good point and click game, perhaps one of the best P&amp;C games I have ever played.",

A much more mature story and characters compared to Daedalus' Deponia series.   Most of the puzzles are well constructed and intuitive, with a few issues. A couple of puzzles were obtuse, and required something approaching a pixel hunt. In one case you have to stay and wait for an NPC to follow the same routine you've seen him do a dozen times before so you can see the outcome of your actions; I had left the location to do the next step in the plan only to find out I had to return and wait. Frustrating. The finale ultimately comes down to a timed 'battle', which felt overlong and slow. There was no challenge once you grasped the concept, but you had to repeat it 3 more times. If they feel the need for combat they could learn a thing or two from the Monkey Island series.  Overall an enjoyable game, I would recommend it to any fan of point and click games. I can't wait to see what they do next.",

Anyways, to be completely honest, the first 3 hours spent in this game, I was bored. The story didn't really catch my attention, but after finishing the starter quests I finally realised we are talking about a really good game here. Here is what you should expect: Puzzles: If you've played Deponia, the puzzles are way easier. I used the guide only 2 times through the whole game which surprised even myself, since in Deponia I used it about 20 times in each game (especially in Goodbye Deponia). Fun puzzles and straight to the point with many hints to tell you what to do. Story: The story, to be honest. is weird. Weird, but personally I found it quite fun. At a point it becomes quite emotional but the main character gets back on track and finishes it off with a happy ending.  Length: Longer than most point and click games + it has a bonus collection where you collect stuff throughout the game (has also audio book which can give you more details about the story). I should go back and collect the rest, but oh well.  If I had to grade this game, I'd say 9.5/10 (lel.) The story is just, weird. The game however is plain amazing, probably the best point and click I've played (placing it even above Deponia which is one of my personal favorites).  Overall, a fantastic title worth playing.",

Lack of varied speech replies/character animation Minor bugs are still in the game, like misplased/missing lables or, more game-breaking, glitches in game reply to player action Why the game would be lagging somewhat where Assasin's Creed 4 flies on max is also beyond me Overall: Would skip this one, possibly looking into direction of Chaos on Deponia",

But still manages to follow the fine red line throughout the story. Which is great.   The puzzles are a bit hard at times, so a guide is handy when you bump into these parts.  Overall a great game I'd recommend to people loving an adventure. With an extraordinary soundtrack. Wow!",

Some of the puzzles were very logical, while other ones were hit and miss, ie: you could only combine certain elements in a certain order, even if it shouldn't matter what order things are done, causing you to think you must have done something wrong. Also, the dialogue sometimes is matched with character movements, so even if you try to quickly skip over lengthy bits, the game just waits until the animation has completed before moving onto the next bit of dialogue, basically forcing you to wait for it.   Aside from some of those less than logical puzzles, the story itself was really well told, and there is a great epilogue to help tie things together.",

Beautifully painted illustrations Great soundtrack Good story with a positive message Interesting characters with decent voice acting, Some dialogue can be quite long and slow, but it sets the mood and characterization... until you accidentally talk to them again. Thank goodness for being able to skip through dialogues. Puzzles with varying difficulty. I must admit I needed to look up the guide for a couple of solutions. Offers a decent amount of playtime  I especially liked the final chapter presentation. The only thing that could've been improved was the Quartet card game speed. Being a linear adventure game, there isn't much replay value, but I do recommend watching the beginning again after you finish the game, as it will make a lot more sense.  All in all, it was a nice adventure and I enjoyed it very much.",

At the moment though I am let down and disappointed by the technical difficulties the game experiences as well as the lack of progress. The puzzles often lead to dead ends rather than chaining to the next puzzle, pushing you further along in the story. If this weren't bad enough to deal with, the convoluted puzzles have far fetched solutions that and it is difficult to come up with the solutions. Although the environment and atmosphere of the game are pleasant and charming my immersion into the game is brought to a halt every time my game crashes (which is quite frequent.) I am using a fairly new iMac with decent specs and good processing power that can match the unbelievably high requirements provided by this game. For a point and click adventure it certainly is convoluted. My recommendation? Wait for a patch or fix or even wait for Daedalic’s next game because this one isn't ready for playing.",

It has its flaws, but I'd recommend it overall, especially (but not exclusively) to younger people. I think the game's ideal audience might be 12 year olds or so, but the young at heart can also enjoy it.  Pros: + Great artwork. Not only is it good, it really suits the game and makes it look like illustrations in a storybook--the good kind that you'll always have a soft spot in your heart for + Voice acting is also good, and suits the game well + Overall, most of the point and click puzzles are pretty good. Not too many are nonsensical or overly frustrating--though the in-game 'hint' system is awful. You may need to consult a walkthrough a couple of times. + Story and setting are very creative. This game is not your standard genre cliche.  + Story is very good and features some nice twists  Cons: - Game can be a little boring. The game is more charming and imaginative than it is exciting or action-packed - Interactions with characters are a bit one-dimensional and at times reminded me of the shallow interactions on a children's TV show. The main story has some depth, but the 'everyday' interactions are not very good. There is none of the grittiness behind characters that you see in many games. - Pacing of the story is off. The game really drags at spots, and on the other hand huge chunks of story blow past in the ending cutscene. You spend most of the game guessing at what's going on, then everything is revealed all at once.",

Exploring the woods near his house on one of the last days of summer, he encounters a talking magic rabbit who offers to train him to be a magician. The rabbit then whisks them away to a quaint miniature village populated by talking mice, where most of the game takes place.  Verdict: I loved it! Great atmosphere, great art, great story, great voice-acting, great music, great puzzles, great everything! The setting was charming without being twee. The story was funny with just the right amount of serious darkness and wonder. The puzzles, for the most part, made sense and were self-evident once I'd considered my remaining inventory items and options.  The only downside was one or two puzzles with ridiculous unguessable solutions, but even then, there were fewer of those than in most point-and-click adventure games.  So I certainly recommend getting this one.",
