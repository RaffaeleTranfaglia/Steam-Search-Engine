            "review_text": "Game was and still is so cool, but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time. I usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit. Mods i use: - Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game - Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents - True Storms: Intensifies the original weather of Skyrim, making it look much tougher. (Thing i most appreciate of this mod is how you can listen the rain falling on the roof while you are inside a cabin. - Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster - Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing. - Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad. - Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them. - Waves: Now beaches with waves :D - Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense. - Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers. - Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter. - iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable. - Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff - Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar. - Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH) - Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon. - When vampires attack: Same with vampires - The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life.  - Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard. - Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill 'i barely know how to hold the sword'. - Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game. - Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north. - Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle. - NPC's Run and Walk at your pace: exactly what the mod says. - Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something... - MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks. - Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD! - Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city - Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. - RLO: Realistic Lights Overhaul. Also makes darkness darker, so no need to download 'darker nights' BTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly",

            "review_text": "I've played this game throughout multiple times, I never modded it as I prefer games to run Vanilla. Meaning for all those hours I dealt with Vanilla Skyrim graphics and I can confirm that there is a HUGE difference. As soon as I started in the wooden carriage with the prisoners/Ulfric, I turned to the left and couldn't stop looking at the wooden carriage. I instantly messaged my friends telling them to look around as soon as they start, and they responded exactly the same. 'It's beautiful.'  Also people are saying that their is no difference between Original Skyrim &amp; Skyrim Special Edition. I have around 200+ hours on Skyrim on Steam and around 1000+ hours on PS3 Skyrim. Old Skyrim feeled so bland, dark colours. Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is and will be one of the best games to be made, ever. However Original Skyrim felt so bland, there were parts of the game that felt colourful, such as spells or Whiterun. However this edition feels like it has the colours of a TellTale game. It has a more cartoon feel to the colours. It sounds negative however once you see this on your own screen you'll know exactly what I mean. It's basically Original Skyrim, with beautiful colours and everything feels more smooth.  It feels like a totally new game, I've played hundreds of games for thousands of hours, and not one has ever felt as good as this, I only have a couple hours on this game as I write this review, however throughout time I'll end up with thousands of hours on this game.  I would have been happy to pay for this game however Bethesda was generous enough to give us owners of the Original Skyrim including all DLC the whole Special Edition for free. Which comes with all the DLC. Which is honestly amazing, Bethesda could have made hundreds of thousands of dollars by making us pay for it. They made an extremely generous move on their end and for that I respect Bethesda alot more.  I'd recommend this game for anyone looking to have a whole new experience with the gaming genre. Some games are for certain groups of people who like different games, however Skyrim, I'd recommend for anyone and everyone. Get this if your PC is decent enough to run it which you can find out on the Store page by looking at the recommend specifications.  - TJ",

For console gamers, this really would be a dramatic improvement.   But for my fellow gamers of the PC variety, you can get a nicer looking Skyrim that runs with twice the FPS by adding a few simple graphics mods to the original. I got it for free, so I hate to complain, but if you are looking to buy it again for a percieved graphical improvement, I'd recommend against it and just mod the original.",

I'm giving this a negative review because they didn't fix any quest bugs. Every bug that bothered me in the initial release is still present. You would think that was the first place you would look at to release an enhanced edition. The fact that little things like the gildergreen not disappearing when the new, smaller tree is planted is not fixed is simply inexcusable. Those are things people fix with common console commands. You cannot convince me that that wasn't an easy fix for your programmers. It just seems like a lazy development project given to the visual effects team to keep them busy and sharp while being able to charge $60 for a 5 year old game that you made no real improvements in GAMEPLAY to. It's the Michael Bay of videogame development. I probably wouldn't have played the game if not given for free after paying nearly $100 to buy the original game and expansions. Thanks, I genuinely mean that. I also have to knock you on taking form over function. I'd have preferred you give me a patch to fix all the crappy bugs over a visual overhaul. This seriously makes me not as interested in buying future Bethesda games. I don't want to wade through bug after bug to get to a rich storyline. I've played since morrowind. I like the story and the basic engine. I am too disrupted by bugs though to enjoy it. I honestly cannot believe that those weren't the first fixes. It makes me think less of you as a developer.",

            "review_text": "  The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is considered by most to be one of the best games of all time, so it is no surprise that Bethesda would decide to re-release it with an updated engine. However, many people are having difficulty recommending the game, hence the 'Mixed' reviews. Whether or not I recommend you buy Skyrim depends on who you are.  If you already own Skyrim and all its DLC then you will receive this for free, obviously Bethesda realised that it was preposterous to expect people who already owned the 'Legendary' edition of the game, to re-purchase the 'slightly more Legendary' edition. So if you are able to receive this game for free then there is honestly no reason not to delve back into this amazing word.  You will not immediately be able to tell the difference between this version and the original (especially if you installed a ton of mods), but persevere and you will see that there are differences. Sharper colours, god rays and improved lighting effects are a welcome improvement over the dull greyness in the original. Water looks and flows more realistically and the foliage is more dense. People have claimed that no bugs have been fixed, which is true to some extent. However, some graphical glitches that I found very irritating in the original have been fixed, plus an annoying sound bug that would cause voices to stutter and skip is gone.  Obviously none of this is anything mods cannot do, and this is why many do not recommend this game. I must confess I'm no expert in modding, but many mods will need updating to work with this re-release. This means that currently mods are not a numerous as the original Skyrim.  If for what ever reason you are not eligible to receive this game for free, do not buy it. If it ever goes on sale in the future then it may be worth paying for and hopefully by that point many mods will have been released for this version of the game. But at this point it is not worth buying for £29.99 even if you have never played Skyrim before. The only people I can see paying full price to play this are people who are buying Skyrim of the first time on the PS4/Xbox one.  Also people have reported crashes, I personally have had a very stable experience on my GTX 970, but it is important to consider that the last patch introduced crashes on some machines. I believe they are working on another patch to fix the crashing.  I'm not sure If I recommend this or not, I received it for free which means I'm massively biased. If you received it for free like me you obviously have nothing to lose, but if you have to spend £29.99 I would avoid doing so until either it goes on sale or the modding community take advantage of this games huge potential for mods. As usual this is a case when the modding community will eventually make this worth buying.  *EDIT*  After playing this version of Skyrim for over 80 hours I have encountered tons of graphical glitches that were not present for me in the Legendary Edition, so whereas before I was in two minds about whether or not I recommend this or not, now I absolutley do NOT recommend you spend money on this.",

It's not something fantastic like a solid ENB or overly noticeable, but there are small added features that seem to just make it look much better. In comparision to Vanilla Skyrim, it blows it out of the water; even if you don't think so at first. I was someone who spent hours playing the game, but also spent countless, frustrating hours trying to always make my game look perfect. While I was able to get my original Skyrim modded to look amazing, I always felt the need for more.  There has been so much I couldn't do in the game that I wanted to because I focused so much on making the game look perfect. However, I feel that this enhanced version not only makes it look more attractive in subtle ways, I feel that I will finally be excited to get into this game again and spend a far more amount of time playing than worrying about visuals.",

            "review_text": "  This is 'STILL' a great game, sure it's an expensive remake of an older game (if you don't already own Legendary Edition), but the performance gains are well worth it in my opinion, plus this will reinvigorate the community to put out new mods that weren't already out there. the one thing I'm bothered by in these other reviews is everyone is saying that 'Alt-Tab is working now', I have never had an issue with Alt-Tab with Legendary Edition, but I do have issues with it on Special Edition.  so here are my pros and cons:  Pros:  1) Far better performance than the old versions. My load times are down significantly, I used to have to wait 5-10 minutes sometimes with heavy modding, now even with Realistic Lighting Overhaul and a few other graphic mods I get a standard 40-60FPS (*see pro 2) on ultra and load times at most 15 seconds.  2) More stable FPS. As stated in Pro 1, I now have a good 40-60FPS when I'm in an area that I'm at 60FPS in, I stay at 60FPS, if I should enter an area where it drops to around 40FPS I get from 40-45FPS on average. there have been the occasional drops to 20fps, but that was while testing a mod I was working on.  Cons:  1) Other people claim their Alt-Tab is working well, so this may not be an issue for you, but when I Alt-Tab, I get a black screen followed by the game image coming back on, but it clearly has a different window open, just not visible, and when I Alt-Tab again, it allows me to switch to a different window properly. This would be ok for me, if it weren't for the fact that occasionally it will not go back to the game and it doesn't crash but makes it to where I have to force quit the game, losing any progress I have made.  2) This is a minor con, but a con nonetheless, it's still the same old game we have played for hundreds to thousands of hours, not even much of a visible graphic difference to me (Though I did use enb and texture mods on the original). there are no new quest lines that I have noticed, I would hope, but doubt it will happen, that they release at least a couple small free, or really cheap, dlc for it to add new NPCs, companions, and quests.  This is my honest assessment of Skyrim Special Edition. I'm glad I got it for free though, as I probably wouldn't have payed $40 for it, but if you don't already have it, then you probably haven't played it, so I suppose the value is all relative to the purchaser.",

As often mentioned, the main reason they made the Skyrim Special Edition is allowing modding for the console peasants, thats also the reason why it is free for us.  So, to keep this short, my personal recommendation is, if you want to play Skyrim again, download the vannila version and mod the shi* out of it. Graphics will be way better and right now there are 7000+ mods for the vanilla version, including storymods, survival mods and even Enderal. The modding support for the Special Edition will take off some day, maybe. But the Vannila Version has already everthing in it.

Even if SKSE for special edition is ever completed, there will have been no more development on SKSE-based mods in that time.  Old Review:The special edition of Skyrim is pointless currently. It looks marginally better than an unmodded original skyrim, but that's about it. The main issue is that it breaks literally every mod, and the script extender will have to be rebuilt for it (and that will take a lot of work). Ironically this remaster does the opposite of bringing the game into this generation because SKSE and tools like FNIS are necessary for all the mods that 'modernize' skyrim. The entire point of the special edition seems to be trying to console-ify skyrim modding. And because consoles can't get a script extender, Bethesda doesn't care about breaking it on PC (afaik).  Also, they didn't even integrate the bugfixes from the unofficial patch into the special edition, they actually broke the unofficial patch. So this version of the game will be incredibly buggy compared to the original skyrim with the USKP.",

Textures are a bit better but I have seen textures from mods for regular Skyrim that are way better than these.   Faces and hair are almost identical to the original and that is why Bethesda didn't want early receivers of the game to show game's intro (only when player exit from on-rails intro part they could stream or upload). In this intro part, the very first thing that player see are the bad faces, bad hair and low polygon count is more than obvious. With this, Bethesda obviously sends message that they don't care to properly finish their games. From a company with such resources I expected much more.  This would be amazing if original game was like this, but it is really something unfinished. If Bethesda is small company then yes, but Bethesda is giant now and this is not the proper way to treat their fans. So I have to look for mods to enhance this because I can't stand those blocky faces, hair, bad textures and so on.

A few things: If you have any mods it won't let you get acheivments, which doesn't make sense because you can simply go into the command console and turn god mode on. Even if they are mods which change the colour of moths, it disables acheivments. Also, sprint is now not a hold and sprint, it is a toggle. I know it is a small thing but you can really notice it in combat or going places.  Also Bethesda have made absolutley 0 effort to optimise the menu. I understand the menu has been 'made' for consoles, but they could have at least done SOMETHING.  This is literally no different than the original Skyrim, except from an ENB (Where bethesda have pretty much just added God rays and lowered the brightness).  I did get this for free as I do own Skyrim and all of the DLC, however I am really let down by Bethesda.  If you are contemplating buying this, I would save your money.

The graphics dont look much better than the original, sure it has better lighting and water quality, but the textures still look the same. I run the game in High Quality, 1080p, and it just looks like a slight graphical enhancement. I played on Ultra, and then after writing the review saw a sevre drop in frames. I have a AMD 6300K, GTX 960 2GB and 8GB RAM. Not a high end system but the game set me to play at Ultra by default. Having mods on this version of Skyrim disables the achievements, even if it is just a graphics mod or a survival mod. Because of this I have not looked into the mods but I am told that there is mods avalible, even one to re-enable mods. Bethesda please fix this, although theres a fix it's a ♥♥♥♥ idea, and there really is not need for a fix.  All that being said Skyrim is a great game and I have had hundreds of hours of fun with it, both on console and PC. This is the same experience but with prettier lighting.",

So, please, stop that argument because it's false. Secondly, to each their own opinion. I say that meaning...your own opinion, that you came up with. Not someone else.  Now...on to the review for this game. I had owned Skyrim for PS3 way back in 2011. I played it for probably 20-30 hours and somehow during the transition from my military deployment location on back to the states, I lost my save. I was upset and refused to play it anymore. I then bought the 'ultimate' edition here on Steam back during a summer sale and still, didn't really play it.   Now...the special edition is out. Yes, mods are not fully available as they were before on Nexus mods, but they will be back. The Skyrim modding community is one of the best out there and we all know they will deliver. I think the game looks a LOT better than it did (without mods). Bethesda always put a lot of effort in to what they do and genuinely don't want to release trash or bad products. So without flipping out about the audio (that they will fix)...the game is what it is and is an updated version of essentially the original release. If you want all the mods and glory of the original, stick with that, this game installs separately. It doesn't overwrite your past saves (although most old saves won't work). It is a stand-alone install. I have the original still saved and modded (SKSE) for Enderal.   Have fun everyone!",

You want to see what modding is like, and this looks like a good game to start out on. In this case, give it a few months. Like I said above, this version hasn't caught up yet, and needs to be tinkered with for a while to match the original in this regard. Once the mods are caught up, the original game will be obsolete, and THEN you should buy this.  Now, about the actual game:  Skyrim is a masterfully-designed, open-world rpg that everyone should at least try out. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't. It's brimming with interesting content and things to do, though admittedly it's rough around the edges when it comes to character progression and bugs. That's what the massive modding community is for, and Bethesda has gone out of their way to make modding easy, and even fun. You'll enjoy the game even without mods, and when you inevitably find small problems with it, you'll be able to find a mod for just about anything.

They're all really excited for it to be coming back to a new generation.  It doesn't look that much better, in fact with the mods I already had on Skyrim this looks worse now, so graphics aren't a reason to switch over.  The mods are delivered via a Bethesda account rather than Steam Workshop. Not hard to use, but a pain to log in when you can't paste into the password box, and a completely unnecessaey change outside of folks on consoles.  Using mods disables achievements. Adding hunger, cold, and other mods that make the game more difficult shouldn't treat you like you're cheating. I used one cheese mod on Skyrim, a chest full of building materials for Hearthfire, everything else I added was a realism mod. The only achievement I got without earning it was from playing with console commands rather than adding a mod.

I'm running it with an Nvidia 980 and 32 gb of RAM and experiencing insane frame drops and these weird gray splotches on npcs and trees. I've tried it on every setting from low to ultra and while dropping it to low, which I shouldn't have to do, helps a little with the frames nothing I do gets rid of the splotches. In addition, the start up time is awful. It sits at a black screen and only after the music has been playing for a few seconds does the Bethesda logo pop up and then it finally gets to the main menu. Sometimes it doesn't even do that and just crashes. I've tried it with no mods and with the unofficial patch, but nothing seems to fix these problems. As of right now, the original skyrim with some graphical mods is a far better game than this 'special edition.' If it gets patched or otherwise optimized I will change my review, because at its core Skyrim is a fantastic game. This attempt at a remaster is a very poor representation of that.  UPDATE: The game for whatever reason by default selected my integrated graphics card rather than my nvidia card. After fixing that and fiddling with a few settings, I managed to crank the settings to ultra and eliminate both the splotches and most of the frame issues. The only issue now is the fact that the game looks near identical to the original.",

The audio is more compressed and sounds slightly worse on headphones, and the textures were upscaled for some reason even though they look exactly the same.

Second it's nice, it's a 64-bit client and incorporates what a few previous mods did and some lighting stuff.  Game breaker, the AA (Anti-aliasing) choices: none, FXAA, TAA. TAA blurs anything when you move and for many makes it just impossible to play (including headaches).. FXAA looks pretty bad but that is only other choice. They removed real AA (MSAA and AF filtering setting) options that made the game look sharp and clear. So you need a working AA detailed graphics you need to work around with SweetFX, or if lucky I guess some can force AA in drivers, mine BSOD's on win 10 in a hurry.  It has the new Fallout 4 styles, if you mod at all you, achivements are turned off.  I loaded up a slightly modded original Skyrim to compare, it blew out the new but I had invested too many hours already in a new character (saves from SE will not load in old, but old can sometimes load in new).  Audio apparently is downgraded, textures are hard to tell if they are upgraded at all because of the AA and post processing going on. The old high-res texture pack on original looked way better. Talk is they just upscaled previous textures that cause more memory use and have no gain or even some loss.  I can go on and on about the cons. Bugs galore, crashing 10-20 min on Win 10 unless you disable Touchscreen.  Only one pro the 64-bit part.  I made it work. Besides pages of cons and the fact that the vanilla game modded still looks so much better at the moment, there is hope it can be modded to be compareable or better on graphics. But still it seems the AA options that were removed might be a show stopper.  So do yourself a favor, remember that if you mod no achievements without installing a mod to override it. Just ridiculous. Play original unless you just want to see more npc's on the screen go haywire due to buggy AI. Mod the original and it will looks amazing, and you can keep achievements and have far less bugs until this mess sorts itself, if it does.",
