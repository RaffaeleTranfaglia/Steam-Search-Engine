    "description": "Hyperspace Dogfights is a juicy jet-combat roguelike in which you blast, dodge and slice your way through masses of technologically inferior enemies. Your jet-craft evolves differently on each mission and becomes stronger and weirder by gathering some of the 250+ items available ingame.",
