Lloyd dodged, dipped, ducked, and dove as best he could, but I was forced to watch as he juked right into the maw of a hungry jelly creature. Goodnight, sweet prince.  10/10 would fall in love again.   Alternate title should be 'Adventures in rage-quitting.'",

Chickedy-check!  - Play a few levels, farm some stuff, kill some monsters. Go back to your ship and tons of recipes to discover for crafting and alchemy. Use scrap metal to build your own ship. Invest in droids to find red crystally stuff in space for you, to buy new stuff that you have no idea what it does. Yes!  - Level up your character, find sweet skills that don't fit your current playstyle. Get curious to play with a different classes, so you make a Bounty Hunter to triple shoot a huge bazooka. Or an Aethermage. WHAT THE HECK IS AN DATAMANCER?!  - Convince your friends to buy Roguelands and play together. No hamachi? No problem. Just host a game, share your IP and BAM!! You're wrecking monsters with your sweet space squad. WHAT?!  - Get a high level character, fight a giant flaming dragon, get whooped within 20 seconds. Cry because you lost your character, then click some chest to unlock sweet unlockables and forget about your loss.   - First levels get a bit too easy, so you pay 5000 credits to upgrade the challenge level. Warp to that level and HOT DAMNIT SON, NEW ENEMIES, DIFFERENT COLORS AND EVERYTHING IS DROPPING SWEET SKILL MODS.   Definitely enjoying Roguelands so far.",

            "review_text": "Hey Sean, just wanted to let you know how im feeling about the game and the way its going. Personally, I think it is a well made game, with alot of potential. Me and a few others have enjoyed playing this game and Magicite. But we are scared that it is going in a much different direction then its Kickstarter decribed, such as homeworlds. Here are the changes we recommend to improve Roguelands...  - Guns/Long Ranged Weapons sounds and bullet effects should be unique - We feel the weapons need to be more unique. Since tier 1 and tier 3 and even ultimate weapons have the same stats, there needs to be another incentive for getting higher tier gear. Such as effects like burn or shock or even higher stats. Otherwise my starter sword is no different from an ultimate sword besides looks.  - Items based on tier or rarity should sell for different prices.   With these changes in mind, I would still recommend this game to anyone. Besides these little patches that I think are required, its alot of fun. If you enjoy Magicite you will enjoy Roguelands.   8/10 Soon to be a 10/10 I hope. Good Luck Sean!",

Each time you go into a new location the risk of losing your charecter you spent hours on increases. You are never safe and never prepared. It is a game so frustratingly good it can drive you mad. The depth in the game is great, creating new items and potions with different tiers and exploring new enviorments.

The joy you feel when you get an Golden item randomly or when you hit a 2k damage at lvl 40, the diversity made possible by a few characters and a LOT of weapon, ...  On a single run it is fun and on the long run, the replayability is unlimited.  Even, you wont have the choice, because you will die. And you will die a lot. Oh you will Hate it. Maybe scream, telling you you wont play that DAM game anymore. Sometimes you will cherish your tiny character more then others. But hey, you might even get something out of your death, and sometimes you might even kill yourself on purpose, hoping.  Of course, nothing is perfect. I personnaly dont like the design of certain aspect of the gameplay. Battlemode or the bugger who speaks to you before a boss per example. For me, it is just an annoying way to make you kill, while there are already many ways to get you kill, and no, it is not forgiving. Also, past a certain point I get quite bored to click to harvest mostly because its 2 step clicks. But hopefully DROIDS will eventually do the job. (?)  Still, the game is great, evolving in it is great. And I wish the game itself will continue to evolve. This is mostly why I want you to buy it. I want more special abilities, droids and so on.  + MULTI IS REALLY FUN and GREAT. Poor Johnny screaming HELP because of bees. Just Hilarious.   RIP PAUL AND WESLEY.

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER:This game has bit recently hit by alot of negative reviews since being on humble bundle because they arent quite part of the roguelike community. So if you don't like roguelikes, dont buy a game called ROGUElands.  Pros This game is brutal and puts you in at the deep end. No matter what level, what gear you have you can still die in 3 hits. You cannot become god and this is what i love about this game, it always keeps you on your feet and gives you a sense of panic It has a wide variety of weapons and armour and a very unique way of making them more powerful, 'Ultimate Weapons' and Armour. All of the ultimate weapons do something different and are unique in their own respects. I love the enemy, bosses and planet design as everything has its own special ability and thing that makes them all ,once again, unique The character designing is so diverse with augments, classes, races and even hats that you unlock by playing the game. I could go on about the good things about this game. But there is 1 main issue that I want to adress.... ALOT of people have ♥♥♥♥♥ed about this and i kinda see their point and it of course the slighty random unlocking system. I dont have a problem with since the big unlocks e.g Get to level 100 without taking damage have a 100% chance of unlocking. I also dont have too big an issue with the fact that you have to die to unlock your stuff. Some stuff has say a 50% chance or even a five but i dont find a problem with this because these are smaller unlocks. So, in my opinion the games 2 main flaws are ....... The sound effects are a little bland. The music is nice, just the attack sound effects get a little repetitive and my main bone to pick..... the inventory managment. This isn't too big of a problem but when I go to my stash i hate having too sort it all but this is because i am lazy.  In short, I LOVE this game and cant find too many gripes with it.  P.S If there are any grammar mistakes please tell me, I'm not too good at spotting them  P.P.S If i've missed anything once again tell me. This is my first review so i probably missed some stuff.",

Also, It's probably the first time I've seen an Early Access game that was promising, and continually worked on until release. Sean worked hard to stay on scedule and massive updates were released weekly! In my opinion, any developer who works as hard as Sean has kind of deserves for people to buy his games.  Note: As of October 19, 2016, development has become quite a bit less frequent. However, I still believe this game is worth it.",

            "review_text": "I love this game. I LOVE this game with a massive passion. But this game is a love hate because it has so much potential, but needs SO many fixes. Forward momentum in character development is almost impossible, but as soon as you reach it, is almost impossible to lose. Deaths are so unconceiveablly underrewarding that there's so little point in having unlockables upon death when your level 100 dies with maxed legendary equipment on a button slip, and you get one death chest that gives you nothing. I have repeated the above step more times than I care to admit and it's so frustrating to lose all of that and get no reward, when you start off getting killed in the first level and can get 12 chests after dying at level 2. That whole unlock development needs to be scrapped or re-worked. The area difficulty is very non-linear. The first 3 areas have undestroyable obstacles that interfere with movement, then the next like 7 areas have none. The second area is complete hell for a melee build, whereas the Byfrost and Shroomtown are so painfully easy it's absurd. I skip the first six areas when I start because of the painful ambient obstacles and slow levels available in the first areas. It needs some revamping. Items aren't too terribly bad, there are some that fit virtually every playing style. However, I personally feel there should be more of a noticeable difference between guns and cannons. The only difference I can see, other than stats of course, is that Cannons have a little knockback where guns don't, and have slightly larger projectiles. But by far what needs the most revamping is the storyline quests. The first ever storyline quest I did was the Galactic Fleet. You get the first 2 levels instantaneously. Then they have you kill the boss in area 1. Not a big deal, can be a bit of a challenge for melee, but still not much. Then you get 2 more levels and they ask you go to the 4th area. You spawn in and Lenny freaks out and all of a sudden you have the normal enemies for that area to deal with and a massive, unkillable, extremely fast worm that you now have to avoid along with everything else. Even with Beats by Boizu I could not outrun that worm in a straight line, and it's inconceiveable to outrun a massive worm that takes up 2/3 of the small tunnel you're in along with every other enemy. Equally as bad, just like that, all other storyline quest are just like that. You can do the first 4-6 levels as a level 10-40 super easy, but then the very next level you see people with videos on youtube with lv 86 characters that say they are 'under-leveled'. The scaling is just terribly broken. It makes it a very large grindfest. Granted I love this game and the grinding is much more enjoyable than on other games, but it's still tedious when you've completed 80% of the game one character can achieve by level 20, and have to spend 10+ hours grinding to 75+ to complete the last 20%. If you make it there, that character will probably never die unless you want it to. If it doesn't make it, you will most likely be left unrewarded and robbed of the last 8 hours of your life. I get how rogue-likes are supposed to be like that, but I don't get why this game is. Sure it's got harsh death penalties, but it's not that bad unless you want death unlocks to increase your race, outfit, and extra items pool.  I like the game, it has wonderfully painful, but rewarding starting momentum. But as soon as you go from newbie to adept, it's like hitting a brick wall with your unlocks and dying to unlock extras becomes more of a pain than something to expect for your hours of work.",

There's a clear sense of stake in pressing on to a new level, but the price of death is low enough to encourage a player's greed.   Likewise, a good blending of SF and Fantasy visuals and tropes. Hacking at giant spiders while flying on a jet pack is quite experience. Once again, it's an interation from Magicite where fluidity of motion wasn't nearly as present as it is here.",

I played his previous game, Magicite, and I immediately fell in love with it, and then I found out about this, sprinted to my local wallgreens and bought a $20 card for steam to buy this. I was one of the first people to get it, and I've found that with every new update there's more and more stuff to deal with. All of the negative comments you'll see about this game is probably by people who are butt hurt since they keep dying, but if you play for a while you can get to a really high level with a little bit of practice. Over all, it's a terrific game.  Thank you, Sean for being a huge inspiration for me, because you got me to start learning how to create games, and I hope i'll be as good as you one day.",

I don't really mind the permadeath aspect, as it adds a level of risk to the game, but I do oppose the idea that dying is necessary for unlocks. This system worked well in magicite because there was actually a game to finish, meaning you could live through an entire playthrough and then recieve your unlocks. Here, you could spend hours on a character, finish all the content, yet never die due to care and practice. However, if you want to unlock those races, augments and costumes (which can add massive bonuses/alter gameplay entirely) you need to literally purposefully die. Of course you can stash all your gear and what not and then die naked, but you still lose the levels and expensive ♥♥♥ end game combat chips. Though many rogue-like aspects fit well into this hybrid game, unlocks by death do not.    Apart from that, the game is top-notch in my opinion with it really shining in multiplayer (with some bugs). With a few more updates (maybe some level design changes to spice things up) this game can only get better.",

            "review_text": "This has the potential to be a great little game. It reminds me a bit of dark souls, it's very challenging and demands that you 'git gud' to progress, but there's a few flaws that make it really hard to recommend.  First of all is the assertion from the developer that this is a roguelike game. It is not. There are maybe 4 or 5 level configurations, and all the worlds use them. After an hour or two you will realize that every level is more or less exactly the same with different colors. The enemies spawn in different locations sometimes, that's about as randomly generated as this game gets. The game is based on a heavy grind as well; prepare to play the same 5 levels over and over until you get to about level 100, and then you get 2 new levels to play over and over.  I can deal with all that, I like grindyness, but aside from that here's the issue that really got to me: There's a character named Lenny that will give you 'helpful advice' about once per level, and they are always the same. The messages take up a huge amount of the screen and must be clicked to be dismissed. This game also has permadeath mechanics.  What this means is, you could have a level 100+ character that you've poured weeks of your time into, running an extremely difficult level, and Lenny's messages can very easily cause you to die. All that time and effort, gone in an instant, because the game covered up your view during a bossfight with a message you've read 10000 times before.  This one design flaw makes the game borderline unplayable, otherwise it's a fun, fast paced action platformer.. but that one thing really leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you lose a high level character to it. It would be really, really easy for the developer to fix, but he hasn't even though there are a ton of people talking about it on the community hub. It's inexcusable. If that got fixed, I would say 'Get this game next time it's on sale'. But right now, it feels like a rip off to pay any amount of money for this experience. Not recommended.",
