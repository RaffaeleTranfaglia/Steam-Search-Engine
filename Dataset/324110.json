            "review_text": "I'm not too sure what people were expecting with this collection, but from the reviews I hvae read, you people have been far too harsh for what it is and when it was made.  Moto Racer 1 is a PS1 game which, I believe, was ported to the PC (or released at the same time as the PS1 version). The graphics are old and it's going to have the odd glitch and incompatibility now and then. Anyone without common sense should know that your 'Octa core processor with SLI'd GTX 770s' would have compatibility issues with a game from the 90s.  Additionally, you cannot expect a game that was made for the PS1 to be fancy. If a HD remake was produced, the original old-school gamers who played this game probably wouldn't have liked it. Why expect a game or a collection that's released onto Steam to be new and sparkly? Developers ARE allowed to release old games onto Steam.  So overall, I recommend this merely because I congratulate the developers for releasing this great PS1 game onto Steam. I've played all of the games in this collection enough in my childhood and away from Steam to know this deserves a recommendation even if Steam says I've only played for less than an hour.",
