            "review_text": "This game will never die. From 1999 to the present, this game has been at the heart of Esports throughout. After Challenge Pro Mode Arena (CPMA) was released the competitive community divided. Since then, the game's popularity has seen a steady decline. Currently, there is only a small crowd of hardcore fans that still enjoy this game.   Around 2007-2008 a new iteration of this game came along as a free-to-play web version named QuakeLive. Download QLPrism (standalone browser made specifically to run QuakeLive) to fully enjoy. As a pro-subscriber in Quakelive you can spawn servers to run all kinds of fun gameplay from simple duels to team based games and now Quakelive even includes Race mode (Quake3 DeFRaG Mod). Quakelive is constantly updated with new content (gametypes, maps, custom options) making it the most comprehensive Quake ever.   Quake 3 is one of the most enduring games in all of FPS history. The gameplay is dynamic, engaging and unique. If you are a fan of fast-paced, deathmatch style gameplay, Quake3/Quakelive is the ONLY game for you. Takes years to master, takes seconds to become addicted.  Currently, there is some debate over whom the G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) of QuakeLive is. The greatest contenders for the title include the two finalists of Dreamhack Winter 2013, the Belarussian 'Cypher' or the American 'Rapha.' Other names through the years include American 'Zero4', the Swedish aim master 'Toxjq', and the notorious Russian 'Cooller'.  In the end, I see the competition for this title always coming back to the two: Cypher or Rapha! After the latest Quakecon and Dreamhack tournaments in 2013 you can see why!!",

I think names work too, like Red or Blue. Some servers don't like OSP. If you want to play on one that kicks you, take those files out. Keep the entire OSP folder in your main Q3 folder.

If it keeps forcing your Game Key to Upper Case go into the games directory in Q3base and edit the key file with a text editor. Make it lowercase - save it - then right click the file and go to properties - make it read only. It may still ask for your key after a match but it's just a glitch, ignore it.

This game is nuts, but you know..... fun nuts. The maps in this game are fun with not too many camping spots (as if you would feel the need to anyway) and are mostly quite large.   Now....... The guns. Ok, so first up is the Machine Gun which is only good if you are accurate and your enemy is very inaccurate so lets skip this one. Then there is the Shotgun. One hit kill at short range of course and good damage at medium range. The Rocket Launcher is deadly to both your enemy and yourself but can also tend to take a few hits to kills if not hit directly. The Plasma Gun is basically a super Machine Gun. It has a lot more damage and similar fire rate. the Grenade Launcher in my opinion is the hardest gun to use because you have to time as well as place the grenade well. the Railgun, my favourite weapon, is basically a sniper that you have to no scope with (except unlike no scoper's in COD it actually takes skill) and is either a one or two hit kill. The Lightning Gun shoots out a stream of lightning towards your enemy and does decent damage. It's kind of like a Super Soaker except instead of water coming out there's lightning. And finally there is the BFG10K. now this gun is a one hit kill and has a fast automatic fire rate so it kicks ♥♥♥♥.   Now in addition to these guns is the gauntlet, which is basically a glove with a spinning saw blade on it. Its usually a two or three hit kill but its always fun to kill someone with it. also there are several other items that can be placed on the maps such as +5, +25 and +50 health capsules, +5 armour shards, +50 and +100 armour vests, a mega health capsule, a quad damage power-up, as well as a regeneration power-up and a beast power-up. I won't take the time to explain these items (Most of which are pretty self explanatory anyway). The best piece of advice that I can give you is to aim well. You aim well and you win....

Although it is my considered opinion that Quake 3 played second fiddle to the first Unreal Tournament, I can't deny this game. Why? Because you will not find a second fiddle anywhere near this damn good game. Hell, you won't find many first fiddles either. Honest to God: I love this game. I honestly think the era of arena shooters was too short for its own good. Although I have high hopes for the new Unreal Tournament, it might not bring the arena shooter back to the mainstream stage as many have hoped. I hope it does, but I understand it has a lot to live up to. This game has spectactular gunplay that is expected of the Quake series, that fast paced, adrenaline rushing gameplay that made arena shooters fun.The map DM17, otherwise known as The Longest Yard has become one of the most iconic FPS maps, ranking alongside Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds. There's just no words to describe that feeling of launching off of a boost pad and sniping your enemy in midair with the Railgun.  The music fits the game extremely nicely, as do the environments. The computer opponents give you some pretty amusing dialouge during the single player campaign.  So what are you waiting for? Get out there and make your enemies Quake in fear! Doom got a remake, Unreal Tournament is in the works, so all we need are Half Life 3 and Quake 5 and the 90's can be here once again! A good old dose of pure 90's fun.",

I guess it's because I was expecting something more 'realistic' like Wolfenstein (yeah, I know, at least for the most part of it). Either way, that was because so far I never had the experience of playing anything online. Back in the day I had this friend who eventually convinced me to give it a try. After I started, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on it. Time passed by and someday Quake II was released. Then again, when I tried for the first time I felt kinda disappointed with the game and can't deny that I still feel somehow like that after all those years (I guess it's because I missed that 'medieval environment' touch from the first one). Anyway, when I first heard of Quake III, I didn't quite know what I should expect. I just read about the premise that the game was developed to be focused on the multiplayer experience. The irony was that although this title had exactly that concept in mind, that was the only one that I never had the chance to play with other people. Hmm what is there to say? For me it felt like a polished version of Quake II's multiplayer and later it wasn't hard to compare it with Unreal Tournament (which I won't deny that I liked better). Besides that, back then there were some really interesting mods involving the game's engine, like for example 'Bid for Power', which had some DBZ characters and levels to play on. Overall, it's not a bad game, you can even play it casually if you're not in the mood to go through a whole set of matches.",

It's not like the other shooters, you got a perfect movement &amp; weapon feeling. It's quite challenging, it's a game you wan't to play doesn't matter for how long. I wish I would have seen it earlier in steam! 10/10 points! Just go on &amp; give it a try it's worth!",
