            "review_text": "Snail Bob 2: Tiny troubles ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, I have met a number of snails in my life. Plenty of Jean, Julien, Andre and Paolo (yes, Paolo is a well-known name in the snail community) - but Bob. . . that is surely the first one I have ever met!   Snail Bob 2 is a casual puzzle game for parents to play with their kids, but also enjoyable for all ages. At first, you will meet Bob and go through a small tutorial which will show you how make Bob turn around, move and stop, as well as what you will have to look for within the level, such as buttons to press, levers to activate and other things to look for in the level.   Bob will have 3 stories to play in this game and each of them has 30 levels to complete. Basically, you will have to get Pao.., sorry Bob to the door with the exist sign in one piece. In each level, you will have to collect three Stars which are very well hidden or blend in within the artwork. Some levels will have a puzzle piece to collect; in total you will have to gather twelves pieces to achieve the entire puzzle. Each time you collect a certain number of stars, you will be given a new outfit in your wardrobe. Bob could become a pirate, a plumber, a Viking snail and much more!   The path to the exit door is not difficult but you will have several obstacles to navigate in each level. Time of play is approximately thirty-five minutes per story.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Cute artwork - 90 levels to complete - Great to play with kids - Trading Cards &amp; Achievements  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Short game - Repetitive  Snail Bob 2 is a casual game for parents and kids to play together.  6.5/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
