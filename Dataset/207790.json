            "review_text": "Coming into this game I was hoping for a more simulation style Ace Combat, unfortunately that is not the case. First thing I did, as I do in all games, was check the key layout and controls for flying with a keyboard. It was doable in writing, unfortunately, it's poorly executed in-game. The throttle up key (arrow key up) does exactly that it throttles up, however it also turns the camera in-cockpit 90 degrees left. Slowing down (arrow key down) does the same thing, it throttles down with the expense of turning your camera 90 degrees right.   Also, before purchasing JASF, I read in multiple places that the game can be used with a joystick/gamepad/Xbox 360 controller. Nope. I restarted the game (with Xbox 360 controller connected) and was prompted with the 'Enter' key as well as the arrow keys for navigating the menu. Fair enough, the menu is keyboard exclusive, I can understand that. As I went in-game I soon noticed that there were new icons. For instance, instead of an arrow key, it was the 'A' button. I pick up my Xbox 360 controller and press 'A' for a solid 10 seconds... Nothing. The voiceover is still going, droning about my important task at hand. I keep pressing 'A', then 'B' then every other button on my controller. Nothing. For a game that is ALSO on Xbox 360, there was a transition error or flawed coding to not have a smooth transition to PC.   Graphics: Not much concern. Although, I did experience some screen tears and occasional stuttering throughout my loop-de-loop camera turning spiral into the end of the runway. Nothing gamebreaking however. Planes look good, environment is minimal but effective. Cockpit perspective looks alright. Not much criticism here.  I'm a huge fan of the Ace Combat series, I've played hours upon hours of IL-2 Sturmovik for PS3, even more on Heroes of the Pacific and Secret Weapons over Normandy for PS2 and many more airplane specific games (I'm not going to include Battlefield games because that's somewhat taboo to flight simulator enthusiasts). So, it's safe to say that this is no user error, this is a game with potential, but failed to properly execute the most basic of video game tasks, the controls.",

If you're looking for an arcade-style shooter well, maybe give this game a look. It's typical arcade shooter fair with terrible voice acting, crappy controls, tons of enemies and only a limited grasp of physics. Got it because I thought it would be fun with my new Thrustmaster HOTAS. I was wrong. The throttle is terrible. It always wants to go to a neutral speed no matter where you have it set.",
