            "review_text": "This is a very simple game, where you kill goblins trying to reach the top of a tower by quickly pressing the key that matches its color. There are no levels or storyline, and just one life. That's it. You can unlock some characters and cosmetic changes to the tower, but they do not affect the game at all.  Its mechanics are quite reminiscent of ancient times (I dare say at a 'Game&amp;Watch' level). As far as I'm concerned, and as a counterpoint to other reviews, I'd say that's neither good or bad, it depends on your preferences. I personally enjoyed it, just like I enjoyed playing LCD games in the 80's, even though I realize that we are in 2015 and sensibilities have changed.   Unfortunaletly, all of this gets old quite fast, once you realize you have reached your reflex plateau. Some of us are old now. Since achievements are completely bugged, the incentives for longer play is removed. One I beat the 1000 point barrier, I did not see a reason to keep playing.   I'll say that I personally had a good time for the 3-4 hours I got out of it, and for that I'll vote 'yes'. But I would not recommed it unless it happens to be in a bundle (luckily, that's how I got it) or some kind of bargain. It's also true that I have played much better indie games for the same price.",

            "review_text": "Yep game is simple and basic, but come on, you can see that on the video ;) It is nice for time killing, for example when waiting for LoL match to load. Graphics are really nice and thematic, I like that when you change the character not only the icon changes, but goblin death and attack animations too. Although I enjoyed playing it for a little while, I would strongly recommend the mobile version, swipe gestures suit the gameplay better.   Now I look forward to playing the multiplayer version! :) And don't complain for the simplicity of the game, you get what you see on the trailer. ;p",
