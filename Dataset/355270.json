I have some minor complaints about a lack of options, but for $2 you can't expect that much polish. A warning though that F12 doesn't take a screenshot, it resets the game. But it's a credit to how interesting the story is that I actually restarted instead of rage quitting over those two lost hours.",

            "review_text": "This game is an absolute gem in my opinion. It's certainly not for everyone, and if I had to give it a strict categorization I'd go with 'post-RPG'. But I think people are going into it looking for, or expecting, something this game is not. What it's NOT, is a (stylistically) 16-bit RPG set in the near-future-past. What it IS, is both a parody and homage to the games that I (and Clara, and the developer, clearly) loved and cherished as a child.  I'm a 31-year-old man, and kinda a 'tough guy' I guess -- and I will readily admit I cried at the ending of this game. Because it's so bittersweet, and beautiful in a way. That last decision box, man -- wow.   But beyond that, this game captured that childlike wonder that I vividly remember when I saw a preview for the upcoming 'Final Fantasy II' for SNES (yes, I know the real numbering scheme) in 'Nintendo Power' in '91 or so; the absolute dumbstruck awe me and my little brother experienced when we saw the mechs-walking-in-the-snow intro to 'FF VI' the first time; and the sense of loss when we weren't quick enough and Shadow didn't make it. (Incidentally, we didn't know that wasn't the only possible outcome for years -- the internet wasn't really much of a thing yet.) The references brought back so many fond memories, made me grin, and helped point me in the right direction as far as where the game was going. I could see not 'getting' the game if you DIDN'T grow up with those SNES/SFC games, though... but even so I think someone could enjoy this game without that background. And if you DO come from that gaming background, it's gravy. I personally absolutely loved it. Not to mention... the dev responded quickly AND helpfully when I posted a question about remapping the control set-up for my gamepad. (short version PROTIP: Use JoyToKey in addition to built in 360-pad support.)  Anyway, the game only takes about 2-3 hours to beat. People whining about needing a 'run button' or the layout of Delilah, or how buildings are always described by size and color... are just completely missing the point. RELAX, and enjoy the f*cking experience, man. For f*cks sake, there are only SIX streets in the town, you ought to be able to find your way around, and if you'd just chill out and take in the details on your first few longer walks, you'd just remember every key location. AND the layout / simplicity of the city is even a key story point. Jesus.  The ONE complaint I've seen a few times in other reviews that I do agree with, is I wish the 'inventory' was universally accessible. Worth mentioning, however, is that in the D'n'D game-within-the-game, you actually CAN open up your 'Items' and see all of those little notes -- and it was actually really cute and funny. Maybe it's better ONLY being able to do it there, in a way? I dunno. It is funny how one of the other roleplayers asks about the stuff in the inventory tho, haha. That joke would still work even if it WAS always available, though.  For 2 bucks (and I think I got it even cheaper than that on sale or in a bundle or something) it's WELL worth it in my eyes -- clearly, I would hope. HIGHLY recommended for anyone who truly LOVED 16-bit RPGs... and not just the games, but the CHARACTERS.  I'll miss you, Clara. I love you, too.",

            "review_text": "This game is rather fascinating.  The developer wrote a very interesting story that I can't tell you anything about besides that if you go through the experience of playing it, you probably won't regret it.  Story wise, this is a 11/10. Though it's short and you can easily finish the game in a single afternoon, it's different and interesting.  One of the minor issues that bothered me was the lack of an ability to run when you are walking through the town. I'm sure this had something to do with making you 'appreciate' the environment a bit more as some of your answers about it are addressed later in the game. However, it was still slow. I can see why some people who have written things about getting lost, or not knowing where to go could have become frustrated, but just be present for the story.  The music in this game was very interesting, if you pay attention to the music. However, if you were to play the game muted, it'd make no difference to the game. You wouldn't really have noticed something missing. If you like the music you can get a free DLC that comes with it, by the band Kearney.   One of the other issues that bothered me is that there were basic issues with level design. Guiding the player toward exits is typically done by showing you were the door is by creating walls toward those doors. That doesn't exist. There are places where you can walk that you shouldn't be able to.   The microwave in the Antiquates room     The grey building that has bricks running down the center... start from the top   There are other things like not knowing which way is the way out, but if you can just get past these small issues, it'll be fine.   Personally I hope the developer creates another story I can be a part of, but I hope that they fine tune some of the issues above. (I would have rated the game much higher without these issues)  I'd definitely recommend 199X even if it does use stock RPGMaker graphics for parts of it. The story is what you're paying for, and it's worth the story.  6.9/10",

            "review_text": "So, as you can tell this is a positive review, However i want this to be listed as a sort of list of negitives, so if you're looking for that, stop here.  To start, the game is /very/ rpgmaker..ey. It's not like To The Moon or Lisa, where they somewhat mask the engine, this game goes full force and uses very very rpgmakery textures and from what i understand, a stock conversation engine, This isn't nessicarly a bad thing, but it's the type of thing that you might not like.  Another thing that's bad about this game is the writing isn't exactly perfect... The main character at the start sort of reminded me of a bad fanfiction, She swears.. A lot, Now to be clear i don't think that swearing is bad or anything (Hell irl i do it more than anyone else that i know) But in writing i allways find that it makes characters just seem wierd. another point on the writing is that it has a lot of kinda 'refrence' humor, Which reminded me of the really bad parts of to the moon, Though i will say that due to the nature of the game.. it's kind of hard to avoid it.   For another thing the games music is... Honestly kind of awful at times, Now again to be clear the entire games soundtrack isn't all bad, there are definatly some okay songs in it, But i noticed that there are some loops that are like 10 seconds long in scenes where you will be there for around 5 minutes, and it's not exactly a smooth loop either.    Now then, as i gave it a positive review, Positives!   The game overall has very very good pacing, I beat the game in one sitting in about 2 hours, and i felt like it was quite well done, I will say that the ending was quite sudden but.. GIven how it was, i think that was both intentonal and good.  The games writing does actually get quite smart and good the more that you play it, as i said the game is definatly not perfect in this regard, but when you learn the character, she does tend to act like, you know, a real person, which is interesting.   i absolutly adored the way that you walk around in the game, with having a very consistant small town that you have to walk around, getting directions such as 'go to the red house on the third street' it's quite intersting wandering around looking for stuff like that.  And finally, the price, This game honestly gave me something to think about for just two dollars. While i will say that a game like to the moon beats this game in quality, this game is five times cheaper than To The Moon, which tends to make it a lot more playable, And honestly for two dollars i think you can take the gamble.  overall i'd give the game a cautious recomendation, If you think you'd enjoy the game based on the description and trailers, i can't imagine you would dislike the game. Though if you have to choose between this and to the moon, choose to the moon  Also as a very, very major complaint there is a spoiler below. --- --- --- ---  WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THIS ♥♥♥♥♥ THINK THAT POKEMON MYSTERY DUNGEON IS A BAD GAME, THIS GIRL LOST ALL OF MY ♥♥♥♥ING INTREST AS SOON AS SHE SAID THAT POKEMON MYSTERY DUNGEON IS TERRIBLE, DOE SHE EVEN PLAY ANY GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥ING DUNGEON CRAWLERS AS ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT ONE, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ♥♥♥♥ THEN YOU ARE JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING BAD PERSON.",

I actually played it because of the comment in the traler that went '30 minutes (at least!)'. I wanted something quick just to pass the time. This was false, of course. It took more time than that... and it also touched something deep that I never though would happen.  The graphics are poor, the collisions aren't well done, lots of things strangely done... but you know what? It actually makes sense for it to be exactly like it is as you progress.  Last time I felt something like that was when I played 'To the Moon'. Of course it is not exactly the same, but the way you create a bond with the character... literally as a player with the character...  I don't know how to describe it. I don't know exactly how I felt. I was touched, that is certain. I don't know what to add to that.   If you're someone that only wants to play action games, or play with great graphics, or play 200 hours on a game... then this perhaps isn't the game for you.  But if you want to experience something more, if you care about a story that makes you *feel* stuff... then by all means instead of buying that next beer or chocolate bar... why don't you spend it on this game?",
