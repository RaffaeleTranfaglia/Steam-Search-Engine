            "review_text": "It's slow, it's boring, it's not in any way funny or clever. Nor is it actually satiric or contemplative, despite what the developer claims.   The way it works is, you float extremely slowly through three confusing but dull maps, looking for the four special floating objects that are secreted here and there. The scenery around you is surreal, but not in an exciting, interesting or thought-provoking way. Just in an it's-confusing-to-figure-out-where-you're-supposed-to-go-because-game-design-principles-went-out-the-window-and-everything-looks-the-same-as-everything-else way. There are exactly three animated character models in the game and they get resused ad nauseum. There are maybe half that many textures for the floors, walls, and ceilings.  If you 100% the game, you unlock three special endings which display those same three character models floating in different but equally unexciting ways and some scrolling text which says something about not being ashamed because we are all rebels. So, there. Now you know.  Seriously, don't bother. Not even for 50 cents. Go watch a Let's Play, since you'll experience the same depth of gameplay just watching it instead of playing it, and you can fastforward through the dull bits. (The whole game is the dull bits.)",

I´m sure this game is made by one person who is maybe a freak ;-) But if you like games which are buggy and impossible to play (you can´t find the way) and if you are a freak - then try this game, try it, because 'you can´t play it serious'. Better play Goat Simulator with the mod where you can fly like a 'superman astronaut' !",

            "review_text": "So let´s bring some light into the mysterious dark that is 'Hippocampal: The White Sofa': It is a completely self-aware and funny exploration game that has a VERY special, quiet and somehow hidden kind of humour that I enjoyed and that mixes up with goofy moments whenever you accomplish a target. It´s very short and the atmosphere is unique, yet it may not be worth the asked price. The gameplay is simple at best, confusing at first, but once you ge the grip of it it somehow 'works'. The physics are neat, the story is rubbish but the entertaining sort and while I obviously can´t recommend it to everyone, I had a decent enough time with it and if you enjoy experimental games and want to know what the hell this actually is, then you may grab it if it ever comes on sale. Oh, and if you know Tale of Tales and find em ridiculous this is THE game for you :D",

Problem is even with a PC well in advance of minimal requirements I can't get it to run well. Tried 3 times. foirst time was laggy and slow so I quit and rebooted. Second time was still laggy and slow so I tried using tab and accessing the console to improve performance. Third time it blue screen of deathed me. Uninstall time!  I might give it a go again in the future on a different PC/laptop but for now its unplayable. A pity as I really wanted to give this game a decent go.",
