            "review_text": "My biggest problem with this game is that it feels like a very early access inide game and no where near like the complete product.  Firstly the driving mechanics are aweful the controls feel clunky, it feels like driving a tank and you even have to turn off the engine before you are allowed to get out of the car. I don't think they will fix this either because it is one of the core mechanics of the game.   Unfortunatly when you do anything it is done through a menu system, for example you call to get a prisoner transport and instead of seeing a car come out and pick up the prisiner you get a screeen shot saying it has been done, this is the same for ambulances, tow trucks ect.   The graphics leave a lot to be desired, most of the game looks pretty poor the models look like they came out of a ps1 game, this would not be an issue if the game mechanics were better. Also every citezen looks the same i think there are no more than say 10 character models.   The map is split into tiny sections you have to drive through checkpoints to get to different parts of the map, there are so many loading screens in this game for pretty much everything you do.  All the above points are things that are core parts of ther game and will probably never be changed/fixed at the time of writing there are many other issues too such as bugs (cars floating in the sky), I feel like the duty time is too short it makes you rush to complete the day, buying yoyur own car is far too expensive compared to how much money you make, you have to get a taxi home because home is too far from the station. Hopefully the modding community will come to the rescue of this game but at the moment i wouldn't recommend this game, ive played played games that cost £4 - £5 that have been more polished and genrally better games.",

It offers you plenty of options what can a good officer do, like patrolling the streets, stopping cars, checking drivers, chasing burglars and vandals.  You always play in the sandbox mode and you have to watch your needs (hunger, energy, health). You have to complete some of the missions during duty hours (some of them are optional and randomly generated) but it gets very repetitive very soon.   Technical side of the game is a problem. City looks empty and sterile. You see some pedestrians on the streets but they all looks the same (only few types).   Driving mechanics is also bad, it feels nothing like any of the GTA games.   For the standard price I cannot recommend this game, fair price would be 10 Euro.",

It has some really nice implementations like choosing your patrol vehicle and customizing it. Also the missions are fun. BUT sadly this game is so full of bugs and annoyances that I can't recommend it right now. If even slowly driving your patrol vehicle onto the concrete of the downtown gas station damages your car badly (up to 10%), that's just not how it should be. Also the handling while driving is annoying. The slightest push of a button can completely turn your car around. Not to mention all the bugs like flying cars that are not reachable which makes it impossible to finish certain missions, too fast decreasing of gas and car condition, clipping errors (eg. handling your submachine gun), invisible road bumps that crash your car and so on. As said, the idea behind the game is pretty cool, once the developers flat out MANY bugs and annoyances, it might be actually pretty fun. Until then, I don't recommend it.",

Imagine if you combined True Crime with the Sims, yet kept some realism in there. If you have an interest in law enforcement pick it up, if you like laughing at the crazy stuff, pick it up.

However, as a game that claims to be full, it is not even close. There are many areas that are lacking. Many features that were promised that still have yet to show up. The player movement is clunky, car acceleration random and almost uncontrolable, useful customization almost non existant, features that felt like dead ends and were started but never finished. The world feels so empty, and you have such a large area to patrol, I feel like this should be state patrol or sheriff's department. It's so empty. You are the ONLY COP.   This is not a complete game. If you're desperate for a police game, ok buy this, but other than that? Don't waist your money. Get GTA IV for $20 and downloand the mod LCPDFR. Its clunky and crashes, but it still feels more complete than this game. You can download additional callouts, bug fixes, custom cars, custom uniforms, different scripts for police AI, the possibilities are endless...   Unfortunately this game just falls short. If I knew anything about developing I would totally help this guy out and crank out an awesome and complete game. This game has potential, but a year after launch? Still feels empty and incomplete.  In this current state, I would not recommend it.",

I look forward to seeing this game develop and cant wait to see it in the later stages.  PROS - Rare game type - Fun after figuring it out - Great potential CONS - No Tutorial - Lacking ambiance (dont feel involved/in the game) - Needs to work on the tweeks; shooting, pursuits, just overall stuff in the game - IMPORTANT needs AI police officers that you can call for back up or help you in pursuits  Currently 5 of 10 but there is lots of potential and i like the idea of seperating from mainstream games.",

The graphics are bad, its really outdated looking for a 2014 game and the driving engine is handmade in Hell. However, the gameplay is there in spades - fans of Maxis' SimCopter will be at home here.   You play a uniformed cop who simply works a shift and is faced with mundane tasks like setting up speed cameras to record speeding vehicles, or chasing down armed suspects after a botched home invasion. You can ask a suspect to comply while you check his ID, frisk him for weapons or arrest him, and use your radio to have him taken downtown or have his vehicle towed, all with an intuitive interface.  The missions are quite repetitive and if you're quick to complete them, you can face a boring period of wandering around looking for speeders or drunk drivers while waiting for an 'official' mission. However, if you like police themed games, Enforcer is not too bad.",

This game lacks a certain polish -- it almost reminds me of the old GTA or Driver games, yet has a sincere charm to it. It's a great concept (as mods for GTA V such as LCPD:FR have shown with their massive fanbase), and this actually isn't a bad excution of it, while it needs some serious bug-hunting and polish, the potential is certainly there.  Problems: 1.) Days are way too short, you don't have time to do much, then your character is clutching his guts in agony while standing in the road. 2.) Time compression is extreme, gas runs out, hunger sets in, and your character becomes lethargic all while driving to work. 3.) Physics are non-existent, one stop light in particular sends cars flipping across the road, good entertainment value, but certainly immersion breaking.  The good stuff: 1.) I think a game like this has had a demand for some time now, while we've seen a few teasers over the years they've often turn to little more than a flash in the pan, unless you count the CoD clone SWAT games (police=FPS... wut?). 2.) The game-play is rather straight forward, and the Sims-esque needs give you a break after putting the hurt on drunk drivers for a couple hours. I know after playing GTA V with LCPD:FR for a couple hours, I often got bored and started a massive killing spree -- no reason to do that here. 3.) Options: car liveries, and player clothing. You have several asthetic options right off the bat, all of which seem to have had work and thought put into them. 4.) The future -- I think this game will get the polish it needs, the devs are small enough to work with their potential fanbase, and although I haven't had look at the files yet, probably has a good modability factor.  I know what you're asking and why you're reading this: 'Red, should I buy this game with my hard-earned money?' Well, I really couldn't tell you -- while the potential is there, it isn't yet. Is it worth $20? Probably not.. not yet anyways. Do you have $20 you want to spend and help a small company along the way? Then buy it. But if you don't want to spend $20 just to see if you like it, then I wouldn't recomend it, you'd end up hating it like the rather harsh people who've commented before me because now you think you 'wasted' $20 on 'this'.   Give it a shot though, and keep an eye on it, I know I will.  -RedHorizon",

Flying cars, glitching NPCs, falling through the earth, getting stuck in the ground or buildings, failing an objective despite completing it with flying colours, hell some objectives won't complete at all and you'll be stuck in a state of boredom limbo.  Secondly: The game is horrendously boring, so far I've only experienced 5 different events multiple times, and 2 flavours of side activity. Most of the time will be spent mining trading cards or waiting for the off chance that you actually get given an objective that you haven't completed 50 times previously.  Thirdly: The team has abandoned it completely. They are nowhere to be found except in their miserable fiefdoms, moderating their forum with an iron fist like a Cold War era Russian dictator. They don't listen to it's player base, they don't update their game, they break all of their promises and they have the *gall* to insult players with actual concerns, actual criticisms and actual desires to see this game completed.  ---------------------------------------------  In summary, stay away from this mess, the game is broken and it won't be fixed and the development team are petulant children not deserving of a single cent from you.  If you want a police simulator, you're better off getting the First Response mods for GTAIV or V.",

You can change quite a few things on your cop car as well as your house. You can also buy your own car.  The game does however feel 'early access' and does feel a bit dated as well.

Also when you pull drivers over and inspect their car it sometimes says 'Illegal Licences Plate' Normally you get arrested for that and in this you can only ticket the criminal.  4.

It needs alot of patches and bug fixes an example is when a car hits you, what happens is that the car makes a flip. Another one is when I travel from one part of MV to another one, my car loses 1 hp. When my sirens and lights are on some cars still manage to hit me and the drivers are not drunk.. Things are very expensive. I was on a mission I had to shoot 2 drug dealers, I got hit once and and shot like 8 bullets. My car got hit by another car and i had to pay for the gas. I had to pay 100$ for the bullets, 200$ for medicine 25$ for my car and 11$ for the gas plus the food that is 5$... I earned 600$. My total expenses were 341$ 600$-341$= 259$. The cheapest car costs 9000$... After my shift I have to either walk home (like 7-10 minutes running) or waste 20$ on a cab to my house. You have to pay to get food out of your fridge, it's 5 dollars... wtf? The physics in this game suck, driving is laggy even with the lowest graphic settings with me and I have no clue why because I can run games like arma and BF4 on max FPS. 2 body shots with an m9 can drop me but with my mp5 I need 4 body shots (m9 fires 9×19mm Parabellum bullets and so does the mp5, this means that it fires the same bullets but I need more shots to drop someone). The map is split in small parts which is really annoying because I get lost alot (for anyone of you who has postal 2, think about going from one part to another) This wastes alot of time on just loading that and I get lost sometimes trying to find my house.. Also when I arrest someone and as for a van to pick them up I see a screen saying 'Good job, one less criminal on the streets'... They could've added a truck to pick them up.

Mainly because its in its baby stages, and theres more to add in this case.   So far, the gameplay is alright, Simple so far. Start out as a beat cop (Sort of) Walking around, Ticketing vehicles, setting speed traps, pulling over drunk drivers. There is a minor story in both the male and female characters, but that quickly liquidates as..Well. Its a sandbox..Free-roam. So I can't mark down points on that.  The location is....Clunky. In my personal opinion (And others may feel free to disagree) It feels as if you could either move it to a more populated area. (Or create a second map. That would give players a much wider sense of adventure and exploration) Or just expand the area more with more to explore. Eitherway, Once you've seen all the areas, thats it, exploration over.  Combat? Well. Rarely there. Or I havn't really progressed far yet. (First Sergeant so far) Fists are rarely used (You could throw a baton in there for variation.) Firearms are suddenly thrown in. Maybe remove the SMG? I find its rarely used around now. Probably for later ranks. Tazers are not the only non-lethals out there, Pepper spray maybe? Good for short-ranged. Less range than the tazer. More range that your fists (Or baton if its implimented). Two hits and your dead, unstandable. Frustrating when you forget the tazer has only one shot and you have to reload. Maybe throw in body armor later on? Seeing as you will more and likely going up against drug dealers, cartels, gangs. It'd be logical to later on recieve body armor for a small cost. Hey. If it gets worse, throw in S.W.A.T armor/uniform! Baby stages!   Missions. So far. So good! It started slow with simple hunt down drink drivers, or wander drunks, or setting up speed traps. And as I ranked up I started getting more into the dirty side of crime by hunting down the occassional drug dealer. Like I said, in baby stages so far, but more can be added. So looking forward to more here. Some missions I find quite entertaining. 'Go to X and find Z' One I just find inasne......'Illegally parked Vehicles' Okay. So 25 Minutes to find 7 wrongfully parked vehicles. I don't think Mountain Valley has a drug problem, I think it more has a parking problem. And they're so well hidden that I can't find them! I have to traverse map to map sections just to meet my quota! Oh. And some times are too generous. 25 Real time minutes is pretty much 2 shifts. But when your first shift ends, that progress is lost. Be alittle more less lenient on times..... And...Less illegally parked cars...More drugs and gang violance.  Progression. So far, I'm liking the rank tree and the standard 'Gain certain amount of EXP/Score' to rank up. Maybe unlock more uniforms/Vehicles/Housing and such as you level up. Hell. If you get to Sergeant, throw in an NPC Companion maybe! It pays to be ranked! And this job is too dangerous to go alone!  Driving. Okay. So far. This will be the main negative part for this. I took a car out, and I swear I was falling into a 'Back to the Future' Moment. Gently press the accelerate button...And...Atleast a second later. 99MPH..... I had to immediantly slam on the breaks to slow down. Heck. At one point I was going in reverse so fast I had to slam the handbreak on as accelerating did nothing! This requires quite abit of tweaking! And the car repair costs are manic, not just because its expensive, its more that its difficult to NOT hit anything. Cruise helps. But. Eh.  A.I. Uh. Its not great, but its not so bad either. Maybe some more character models for look. They're not so bad walking, they just horrific when driving. Stop one car, the one behind slams into it and slowly (And painfully) Tries to continue moving. Usually people stop as soon as they hit a car, (Or see a policeman giving a ticket to the person in front.) A bit of an intelligence tweak may be required on the drivers.  Customisation? Meh. Five off duty uniforms. Two on duty uniforms. Not great. Maybe add shopping here? Or a new flashy uniform when you rank up? Only one house. Little customisation. An expensive fridge does little to no better than your cheap stock one.   Overall Verdict? So far. So good. Alot of tweaks to be made. It does in its own way feel unique. Realistic. And none of that 'Good cop, Bad Cop' rubbish. (Though kicking in doors is quite a good one without caring for minor loss points.)  Improvements? - A much stronger progression system. Maybe additional uniforms per promotion. Access to more equipment. - The cars. The speed is an issue. If I go any faster, I might break the time barrier and see the game in the future. - A.I. Yeah. Intelligence Tweak when driving. - Either friendly Police A.I to assist you (Seriously, Can't be the only policeman in this valley right?) Or impliment a co-op feature (Though give that time, Co-Op and multiplayer is when the game is a good few builds away from completion)  Overall. Keep it up. And keep going!  ",

However i feel like there is alot of improvement that can be added to this game,. Here are my ideas;  - Story Line and Missions to complete as well as everyday cruising etc... - Better turning because at slow speeds turning is smooth however it is a struggle to stay on the road at high speeds and i tend to crash... alot! - Time needs to go slower and you need to be able to have like days off and things to do during your days off.

(True Crime doesnt count there's too much of a fantasy element there) But in it's current state, this game is only kind of OK. But at the current price, it's just not worth picking up until some things get ironed out. Such as the driving; it's the worst driving with a mouse and keyboard I've ever experienced. I feel like this could be remedied by figureing out a way to have controller support. While it wouldn't really fix the problem, it could make the problem a lot less evident. Character movement is akward, though not as bad as the driving. I would go out on a limb to say that it's passable, but it still needs work as well. I also feel like the devs are working on trying to work on making the game bigger and more complex before addressing these fundemental issues. Overall I cannot recommend this game for it's current state and price. There is loads of potential here though. So hopefully one day that price will reflect what could be a very cool, unique game.",

Dont get me wrong i love the game and all but if it was in one big colourful city with backup police npc's that dont kill every suspect (gta style) it would make it better and faster running but in conclusion great game hope to see a workshop soon for this game. and more vehicles maybe a police helicopter.

            "review_text": "(Important note for Fsecure users: Disable deepguard while you play this game) For anyone with an interest in police work, this is a fairly good game. The calls are varied and the situations feel organic with the suspects reacting in a believable manner. For example, drunks and thieves are unlikely to pull a gun on you (but much more likely to flee) while hardcore criminals with drug raps and worse tend to violently object to your stopping their crime sprees. Also, the locations of the criminals are not automatic and sometimes you just have to go around looking for them either from witness descriptions or behaviour described in the initial call (example: rowdy drunk). The game does give you hints after a time in the form of radio updates about the rough location of the suspect(s), if you are worried about never finding the perps.  The police procedures are sometimes a bit off (you generally want to cuff the perps before searching them, devs...) but overall the basics are there. Note that this game is meant for people who WANT to follow police procedure. If you want to mess around, the game basically ignores it and it will feel weird. But then again, if you just want to mess around in an open world, why are you here? GTA series are that way ---&gt; The game has problems too. The driving model is wonky and there are some glitches and bugs around, some amusing (like trucks launching in to orbit) and some not (a car parked 10m in the air....).Its not the prettiest game in any way, shape or form either.   In the end of the day, this is a game for cop fans and no-one else. Being one, i recommend it. If you have no interest in patrol police work then this game is really not for you.",

I promptly respond that I'm on it, get in my squadcar and haul ♥♥♥ to the crimescene; sirens, lights, the whole schebang. As I get there, the robberer seem to have fled the area. I ask a few witnesses and luckily I could get some valid information from them on the robberers appearance, what clothes he wore and his approximate age. One man, walking away from me, fits the description to the letter. I order him to stop and as I do, he turns around with the speed of light with a 9mm in his hands. He fires off a shot and misses me by a quarter inch. Pedestrians, people on their way home from work, scream in fear and suprise from the sudden and loud noise. At this point I'm glad I hadn't developed the nasty habit of doughnut-eating like many of my collegues. I pull out my own pistol and return fire. Three times I pull the trigger in rapid succession. All shots land in his upper chest and the robberer collapse to the ground, face down, in the middle of the streets. He's not moving. Between trucks and sedans I close in carefully. People around me stare at the macabre scene in shock and disbelief. I pick up his gun and the goods he stole and call an ambulance.  Just another day on the streets as a Lieutenant in the Mountain Village Police Department.

Having said that it appears the developers are working very hard to get this right (eventually) and that speaks volumes for the games appeal. Is it LCPD:FR? Nope, but it is trying, and with the addition of backup units, even a cutscene style state police call where they come and 'help' by arresting the fleeing vehicle, (I'm tired of spending tons of money fixing a cop car that has to be used as a battering ram every time I get in a chase) would make this game absolutley worth it.

            "review_text": "If you have ever played GTA IV LCPDFR then you know the love of serious, realistic, police simulation games. In addition if you have played LCPDFR you know the struggle to get the mods you want to work, hell you had problems getting GTA IV to start, but you did what you had to, stayed up through the night to get everything working because you know how fun it is, and now you are looking at this game because its like LCPDFR except you don't have to worry about bugs, crashes, bad mods, no. Finally a game based around the idea of police simulation. Now the question is, is this game good? Is it what we all wanted? The answer, is yes. Amazingly this seems to be the first success of its kind and on my very first day of playing it I already had 5 hours, keep in mind this was not made by Rockstar, this was made by an indie developer so this is not GTA 6 Police, not even close. This game still has minor bugs, it still needs polishing, it is not finished. Currently the game is very enjoyable and playable, none of the minor drawbacks that I just mentioned damper the games 'fun factor' at all. All I meant by saying that is do not expect GTA 6 Police, however what you will find is a game with good graphics, decent animations, a good selection of vehicles, and a good system of fighting crime. And I know that the one question you still want answered before you buy this game, so I will tell you, yes, you can *Pull people over (Traffic stop). When you do this you have the option to check their plates and license, use a breathelizer, ask them to exit the vehicle, issue a ticket, and I believe a couple more. And yes, sometimes they do run and you must chase after them, but whatever the random situation is you have the choice of letting them go free, write a ticket, or if need be, arrest them and transport them to the station or call a police van. You also should tow their car however that is optional. Now for your characters abilites, you can fight with your fists, you have a pistol, you can direct traffic, you have a taser, and you have your radio to call a police transportation van, an ambulance, a tow truck, and help if your police car runs out of gas or has reached its maximum damage capacity. (Yes cars use gas I know its awesome!) And of course you do get random callouts. There is also a level system, I do not know off hand how many levels their are but I believe their is about 15 or 16. You start as a corpral and make your way all the way down to the final rank Chief of Police. Now depending on your rank you will get more dangerous callouts and get paid more at the end of your shift. Now I do not want to spoil the whole game but you do have shifts and off your shift you go to your house, you can go out with friends, own your own civilian car, eat, watch TV, shower, sleep, and many other things. Now this system of off duty is not the greatest, their is not much to do and it will probably be polished in the future. But I do think that it is good because in a game that is centered around police simulation it would be awkward to be on patrol 24 hours a day 7 days a week, so I do believe this is a good system that was put into play. So that is pretty much what you are getting, also do not forget the whole game is open world, no missions! Now if there was one thing that I could say was the biggest problem with the game currently it would probably the car physics, they are not unplayable but they are not Iracing physics. That is pretty much the end of my review and don't think you know everything now because I am happy to say there are many more features in the game still that you can do as a police officer! I do believe it is worth the money and my final rating on the game *CURRENTLY is a 8.7/10",

The pedestrians are quirky, so it may seem lame to some, but I think it breaks up the repetitiveness of the game.

This game isnt difficult to learn, and is a great time killer. I got on Steam sale for 9.99, and I would say that is the price YOU should shoot for.  Pros -Variety of missions leading to different styles of gameplay. (Laid back pulling speeders over, or gun ho, busting dealers) -Customizable clothes, cars, and house. (Not a huge variety, but enough to set you a part) -Easy to learn -Tons of potential -Taser the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone.

The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the 'Contacts' menu, it says '4+h' when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a 's' on the end of words.  Another issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...  I am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.  Right now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars.   Overall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again...   Once the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading.",

Gameplay: 6/10 Although some stuff is boring I am really enjoying this game Setting/Story: 2/10 The story as I've seen so far is non-exsisting you have a setup and then nothing more. The city you are based in is very bland and average, red lights also take waaaaay to long to turn green (not that it matters as you can run them at any time) One thing that dissapointed me was you never see another cop and you can't call for backup.  What I think they should add: Other police officers around the city to make it not seem like you're the only cop around. Graphics over haul More customization. Having to check ID's in your squad car to see if they're wanted. Higher chance of traffic stops turning to shootouts. Getting in trouble for arresting people wrongly/ breaking the law yourself More diversity of NPC's. I've pulled over the same guy like 30 times. Large scale crimes that require multiple units and SWAT   Overall the game lacks serious depth hopefully they will add some of these things and it will be a MUCH better game. ",

Praises: - Great overall concept, very workable ideas - Decent replayability - Dedicated staff - Much potential  Gripes:  - Animations aren't great - Modeling is slipshod - Driving controls are unbearable - AI are generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pathing is off  So overall I'd reccomend the game, even though I can hardly get someone to pull all the way off the road, it is still a fun game worht the buy.",

Here are some things I'd like to see implemented in the game.  -Have more variety of missions as you move up the ranks. As I've ranked up I am still getting the same menial tasks while on duty. I'd love to be able to do drug raids and busts as well look for clues at a murder scene etc.  -Have the option to choose a career track. Have the ability to choose whether to become a SWAT team member or Homicide Detective etc.  -Have more things to interact with and do while off duty. Have a bar or nightclub where the player can go for a drink to lower stress or even meet a partner to date and eventually move into your home.  -Have bigger houses to buy  -Have food places modelled indoors. This could work gameplay wise with robberies in progress happening inside the places or hostage negotiation situations.  -Fledge out the precinct indoors a bit more. As you rank up you get your own desk. You could also have a meeting room where the chief tells you about a wanted criminal to track down etc.  -More NPC variety. Once you pull them over and as you walk up to their car they could take off and start a pursuit. I also haven't encountered any of them who try to punch you, it's either they run away or draw a gun. There should be an inbetween.  -Add new items like pepper spray or baton you can use on unruly NPC's and Spike Strips for speeding cars who are dangerous.  The game is still in early development and I am sure the developers have a lot of plans for the game they want to implement. I am keen to see how this game pans out in the future :)",

However if this genre is your cup of tea then by all means I would reccomend it if you have time to kill. The game itself is fairly realistic; essentialy you complete day to day police tasks such as issuing parking tickets and arresting drug dealers. You have a health bar along with a hunger bar, strength bar and an awakeness bar (both of the 2 latter can be refilled on duty by using fist tool for a while). All the police vehicles in this game are fairly nice however chases tend to be uncommon.  Please note: This game is not good for laptops, mine succeeds the minimum requirements but realistically you should use something more powerful, my laptop struggles to handle this game and thus fries itself. KFC (Kentucky fired compaq) (not really it's a dell).",
