            "review_text": "This is a difficult platformer with some rough edges. The graphics are solid, and it contains a few clever ideas, but it's mostly just frustrating, and mostly because of its stiff and unforgiving controls. It contains a super bad usability problem where if you pause the game, pressing the jump button exits to the menu without prompting (losing any progress within the level). I lost my progress to flawed muscle memory a few times because of this. You can collect skulls to buy items, but the items are fairly useless because unless you have already played through the game and memorized every trap, you're certain to die before you get to benefit from the item. (This mostly goes for the secret hearts, as well.) On the plus side, the boss fights were all pretty interesting and fun. The music sounds randomly generated, and the sound effects click like there's some 30HZ sine wave starting in the middle of its duty cycle. I played through it to the end, but can't really recommend.  Games to play instead: Super Meat Boy, Super Time Force Ultra",

            "review_text": "It has a bit of a charm to it and it does do some things right but there is also a fair amount that needs improvement. I'd recommend this to you if you are prepared to deal with a bit of frustration.   The game does a good job of trying to mix things up, it does all the platformy gimmicks like a level where you have to stay on a moving platform and dodge things coming from underneath, or a boss that gets a stronger attack when you've almost killed him (I'm at the final area right now and only one boss seems to have done that), and overall has a lot of elements that could make it a great game, including a level that is essentially a side-scrolling shmup like that old alien shooting game on nokia phones.   Unfortunately a lot of little issues come together to make the experience less than ideal.   First off, the way that jumping handles in this game is a bit jenky. The first jump works fine but the second jump throws your character in whatever direction he is facing which can sometimes cause your character to get tossed into spikes or other things when you are doing jumps in certain areas that require you to double jump and probably get hit by said spikes.   Another issue is hitboxes. Your character's hitbox is a bit weird, sometimes you will get hurt by things that are clearly not touching you and when you jump you have to get much higher than it looks in order to get onto platforms. There have been platforms where the character very clearly is able to jump higher than the platform yet is unable to land on it because the hitbox is a bit off so you are required to take a different path there. This problem is at it worst during one of the earlier levels where you have to swing across vines in certain areas. You are only allowed to catch onto the vine if you hit it right at the tip which is weird in and of itself but when added with your character's slightly off hitbox it can mean a lot of dropping into an instant death when, visually, your character should have been perfectly fine,  A lot of the difficulty in this game actually stems from little issues like this and not actual hard platforming. In the aforementioned section, where you do the whole moving platform across a river of acid or toxic water or whatever, you basically have to stand on the platform and dodge the balls coming from underneath. The big issue with this is that there is neither an animation prior to the balls launching up at you or a consistent timing for the balls. One or the other would have been fine but without both it means your character is at the mercy of the random intervals since you can't actually use timing or visual cues. You can help this to some degree by standing all the way at the back of the short platform and running past the ball the instant it launches then running back (provided you aren't in a bit with 2 balls launching which can seriously screw you over if one decides it's going to resurface in half the time it generally takes). But this strategy gets compromised by flying enemies going at your head that you will have to attack, this wouldn't be an issue at all but when your character attacks he mysteriously stops where he is on the screen while the plaform keeps going so you may end up falling into the acid which is an instant death because your character does something illogical only on that bit.   The game attempts to make boss fights easier by letting you find golden hearts that increase your max hp (you start with 3). The issue with this is if you die you will lose the extra hearts. With the combination of most deaths being instant and there being next to no regular hearts for you to pickup (enemies don't drop them and on some levels they seem rarer than golden hearts) the odds of you making it to the boss with the extra hearts is very unlikely. Now let's say you do make it to the boss with the extra hearts, it's gonna come at you and with how easily your character dies you will likely have to fight it a couple times in order to get the patterns down. That is standard with these games but it also makes the extra hearts you might have had when you first encounter the boss virtually worthless and is furthered by certain points which are clearly designed to kill you the first time you enter them because of the surprise which makes anything you picked up (or even purchased immediately before that screen) pointless.   Artstyle is pretty basic, wouldn't say it's good or bad. The music ranges from certain tracks being very good to one that is actually quite annoying given some time. The main issue pretty much all the music tracks have however is that they weren't designed to loop. There is a very obvious start to the tracks and since it loops right back to the beginning when a track ends it creates very abrupt transitions which does break the mood quite a bit.   There are probably about half a dozen other issues that I won't get into yet but yeah, this game has potential but it definitely feels clunky as hell.",
