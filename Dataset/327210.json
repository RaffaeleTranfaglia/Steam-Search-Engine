            "review_text": "This is a pretty fun game  The mechanics are very easy to learn, though moving around the planets can take a little time to get used to. T he whole thing is pleasantly straightforward.  GET THE CRISTALS. GET THE CAKES. REACH THE EXIT. DO NOT DIE.  As you progress, these basic objectives become actually very challenging. Sometimes you need quick reflexes to dodge obstacles. Sometimes you need to make a very precise sequece of jumps. Sometimes you need to really use your brain to find your way through.  The game makes a good job at mixing things up. Dull moments are a bit rare, tough sometimes, when you die, the moving planets might take a while to reset, and that waiting is a bit annoying, but certainly nothing gamebreaking or that migth spoil the experience.  Another highlight that deserves a big note are the graphic and sound designs. The gaphics are neat, fun and clear, with interesting characters and funny enemies, things change a lot from a world to another, so its hard to get tired of the colorful and unique art style. The music is fun too, it's a cool jazz improvisation that goes very well with the funny graphic design and the simple yet charming animations.  Overall, it makes for a pretty neat experience. Certainly worth a look.",
