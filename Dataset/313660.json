    "description": "“ALEA JACTA EST” (The Die is Cast) is what Caesar said as he crossed the Rubicon River when he learned that the Senate had removed him from his command. Crossing that small Italian river was equivalent to disobeying Rome’s orders and entering into open rebellion in this historical turn-based strategy wargame .",

            "review_text": "Simply a beautiful game. At its heart it is very simple and the age engine itself is Imo much easier to learn than some of the Clausewitz games e.g. HOI3. True the tutorial does not explain enough and formulating strategy is the main difficulty and can be very complex in the generally bigger original scenarios. Some of these are quite formidable multi-front affairs (for these its best to look at the AARs on the ageod forum/youtube). Hence I would advice to get most of the dlc, especially BOR, Spartacus and Parthia. These are smaller, easier to manage affairs generally. (Hannibal is great too, but 2nd Punic war is quite big) (Cantabrian wars is hard). The AI can make mistakes e.g. placing its main army in cities that can fall at a stroke to a successfull siege, and other supply stuff, but overall it is pretty capable and can be a worthy adversary/ and can win sometimes.   But what I really enjoy about these strategy games is how much history I have learned from them. Like whether Pompey was right to go to the East and the pros/cons of adapting the corvus boarding devise to the Quinqereme ship. I also love the alternative history (but based on facts) Caesar's revenge scenario against Parthia (easy Roman whitewash :) ). I cannot emphasise how much it has taught me and makes me want to read more. In summary a true Roman game for true Romans :)",

            "review_text": "You love Grand Strategy Games? You love historical Settings? You are willing to read a manual? You love a challenge? You are not afraid of your wife?  You know how to handle the 'Just one more turn' syndrom? Graphics and visual presentation is not more important for you than gameplay?  If you can answer all these question with 'Yes, Sir, Yes!', you should really consider to buy one of the AGEOD Grand Strategy Games. (The one with the historical setting you are interested in!)  To be honest, I avoided AGEOD games in the past, because I was always too lazy to read another manual besides the one from GG´s War in the East and the long turn processing times from Pride of Nations...   ... now I know this was a huge mistake.  The depth of these games (I am talking about all AGEOD Games, not only this one) is awesome, and the rules and mechanics running in the background are incredible deep, so complex that you have to read the manual if you want to master the game.   Moving around your units is easy. To know why your units are out of supply, exhausted, lost half of their manpower is a step to master these games.  In my play time in Alea Jacta Est, I played only 1 Scenario, 'The Civil War between Ceasar and Pompeius' and I have to admit, at first it was frustrating, because I played the tutorial first, but reading the manual changed everything and the game became a blast.   Sure, the older AGE games are missing the ability to set up battle tactics (like The Thirty Years War) but I am simply in love with the historical setting and so far, this is the BEST Grand Strategy Game I was able to play for this setting.   What do you get? Turn based battles? No!  You can´t directly influence the battles, they are automaticly resolved. The task and challenge is  to pick the right time,  the right place,  the right composition of troops the right commander in charge and the right enemy to attack  Some more R´s can be added, but I guess I will cover them later.  Micromanagement? Compared with games, like Hearts of Iron, or War in the East/West, the micromanagement level is low. The only real micromanagement I encountered so far, is keeping your supply chain in shape, this requires to move several supply wagons every turn, at least if you really want to be as efficent as possible with your troops. Building troops, Diplomacy, building province improvements are simple and easy.  Alternate History? Compared to Paradox Grand Strategy Games = No! Is this bad = No!  First of all, you can win the Civil War as Pompeius, but many decisions and diplomatic options are only available if you reach a specific turn, not all, but many.  But, it´s still up to you to decide if you use the diplomatic option or how you decide.   Empire building? No, the games are ALL about WAR Scenarios, not about building an Empire or a Dynasty. Your job is to win a war with a limited amount of ressources and this can only be achieved by using everything with the highest efficency!   Is this fun? If you like board games and you can enjoy 'the mind game' part = spending a lot of time in front of your monitor with thinking and listening to music or an audiobook, yes it´s fun.    ",

            "review_text": "Alea Jacta Est as an idea for a game is a good one In execution it needs a lot of work The game suffers from slow run time and an annoying habit of crashing and at times the game simply doesn't register my commands and i have to click multiple times before it gets the message (although this cold just be the slow runtime)  The gameplay could be interesting if I knew what was going on as the tutorial does a very poor job of explaining how battles work and tells you nothing at all about the units (ie what there stats mean, what different units are good for etc) from what i can gather it seems that armies have a power score based on their units and health (possibly morale too) and this combined with the general and terran will determine the outcome of a battle it feels like a more complex and interesting version of the battle system in crusader kings or EU (which is good cause both those games need a better system for battles) and I feel that if I could just figure out what to do (and have the game run well enough to have the chance to do it) It would be very deep and challenging and a lot of fun.  As it stands now I wont recommend this game, give it a few months to sort itself out and wait for another steam sale by then hopefully it will be running well enough to be some real fun.",
