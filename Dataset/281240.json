I wouldn't pay anymore than that to be honest. I do recommend a play if you can get it for cheap and like hidden object games.",

            "review_text": "I didn't want to play this after the disaster that was the first game 'Escape The Musuem,' but I'm glad I finally found the courage.  AC: The Search for Lost Treasure is sequel that fixed everything that was wrong with one of the worst HOGs I've ever played (Escape the Museum). The clutter is gone, the HO scenes are 100% graphically improved allowing you to actually recognise the objects you are supposed to find, there isn't as much pixel hunting, and you don't have to revisit the same HO scenes over and over again. (Sometimes up to 4 times in the original)  It's not a great game, but it's enjoyable enough to keep you playing as you globe trot to locate famous treasures. The only negative I have is that the main character is supposedly an archaeologist and you spend most scenes destroying and desecrating historical artifacts in order to find the treasure!  Overall. If you've played the terrible 'Escape the Museum' and have been avoiding this game as a result, don't, it's safe!",

        {
            "review_text": "Terrible example of a Hidden Object game.    The items are incredibly difficult to find due to muddy graphics and poor coloring. And no matter what I set the sound to, the cutscenes played at full volume.   Also, after ending the game, steam would think it was still running so the only way to close steam was to shut down my computer.  I wasted 54 cents on this and I still feel ripped off.",
