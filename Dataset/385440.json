            "review_text": "Buff Knight is a passable game, at $1.00 at most. The controls do not work at the start of game and the keybindings in the option menus were confusing. as for the game its the typical move forward kill things, gain gold, grow stronger repeat. This is fine, but there isnt much besides that. There are lots of stats and gear to upgrade but it only ever really changes the numbers you deal to the enemies. also i ended up buying things on one upgrade page while on another, doesnt seem like the code for the other menus is frozen while not being looked at.  If this goes on sale to something like $1 to $2 you can think of buying this. but otherwise for +$5 there are other more enertaining games then this.  ",

            "review_text": "This game is really fun despite being a bit repetitive, can be addicting sometimes aswell. Though I would've loved if there were more stuff to buy in the shop. More customizations, more skills, more different attacks, more characters.   You attack monsters coming towards you and you can use 2 special attacks against them. When they die, the grant you gold so you can buy better equipments and buy potions aswell. I wished there was a way to buy new artifacts or new skills, buy a new character and repeat game or something like that.   Buy this if it is at a discount.",
