I got the impression I could use this app to view all the models on the sketchfab website, but that is not the case. There is a handful of predefined models that you only need about 5 minutes until the app has nothing more to offer you.  I expected much more from a company who delivers 3d digital content as it's claim to fame. At least allow content from your own website to be imported...  Unfortunately, you can't import anything... at all... from anywhere. I'm sad, I thought sketchfab would have put more effort even into a free app.  Oh well, now I know.",
