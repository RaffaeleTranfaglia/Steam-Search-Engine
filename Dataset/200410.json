            "review_text": "I feel this game has too many bad reviews, that don't do it justice.   The gameplay is excellent. It's similar to freelancer, but with inertia and glide/slide mechanics. It's a joy to pilot the fighter!  Sure it could be longer and have more options, ships and whatnot, but then it wouldn't have this price tag.  Great dogfights, varied mission objectives. Hope they make a second one!",

I'd give it an 84, mainly because of the short length (3.6 hours for one playthrough). At the price point however, that is reasonable, and the game is very fun. Pick it up; it's worth the money.",

I enjoyed most of them and have fond memories of each one.  This game is an exception. Its combat mechanics are horrible, visuals are so and so, the music and sound generally is out of place, and the story is laughable.   This is a rare case of a game that I'll leave it unfinished, uninstall it, and never think of it again. And so shoud you",

In space moving around should be like a big 3d ice-rink - you slide around with no friction. In this game your ship's velocity vector (i.e. the direction you're going) is simply where your ship points.",

Try the demo at the very least before buying.  Interestingly, this game used to work for me. I don't know what broke it - possibly the upgrade to Win10, but there is at least one person reporting the crash on Win7. From what I remember, it was fairly fun, but that is irrelevant if it doesn't run any more.",
