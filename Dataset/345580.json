            "review_text": "So.....this game.  Putting aside any personal isssues with Derek Smart (and let's be honest, a lot of people have issues with him), let's try to be as objective as possible in this review...  What exactly is UC and does it live up to its claims?   It's a 'do anything in space' simulator. You want to command a battlecruiser? Check. You want to be a Marine on a planet shooting stuff? Check. You want to fly from a planet to space and dock with that carrier you see over there? Check.  The problem is...well....the problems are...  One: Excessive micro management: Why for instance, should the commander of a large ship have to manually set power levels? Why can't....say....the crrew AI do that for you and if you want to then alter it, you can? By default, there isnt't enough power to go around and you have to go in and manually set it. Or, say you want to send....I don't know, four Marines and a tank and a pilot to a planet. You have to tell each individual what to do. There's no group option.  Two: HUD issues. The HUD itself isn't intuitive at all, the three MFDs at the bottom of the screen don't easily tell you what they are, the radar is 2d, not 3D and that is confusing as well as you got no clue if the enemy target is above or blow you.  Three: Questionable vehicle physics. Why should a shuttle be able to stop on a dime in space? I can understand tanks or ATVs stopping quickly on a planet, that makes sense, however...a shuttle, in space, you cut the power and it instantly stops? Really? Yes, I'm aware it's explained away as some technical stuff but that's an easy and cheap way to get around the issue.  So what are the good points then given I've laid out some issues with it?  One: You can literally go anywhere and do anything you want to. For instance in a free roaming scenario, I have taken a battlecruiser from Ear to the Moon, landed troops, done exercises, got picked up by the shuttle and flown back, all without cutscenes or scripting.  Two: It's seamless once it loads. Yep that's a big, big plus. You want to go from planet to space? Get above a certain height and push a button, then confirm it (again....micro management issues but....), there's a few seconds worth of animation and you're in space. Same for going to a planet.s, get close, it'll ask establish planetfall, say yes,a nd sit back.  It's pretty. Oh yes it is, it's some of the most atmospheric graphics in a space game....and you feel as if you can actually go to that nebula, or that planet....or even that base and dock there  You are not the hero. Okay, this is astrange one but....most games are all about the player, right? Well, UC, CE isn't. There's an entire universe going on, things happen regardless of you being around or not. You can be in a system and go off for a few days, come back and find that station you were docked at got attacked and changed hands, or there's a war on a planet that broke out while you were going there.  However....I personally wouldn't recommend it unless you want to spend a LOT of time reading and learning. It's not a simple pick up and play game in the least, it takes time, dedication and (sadly) figuring things out on your own so you don't have to deal with Derek Smart to enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, once you like it, it's definitely good but I do feel many, many people will be put off by Derek Smart and won't even look at it.  If UC was made by somebody else and released on Steam for free, it would get a much, much better reception, I can absolutely say that for certain.  Either way, although this has not recommended at the top, try try it out. Make up your own mind and be prepared for a lot of reading and learning too.",

            "review_text": "I downloaded this free game half an hour ago, played it for 27 minutes according to Steam and in that time it crash hard to the desktop 8 times. EIGHT TIMES IN 27 MINUTES! That's not enough time between 2 crashes to figure out the cryptic menu system you need to use to command anything. Usability was clearly not part of the development plan of this game. It's probably an engineer's wet dream, but it's a gamer's nightmare (unless you like to hurt yourself). I guess the graphics were okayish for a game of the 90s, but the gameplay is a pain in the neck, it's just horrid. It's simply not rewarding nor enjoyable. Since I don't feel like reading the 100+ pages of what looks like an accounting manual to figure out how to fix this game or what to do, I'll just uninstall it right now. I have a lot of 'old' games that work just fine so I don't need crappy crashy ones even if free. (oh, a $27 DLC??? yeah right)",

Flight mechanics are primitive and most time seems to be spend in menus. Because of the limited development team, the vastness of space is appearing rather empty, a problem, that Elite:Dangerous also faces. If I'd have to give any advice to the creators, it'd be to reduce the scope of the project or massively increase the dev team size.  If you enjoy tactical space games and dont value graphical fidelity too highly, this one may be for you, especially because its f2p. All others should stay away and maybe try ED or SC (when released).",

A PDF exisits somewhere on the internet on how to play this game ( I could not find a direct link to the PDF.). 3. Even when/ IF you DO figure out the controls from the PDF, The controls are garbage sound quality is sh*t, Graphics are ok for a remastered 90's game. This game was not worth the money I didnt have to spend. It certainly isnt worth 9.99.",

You'll probably get lost on your first play but it's worth sticking with. As this is an old game re-released the graphics are dated now but still they are still good enough to enjoy the game. I recommend giving this game a try if you like space games, just be patient with the initial learning curve.",

You can lead troops on the ground in an assault on an enemy base, fly air support in a fighter jet or level the site from orbit with Orbit to Surface missiles. Fighting too much for you? You can always grab a trade ship and make your fortune in the space lanes hoping to outrun or hide from raiders who would steal your stuff. Or be the raider and just attack everything in hopes of scoring it rich! You play how you like and make your own story.",

Universal Combat CE  is the latest version of that huge monster of tactical space simulation Derek Smart started with  Battlecruiser 3000 A.D.  (well known as  BC3k ). It is the most complex game I have played in my almost 30 years of gaming, so please don't give a warm handfull about those complaining 0.1-hour-kiddies. You have to give it a chance, if space sims are your thing, especially when you prefer to command your own battlecruiser. There's a whole lot to learn, you have to check your fuels and care for your crew, but the possibilities are endless, and so is the fun you can have with this game! And this for as free as free can be! Trust me, I've fired up tons of hours with  BC3k  and  Battlecruiser Millennium  back then, and I already love this one! Can't wait for  Universal Combat Advanced !  Edit: There's a really frightening lack of games like this nowadays, and all you useless premature hater-zombies will never see gamerheaven! :P",

It gets a lot of hate as it is not as polished as it could but that is to be expected from any indie game developer like 3000AD. This game will allow you a level of sand box play that you cannot find any where else. You can leave your ship for any planet surface leading your fighters and tanks into land combat, attack even carriers and fighters in space or in the air, assault a ground base WITH your assault ships, attack space stations, lead entire fleets of ships, the list goes on and on and on. The game tracks the location of every single one of your crew members inside your ship so you know exactly who is where (And sometimes intruders will attack your ship and storm you bridge, killing your commander or other important crew) You can take command of any asset in the game as the commander and is the ultimate mode, with ACM being the hardest but most rewarding version of the roam mode. You can also do a ton of missions to get used to the different controls and get a taste for life as various prats of your fighting force.   Yes the game isn't perfect, but there is no other game out there that allows you to do the things you can do in this game, trust me!",

If you ever dreamed of being in command of a space battleship then you should give this game a try. I spent many nights flying through the galaxy role playing as Captain Julian Augustus, Battlecruiser Commander and I can't wait to get a free weekend or three to give it another go.   This game is very complex and and takes a while to learn to play it. This game is originally from a time when PC games came in a box and included a detailed and lengthy manual. These manuals were often a treat and included background information, cool artwork, a written tutorial, list of commands, etc. I miss those types of manuals.   The tutorial is a PDF file that you print out or read on a tablet while you play through the tutorial scenarios. I'd recommend doing that. And print out the command reference as well or keep it open on a tablet.   The main thing to understand is that this game is deliberately complex. It is designed for someone who wants to feel like they are commanding a real battleship. To get the most out of this game you have to learn to play it and you have to use your imagination and really get into the role playing and the simulation. If you treat it like an arcade style game you're going to get frustrated.",
