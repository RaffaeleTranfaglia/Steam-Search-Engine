            "review_text": "Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris. Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.  This is the story of those 20 hours.  My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release. I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't. I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy. If I took 'Spiritualist,' I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness. Even better, if I grabbed 'Fanatic Spiritualist' I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.  It wasn't deep enough.  I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.  I had to go deeper  I found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness. I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone. To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about 'Alien abductions.' Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.  My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI. It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy. I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain. I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld. I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.   And we were all so, so happy.  But we needed more friends.  So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet. I set up a research post and began lightly observing them. Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.  I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are. This is where this game is, now: My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well: genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.  Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week. And I have no regrets.  Update from 5/11:  I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends. Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit. They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.  My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors. Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.  The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and 'liberating' all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.  The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.  My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.  That's when we saved and quit until next time: In summary: I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.",

            "review_text": "The year is 2387, and the galactic community is on the verge of extinction.  The Prethoryn Scourge came to the Milky Way galaxy in 2368, in isolated pockets which were quickly dealt with by the Outer Rim empires. But everything would change, the main force arrived only 3 months after.  At the beginning, the galaxy united together to fight off the Scourge, but setback after setback, the Scourge pushed deep into the galaxy within the next four years, assimilating all forms of biomass they could find and eradicating any resistance that stood in their way. At first, it was the smaller, weaker empires that went first, the cannon fodder while the major galactic powers consolidated their forces and entrenched their worlds and secured their borders.  But then, the Scourge targeted the two Fallen Empires in the galaxy. The galactic community all sighed in relief, the Scourge would surely be annihilated in mere moments against the powers of the Fallen Empires. But within the next couple of weeks, the Fallen Empires fell silent, with infected ships pouring out from their borders. The Scourge had assimilated the Fallen Empires, and now nothing could stop them. The galaxy was stunned.  The panic set in all across the galaxy, a once unified galaxy, now fractured as Empires began fending for themselves.   As the Scourge advanced, some some species thought they would kill themselves rather than become a twisted horror of the Scourge. Entire Empires were wiped from existence as they nuked themselves into oblivion, committing mass suicide with casualties reaching into the billions.  Over the course of the next 20 years, many Empires would stage a brave final stand at their homeworlds, fighting until the bitter end before being snuffed out like a flame from existence.   During the 2380s, the United Nations of Earth were one of the last remaining empires still militarily capable of fighting the Scourge, but by 2386, the UNE had lost a majority of their colonies to the Scourge, billions dead or transformed into nightmarish horrors.   In 2387, humanity staged their final stand in the Sol System, having lost contact with most of their allies, they accepted the fact they were now alone. The first engagments of the Battle of Sol were small. Small scout fleets entered the system and were quickly destroyed by the remnants of the United Nations Earth Defence Fleet (UNEDF). The first major Scourge fleets were dealt by layers of defence platforms and fortresses built across the entire system, with most of the outer Sol system mined, it was an absolute death trap and would've been considered suicide to assault, but the Scourge had no fear. Within months, the Scourge had broken through the the layers of defensive placements and now directly besieged the worlds of Earth and Mars. The UNEDF was mostly ruin, reduced to a few corvettes, destroyers and cruisers.  The fighting on the surface of Earth and Mars was terrifying. Entire armies annihilated by hordes of the Scourge's abominations. The capital city of Earth, Geneva was lost within hours of the planetary invasion, now reduced to nuclear ash.   The date is November 11th, 2387, Humanity's grand fleet and army continue to fight desperately in their home system, heroically defending their homeworld against the endless onslaught of the Prethoryn Scourge, hoping for an impossible miracle, or die trying.   This, is the galaxy's last stand.",

            "review_text": "This game started off as quite fun. I like the idea behind it, but it definitely suffers from Paradox-Syndrome.  Paradox-Syndrome is a disease in which games are born unfinished, with numerous gaps in content. Whilst pleasing to the eye and imagination, they are ultimately empty or unreplayable unless the player is willing to wait at least a year for patches, or worse to send more money for incremental improvements in the form of DLCs (which I see is the developing pattern here)  I like the game, and my initial thoughts were that it was fun. After a second play through, however, you realise that tech trees are actually rather limited and there are only a few combinations of weapon worth equipping your ships with.  In terms of story line, we were promised more mid-game developments. which have been introduced. Their effects, however, were limited. I had a race-war on one of my planets, but in all honesty, I didn't need to pay any attention to the results.  So although I like this game, and like the 'style' of paradox games in general, I really dispute their methods for brining games to market.",

The AI is the worst part of the game hands down, allied fleets of 30k would rarther try and follow your fleet halfway across the galaxy than fight an enemy fleet of 1k, they will NOT defend their borders or start an assault. Just join your fleet and wait for you to do something, not a bad thing early game but by mid/late game it becomes unplayable. The opponents have 30 undefend planets and no fleets, but the AI still just piles ontop of my own fleet lightyears away.  The lack of content has been adressed by Paradox and will be included in future updates, but then why was the game shipped? They said most of the content had to be cut last minuite and it really shows. I will update my rating when the full game is released.  In Short: Terrible AI and lack of content leave you disappointed after a great start",

            "review_text": "Stellaris  I really like this game. It is a lot of fun. Stellaris is much more than the typical Space 4X game.  I play on super slow most of the time, which is why I have a lot of hours but have yet to finish a game. My first game went wrong, I was in a nebula so my fleets moved slower, but worse I had no minerals. After 20 years of gameplay I had mineral income of 12 per month. I could have stuck with it as there was a very weak enemy Empire I coud take out, but I restarted.  My second game is great! I have room to expand and even won two wars so far.  Stellaris has neat technology system, where you get to choose from 3 different techs each time. SOmetimes techs are different to choose from, so you have to choose the best for you when you can.  Diplomacy is ... WOW! You can trade, set rivals, have embassies. There are also alliances and federations.  Also, the population management system is full-blown. I have a binch of conquered worlds where the pops have Fanatic Xenophobic ethos = thta means they hate aliens, meaning me. Err, these pops are hard to manage! FUN !!! I guess over time things will smooth out.  Love the ships and the ship design system. Ships have slots to place Weapons, Defenses+Reactors and also Support. I like designing the ships from time to time, and refits are a snap to handle.  Oh, part of playing is sending out Science ships and Construction ships. This means a little bit of micro-management. I like it, others don't.  The early game is slowwwwww .... some players would get bored, but I love it.  Graphics are nice and the soundtrack is wonderful.  I really enjoy this game. It is now one of my favorites, I am certain Paradox will improve the game even more. Currently there are no game breaking bugs, but there are a few quirks here and there.  Overall, Stellaris is a great game!",

            "review_text": "Promising game, great visuals, some story, but:  1. Lots of mechanics that are clearly broken, like sectors, warscore, AoE weapons (they are not actually AoE despite UI saying so). Some features are useless (missiles), some are overpowered. Looks like game was rushed and those were inserted as placeholder. Some crucial features, like espionage, never made it into release at all. Patches address this by quick-and-dirty decisions (like arbitrary limit on point-defense guns on ship or limiting each ship size to one battle strategy). 2. Frustrating and fiddly UI (subspecies management, fleet splitting, army management). To build a proper army, you have to manually click every unit and add an attachment, which is very low-cost and has no drawback. Only problem is clicking a lot. 3. No real depth to the game. No supply mechanics, just build anywhere. Only viable strategy for war is doomstacking. Fortificating is useless because even top-tier space defense station can be easily overcome by contemporary fleet, most it can do is shoot down unarmed transports being carelessly sent by AI. 4. Events are interesting, deep and varied, but all scripted and you get the same ones every game (mostly), Gets boring after first time. 5. Performance gets AWFUL into late game. Expect slow-death. 6. AI is dumb, sending numerous unarmed fleets to their death. Only way it can win is via cheating which is called 'difficulty setting'. 7. Most of the game is spent micromanaging your planets, ensuring the best positioning of buildings. You have to process each planet manually to achieve good returns, but you can't keep them all under manual control so you have to give them out to 'sectors'. Having only small pool of planets to manage yourself results in frustrating fiddling with sectors. Otherwise you have at best sub-par performing planets, at worst AI management causes happiness to drop and sectors revolt.  Free updates are ongoing, but while fixing stuff they kinda break game even further. With recent warscore changes and messing with sectors it's nigh unplayable. And they are already rolling out paid DLC without fixing basic mechanics. Stay away unless in far future they patch this mess up.",

I found the game very fun as is. There are some weaknesses, but nothing that prevents me from enjoying the game. It's not perfect, but it has enough depth, novelty, as well as modding support to sink countless hours into the game. However, I also know that Paradox is in it for the long haul. They will continue to flesh out and develop their games for years. I endorse their games knowing that they will only get better with time, and they aren't afraid to overhaul major game mechanics if they aren't quite right, almost all for free. It's a unique style of development, more like an MMO.   If you just want a perfect experience right now, play the game and just forget about it, then this may not be the game for you, yet. You can wait and get a more evolved version of the game later. As for me, I will enjoy the richness of the current experience, and watch as the community and developer together explore and evolve a fantastic and unique game.",

If you like endlessly building a space civilization this is kind of good. I have to say the art direction, the sound, the idea behind this was solid.  Sadly what really drives me away from this game is the sheer tedium of later gameplay. It's not terribly challenging nor is it frustratingly difficult. It's just boring. There's almost too many things to be worried about and very little in the way of automating a lot of the little things. When you do automate you take a penalty in resources for doing so.   The other major drawback this game suffers from is how easy it is to play the 'I win' race. You'd think it would be fun to play a guns blazing 'we hate all xenos' empire but that's just setting yourself up for failure. You have to be diplomatic, you have to be happy, and ultimately the easiest way to win is just being the friendly blob that absorbs all the other space empires and keeps them all happy. At the current time of my playing that's really the only victory condition. Suck up everything.   There needs to be work done on more victory conditions and balancing playstyles. With so many possible variables it seems like a very difficult task. I still occasionally check on this game but as far as strategy games go it's certainly not one of my favorites.",

            "review_text": "Stellaris is the new game from Paradox, the publisher/developer of such titles as Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Crusader Kings. This review comes from someone with almost 500 hours on EU4, 200 in CK2, and over a thousand in EU3 and Vic2 each (my steam hours are deceiving for those two games). Now, here are the questions people ask when they first hear about it or want to know about it:  Is it as hard as x Paradox game? and Is it like civ?  The answers are no and no.  Stellaris is a 4x game cleverly disguised as a grand strategy game.  Exploration: In the opening stages of the game, you explore using science ships your surrounding systems while finding new planets to colonize and encountering events. This is a typical space 4x mechanic and exists in most other games of the genre. Does this compare to other grand strategy games? Not really. Even EU4's 'search' function in the New World is different. How is this distinct from other 4x games? The events are more varied and better written, and have far more interesting fluff.   Colonizing: Colonization is a very simple 'build colony ship, send ship, wait' mechanic, as is similar to other 4x games. Actual land and building development is like a cross between Civilization 4/5 and Galactic Civilizations 2/3. Every planet has different tiles that you build buildings on (each tile giving different static resources or none at all), and you assign pops (citizens) to work each tile as they grow and spawn on the planet over time based on food surplus or migration from other colonies. This is all very standard 4x. There is not much that makes these features very distinct, and it is done in a very standard way.  Pops: Now comes the first mechanic that is even vaguely grand strategy: pops and how they function. Every pop individually has four things: a species, ethics, happiness, and ethical divergence. Ethics are a feature in Stellaris that begin based on your Empire's 'governing ethics', and vary from spiritualism to materialism to militarism and pacificm. These are the reigning values that determine a great deal about the paths of tech you will go down to how your pops act and how other empires perceive you. Pops begin with these ethics, but they change over time; as generations are want to do.   Ethics: You can do all sorts of things to encourage or discourage this ethical divergence, and whole populations of your original species may become wholly different from your core populations. This mechanic has the most depth of any mechanic in the entire game. In addition to these ethics, you have a couple other tools available to you if you so wish to reign your empire as they require: slavery and purging. Slavery makes pops work better in manual labor tiles such as farming and mining, but work worse in tiles with research and similar things. Purging is literal genocide or xenocide. Want to Imperium of Man your way and purge all xenos? Go for it. I was proud to see Paradox allow that, as they've been historically wary of slavery or genocide, but I guess aliens are less real than the actual slavery that happened in Africa and America (fu paradox don't revisionist history.). However, even if this has the most depth, it still has less depth than the pop system in Vic2.  Tech: The other entirely unique feature is the tech system. Tech works by drawing from a 'deck' for 3 (or more with modifiers) cards, which you can pick from to start your next research assignment based on three different research paths that operate parallel to one another. After picking the tech you want to research, the other two(+) go back into the deck to be drawn later. This means you may miss out on a tech for a while if you choose to skip it, making important decisions early on even more pressing. This becomes a lot less interesting in the lategame when most techs are already researched and there's a lot of 'repreated' techs that fill up the lists, so I hope more hard decision techs are added later.  FTL: FTL travel has three methods, all three of which are standard 4x tropes. Warp (warp to any system in range, cooldown, warmup, slowish travel time), hyperlanes (can only travel between connected systems, fast, minimal warmup and cooldown) and warp gates (build gates in systems, huge range, very fast, little cooldown, limited by aforementioned built gates). These are very standard and if you've played any other 4x games you know how they work.  War: Warfare is standard as well, and the ship designer is a simple slot-based affair where you stick weapons and modules into a design and it spits out damage and armor values on a generic ship model of which there is only one per class. This will most certainly be expanded in an expansion, though I would have liked to see something more indepth such as Galciv's or Star Ruler 2's systems. It has a few different types of weapons that each are countered by different things. This mostly matters in the early game, because lategame weapons rek everything but aren't quite on the level of really late game galciv things.  Diplomacy: The game does not have very robust diplomacy. I would say it's even slightly below par with other 4x games; and most certainly extremely below par (triple, quad bogey) with grand strategy games. Almost all of your relations have to do with your ethics and government types rather than logical tactical neccessity or events. Embassies are a boring shallow feature when there is nothing you can really do with it. It seems entirely up to the AI who it wants to ally with, and there's not too much you can do to affect that. And if you go militarist; well, good luck finding allies. Additionally, when you do have an ally, you have to declare war together or not at all. Not being able to declare war on my own is an annoying and backwards restriction. I can understand the restriction in the larger federations, but I should not be locked to the wishes of my ally should I want to venture on something myself. You can easily get around this by offering him a planet, but then simply not giving it to him at the end of the war, since apparently the AI just doesn't care. Exploits.  AI: The AI is mediocre or even bad in most cases, though it has that 'perfect micro' that pdox AI often has where it can snipe things that you would never normally think about just because it can, but when it comes to actually making good decisions it falls on its face.   Performance: Performance is okay until the lategame when a lot of things are happening, where it hits the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ really fast. Hopefully this is improved in time.  Random Events: My primary complaint is the complete lack of non-surveying events. When you aren't surveying or observing pre-ftl species, there are just very few events that occur randomly and have something to read or think about. This is the sprinkling of grand strat, that even when you're waiting around for things to build, you typically get a steady stream of events to read or do things with, with the occasional big event you really have to deal with or think about. With several of the quest lines being currently broken and the only other long event lines being the end game crises, this is one of the big reasons (as well as the lack of diplomacy as stated above) the midgame is so reportedly BORING. War after war isn't fun, and internal issues are sparse with so few events. We'll certainly hopefully get more with expansions, but that requires them to keep putting more of the grand strat wool over the 4x core rather than submitting to the masses who just want space civ.   Overall, it's a solid 4x game, and a refreshing take on a genre (space 4x) that has been stagnant for years. Does it beat DW in complexity? Oh, lord no. Does it beat Galciv in raw gameplay? Not really. Does it beat other grand strats in flavor and atmosphere? No.  So what is it? A pretty good 4x game, but a terrible grand strategy game. Maybe it'll be a proper one someday, but not now.  :awoo:",

            "review_text": "Even if the genre isn't exactly the same, I like comparing this game to Civ 5. The idea is that you should strive for the stars either diplomatically or martially, so that you more or less become the ruler of the galaxy. Therefore, you do the 4x'es: Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate. You build buildings on your planets, you can terraform them, you can build stations around planets that gather resources or give research points, you can trade or you can go to war, either as the lone wolf or in an alliance. Sounds great, doesn't it? It does. But the problem is the 5th X: The Xecution. Trading is even worse than in Civ 5 where you had trade routes AND instant trade: Here, you don't have trade routes at all. If you remember the ♥♥♥♥-poor trade menu in Civ 5 with the tiny lines you had to click on and thought it was the worst system possible: Think again. Here, you have a similar list structure, that is bigger, but you have to switch tabs between offerings and demands. Also, the AI sometimes doesn't even accept presents, depite being 'friendly'. However, the AI does only do something when it is sure it will be accepted. So the AI builds alliances at staggering speeds, while you have to check every in-game month whether any of the AI would accept an alliance invite. Diplomacy? Feel free to estabish vastly overpowered embassies, ameliorating the standing with the other faction - until you run of of them, as you can maximally have 4 embassies.  Also, remember setting your scout to explore mode in civ 5 and never ever having to manage them again until they either get to the coast or the whole map was explored? Well, be excited by this immersive gameplay decision Stellaris has made: Get ready to manage every very single system survey by hand. Automatic exploration? Nope.  Same goes for contruction ships (the workers in Civ 5). Automation? Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. It's even more tedious as your faction's borders expand with time and planets that you couldn't previously mine become available. So if you have a Chile-Style empire (long and narrow), get ready to check all few years whether you can exploit more systems.  Reaseach is similar: Get ready to select research targets from 3 different sections (Society, Science and Engineering), which is fun until you run out of Scientists and you get a 20% malus on the research speed. The scientists themselves are Leaders: Guys you need to buy for influence because... ? Civ 5 had a similar thing by being able to buy prophets and stuff for faith points, but they were more or less optional. In Stellaris you don't get anywhere without research.  So far, we've established that the diplomacy lacks practically everything needed to be able to be a valuable way to go. Alright. Not what I would have hoped for in a strategy game like this. But then again, war can be entertaining as well, right?  Aaaand nope. It all boils down to the simple rule: Steamroll everything or get steamrolled. Remember in Civ 5, when you were furios about the tremendous defense strength a city had, making it nearly impossible to conquer a city until you had catapults? Well, this time, your planets are about the weakest things in the game. Sure, they can't be conquered in the first few minutes, but as your empire grows, it becomes impossible to defend every single planet. Big fleets are far better, even for defense, which is weird at best. Alliances do a ♥♥♥♥ job of defending you btw, and the (thankfully disablable) empires starting with an advantage either love you or hate you from the first contact and then will steamroll you to death or leave you be. Seriously. You don't even have to give them a reason to attack you. They just do (similar to civ 5). The only problem then is: The AI does only do things when they are sure they can pull it off. So if they declare war and you're in ironman mode, exit the game and start a new one or give them half your empire, just so they can attack you again after the peace period runs out. It basically always is gg.  About the shipdesigning: Well, you design ships. Is cool, but as your fleets will be a blob anyways and you can't see what's going on in fights, you basically just change some stat values.  I personally didn't find the UI too confusing, but I can understand why some do: Too many tabs, too many hidden options and too much scrolling to do without clear indicators that you CAN scroll.  In the end, I'd consider it as a realtime CIV 5 in space without the hidious round times (as it is an RTS), but with every single contra civ 5 had (Really, it seems to me that Paradox had a checklist of all the bad things about CIV 5 to tick) and none of the pros of balance, trading and automations.  I'd say: Pick it up when it's cheaper than 20 bucks, maybe even as a package with the promised DLCs (that should have been in the basegame...) so you get the game it should have been.  Don't buy this barebone for 40 bucks.  TL:DR: Buy it if you LOVED all things that were flawed in CIV 5, don't buy it if you didn't LOVE civ 5. (Liking doesn't seem sufficient to me).  /EDIT: So some patches after, the game hasn't really gotten better. There are still gamebreaking bugs (like inability to leave federations) and the Lategame is basically a stall to any gameplay and yields to doing nothing. You can now research auto-exploration (no, not a default: A research). C'mon man. It's 2016. This game loves micromanaging to much it's literally not fun to play at all if you expect a game and not an excel simulator.",

It has some interesting things to say about the 4x model and correctly approaches the many pitfalls that other games just like it have failed at. In the end it also has a good price-point, which talks to me about the thought put into addressing it's audience.  O.K. The good, the bad and the ugly:  Good: It has intricate depth to almost all aspects of the game. Once you think you have figured something out, you quickly find out that there is much much more. The sound track is REALLY good. The AI does not simply focus on KILL KILL KILL. They act appropriate to their civ traits and tech levels (shocker). It's really a very pretty game.  Bad: The AI that 'auto-designs' your space fleet is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and, until I figured out what was going on, I lost like 4 or 5 games to crazy inferior civs because of it. The UI needs some tweeking (for example: there are moons that you need to click on sometimes that are so small that you have to barely adjust your mouse this way or that in order to click it... very dumb). The tutorial for the game does a farely decent job at addressing the basics like what one interface or another is for, but does nothing for others. Additionally, there are entire aspects of the game that could use SOME sort of information, but has none to offer. In some way this lends to an atmosphere of mystery, but some people would just call this poor game design.  The inbetween: The tech tree is non-existant. In lue of this basic 4x concept the game uses a new and interesting mechanic that the game designers call a sort of semi-random lottery. You draw 3 random techs from the pool of possible techs every time you start a new game or finish researching a technology. It's really interesting to be sure, but semi-frustrating because I have no idea what the technologies are that are possible. My initial frustration was that I couldn't make a plan... like in CIV 5 for example. In Civ 5 I look at the tech tree and look at what resources are available and make a plan that involves my ersearch path and the units I build to take advantage of available materials around my cities. After playin about 15 games now I can tell you that I really like the way Stellaris does this. I'm sure that the developers looked at this and called it a risk, but in the end I think it's something unique... a risk in game design that has payed off.  The ugly: Fleet battles in Stellaris are sure pretty, but unlike a game like Sins of a Solar Empire that absolutely hit the concept of 'Fleet Battles' out of the ♥♥♥♥ing park home-run style... Stellaris really just failed. Once a battle begins you have NO ♥♥♥♥ing control over it what-so-♥♥♥♥ing-ever. You can't, for example, force a singular ship that is being focused by the other fleet to retreat. There is only one ♥♥♥♥ing thing you can ♥♥♥♥-all do once combat begins: force the entire fleet to retreat... and oddly enough there is a random trait that fleet leaders can develop after retreating that disable even that small piece of control. SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. FRUSTRATING.  So all that said I think that if you like games like CIV 5, Gal Civ, Sins or any 4x like that, then you should certainly check this game out. I'm still having a lot of fun with it.",

It doesn't matter if other empires like you, you can't effect them in any meaningful way outside of war.  Build a big fleet, send it to the enemies systems(static defenses don't matter in this game just the biggest fleet wins, always) conquer 5 planets, end war, repeat 100 times, throw in an invasion of aliens outside of the galaxy toward the 'late game' when you're about to quit out of boredom, (which are a moderate annoyance rather than an interesting feature) and that's it - that's the game.  P.S. ethics divergence, species traits, ethos, etc. seem important, and that they might add depth, but they're mostly superficial IMO your empire is on rails to the end. your empire grows or you die.

I'm not very good at explaining games, but I'll give you a little fun story from the game.  So my science ship was surveying this system and, as it turns out, there was an industrial-age era civilization on one of the planets. This was perfect, since I already colonized a planet on a nearby system, so this planet is in my borders. These guys were the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n civilization. I decided to send a construction ship there and build an observation post there so the my scinetists can passively study them.   Fast-forward 10 years, and I'm in the middle of a war with a neighbor who was a xenophobic fanatic spiritualist, so they basically hate me since my empire is fanatic materialist, the opposite of spiritulist. Anyway, right after a huge battle where half of my ships were destroyed, I get an event of a level 4 class asteroid headed towards the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n planet. Normally, I would've sent my ships to destroy the asteroid, but my ships were heavily damaged and there was an enemy navy in a system right next to my home system, so I couldn't just go there and destroy it, because then the enemy would attack the capital. Basically, I watched the asteroid slowly encroach on the doomed planet, and the beautiful, jungle planet became a desolate, barren planet, and also got some rings now, like Saturn's rings.  I just watched an entire civilization disappear like that in front of my eyes and I didn't even do anything. For a few minutes, I felt bad for them. But hey, that's Stellaris, and maybe you'll get an awesome story to tell someone someday.",

But I could not honestly play past 2 hours per session, out of sheer boredom. This review will explain why to all the people who dismiss me as being too attached to EU4.   1. The economy mechanics.  They are boring, nonintuitive, clicky, nondynamic, and simple- in a bad way. The system is based off of buildings you make which give you a flat increase of income a turn. Personally, this '+1 plot' system is not what I expected from Paradox. Paradox has been known for their complex economic systems- Trade in EU4, Production in Victoria and HOI, and feudal taxes in Crusader Kings. Seeing that Stellaris doesn't even have a trade mechanic, which I feel is a lost opportunity here, when dynamic trade nodes would be *such* a great addition to the game. Instead, they decide to completely remove one of the greatest features of a Grand Strategy game in this '4x/Grand Strategy hybrid' under the justification of 'keeping it simple'. I would argue that there is a difference between keeping it simple, and not even including an important mechanic.   2.The warfare mechanics. They are boring, nonintuitive, spamfesty, and carry very little player interaction. 'Designing your own ships' is about as useful or rewarding as adding a paper sticker onto a cup and calling it a 'design'; it has little to no impact on anything, as the game already appears to have the most proficient design ready for you anyway. Not that designs really make a difference either, as the battle is based on sheer numbers; mainly two. Armor, and armor penetration. There is no maneuvering going on here, there is no composition or 'specialization' that is effective here. I cannot heavily comment on this personally, but I do believe that even those who enjoy this game criticise the warfare mechanics.  3. The Diplomacy mechanics. Nonexistant. Besides the cosmetics, the diplomacy mechanics are only *just a tad better* than civilization's. I'll just quote the Wiki on the features:  -Establishing an embassy to improve relations with an AI nation (embassies have no effect in a multiplayer game if established between two human players) -Sending an insult to reduce relations -Offering an alliance (a strong alliance with 4 or more participants may become a Federation) -Offering a trade agreement (trade agreements can include non-aggression pacts, map-sharing, resources, research access, -border access, and migration between nations) -Demanding a weaker AI enemy becomes your vassal -Declaring war -Declaring another nation your rival (resulting in both parties gaining Influence)  Simplistic, alright.  4. DLC Platform  I will never understand how people will conform to companies shoving out such a minimal game and charging full price for it on the grounds that 'they'll fill out the holes with expansions later!'. People should not allow themselves to be continuously abused with DLC containing content that should have been in the base game.  ",

As it is right now, it ends up unplayable sooner or later along the game always. Maybe, with some serious patching, it'll become better.  There is hope. Much of the engine is clear and usable, the groundwork is generally well done, you get a cozy environment in your galaxy with a lot to tweak, options to do more or less of that yourself, many ways to go. The UI gives mixed feelings, some things are very clear but others are just catastrophically stupid, causing dozens of extra clicks for simple matters. A number of bugs will cause a lot of game restarts, with blank windows filling the screen or clicks stopping to register every now and then. The balance of resources feels mostly good, and I'm guessing constantly running out of energy is more due to lack of my gameplay skills. It makes sense to have some lack of resources, so you'll actually need to balance it. Strategy games tend to be too easy in this regard, so I consider this a better option.  The AI. That's where it all falls down. Even if you set the AI to passive, what it means is excessively aggressive. If you get a late game event with really bad guys taking over the galaxy, the AI empires just ignore them and try to fight you twice as hard when you're supposed to be saving the galaxy on your own. There's a lot of other illogicals in the AI behaviour, which simply make the gameplay extremely frustrating. And when I say extremely, I mean 'this monitor's going out the window' level of frustrating. There's just no balance and no sense. It's hard to make it perfect, I've seen that with way too many thousands of hours in strategy games, but this is not 'slightly untweaked', it's a ♥♥♥♥ poor job. Unfortunately.   Give us an easier way to manage all spaceports, give us a more balanced AI and wouldn't be a bad idea to add a beginner friendly difficulty level to get you started at first. The first gameplays ended way too quickly with a massively overwhelming attack by... well, everyone. Make love not war, you know?

But... The game had several mechanics that are foreign to most 4x games I have played. This caused a painful learning curve for me.  After getting through that, which took me a 2 weeks or so, I'm starting to really like this game.  It suffers the issues of most 4x games on release.  Has bugs. Exploitable. Not fully fleshed out.  But it's better than most modern 4xs.  What's better. Maybe sots1 complete. Maybe civ 4 complete. But it's at launch. Totally worth it to wait a few months. I imagine the game will get astoundingly better.  The combat is A lot like sins save I can't give any commands other than retreat. It's not my favorite model but way better than say galactic civ. No instances.   The ship design is a like a mix between sots and gc3. It's simple but because the combat is sins like it works. The level of detail there is functional. There are a lot of hard counters. But defenses can be mixed and matched.  There are some mechanics that are extremely cool. Scientists have traits and these both can change the way they should be used and effect the tech comes.  There is not a tech tree exactly. The tech mechanic used looks like it can be made to be expanded to be different for each race or resource available or a bunch of stuff.  Time will tell there but it looks like it could be dlc.  The game can suffer from forcing a certain style of lag to have the game be fun.  It can be really dull in some cases and a whole lot of fun in others. For me I have to be a bit war hungry to keep the gang interesting. The war aspect feels good to me.  I don't use simply huge armies to roll the target.  The last war I was in I had three and the enemy still slipped a force through and started causing trouble. I like that. All aspects of the game require thought.  Bottom line... it's OK but can get really boring in doing play styles or situations. Finding an enjoyable way to play makes it quite a lot of fun.  And it's going to get better. I would imagine over the next 3 years that this game will be the legendary game I have wanted since moo and mom. ",

            "review_text": "**UPDATE*** So I decided to give the game 100 hours, since I love Paradox, and this game is still trash. I have a killer rig, yet the game gets really sluggish even on medium maps towards late game. It isn't optimized at all. I thought battle mechanics might need just more time on my end...nope...still trash. Forget about trying to do a war if the enemies all get 'Psi Jump' since you will never even have a chance to engage in a fight...even if you outnumber them 100 to 1. This game is just horrible...even Endless Space seems like a AAA title compared to this failure from Paradox.   ---------   Unfortunately I cannot say Stellaris is a good game to try...yet. It has potential, but overall the game is severely (as in, beta type development) lacking in battle mechanics. There is no strategy involved nor can you plan for eventual fighting. There is no espionage, so there is no way of knowing how advanced your foes are, until it is beyond too late. If you lose a war when you are not warleader, you lose completely with no chance of coming back. You will see players on forums talking about interchanging weapon modules and tailoring ships to fight you foes...which sounds good (on a forum only) but never works out that way since, as mentioned, you cannot determine what your foes or even allies have going on.  Don't even get started on allies. Trying to track down their fleet movements is not only a chore, its a game of 'Where's Waldo'.   Paradox has enough experience to know what is an issue with battle mechanics (since that is one of the biggest gripes in every game), but there is absolutely no excuse for the junk they have presented this time. Of course, we know that they plan to sell features later in DLCs, witholding features that actually would help.   This is a complete failure and dissapointment from my favorite dev studio.",

I played with AI aggressiveness on low. After 3 hours of playing suddenly a AI from halfway across the galaxy declares war on me, parks a 5k fleet on top of my planets together with another 3k fleet from another guy that declared on me as well without reason. I wasn't even close to their borders, did not rival them nothing. So my 3k fleet got wiped out without trouble. They take everything and the game is over for me. Lowest difficulty, lowest aggressiveness.  I thought to myself: well maybe it had something to do with my ethics beeing military and xenophobe. So I switched to collectivist and the fanatic scientist ones. After another 3 or 4 hours the same happens to me. I kept to myself and made sure my borders stayed away from other borders as much as possible. I offered most people non aggression pacts. Again without any reason 2 civs join together attack me and I loose. I had several planets all with space ports and the biggest fleet I could get with that number of planets and ressources. They still kicked my ♥♥♥. And I played without the fallen empires or whatever. So they should start at the same level as me.  I would really love to like this game. But so far I played 3 sessions on the lowest difficulty trying different things only to get my teeth kicked in by some AI over hundreds of lightyears even though the AI should not be this aggressive. Especially when there are better and closer targets for them. But nope it seems after 3 hours or so a timer runs out that says: focus down the player.  I can't do hit and run tactic because even if I set it that every empire has the same FTL method their fleets are far faster than mine.   Beeing a noob I am aware that there are several things I am doing wrong and I checked several tutorials and watched other people play. But I just don't want to start another campaign again only to get destroyed by several AIs joining together again after another 3 or 4 hours thus completely wasting the time put into this game.  If the AI would only try to make a vassal or something or just take 1 or 2 of my planets I could rebuild and do other stuff. But no they always want to take absolutely everything. So I can't win the war and if I loose the war the game is just over.  So yeah unless they add a lower difficulty to get to know the game or make 'low AI aggression' actually beeing 'low AI aggression' I will probably not continue playing this game. Which makes me sad because up to the point I get roflstomped for no reason this game is fun. But if I have no idea why I suddenly get declared war on I can't really avoid it.  If you guys have advice I would be glad to hear it.",

Well and its definitely not ck2 in space . Its just a base framework for future addons/dlc's. A bit shallow game.   Early game is really nice   with exploration and early colonization and management, mid game where alliances/federation happens and colony micromanaging and later game which is boring as heck. This game severly lacks proper mid/late game content and 'crisis' is not proper end-game content. Kinda expected too see my neighbour to ally with me to fight againt extraterrestrial alien swarm but nop. He was still angry at me. It would be nice if we could cease fire for the sake of saving the galaxy. While other empire are collapsing to them.  Every AI behaved the same and any pacicift AI was hating me too becasue I was warmongering with my neighbour too much. Diplomacy is unpolished and shallow. Beyond agreements there is nothing else to do, why I can't marry some pretty alien girl or set a no-man-land by comprosis if war takes too long.   Combat system   *visuals* are terrible and in the late game you just stack those fleets and let the disco lights happen. There is no real tactical depth into it.  Also AI allies/vassals tend to follow your main fleet everywhere. AI is not really fleshed out and it was the easiest/cheapest way to make them usefull in the war.    Instead of taking a time and planning your tactics with various generals  from alliances on the galaxy-map,setting up objectives and everyone would know what to do, you have this. Think how fantastic it would be. But nah not even Military Junta government have anything similar to this, yeah goverments are just bunch of raw stat boosts and AI behaviour alterations.   All alien races feel way too *humanoid*  to mee, this game could use more varied gameplay styles like devouring worlds instead of colonizing planets. Also where are robot races? Cyborg races? Its all the same gameplay, only some AIs will colonize more , some less planets.  I won't mention how the game punishes you for having a big population and influence really limits your gameplay. Or several annoyanced like sectors or not-so-good AI. This game also runs on 1 cpu , come one its 2016, you can dream about generating 10k galaxies with 500 AIs in the future with mods.   Game also has some solid problem in the late game with the performance. And how warscore is not so good idea, what if I just want to glass every planet? What If i don't really care about warscores and I want to quickly conquer their empire? I don't really think every race would behave the same, always respecting *some-kind-of-universal-galaxy-law-about-the-warscore*. Klingonds didn't, they fought for the sake of combat and honours and some should fight for the same of domination, afraidness, using the weak-sides.  Right now it looks like this, you conquer 3 planets, 10year peace-period and repeat. Its called a artifical time extender, same goes for surveying systems with your science ship and clicking on every debris manually by shift-click. I can understand in the early-mid but in the late there could be some kind of automatization, there are bigger concerns than clicking on small X all around the galaxy. Less micromanaging in late-game please.     no trade routes ( it would be nice to see small cargo-ships travelling between your systems, it would add a lot the the gameplay mechanics like 'cut the supply lines' )    ^ also no pirates? really? they only happen in 1 event and disappear forever    no espionage    no sabotages    no family tree? really?    no marriages    no sabotages    Good game , had fun but it just feels unfinished . I really dig the random-event and reading lore but there needs to be more of it, especially in the mid/late game.   Its just average game at this moment.   Kinda gets boring after a while.  Maybe after year or two with some decent dlc/updates, this game will get better, well for sure it will get.",

I am not going to go into a million details of what is great (or about the current batch of bugs that shipped with release, which is what most of the reviews I am reading are about – as those will soon be fixed), take a look out there, watch a few youtube videos if this game is of interest, and if $$ is an issue, wait for a sale.

What does it mean? Instead of having control over the war and how it develops you are trapped in this artifficial system which is just prolonging the gameplay in cumbersome way where you have to wage several wars with long breaks in between. This lacks the fluidity and good pace of anotehr 4x titles. Not sure if I would bought the game knowing about the war-truce limited system.

            "review_text": "I put 40 hours into this game within the first week of having it. That's a full work week, but to be fair I was sick...  This is one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of picking up and playing. Once you get your hands on this game it will be extremely difficult to put it down. I've already dedicated 2 full nights to this game and see many more in the future.  Stellaris can be intimidating when you first start playing. I'm a fan of 4x strategy and even I was a little wary of everything going on in this game. The good thing is that Paradox crafted an amazing tutorial that guides you through everything you need to know. I definitely recommend turning the tutorial to full even if you have 4x experience. Don't expect to crush the AI the first time you play either. While the tutorial is great there is so much depth to the game that it takes a few playthroughs to start figuring out your play style and how best to play it.  You start off by selecting your empire. You can choose from a bunch of preset empires or you can craft your own. I definitely suggest crafting your own, it's entertaining and you can really tailor the empire to your needs. A quick tip from me, wormhole is one of the better travel options in my opinion. It’s not a hard concept so don't be off-put by the (advanced players) tag attached to it.  Once you're done fine tuning your empire it's time to choose your 'map/galaxy'. You have different map sizes to choose from, the amount of players/factions (30+). the shape of the map, how many AI get to start off better than you, difficulty, and if you want to play Iron Man (Auto-save only). If you are looking to unlock achievements, then you need to play in Iron Man mode. If you want to use console commands or save whenever to be able to reload and make better decisions, then turn Iron Man off.  Now that you have the game ready to go it is time to start your adventure in an unknown galaxy. You get plopped into a random star system in the galaxy and begin your journey. Your AI robot will pop up and this is where you go full/tips only/none for tutorial. The robot I found to be a wonderful companion, I loved the dialogue and his duty to helping you understand the vastness of everything ahead of you.  You get a home planet, a starting spaceport, a construction ship, a science vessel, and a fleet of 3 corvette ships. You begin by surveying your system, then building another science vessel and surveying some more. In fact, you spend A LOT of time in this game surveying. You need to get out there and discover everything that is amazing and fun. You will run into some very interesting dialogues and quest lines from surveying. It’s important to know everything you can know about everything going on around you.  You also start the process of building and expanding your empire. You build a few mining stations in your system and mining nodes on your home planet to start that cash flow rolling in. There are 2 places you build. Upon the surface of any planets you have colonized, and in the orbit of stars and planets in the systems you explore. You need to find that healthy balance of energy and minerals to keep your empire going.   Influence is another resource you get as well. It is very slow in the early game to accumulate and certain things like alliances will drain your influence even more. It is one of your most valuable resources. You need it to expand your borders, to recruit leaders, and to setup policies and edicts that help your style of play and help you adapt to what’s going on around you.  Your leaders are very important as well. You need them to govern your planets and sectors, to research new technologies, to man your science vessels, and to lead your armies. You start off with a few already but will soon need to recruit more with the influence you have gained. They level up as you use them and gain their own traits as well. They do age and die so they all have expiration dates which means you will always need some influence to recruit more. It's sad when you lose that scientist who hit 5 stars and basically excelled you through years of research by surveying tech in the vastness of space.  As you expand you begin to make contact with your neighbors. If you are lucky you run into more peaceful/tolerable aliens at first. This allows you to initiate the first move. Do you want to take them out or do you want to use them as a potential ally? There is only so much space and everyone is growing so eventually you will have to take someone out to be able to expand more yourself.   With that being said, don't rush into any wars. You need to plan everything out before you launch an all-out assault. Make sure your fleet capacity is at full and you have an attack plan. Also be sure to have enough cash flow to afford the war. You can't fight if you are broke. Be ready for the AI to warp to your home system while you are in the middle of attacking theirs. The AI can be devious like that sometimes. War isn't easy and you spend a lot of time attacking then licking wounds then attacking again.   Your first war is usually the easiest. Lesser techs and less to deal with. Once you get into alliances and federations, you start getting into warfare like you've never seen before. Things get crazy and the wars seem to last forever. You better hope you chose the right allies. My second war I was severely under-powered for and I lost horribly. It was basically game over and time to start fresh again.  This game takes some time to master and you will most likely lose your first few games before you start making head way but you won't care because you will be having fun the entire time.  This game offers a lot of depth and detail and a rich environment to experience it all in. You can easily lose hours upon hours to this game and care less about where the time has gone. If you are a fan of 4x strategy or even if you are playing for the first time, then this is the game for you. It is worth every penny and we still have more content to look forward too.",

            "review_text": "Stellaris is exactly what I wanted in a space game, and it does an excellent job of meshing 4X with Grand Strategy.  What I love most, and expect many love most about the game, is the create your own species which allows you to choose your traits, FTL type (Warp, Hyperlanes and Wormholes), ship look, government type, species ethics, appearance even ship prefix. It will alter your entire game and your playstyle for that game. It's probably what makes Stellaris great to be honest.  After having set up your species and started the game, that initial burst of exploration and expansion is executed almost perfectly. Sending out your science ship to survey and explore other systems isn't just some mindless task of clicking from one system to the next as anomalies and research projects pop up in your situation log. This leads it to be far more immersive than any other 4X space game I know of at the moment, leading to weird and sometimes exciting events such as a brand of ultra-reactionary religious quacks breaking off from your empire to take a stand against your purging policy. Or your scientists finding a ceramic pot drifting around a sun that they just.. Can't explain. All this means that exploration isn't just 'oh. a planet to colonise, great. NEXT SYSTEM.'   The land grab stage is also done incredibly well as you aim to cut off your opponents in a desperate grab for planets and minerals. Establishing frontier outposts and desperately trying to build colony ships in order to expand your borders. But make no mistake, there is no need for you to grab as much as you can. I've been three times the size of the AI and they've STILL had superior tech and equivelant fleet power/capacity to me. It's possible to build not just wide, but tall and that's done so well in the this game, in comparison to other games such as Sins of a Solar Empire where it's alllllll about the wide.   Colonising is a relatively simple affair of sending your colony ship to X habitable planet, then settling there, waiting a year or two for it to be established and then bam, you have your colony; planets however aren't just things that set down borders, they'll be your main income for science/minerals/energy if you min/max one or the other. Every planet has a planet surface tab, which is divided into multiple squares consisting of as little as 5 up to 25 and this is where it starts to look a bit like Civ. Each tile has a natural resource within it which can either be exploited or ignored and built over to provide a different resource, in order to harvest said resource the tile requires an active pop be living on it; which are grown through the amount of food you have (Currently there is no point to having a surplus of food on a fully popped planet). Pops can be resettled between different planets within your core sector allowing you to keep your eithical bloodline pure.  Now, many 4X games descend into tedious micro-management of -every- planet and system that you own, which obviously a lot of people aren't all that in to. Some like spreadsheets, some don't. Stellaris attempts to alleviate this with something I've not seen in other space games as of yet, it allows you to break up your empire into 'sectors', the number of sectors allowed is based on your population and planets owned. This sector is essentially an AI which will manage and govern the area you portion out to it. You can choose to assign each sector a governor who will convey specific bonuses to the entire sector. The sector doesn't just micromanage the planets though; you can allow it to redevelopment tiles on planets, and set it a specific function; such as military, minerals, research or credits. The sector AI will then attempt to do it's utmost best to supply as much of the chosen function as possible, except for military sector AI who will build military stations and strengthen their borders with space-station defenses, defending armies, etc. A lot of people have moaned that the sector AI seems woefully incompetent and doesn't really seem able to balance itself out; now this is incorrect, at the start you may notice that it is minus on energy credits for a while, this is because it doesn't have it's planets infrastructures built yet; simply pour minerals and energy into it and you'll see it even out, and eventually it'll even surpass itself. I've been provided with up to 400+ minerals by my sectors alone at times. They really do become incredibly good.  As time goes by it starts to morph into a GSG more than a 4X game, with an emphasis on war and diplomacy. They're not as fleshed out as a lot of people were hoping for. I was expecting what we got since I read all the DD's and didn't expect anything more. War is a very set in stone thing. You declare war for specific wargoals such as cede X planet, and liberate X planets. Then it's simply a march to your wargoal (gained through winning batles, capturing planets, etc). 90% of the time the AI will surrender and hand it over to you should you be utterly stomping them. If they're winning however, they will go on winning unless you surrender and give them your systems. This is a rather brutal AI in that respect. Many however have complained that the AI seems overly passive, and while this can be the case it's more luck of the draw and power than anything. They'll only go to war with someone they're superior over, which is just basic sense really isn't it.. And they're less/more likely to go to war based on their ethics and government aswell.  Diplomacy does need some work as it's rather basic right now, reminds me a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire with how basic it is, but I expect expansions and future content to change this. It's a relatively simple affair of alliance, rivalry, star charts. Trading is simply energy credits or minerals in an instant transfer or monthly. It's lacking basically, but it's more than sufficient for the game at current. Alliance blocks can turn into federations, with one nation that leads them which switches out every 5-10 years to a different nation.  Research and tech. Boy, did they outdo themselves with this one. This deck-of-cards research system is simply amazing. I've found tech in some games I didn't know existed, only to never see it ever again in any other game. Basically it's split into three categories; physics, society and engineering. And within each category you'll get 3 techs to choose from, you pick one, research it, and when you go back to picking 3 again, it'll have shuffled and present all new options. Some are weighted to appear simply so you can advance in the game, such as colony ships, and spaceport upgrades, which makes sense otherwise you could get shafted hard. If your science ship surveys debris and finds certain tech then it will appear as a permanent tech option, below the normal three, that you can pick regardless of how many different techs you research.  Overall, this is the game I've been waiting years for. It's exactly what I wanted in a Space 4X game, and it's growth into a GSG over time is well executed as it turns more to war/diplomacy. I want to note that this game isn't missing any features, it's just not fleshed out certain ones enough. Such as diplomacy, trade and managing factions. All of which are pretty basic right now, but that's to be expected when you think of the sheer scale this game has gone for. I'm all too happy to pay PDS money for DLC since I know that when they bring out expansion, it's actually an expansion for the game. I'm confident they'll continue to polish and add to this game for years and years to come just as they have for all their other titles/series: Victoria, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis'  Sorry if I missed anything, the games just got so many features and so much content, I'm sure I did miss something but hell, there's almost too much to write about! xD",

However I can comfortably say that even though this game is pretty expensive considering some alternative stragegy games are cheaper, that I am happy that I spent the money because not only does it have great gameplay and an amazing 'make your own' desicion style to it. But the replay Factor is absolutely unreal.  The fact that the game developers have gone out of their way and put an intense amount of detail in it, from the name of almost every planet known to man, to the actual science behind some of the missions. It's not like a fantasy game where something illogical happens and someone says 'a wizard did it' but it comes up with the idea that an unkown ancient being(s) that came billions of years before man, created and developed a power to enable then to travel around star sytems and create an empire.  The reason it is so replayable, much like Civilization, is because at any given moment anything can happen. For example, my playthrough showed that even if you have the strongest empire in the whole galaxy, there will be some force out there that can destroy you in an instant.   What I would really love to see with this game, is not from the developers, but from the small content creaters and modders. I think this game is the ideal canvas for a Mass Effect mod. I have been looking through the workshop and over the depths of the internet and have encountered many different people trying to accomplish this. If just one of them was to pull it off like the mods of Sins of a Solar Empire, then this game would be perfect for me and anyone else who is fan of the Mass effect trilogy and a fan of strategy games. Plus you can go for the same story as Mass Effect, but change it a bit so that the story of Mass Effect ends how you would want it to.  Over all this game is amazing, it has a long way to go, and hopefully the developers will work their arses off for this project. It's already an amazing game and I want to see how good it can get.  9/10-One of the best games Iv'e ever played, immersive, realistic, lore allows for fun roleplay.",

Tech tree is not your typical tech tree, where it gives you a list or path of techs you can get. It gives you an option of 3 or 4 tech options to choose from, based on your government set up in the beginning of the game and what you've already researched. This means that upgrading to better ships is not an easy task, unless you do some research on google, chances of getting better ships is trial and error. 2.) There's no real trading. Meaning you don't collect certain valuable resources that can be traded for favors. There are no trading zones or lanes, no trading buildings or vessels. Trade seems to be a huge advantage in these types of games and this game lacks it. 3.)  Combat is a little ridiculous. You have the option to make a ton of 'fleets' but you might as well meld them into 1 giant fleet and try dominating other planets. The animation has them swarming around each other, but that's not very realistic combat in space. You can't exactly do tactical movements and the game doesn't tactically put important ships in the back with fodder in the front, because when you attack another fleet it's just 1 large swarm of missiles, lasers and projectiles. Sins of a Solar Empire has much better fleet/battle mechanics 4.) Once you get to a certain point where you make insanely large amounts of social influence, energy credits and minerals, the game is just sort of click and play, the most you have to do is micromanage random factions that appear in your worlds. 5.)  There is no esponiage. You'd think espionage would be a big part of a space game, park your stealth ship in orbit in another's empire, learn their movements, important travel lanes, economy and sense of political stability/instability so you can attack them at the right time or place. There's none of that. 6.) A few aspects of the enemy AI. I have yet to be majorly attacked by them, even after openly declaring total war with the intent of subjugating few and purging the rest. A few skirmishes, but I have yet to have a full on war with another empire that took all of my attention and focus. I'm guessing that if you chose hard mode, war becomes impossible with them because you'll lose, not sure if true or not because i've only been playing mid difficulty.  That's all I really have on it. For the price, I'd pay for something else, but if you don't care about money and need to throw away some time I'd get it.",

You are always looking out for a good planet to colonize and you try to get any bonus by investigating every anomaly. There are many different anomalies out there, but not enough for a second game session or for a long game on a big map.  When you overcome all the other equal starting empires, there is no real threat (except for some special events), because the ancient empires are passive and you can engage them, when you are really ready to fight them.  Also the K.I. is really bad in wars. Allied empires only support you. They don't really try to make any own moves, they only follow your fleet. The Battles look great in the early game, when your fleets are small. But when the fleets get bigger, the game will stutter. No matter how good your PC is, at some point your game will stutter.  During war you don't have many possibilities, you only have the decisions to send your ships in the right moment in. Everything else is decided by your ship layout and amount of ships. I also had many really nasty bugs. For example my main fleet engaged the enemy main fleet, but they were both too far away from each other to shoot at each other. So nothing happened. I was only able to send in new fleets from behind to engage them. Luckily I was strong enough to build up a fleet which was able to destroy the enemy fleet. Really this was the worst bug ever.

Everybody said Endless Legend was better than Endless Space, so I went with that. People said Civ BE was a poor man's Civ5... in space, so I skipped it. I bought Space Empires V, but just couldn't get into it. Sins of a Solar Empire is the only I can think of that I've really put any time into. Then along comes Stellaris...  Like space themed 4x games, grand strategy is another genre I long felt I should be in love with, yet for years every attempt I made to tackle the genre was an effort in futility until I came across Crusader Kings II. Paradox knows how to make a map and spreadsheets immerse you in another universe like nobody else.   Stellaris is Paradox's first escape from real, Earthly history, as well as their first 4x game. It has the best tutorial of any Paradox game thus far, and since it's a 4x and everyone starts out small, it lets you take baby steps into the more complicated aspects of grand strategy.   I begun my journey as a fungoid race of fanatic spiritualist collectivists run by divine mandate. In other words, they're a new age mushroom cult dedicated to enslaving everyone through psychedelic mind control. I only have 3 races of slaves, though. All neolithic primitives discovered on planets I colonized. I decided that I would expand peacefully for as long as possible, and as of writing this review I'm finally surrounded on all sides with no colonizable planets left to conquer save one right on the border of a fallen empire, which means I'd be in big trouble if I tried to take it.  This early game phase has been phenomenal. Despite not waging a single war or forming a single alliance, I have a vast empire with multiple uplifted and integrated species. Of the 3 I integrated without enslaving, 1 I even managed to genetically modify into happy and obedient worker bees. Who needs slavery when they WANT to be your peasant? Unfortunately our experimentation with genetics has also led a sect of my own people to modify themselves into a master race that are beginning to raise a stir. Will I be able to start waging war on my neighbors without these 'ultra' beings revolting? Will I be able to enslave all that surround me without drawing the ire of the fallen empire bordering me to the north, or will I have to reform my government and start making friends? Only the next 20 hours will tell.",

(e.g. It's not clear at first glance that placing a building on a tile on a planet surface will replace certain yields depending on the type of building until after you commit to clicking the 'Build' button at which point the game tells you that building this building will replace the following yields). You're given the option to confirm, but a better means of communicating what the final yields would be for a tile given a certain building before clicking the Build button would be most welcome.  - Cannot queue up ships or constructions to be built if you lack the resources to build them right now. This forces you to remember to build the thing you want to build later once the necessary resources are available. For instance, if you only have 50 minerals, you can't queue up a fleet of ships and have them be built as the resources come in; instead you must tend to the shipyard and build new ships as your resources come in manually.  Verdict:  Must Buy   Any shortcomings or minor nuances that may bug you about this game will most likely be addressed in later patches given the developer's track record. In the game's current state you will still be rewarded with hours of enjoyment until then. And after the patches and DLCs come out, you'll get even more.

There's already tons of great reviews detailing all the aspects of the game so I'm going to talk about the stuff you don't hear about much.  First there's three different types of faster-than-light travel. You can set the game where you can play with any of the three. Or lock it so that there is only one kind. Each form of travel requires different tactics.   Second there's lots of little nuggets in this game from migrating giant trees. Anoying aliens that need your help and then start to need your help way too much. Precursor civilizations to discover. Pre sentience to uplift. Pre FTL races to conquer or to help.  Third there's tons more to talk about but frankly I'd rather stop writing this review and go play Stellaris.......  I have a feeling I'm going to be playing this game for a long time money well spent.   At 150 hours of Play time I started a new game with a new race I created the Darzine Collective. An insectoid race Fanatical Collective and Militant. Think the Borg combined with the Bugs from Starship Troopers. They were Rapid Breeders (fast growth) and Very Adaptive. I ignored diplomacy, I ignored Tech building (researching or building them). I invaded Pre-warp races home worlds (1 machine age, 1 bronze age) Exterminating one and Enslaving another (within the first 50 turns of the game…). I was always technologically behind but always had bigger fleets that were very…. Replaceable. After battle I could scan the debris of battle to learn my enemies secretes. Stellaris is flexible enough that I could do this and get away with it. Victory was Sweet.  At 195 hours, I thought I was getting bored but then I discovered The Star Trek mod.

The traits system gives a certain spice to the game and help the immersion. It makes it possible to create custom species for use of the players and also the generation of random opponents.

Early exploration, trying to get the economy going, potentially fighting off (stronger) neighboring empires. And there's nothing like watching your proud fleet being decimated to nothing by a supposedly weaker neighbor, just because you didn't invest in shields against their mighty energy weapons.  Now, there's still some bad. As others have noted, the game bogs down after a few hours. Once you have expanded, sectors are the key to keep micro-management to a minimum. However, those have got to be tweaked through patches... as there is still plenty of micro-management going on:   - You can't assign ships to these sectors, so you have to hope that they create their own construction ships.  - That means that you need to build up multiple fleets and have to manually patrol them. While you can your fleet to be aggressive and basically attack any enemy station of ship in the same system, it would help if you could also designate a defensive fleet patrolling a sector.  - Collecting debris after battles is a nightmare.  - Assembling fleets is tedious if you want to spread it out across your empire. It would be better if you could design your fleets and then the various space ports in your empire start producing the required ships as needed and sending them to their rendezvous point.

It's so simple it hurts. Declare war, trade resources, declare rivalry, insult them. Just that. As for the casus belli for war, currently the choices are very limited. Giving only 3 choices; cede planet, vassalize, or liberate some of their planets.  The only part I definitely love playing is the early-game stage, you'd be surprised at what events the game will throw at you when you start to explore the galaxy.   The mid-game? It's your average Europa Universalis IV, but imagine it without any DLC. Yeah, that's it. Here's what you do during mid-game: -Build ships. -Wait for your tech research to complete. -Upgrade your ships with the latest weapons you acquired from research. -Declare war.  Rinse and repeat, since there's no other thing except warring other states to 'win' this game.  Late-game stage is bugged. Foreign invaders? Sure thing, the AI doesn't even fight them! Except for Fallen Empires, that is. I still remember when the Unbidden appears, it only gave opinion bonus to all AI states, making them forming federation here and there. But because of that federation, they won't declare war to each other since they're locking each other. That creates a horribly static galaxy which nothing happens, even when Unbidden starts swallowing those states, they don't do anything!  Then again, it's not like I hate this game or something, but currently it feels like an incomplete game.

There are flaws in the design, but Paradox seems to be addressing those pretty quickly.  There are some complaints about the ship design having no impact. Yes, the tactical combat can become something of a slugfest early on. But by mid-game having a balanced fleet can really impact your battles. Make some heavily shielded/armored ships with short range weapons to act as tank, use some point defence ships to stop missles, build some bigger snipe type ships for the rear. These can make a significant difference in combat. Paradox has addressed some of these concerns in the latest patch, extending the range of weapons causing the ships to stand off more during combat.  Also, they addressed the empire management so that the AI governors more closely do what you expect of them.  There's some more work to do, but the scope of this game is amazing. It's definetely a huge step in the pausable RTS, 4X generation. There's tons of races, tons of techs, and amazing graphics.

At launch i found no problems, the game ran so smooth even on my Potatoe. Combat is just stellar to watch, flashing light, colors, and majestic ships flying about in a dance to the death. Creating your own race to rule the stars, Have a 110 year old Mushroom control the fate of his people. The game is wow, and after looking through the negative reviews, all i see is comparisons to other games. The main comparisons are Crusader kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4, Claiming both games have significantly more deapth. My question to them is, how much depth did either game have at release compared to this game? Stellaris release with so much content and the dev already outlined the major concerns the community has. Depth was added to CK2 and EU4, Stellaris has some depth and will only get more with time.Mostly everyone who reviewed it on its own merits gave it positive reviews. The question comes down to would you recommend this game? If you want to subjegate humans, be annihalated by parrots, or form a alliance consisting only of reptiles and call it the COLD BLOODED COALITION....Then start a COLD WAR....Then don't hesitate to pick up the game. If you don't like 4X or Grand stradegy, probably not the game for you, but i say give it a shot. This game is good and will likely stand on its own for a LOOOOOOOONG Time",

            "review_text": "So, after a few too many hours lately I decded to add another positive (yet partially mixed) review.  Short Version:  It depends on 'what you expect' vs. 'what you get' if you rate a game. I most certainly got what I expected. Long sessions, innovative new research and diverse races without managing every single planet in mid-to-endgame.  Longer story:  The game presents itself as a mixture of 4X and Grand Stategy Games. The latter being the ones Paradox is famous for. Owning quite some PDX games I knew what to expect. The early game focuses on exploration, research and micromanagement while in midgame it transcends to alliance forging and stabilizing your place in galactic history. Lategame consits of pretty much war waging all over the galaxy with some surprises consisting of extragalactic threats.  The tools you need are there: Ship Designer, diplomacy with (basic) trading, large scale warfare, planetary management, internal policies and politics, nice race designer to fit your needs and wants you to try out those pacifistic, tree hugging spiritualists vs the xenophibic, militaristic despotism.   That said, the downside is that some things aren't fleshed totally out. Knowing PDX, I'm confident (more likely 100% sure that is) they will add new features by patches and ultimatley larger game-changing mechanics as DLCs.  For example, while diplomacy contains everything you see e.g. in CIV5 it lacks the depth of an EU4. Or the battles, where fleet composition and tech matters, but I'd like some more tactical options (fleet formations, battlegroups, the like) to turn the tide of battle against and overwhelming foe.  The ingame tutorial is sufficent (imho) and tells you what to do, sometimes why you should do it. Tooltips present the other half of the information you need. Some convience-options are missing (e.g. a list of uncolonized planets would be nice...)  All in all, I think Stellaris in it's current state is a very good and stable game (haven't had any issues yet). Very much worth the money and a great platform for upcoming features (e.g. espionage).  Get it if you like to play 4X games from a different perspective. If you're unsure, check youtube for let's play and developer videos.  P.S.: Get some info about the game mechanics first. Most of them are there for a reason and have pretty much proven themselfes in other PDX titles like warscore (which may be quite unfamiliar to some).",

            "review_text": "Stellaris is not perfect. The UI is still, even after a few patches, a bit clunky for someone who hasn't weaned themselves on an earlier Paradox title to get used to. The AI is not terribly bright, particularly when it comes to moving fleets. Victory is achieved exclusively through military hegemony: you either make every starfaring race your vassals, wipe them out, or claim the majority of the habitable worlds in the galaxy.   Despite its flaws, Stellaris is still a lot of fun to play, and has a lot of room to grow. Paradox have brought together some of my favorite features from other games, both from other 4X space games and Paradox's other titles. Its diplomacy system is very similar to the one in Europa Universalis. It has a first contact system that is very reminiscent of the one in Sword of the Stars, where you can never be certain if an unknown alien ship is going to be hostile or not. Stellaris also has Grand Menaces that can really shake up a stagnant late game, much like Sword of the Stars. The ability (and in fact it is necessary once your empire starts to really grow) to automate 'sectors' under the rule of leader characters also gives the game a tiny bit of a Crusader Kings 2 vibe, especially when those sectors begin to get unruly.  By far my favorite part of Stellaris, and what truly sets it apart from other entries in the genre, is how I end up talking about it. I won't tell someone about how I couldn't win a war until after I advanced my ground combat tech; I'll tell them about how my squishy fungus people were so miserable at ground-fighting that I had to develop artificial intelligence and build legions of droid soldiers to fight my wars for me. I won't tell someone that robotics technologies let you construct pops that don't have penalties on worlds that your species can barely inhabit; I'll talk about how the advent of independent robots allowed my empire to colonize and exploit worlds that were beyond our abilities before, as we seeded entire worlds with billions of AI-controlled robots to mine worlds with prohibitively harsh climates. I won't say that I lost the game because my reliance on AI techs meant that an event triggering an AI rebellion was beyond my means to put down. I'll tell people that I reached too far, grasped for too much, and ultimately built the steel boots that would be at my neck.  Stellaris is not a perfect game, but it oozes potential, and Paradox has proven in the past that given time, patches, and DLC, they can deliver on that potential. I'd understand if you didn't buy Stellaris now, but at the very least it belongs on your wishlist, because this is a game to keep an eye on.",

            "review_text": "Stellaris has a different approach to 4x space games, and some of the design choices are great and I really feel like they could change the entire scope of the genre forever, for the better, but some of the design choices fall utterly flat. This was an experiment, both for a company that has never done 4x before and for a genre that has not fully realized its own potential yet. I recommend that people play the game, but I cannot in good faith recommend that someone spends money on this game at this time (unless you are already a huge 4x space and sci-fi fan).   A quick run-down on what this game is. Its a 4x space game, with all the elements you would expect from the genre.  What it does well:  - Tons of random events, a focus on exploration, events tied into research etc.  - Good diplomacy, with AI empires reacting dynamically to you - A novel attempt to limit the amount of micromanagement. It comes at a good time in the game, and without giving control over to the AI it would bog the game down in boring base building.  - Dynamic civics that actually matter - great role-play ability - some deep and dynamic gameplay elements  What it does poorly: - Bad boring combat - Bad sound design (stuff sounds dumb I want future weapons to sound cool, not like someone jumped on a trampoline, the soundtrack is terrible and super repetitive) - Communicating some gameplay elements to the player (the game flat out never tells you things that can ruin your playthrough if you are not aware of them) - Base building is boring, flat, not dynamic.  - Terrible ship design - Lack of galaxy variety/custom galaxies  - The literally worst victory condition, ever.   As I said, Stellaris tries to do things differently. They try to focus on exploration, but lack any incentive to mid-late game exploration (but it does add tedium) and lack almost any art assets associated with exploration. They try to make research more random and uneven between empires with research cards, which flops compared to having just a standard tech tree with % to unlock. But the biggest sin this game commits, its biggest failure and what makes me not recommend the game right now, is the victory conditions. There is only one way to win, and that is to conquer the galaxy, and there are no alternate objectives. Does not matter if you forge alliances with all other spieces and bring peace, does not matter if you finally replace all your empire's filthy organic citizens with nice clean synthetic lifeforms, you must conquer, with your military, every other empire in the galaxy. This is just insane in a game that offers so many options, to then just shuttle you down a single tight and frankly the most boring path of the game in order to win.   And this is an easy fix, either remove victory conditions entirely and embrace the sandbox or just allow players to set custom victory conditions like research a specific technology, reach a certain % population of a species, eliminate slavery in the galaxy, or ALLOW ALLIED VICTORY. The rest of the problems with the game simply come down to 'finish the half-baked pieces of your game', which based off of the company's history and their stated plans for this game, they will do through DLC.  And btw, I know that someone will say 'just do your own victory conditions on your own', to which I say, 'this is a video game, it is literally the developers job, they decided to have an ending for this game and that ending sucks and has an impact'.  PS Achievements are completely broken in this game for most people, they simply never register or work. Does not matter to me, but I know some people care about that sort of thing so I thought I would do you the service.",

Afterwhich, you'll start to think that maybe this wasn't the best buy, because there is a kind of repetitive dryness to the game that I can't quite put my finger on. There isn't much in the way of complex AI, trading, diplomacy, or battle mechanics. It seems like the AI will engage in what is largely the same type of 'camp-then-mass attack' tactics as a bad TW game.  And in response you will attempt to do basically the same, building enough of what you need (which isn't diverse or complex enough to be sustainably interesting), then attempting to blitz the opposing sectors. And you will rinse and repeat that process until you have, after many dry hours, taken over enough to the galaxy to win.  The game, in the longer run, leaves much to be desired.",

But this game just isn’t ready yet.  There are several new and original ideas, like edics (political decision) and factions (political organizations of discontent citizens), individual ethics (political preferences of each single population) and fun government types, like you would expect from paradox’ rich and fruitful strategy experience. But the fact that any cool empire management feature (edicts, allicances, planetary programs, border expansion, faction management, government decisions, leaders and governors, even certain buildings and moving population around) requires “influence”, by far the most valuable resource, effectively takes all of this out of the game, since you are always trying to save your points and do without.  Sound and graphics are from 10-15 years ago, surely not as important in a strategy game, but in this case made so lackluster and dull, it hurts the gaming experience. At least an animated landing of a colony ship should have made it into the budget. What you get is a stamp-size picture with the graphics quality of a steam achievement.   The menu is intricate and counterintuitive. You have a colony ship and want to see a list of possible planets? Not possible. You are on the star chart and want to click on your colony directly? Not possible. You are on a planet and want to switch though to the next? Not possible. You always have to click all the way up, all the way down. To put something on a building list requires all the resources immediately, which you can never afford. So no building lists either. Click, click, click. The game should come with an extra mouse, for wear and tear reasons.  The entire gaming experience feels like an Early Access. There are just so many things that remain unfinished and incomplete, it seems that the developers have first and foremost spent their creativity on one question: what else of the things you would normally expect from a 4x space game (and that was already there as early as Master of Orion 2) can we take out of the game to later sell it to the players as DLC?     Victory conditions? YES, take it out!    Tactical Battles? YES, take it out!    Diversified troops? YES, take it out!    Galactic Senate? YES, take it out!    Capturing Ships? YES, take it out!    Espionage? YES, take it out!    Forceful Diplomacy? YES, take it out!    Planet view? YES, take it out!    Cool Graphics? YES, take it out!

Very good depth, with added late game events with the leviathan dlc. Also 'super power' fallen empires that you can team up with, or gang up with other AI to beat them.  Challenging enough that turtling alone is not enough. The game forces you to alliances and diplomacy decisions. If you just turtle on one corner, chances are, other empires might gang up on you.  Variations on your gameplay and AI, different ethics have different approaches.  You have few win conditions, but it's basically open ended. End it the way you want to.  ",

There are still lots of parts of the game that feel like they could be fleshed out more (ideologies and the mid game), but Paradox has been focusing huge amounts of resources on this and as long as the mechanics continue to work there is a solid foundation for improvement in the next 12-16 months.

            "review_text": "So, I’m liking the game but I am unsure if it is my love for this style of game or the game itself I’m loving. I can say I feel there were a few missed opportunities. I’m a huge fan of CK2 and Imperium Galactica 2 (oh how I was hoping for a worthy successor). I am enjoying the game thought so please don’t be discouraged. Paradox has a record of improving games with mods/patches/DLC and stand by their titles. So I’m not overly worried.  Stellaris offers what many of us have been missing in that it is real time 4x space strategy game. Finally no more “end turn” right? Freely customizable race, easy modding, and a nice arrangement of traits/characteristics allow for replay ability. Keep an eye out for mods in workshop though as they will probably be able to take the vanilla game further in its current state.  Diplomacy could use some work. Coming from an experience like CK2 where there is such a detailed level of advisors, intrigue, relationships, etc.… you will be underwhelmed by the diplomacy. Like no joke, there’s not much to it…   Planets… So I am not sure if I am for or against this rather dated style of planet/colony management. It reminds me of Master of Orion where planets have tiles which can be modified to produce a resource based off the building. It works for the game so I have no real complaints on it, just seems like an old mechanic that we have seen before. Something I’m not too fond of is the planet control system and how your kind a forced to give up control of your systems to a governor after you a mass a few colonies. I suppose if there was more interaction or even the feeling that I was handing over my territory to someone of value it wouldn’t be so bad. However, it feels quite static. Made me miss CK2 and long for those intriguing back stabbing plots to break away or declare independence from my rule. There is little you can do to control how you want your sectors run and leaders again are quite static. Not to mention limited in availability. Don’t expect to have scientist, generals, admirals, and leaders everywhere or even in all the above areas.  So combat is indeed 4x, but doesn’t really feel like it. More or less move one fleet onto an enemy fleet and they swarm around firing. No direct player control. Again, not a complaint, it works. And the UI window on battles during and after offers more details to help redesign your ships versus CK2 UI. Sadly I feel the 4x component is wasted in this though…  Overall the game is very vanilla, like not even vanilla bean, or vanilla with sprinkles….it’s just vanilla. However, mods and time will tell if Paradox adds to it and brings us the enjoyment we have seen in other titles (CK2) (I mention CK2 because I’d so die happy for a CK2 in space type game). I am enjoying it though and have already logged many hours since its release here.   I will leave you with this thought… Recall back to the early days of CK2 and how it was at first launch, or even some other titles… I’m just looking towards the future and ready to reach for my pocket book for the plethora of DLC to come. :) ",

My brethren followed while I led them on a noble quest to scan our local planets (The heck - I didn't see Pluto...WHERE DID PLUTO GO?!). From there I scanned local star systems, and settled some of the scruffier humans (They claimed they were 'Individualists' - but look...showers were invented for a reason people...) on distant worlds.   In an inspired moment I promptly declared war on some local gang of rednecks claiming to be a Fallen Empire. I think it went well, I mean it did offer our scientists a nice close up view of a death ray, which really helped our theoreticians...  Errr..yeah don't do that. Anyway this game really sucks you in, I had just bought DOOM and it's just been gathering the digital equivalent of dust once I started playing this. I like how leaders (scientists, fleet admirals, planetary governors, generals) actually age – and die (make sure you keep some influence in reserve to buy new ones).   The way the game handles tech is...different. There isn't so much as a tech tree as a choice of semi random technologies to pursue. This can be a little frustrating when a tech you didn't choose to research in the past doesn't show up again. Certainly makes you think about tech choices in a different light. As my empire grows I am beginning to see how managing a larger and larger empire takes more and more time, although I suppose this is true in most 4x games.

For the new player: Stellaris plays much like civilization in space including the dreaded 'just-one-more-turn-phenomenon'.  Features: Exploration, expansion, extermination (optional) or cultural/diplomatic win. Different ethics highly change your playstyle e.g. with xenophobe you only get mean first contact hails to select. In democracies the boss is selected among your leaders which mixes your staff around and so on. Context sensitive random event and crisis system, large scale galactic threat events. You can add planets to sectors under AI control so you don't have to micromanage your large empire. Indeed you have a cap for solitary planets. Game is highly modable. Space looks nice. No performance problems or crashes for me.  -minor bad things- There's an extensive tutorial but many conccepts are still cloudy (on the other hand there's also a wiki built-in) Some UI bugs and fighting with the controls and finding infos. Try to uplift a species for example. Pause is your friend here. If you play a lot events become repetative but more will be added later I guess. It could be even weirder but then I'm also reading Rhodan so take that with a grain of salt.  -mixed feelings- Games really depend on your neighbors and where you start as you're never far ahead in the tech/power race in this game even in 'normal'. If you want achievements you'll have to play ironman (only one autosave slot). Death and ruin can come quickly in space. You will take losses of beloved admirals and beautiful worlds. I personally rage quit after an 'ally' snatched a key planet away with a colony ship only 3 seconds ahead of my own colony ship. My best admiral started taking drugs then died ahead of her time.

I was always interested in Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis, but could never get into them. This game does an incredible job of being accessible without sacrificing depth. The early game starts off simple and manageable, and it keeps throwing new systems at you but at a sustainable pace. It also has a fantastic tutorial built in that provides context-sensitive guidance, giving you suggestions on what to do next when appropriate but never limiting you and always ready to explain something you might discover 'out of sequence'. Even if this game doesn't become the gold-standard for 4x, it should become the gold standard for tutorials. Which is kind of a shocking thing to say about a Paradox game.  Heartily recommend.",

Problem is, I found stellaris while waiting for MOOCTS to become less buggy, and more like MOO2..... and it turns out stellaris everything I've looking for in a 4X space game and more.   A Few Things:  The game gives you the feel of actually exploring out from your solar system. Surveying feels meaningful and enjoyable with storyline elements and technlogies introduced from discoveries.   The choices you make in creating a race have a definite effect on how your empire will grow and what problems you will encounter in your growth.  Space battles are enjoyable and actually performed in the same solar system view, in real time, as your empire management. No clunky transition or other players having to wait. Balance of the ship weapons and attributes could be adjusted a bit but I have no real suggestions on how to addequately do so.  Technology research feels meaningful, having standard, rare, reverse engineered, and dangerous technologies to choose from, each with there intrinsic benefits and risks is new to me. Technologies seem to impact game mechanics enough to really try and research and aquire/level-up scientists.  Having leaders, governors, admirals, and generals is a nice throwback to MOO2. Their benefits, stats, and effects on gameplay make them important and valuable... and dissappointing when they die of old age.  AI is enjoyable but could use some work. There are a few quirks that I'm sure are not attributed to be a race actually being programmed to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of these quirks happen to be odd behavior and responses when trading/treaties/etc., a few others are in the actual war goals management and/or the behavior of attacking fleets during wartime. These minor AI issues do not reduce the enjoyment of the game enough not to buy it though.   Buy it. Enjoy it. Enough said.",

The learning curve is gradual, as opposed to other Paradox titles where you tend to jump into the deep end of the pool right away, which can be discouraging for some gamers (though rewarding if you stick to it: looking at you CK2). Your stellar empire awaits expansion, as long as you can balance diplomacy, resource collection, military buildup, and science. This game makes it easier than it sounds.  The most exciting thing about this game is the potential that it represents. Upon launch it is a stable and enjoyable 4x game in the vein of Master of Orion. Indeed, Stellaris is already, upon basic release, near the threshold of usurpuing the title of the true successor of MOO (even while Wargaming works on their shot at an MOO successeor); all it will take is one or two DLC and the mod community, which I know is already hard at work, to transform this game into something really special. The MOO crown is within reach.   I'm playing vanilla right now and having a blast, but I truly can't wait for what is in store.   The game right now: 8/10.

(Without getting military access to space that lies inbetween you, the devs have stated they are working on this.) -Mediocre Ai that are great in some areas and terrible in others. (Ai are also too passive in some situations and highly predictable from a diplomatic POV.) -Lack of any form of major diplomatic UI such as color coding alliances, Ai's opinion of other factions, ect. -Too few victory conditions? (This is more my personal opinion, just look at how many ways you can win in Civ) -Lack of internal/external trading.  There are certainly a few more, but I believe these are the major points.   All in all, I've put nearly 60 hours into a game that was released just under 2 weeks ago. The UI is pretty good in most areas, and it was surprisingly easy to pick up when compared to Paradox's other games.

The gameplay itself captures quiet solitude and shattering revelation. This game plays like the best episodes of Star Trek, the ones that make you feel quiet and small at the end. Every time you feel big and in control, you discover something new to make you feel insignificant again.  The game isn't perfect. It feels like the living project it is. It will get better over time, and some of the pacing inconsistencies and bothersome closeness of the midgame will get worked out.   But this game is already responsible for two of my favorite gaming moments of the year. Spoilers ahead:  1. The first time I came across an alien species. My science ship scrambled. I looked for stats or a description, or something to make me feel better. All I saw was a big scary number that was way bigger than my fleet could handle, and a big quesiton mark. And it was just sitting there, watching me, and then it disappeared. I wanted so badly to know what it was, and I was so excited to read about it when I finished that research project.  2. I was in steady mid-game stride. I had met all my neighbors, formed and aliance and some rivalries. I was in control, and building at a rate that would launch me past my rivals very soon. I sent a science ship out to explore the far side of the galaxy. And it suddenly disappeared. I paused and went looking for it. The last system it was in was a star with no planets, just a giant ring around the star. No sign of my ship. I unpaused, and a transmission comes in from one very angry, xenophobic fungus. His empire was larger, more powerful, and more ancient than I could comprehend, and he didn't like me one bit.   So no matter what else happens with this game, I want to thank Paradox for those two amazing moments. Those alone were worth the game price.",

That being said, you will enjoy this game until you have to declare war on someone.   The warscore system is genuinely the worst war system I've ever seen in a 4x game, and I play A LOT of 4x games.   The game forces you to create 'war goals' which at first glance make sense, until you realize that you can only capture a few PLANETS (not systems) at a time, or form a protectorate over the enemy. You CANNOT just sweep in on a declaration of war and eliminate/capture an entire empire in one swoop. You have to 'liberate' or capture three or so at a time, and then accept peace. Wait like 10-20 years, and THEN declare war again, but usually that just turns everyone against you.   So for a game that says it gives you the freedom to create whatever kind of empire you want, it's true on that part. But what it fails to deliver on, is allowing you to actually carry that out. If you want to create an empire that is hell-bent on capturing and destroying everyone, you can create that, but once you have to actually begin taking over systems and empires, be ready to break out some painkillers for the massive headache that is the warscore system.  Additionally, most everything else people say is true. The UI can screw you over at times, and if it does it REALLY screws you over, but in my experience that has been very few and far between, if at all. The Federation system to me doesn't totally make sense, since I don't really see the benefit in forming one. (Not in a philosophical sense, but a gameplay sense. I don't see any in-game benefit with forming a federation anyway. Just more reason to pull out the painkillers.  To sum this game up, you WILL thoroughly enjoy this. Paradox has yet again created a stellar 4x game that again sets the standard for other companies to live up to. This is the way 4x games should be made. Like I said, I play a lot of 4x, including the complicated micro-managing ultimate 4x simulator Distant Worlds: Universe. This game is just a lot more fun to play. DW: U might be more of the 'classic 4x' game, but Stellaris is a game you can jump into every single time and enjoy your playtime. That's a game I'd recommend.",

You get to create your own race with its own ethics, morals and allegiances. In an ever expanding universe the selfish idea of humanity being alone in this vast and massive space becomes a myth as other races now meet with first contact and must look eye to eye with each other.   We may look at other countries on Earth with different cultures as strange and weird. Now imagine that you, an independent individual with freedom and human rights, meets with an avian creature with beliefs that it is better than you in every way and that there is no way to convince it otherwise. The idea of enslaving you and all other humans is the most common ideology for that creature and not just a very extremistic thought, it is a common tolerance for it and its entire kin. In Stellaris you must stand the test of time in an infinite and immortal universe and unite with likeminded people like humanity has done endless times in the past. But that was on Earth, now the political battlefield is between galaxies and races that look like birds, reptiles, cockroaches even flipping MUSHROOMS!   Conquer you enemies, study the arts of massive weapons of galactic destruction and find allies as ancient empires will remind you that you are not the first to rise nor the first to fall. And something worse is awaiting out there, something incomprehensible...   Stellaris is in my opinion a more 'easy to understand' Crusader kings or Europa Universalis. There are still many options and tabs that you need a basic understanding of, but it has been made so that you learn all of it by pressing buttons and looking around at tabs. It has been made more user friendly, although some might say it has become more casual.   There are many events to experience throughout the game and the first twenty hours, AT LEAST, are an endless amount of excitement as you progress, meet other factions, study new technology, new planets, anomalies... start a new war for liberation, conquest, humiliation or even political demands.   With patience, a fascination for science fiction or grand strategy in general, this game is certain to be a favorite.

            "review_text": "I've played about 30 hours of Stellaris and so far I'm impressed.  The game let's you create a new species with different traits and governement types. When there are random encounters in the game you sometimes have options specifically for this or that trait. This makes the game even more enjoyable because with every trait you have the game can turn completely different from the last time you played it. Furthermore there's the research. Researching in Stellaris is different than most other 4X games, the things you can research all mostly random. For example if you started one game with early game good research it can happen that late game you will get some tech that really adds no progress to your game. What is also fun is the ship design and all the weapons you have. You can design your ships to be long-range or short-range, fully armored or fully shielded and there are far more things to explore with the ship design. What is also fun with the ship design, is that how smart you design your ship, how well your ship will do in battle. You can counter your opponents weapons or defense in the ship design. And then there is the different FTL systems you can have, each one with it's own pros and cons. This is only a small example of all the things you can do in Stellaris. But this all doesn't mean that Stellaris is a perfect game. It still has it's flaws, which is understandable because the game just came out. For instance my own race thinks that my leader is an alien. There are still some minor buggs and some things that are a little bit irritating, but most of them will should probably go away with the next few updates.  And then there's the multiplayer. Untill this day I personally haven't played any multiplayer with this game yet, but I sure am going to. The multiplayer seems a lot of fun and certainly a bit chaotic. If you would play with, let's say, about 20 players the experience will be much, much different than you'll have in singleplayer. There's all the alliances that can be shaped, federations that can be builded and wars that can be fought. I'm really looking forward to participate in one of these giant space wars. And ofcourse the other players are different than the AI. So you'll be having a lot of different, for example, trading offers than you'll have with the AI.  All in all the game is really fun to play and if you like these types of games I really recommend this game for you.  (14/05/2016)",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to love this game. I love the other Paradox titles I've played (EU4, CK2, Vicky2). My love of 4x space games goes back to my first computer (a tsr 80). You can imagine my excitement when I heard Paradox was doing a 4x game.   I went in knowing and having little problem with the Paradox model: release a fun if feature sparse game, then expand and add depth through dlc. I think with Stellaris, though, Paradox forgot the 'fun' part. I also feel that they took advantage of people willing to be patient for new dlc to expand features, and released something unacceptably incomplete. It feels more like a proof of concept of a 4x space framework, waiting for the game to be applied. That may not be completely fair, as the game is polished and stable, but every feature leaves me feeling like they ran out of time before being able to add the fun bits.  Speaking of fun, this is pretty subjective, but for me the galaxy is flavorless. Alien races and space monsters feel like placeholders. The alien races especially feel completely randomized and uninteresting. Ship art is also non-distinct or interesting. The spacemonsters feel like research pinatas, waiting for a strong enough fleet to bash them open.  Oh and now we come to my least favorite part of the game, fleets, or as I have come to call them: Giant Stupid Space Blobs (GSSB hereafter). Gather up all your ships, put them into a single fleet, and run around mushing smaller GSSB's - err fleets. There is no tactical decision. Splitting your fleet is just asking for an enemy to use a GSSB and mush your smaller fleets piecemeal. Also, in addition to lack of tactical depth, the animation of one GSSB fighting another GSSB is so awful that it isn't even accidentally humorous. A combination of techs and admiral traits and skill should limit the maximum fleet size, and that leads to another problem...  Techs. I love what they're trying to do here with a treeless system and having rares and super rares, I really do. For some reason though, it just doesn't work. I end up getting every tech by the end of the game, and no matter what I choose it really doesn't seem to have a big impact on the feel of the game. Every empire I play feels pretty much like any other empire I play. Again, no funsy.  As far as game completeness, I give you: The Sector. Sectors were an attempt to make large sprawling empires both more controlable and also expand more slowly by limited the number of star systems directly controlable by the player. I love the idea. But again, they missed on completeness and funness. As your empire grows, you will hit a hard coded limit (modable) on the number of stars your empire can directly control. Once you hit this limit you can transfer control of a star system to one or more sectors that you define. I was hoping these would be semi-autonomous entities similar in scope to EU4 client states. They could automate to manage and defend themselves as an independent vassal, while kicking up a percentage of their labor to the parent empire, maybe based on tax rate, tech, etc.  Unfortunately sectors are nowhere near this automated. They end up being an arbitrary mechanic with no real gain for the player. You can't even change the color of the sector on the map for easy identification. It's just a heartbreaking reminder of what could have been if the game were a little more complete.  Unfortunately, the heartbreak of sectors is a pattern that plays out over and over through the game experience. Early game is fun enough while you do early exploration and expansion, but any sense of fun and wonder disappears by mid-game.  I'll definitely be interested in what new patches and dlc add, but I'll most certainly be taking a look before I leap approach. I expected better of Paradox, and got let down.",

But to be honest, this game sets its self apart from others like it in many ways.  The overrall diplomacy system makes up the bulk of this, making the game feel much more personal as the AI insults you, compliments you, and tries to push their agenda on you. Each empire feels like it has it's own personality. The best part of this is that if an empire that has liked you for a long time ends up disliking you, they don't immediatley turn to a bland, blind hatred. They still acknowledge your former relationship and let you know that they feel you have strayed from the light. The only thing that I felt was lacking was more advanced Vassal interaction.  The ship customization is great, it's not overly complex, but just complex enough to make every ship between empires unique. The research tree leaves something to be desired. Until you've played the game through a few times you might find yourself a bit confused about what techs you're exactly heading for, though that might just be me and my lack of attentiveness towards research. The single player is excellent, but the multiplayer is where things really shine.  I highly recommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends that play it.",

So, it's only based on couple of hours of gameplay - and why I even bothered to do this, I'll explain later.  RT 4x space simulation with 'pause', (in spirit) much like beloved MOO2. Meaning - there aren't TOO MUCH distracting, or even irritating stuff - one example would be a 3d research tree - all, restricted to what I saw so far, is done with a measure.   The space looks very alive and vibrant and with much to be discovered. Special events seem random and unique - think of ones in MOO2 (and don't think of some in... some other games). Oh, custom races are there too, in order to make gameplay more different each time. So are radically different opponents.  In short, I like this game so far. There were critics that 'mid- and end- game are boring and need to be worked on' - and devs admitted that - but, guess what - so are in Civ5. I never finished 3/4 of Civ5 games. And I play Civ-series for, like 25 years, or what was the Day 1 for the shiny, new Civ1 :)  Yet, Civ5 (the *good* Civ5, after 2 expansions) still leaves much to be desired for me. If this game is the same, well, it's on the par with Civ5 - and that means something. It's maybe even a new MOO2 - well, most of reviewer think it would be. I started playing after some patch that 'had a lots of promise', perhaps game was worse before, I wouldn't know. But I like what I see now. Even if it means hundreds of hours of semi-finished game (kind of 'this I would win for sure, if gameplay would be a bit more interesting, to motivate me for 20h more', or 'this is going badly, I *may* be able to pull it through since I play for so long, but... I'm not willing to play that same 20h more). Anyhow, same faults I forgave to Civ5. But with a chance to get better, which is something I can't say about Civ5.  Player will have to learn certain mechanics (not everything is obvious, there is a learning curve) - and from what I experience until now - it's worh it.   Hardcore 4x fan - try this, or wait for some more polishing. Up to you. People differ - I know some friends that used to say 'but I cannot control well all the space battles manually in Moo2, it's a game flaw', and some which used to say 'Imagine you'd have to *micro* all those 30,000 ships battles (in stacks, to be fair) in Moo1 - what a drag it would be'.   So, in numerous 4X games, the different 'X' were taken for main feature. So far, I like this proportion. It may change, though...  I'll update this after I had more experience... Anyway, looks good so far and if you're curious as me, perhaps you should buy it. I skipped so many 4x (and played equally much, just to be disappointed), but this one reviews had... something... that drew me to it. For how long, we shall see...",

What about lesser lifeforms and pre-warp civilizations, what about then? Do you let them live on their own, do you scan them and learn anthropology passivley, do you try to 'uplift' them and integrate them into your own workforce, do you completely purge them from your resources, or worse yet, enslave them and send them to the mines? That little bit won me over. It ignites the Star Trek geek in me. Are you the Federation, the Cardassians or are you some godlike precurser race viewed by them as gods? Hey we're just 'wormhole aliens' but if you want to see us as gods, then by all the means, add to our empire! The combat system reminds me of a cross between Settlers and Deadlock 2. You have the military might? send them in and a brief standoff occurs. You win or lose. They may send more at your borders, so be prepared to defend them. Military is wasted inside your borders. Lots of little popup mini-quests like pirates or heretic spawn within your borders, so have an inside fleet to deal with those. For the most part it's the simple age-old empire building of gather resources, build militaryl, defend and build and conquer. But what I love mosst about this game are the random events and the micromanagement. Kind of like Civilization III, but with a sector by sector grid of battles vs. the wider spread of ships and such. Some lets me down, some feels more fun. It's a fun game in any sense. What I DO wish, is that there were more victory conditions than mere expansionism and conquest. I play this game, and I wish I could be more peaceful and mercantile. I wish I could meet other races and form a federation. As it stands (and I may be wrong since I just bought it a day ago) is that you build power and sieze it. I want to be the good guy and uplift civilizations, make them my own, and I want to hash out alliances and trade empires, build more than destroy.

For the time being though, it's the best AAA 4x game to come around in a long, long time. I can't think of anything that comes close. I am a huge Distant Worlds and Gal Civ 2 fan. This game manages to mix the 2 very well. I like being able to control the population on my individual planets while still spending a fair amount of time shooting ships off to explore, mine and research random anomalies in the world.  This might not be ground breaking gameplay but the writing, graphics, music and randomisation make it a blast. I'm only about 7 hours in so I haven't seen late game yet but I've enjoyed everything from my initial planet development to my battles with space squids so far. It's a weird game, with a lot of mysterious junk to find. It's a game where the other major civilizations don't even make their appearance until about 5 hours in.   Distant Worlds wasn't so great when it was released either. Universe was a solid package because it had a handful of expansions fleshing it out. This game is already pure gold compared to Gal Civ 3 and it'll have no problem eating up your free time.",

That being said, I'm not the biggest fan. Of the concept, yes. The way it works out, no.  As with other grand strategy games the play itself stagnates at some point. At the startup everything is exciting, exploring new system, colonizing new planets, developing new technologies. But at some point you're going to meet an other space empire that's either larger in economy or in military power. And that's were the Paradox ChooChoo train stops.  Up untill then you had a lot of fun, no problemo. But this is where all the games meet either their end in horrible defeat or a boring stalemate in which you try to equalize power.   Even though I try to finish my games, in the end I simply give up. For no other reason that it loses it excitement.   Though I have to admit that the point of giving up is after an hour or 10, so that means I've got at least a few good runs behind me.  I certainly recommend it to try it out, but if grand strategy (in space) is not your thing, you might want to spend your money somewhere else",

            "review_text": "TLDR version: It's good in same way as Skyrim... As in fun, but you definitly feel the game is bare-bones and lacking content wise some areas. Buggy as a TES game as well. Mods are what is going to keep this afloat above many other 4x games after the massive hypetrain has left station.  Messy Rant section:  Game offers you 6 city and 6 ship looks for each race category. Good chance all mammals fly the same design and all fungals fly their type. Cities seen in tiny window is a nice thouch, kinda a vague reminder from old Heroes turn based strategy games, would love to see more alternatives... As in ship design, you can easy design ship weapons etc. equipment. Ship combat is equally simplistic, as in order attack commando and that's it, with possible emergency ftl retreat (seriously damages ships). I like. However the styling of said ships gets blown so far out of the water and into unknown Blorg space in comparison to Galactic Civilizations III ship design. Only limit there is your imagination. Guess Paradox want to grind out our pockets for more options here in future. Offtopic- Gief endgame crisis there the GC 3 Crusade comes to cleanse the galaxy if there is no human empires alive or free? And what happen to slave uprising?  Traits for your races are seriously limited in options. A lesser degree with flags and symbols. In first vanilla game I had difficulties seeing what faction owned what. I was orange and so was my vassal and 2 of my neighbours. Thankfully partly fixed by mods now.  While talking about my vanilla game with no mods, I got no achievements. However I don't care about that, but thought I should mention it anyway.  Mod menu is permanently bugged out, as in dropdown list over categories are stuck over the mod listing. Really annoying. (Validated the game files twice, not really into reinstalling yet)  AI, is really ♥♥♥♥ atm. like in most 4x games. Hope you like getting spammed by sharing Star Charts, typically if you have explored more than them (might be random how good that trade is though). Classic strategy of 4x games, Diplomacy = spammed by worthless deals by ai. (Civ 5 and embassy requests trauma) You will have puny vassals hating your guts and being disloyal when they are no position to break free (cud not bribe them with energy or minerals either for more love). Pretty certain only reason they survived at all was because of me shielding them from other empires. Your AI controlled sectors will be poorly optimized, feeling the need for mods to ignore the sector use completely. Examples I saw over 20 systems. Research sector building energy over research yields, food over energy yields and research right next to capital building over food yields? Sectors also have no way of earning or getting influence to build or upgrade buildings? Also miss a balanced optimization plan on sector overview, as it builds what is best and try to avoid overflow of food when a planet is full on population. For you see, paradox don't believe in trade between planets. :p Tech and traits for getting back resources from sectors should also be a thing.   Lots of tech options, which is good for the random tech tree is a blessing against cookie cutter spec. Problem is that most extra weapon techs from early aliens don't really stand out compared to default weapon techs, as in ignorable, except the ones that unlock a decent armor. From what I have heard there is also an ungodly amount of ground combat forces even if the game is generally simplistic in that regard, as in send fleet, bomb planet (planet can't do anything about orbital bombardment, no Indepence Day heroics here) and drop bog standard troops and planet fall easy. Some things feel missing like trade between planets in your control and outside. No options for colonizing either through tech, perk or planet specialization of toxic, volcanic and barren planets?  Disconnect between events and what is really happing with aliens under your command: I decided to infiltrate a primitive government. And it was success. Event screen told me these aliens was overjoyed to join my empire and praised me as lord saviour Gaben etc. Great I thought, finally I have alien friends that don't hate me as part of main group in my Commonwealth of Man (human space baddies). Yet when I saw their planet afterwards, they were hating me more than any other alien race in galaxy. Quite the achievement. Some of it is because different ethos… Yet it's ridiculous considering what I done to rest of the galaxy regarding aliens listing, but not limited to: raiding, pillaging, brutal wars against peaceful populations, enslavement of an unholy number of alien subjects and purging dozen worlds (at least 1 species forever gone) over countless systems. So my new alien friends had to get a lesson instantly, even if they had endured none of the hardships for throwing away a future on top.  Lesson being; friendship is mandatory and resistance is impolite.",

Many systems were lost, populations exterminated, but finally (with the great help of the AI that actually helps you if you're allied with them) the hyperdimensional beings were destroyed and banished from the galaxy.  Stellaris is a game that on the surface presents itself as possibly the most accessible Paradox game I've ever played. But after learning it more in-depth I realize it offers the same, if not even more, dynamic and interesting gameplay I've learned to expect. What's more is that the netcode works pretty good, and we've been enjoying games of 7+ people without significant lag. Shoutout to all the great sci-fi easter eggs littered through-out the galaxy too, which are recognizable to readers of sci-fi classic authors like Niven.

It is still quite limited in scope and is not as good as others claim.  Most of the single player matches I've played in Stellaris grind to a halt in the later stages of the game, once the entire galaxy is occupied by competing empires. After that it just becomes an incredibly boring grind. Every one has formed alliances and federations and treaties, that you can't just decide to declare war and attack you neigboring empire to continue expanding, as much as you would just want to unleash hell with your fleet.

The tweaks I want to see:   - Ship designs could do with more explanation, and maybe an auto-update featrue, maybe even a way to order your fleets/stations upgraded from the design window.  - More possible victories.  - Even more Events/Anomalies, seems like I found the alien Merc's diary across 7 systems during a single game.  - A Ship hull type/Component that could carry two wings of strike craft, Strike Craft look awesome.  - A Communications tutorial when you first open diplomacy with another Empire, took a while to find a way to get something in return when I started trading with another Empire.  - A civillian trade agreement of sorts, as a way to increase rellations, taidng minerals for minerals is silly, but effective way to do so.  - More minable Stars/Gas giants, i'm currently useing a mod to achive that, but non-minable(for energy) stars is kinda silly.  - Why can I only Insult my rivals, and not compliment those I want to befriend?  - Explenation of what happines does for a Pop, particulary high happines.  - Why do my Vassals/Protectorates hate me so much?

            "review_text": "Stellaris is an interesting new title among the mass release of strategy games as of late. Paradox Interactive, known for famed games like Europa Universalis IV and Cities: Skylines, seem to be testing gamers with a question rarely asked; 'How good can a space-strategy game really be?'  What do I mean by that? Well, when you think about it, space is big. Like   really   big. It's going to take a good system of trade and diplomacy in order to make such a large virtual galaxy feel alive, real, and especially interesting. It's no secret that Paradox is good at making historical stategy games, such as EU4 and CK2. But how would they convert that depth and enriching experience into not just a space theme - but an entirely made-up universe. No countries or empires to jot down, it's all either randomly generated or created by the player. So, how does it hold up? Well, here's my analysis, without the use of pros or cons:  * In my opinion, Stellaris is an almost perfect combination of the best strategy elements from both EU4 and Sid Meier's Civilization V. Diplomacy feels much like an in-depth version of Civ, while the structure of empires, federations, and vassals serves as a callback to Europa. The battle system feels perfectly blended between both games, but it's not perfect. The outcome of space battles almost always depends on how high your fleet power is, which is heavily influenced by your ship number and technology prowess. I'd say that the fleet battle system is good, but not the pinnacle of what a company like Paradox could achieve.  * Unlike most Paradox games (*cough cough EU4*), Stellaris comes with an unexpectedly detailed tutorial. I'm not a big fan of Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings myself, and yet the tutorial still got me in the right place without any difficulty. I'd suggest coming into Stellaris expecting Civ 5 depth but more detailed - even though there's far more to it than that, as you will no doubt see.  * Stellaris' customization/mods implements both creativity and individuality. There is a large gallery of choices for your species' appearance, empire, flag, and government. Workshop mods, especially, bring in a whole new array of possibilities. Stellaris has barely been out already, and there's already tons of coloring mods, a Warhammer 40k mod, new species, etc. Definitely worth checking out.  Overall, Stellaris is a more-than-solid game. It has both the depth desired by experienced players and the welcoming atmosphere sought by newcomers. This might even be the game that introduces some people (maybe even you) to the strategy game genre as a whole! Solid purchase; no regrets.  [Extra Notes...]  - It is not a turn-based game; the game moves in real-time unless you pause it or alter the speed. - I have yet to experience multiplayer, but I hear that it's very fun. Recommended for people buying Stellaris alongside a friend or two. - Paradox seems to be listening to player feedback. Let's hope that the great community continues!    No number rating, just buy the game!",

Stellaris on the other hand decides to make the UI at lot more simple and all the useful numbers have been replaced by vague approximations (superior, inferior, equivalent, etc.).   And that would be fine... If not for the fact that combat is almost entirely based on numbers. Granted, late game you're probably either already winning or already losing so a non specific approximation is probably all you need. Early game, 1 extra ship can be the difference between winning you first War or losing horribly - which is exactly what had happened in one of my games. In that round my enemy had one extra ship, something I could have never known since all signs (population, number of planets, etc.) seemed to have indicated that I should have been able to easily outnumber them.   And again this wouldn't be a problem... IF Stellaris had an actual combat system rather than a amoeba simulation. As much as I would love a combat system along the lines of a space Total War, the EU IV system would be enough - by which I mean that certian terrain (or in this case, certian tracts of space) have ups and downs to attacking or defending. Instead in Stellaris all you get is two or more blobs doing basic subtraction from each other with minor modifiers based on ship layout - which early game is close to irrevelent.   To sum it up... EU IV is just a better game. Hopefully Endless Space 2 will serve as a superior alternative this this once it comes out.",

The emergent story-telling via events is a nice change from the usual bland 4X routine. There is a lot of data, but it is well-organized, and I never felt overwhelmed. I think it gives a good first impression.  Unfortunately, it suffers from some serious flaws. It is a slow game. Very slow. Expect to be playing it on Fastest speed for a lot of it, just to get to something to do. There doesn't seem to be as much meat to it as I'd like. The combat doesn't seem quite right, and though they show combat ratings, due to the variances of weapon types and defenses, those are very inconsistently accurate. It's not unusual to either be annihilated by or dominate similarly scored enemies. That makes battles 'fun'. The deepest flaw, for me, is the War Goals and War Score, which is something ported from their grand strategy titles. This is essentially a major constraint on a player's ability to wage war: you are required to pre-declare the goal of your aggression, build points by doing certain things, and then 'spend' those points at the end of the war to actually accomplish anything. This translates to taking over a dozen planets, but only being able to 'afford' to keep 1 when the war ends. It is as odd a system as it sounds, and it does not work in a 4X environment, in my opinion. The only up side is that your enemies play by the same rules, so players are less likely to be knocked out of the game in a single war. There are other more minor flaws and annoyances besides those, and an oddity with achievements only unlocking on Ironman mode, which seems needlessly anti-player.  Overall, it is not a bad game, but an ambitious, slow one with some critical flaws. It keeps a bit too much of its grand strategy pedigree, and suffers for it.",

            "review_text": "Looking at what Stellaris has to offer, it seams like an awesome game - and it is in many ways. I enjoyed playing it most of the time. However, several of the game's mechanics turned out to be either frustrating or only implemented to inflate the length of a playthrough. In this review, I will only talk about the negative aspects of Stellaris as of version 1.2.5.   Frustrating: Combat System  Ships built have to be integrated into a larger fleet as every ship on its own is a fleet, which inflates the fleet overview to a point where you're almost unable to find the correct fleet/ship. However, as part of a large fleet, there is no possibility to control individual ships within the fleet. Instead, only the overall fleet can be given orders.  Fleets themselves have a distinct combat mode. As soon as anything hostile is within combat range, the fleet will enter combat mode and engage. From this moment on, it is no more possible to control the fleet expect for giving the order to retreat. Moreover, the overall speed of the fleet is greatly reduced, depending on the ship type. As for the largest ship type, battleships, I found that their speed is reduced to roughly 1/12 of their usual speed. Since smaller ship types are faster, the fleet separates with the weaker ships in front engaged in combat and the larger, stronger ships in the back trying to catch up and not attacking at all. This effect is enhanced by the wedge formation of the fleet. Even for fleets consisting only of one type only the ships at the tip of the wedge will engage in combat, rendering the bulk of the fleet useless. The fleet formation cannot be changed. Thus, fleets are only effective when jumping onto other fleets outside a system's gravity well. This is frustrating as you will lose far more ships as necessary, especially when the opponent's weapons have a larger range such that your fleet has to move with slow speed to bridge the gap.   Gameplay Inflation:  The length of a playthrough is greatly inflated by three mechanisms:   Influence Points: Beside energy and minerals, influence points are a third basic resource required for colonization, establishment of outposts, recruitment of leaders, influencing elections, building certain structures, and controlling opposing fractions within your empire. Since influence is a resource, a certain amount is consumed by performing above actions. As influence rises only slowly and is greatly decreased by each existing outpost, the expansion of your empire is greatly hindered. Even if your empire is economically capable of sustaining a dozen new colonies, if you do not have at least 30 influence, you cannot establish a new colony. You will therefore find yourself often in the situation where you have to wait 10 minutes or so until you have accumulated enough influence for colonization - and then an other race claims the planet (occasionally). This mechanic of influence raises the question: Is there a higher entity that I have to please first before I can establish a new colony or even an outpost? Shouldn't this be determined by a player's economy?   Warscore: To declare war against another faction, you need to specify your war goals, such as e.g. liberation or ceding of a planet, or humiliation or vassalization of the other faction. Each of these demands has a certain value referred to as warscore. In a single war, you can only specify goals worth up to 100 points of warscore, which corresponds to about 7-8 planets that you can gain per war. After the war is over, a truce of 10 years is enacted. In practice this means that defeating a medium-sized empire of about 40 planets can take more than 50 years, corresponding to several hours. Even if your fleet is overwhelmingly more powerful than your opponent's and you could theoretically defeat your opponent in a single war, this is not possible. And again, this raises the question: Is there a higher entity that limits my actions?Why is it not possible to wage war as I want it?   Late Game Event **SPOILER**!!: In the later stages of the game, a certain event occurs that adds nothing to the game but greatly increases the length of the playthrough. I will not go further into details about this event.    Conclusion:  Although Stellaris has many awesome elements, the time required for a playthrough is significantly and unnecessarily inflated by several mechanics. In my playthrough of 50h for a medium galaxy of 600 star systems, at least the last 10h were only a grind towards victory - with occasional grinding periods throughout the game. And as the game has no 'Hall of Fame', achieving victory has no significance whatsoever. If you have no problem with inflated gameplay and unnecessary grinding, you may enjoy this game. Generally, I do not recommend this game.",

When I combat opponents, I can feel the push and pull between me and the game as it tries to find weaknesses in my strategies. The race customization options, both at the start and during the course of play, are fun. Overall, the title is promising.  On the downside, I've played through seven different games over 200 hours of gameplay and all but the last came to a statemate. I develop my empire's military strength and manage diplomatic relations, and each time my npc allies waffle right before my npc enemies zerg. In this last campaign, I managed to fly under the radar of all the other pc races, built up my empire strength and technology until I'm just about to peek out into the universe... then the game suddenly decides that my empire is due for a revolt that instantly spawns invading troups on every one of almost a dozen worlds and a fleet three times everything I've got. It was like the game saw I was doing well and spontaneously created an unwinable game event.  Between the fun I had when I was doing well and the disappointment I felt for seemingly impossible odds, my Stellaris experience feels like a wash.

To begin with, the game is pretty simple in the beginning, and will gradually become more complex, and actually explain most of it pretty well. The game lets you decide how you want to play, already starting with your species of choice.  An example: The empire i created is a pacifist species of mammals who believe their ruler is a divine protector, and they LOVE aliens. As a result my empire (in my main playthrogh) now has around 20 different species, and span half the galaxy. Instead of alliances, they make the other species into their vassals, and then integrate them fully, allowing all species to become leaders of their empire as well.  One point i REALLY love, is the 'ethos system' which governs what choices you can make, and how you can interact with the other empires. Thers just so many choices.  To help with the boredom between wars, and political drama, thers 'events' and 'event chains' which reward the player with anything between resources, bonus ethos, and special research depending on choices during the event.  All in all, if you like complex RTS games, if you love space, and if you LOVE games that get mods in abundance.. Then i highly recommend this.",

Much like Distant Worlds, it tries to be different, but manages it without the overwelming spreadsheet complexity and tetris-like starship construction minigames that recent contenders to the throne have offered us.  Not perfect yet, but paradox have a wonderful history of putting out years of patches and enhancements to their strategy games, so I'm REALLY looking forward to seeing what the next few months bring to this already very good 4X grand strategy.

Yes you can save and come back, but for me, while I do enjoy a good game that takes time, pouring 2 weeks into trying to take over the galaxy sorta....becomes boring. Empire at War, you could finish Galactic Conquest within one solid day. Battle For Middle Earth, 2-4 hours, with 7 brutal armies, depending. With friends it could take longer.

            "review_text": "Everything I ever wanted from a Grand Strategy game set in space. It's slightly more of a 4X Strategy game than your other main Paradox Titles.  This game is packed with depth in mechanics and features and is bound to add more through free expansion-DLC's.  From the very start of the game, you can craft your own unique Empire from a variety of traits ranging from Empire Ethics, Species types, Government forms, Hyperspace travels, and plenty of other unqiue ways to customize your faction.  The cosmos-theme of the game is extremely pleasant, the soundtrack is great, and the gameplay very addicting. The customization of your various star-ships based on hull-size with different types of weaponry, armor, and utility slots adds for a lot of strategic depth to how you structure your military.   You start with a single planetary system and the game-map can have up to a thousand solar star systems each with several planets (which you can terraform if they are not the correct planetary type to your species).  The ealry-game largely consists of exploration through surveyingn various star systems in your region controlled by 'Scientists', which act as one of the hero units of the game (others being Governors, Admirals, Generals).   Eventually, as your fledgling faction grows into the stars your mid-game continues technological development and comes into diplomatic contact with various other factions populating the galaxy. Being a sandbox strategy game, how you choose to play is largely up to you but conquest of your less amiable neighbors while military or trade alliances with others adds a lot of diplomatic depth that you come to expect from paradox strategy games.  The late-game is full of apocalyptic scenarios such as the technological singularity of synthetic revolution against biologicals, extra-galactic invasion, and some other interesting galaxy-changing scenarios that throws the mid-game-established balance of power for a loop.  Overall there's just too many mechanics to talk about here, from migrating individual 'POPs' (each with varying values that develop based on your species and others that inhabit your planets) to a wide array of technologies in a unique 'shuffle' system technology tree.   I fully recommend the game for it's price and even more-so it's on sale. If you're an avid strategy gamer this is one game you don't want to miss out on.",

            "review_text": "This game is awesome but it does have many flaws and is a downgrade of all the other Paradox games.  First off there is no replay value, atleast for me, sure you can create your own races and buildings and things. But no matter what the early game is always the same, you explore and expand, almost always the same (if you dont mod). But i have one save in this game and as of right now i have 25 hours and i am not even done.  The thing i love about this game is you can create your own race, name it. Create a faction, chose a goverment like, A Kingdom or Empire, what sort, religious, friendly or warmogering. Or a democratic, like a Republic or Direct democracy or Indirect. What sort of Republic, a religious republic or military? anything you can think of pretty much. You can chose your own planet and name it.  Like i created The Grand Republic, Former name:The United Nations of Earth. Capital: Earth, No former name. Province: The Capitol, Former name: The Milky Way. Main Species: Humans, Leader: Krill Makarov (Robot), Age of Krill: 357.  This game like all other Paradox games makes me feel like i am the leader here, I started off as the United Nations of Earth (my own faction i made, not the one in the game), we expanded and found sentient life form and formed an alliance with them, this was the formation of The Union of Allied Planets. We waged wars together and new members joined the Union, we had free migration which let all races travel around the Union. The United Nations of Earth was no longer a only Human Republic it was now a multi-racial Republic, so it was fitting to change the name of my Empire. It was now called The Grand Republic occupying one fourth of the galaxy (along with the Union of Allied Planets), Together we will crush the dictators and rid the galaxy of corruption and tyranny. Our enemy was The Grand Hierachy and The Iron Pact.  As of now i own half the galaxy and the Grand Fleet of The Republic will soon 'liberate' the rest of the galaxy. Now my Republic isnt really a 'Republic' per say. A Robot is the Grand Admiral (Leader of The Republic since i am a Military Republic) that has been the leader for 357 years, since the early days of fighting tyranny Krill became the Admiral and i have seen to it that he stays and rigged the elections to his favour and since he is a robot he cant die and he will remain the Grand Admiral until the end of The Grand Republic.   The Republic isnt the happy loving thing that people around the galaxy hear about, i do what i do to win, decimate enitre planets, wipe out races, and rain fire on my enemies, i start rebellions, and start wars that rage on for hundrads of years, i kill the politicans that apose me and i rigg elections, i spread propaganda to make my people happy and so on and so on. Thats what i love about this game. It felt like i was Krill and that i did all that, sometimes i felt bad about erasing entire races from the face of the galaxy, and sometimes i felt good when i incorporated and Empire into my Republic and showed them freedom. Now i have free migration in my empire which means they can move to other Galactic Goverments if they have open borders or people can move around my Republic, that bad part about this is that when you set someone to work for instance on mining, they can move when ever they want to to another place if they get unhappy, but it makes me feel good that i have free migration, and i have abolished slavery and removed Humans from the primary race, all are equal in my Republic, thats why its Grand.",

You can setup zones as your empire grows that are indirectly owned and setup govenors to manage those zones. As your empire grows the story of your empire, which is unique with each play, grows, changes, and becomes more colorful. Characters (leaders) have a lifespan, advantages and disadvantages, and a personality of their own. It makes the game feel more rich and story driven even though it's a generated galaxy each time. There is a lot of waiting early on but you can speed up the game when there's a lot of waiting so that doesn't bother me all that much. On my Mac it does crash somewhat often with the last set of patches, and that's annoying but I have confidence they'll fix that.   The only thing that I really don't like that much is the way you have to setup war goals or war goals are setup against you. I feel like if you invade a planet you should be able to cede it to your empire at will. When someone goes to war with me I haven't found a way to negotiate them out of it. So, this ends up with long wars where you want to negotiate your way out of it but there isn't an option. I also haven't found a way to encourage other empires to go to war against your ememies without creating an alliance. I find that a bit of an annoyance.

PRO: - Compelling early game exploration and expansion gameplay. - Interesting and viable systems for managing multi-species empires through several different approaches. - Tech system is, at least to me, a welcome change from traditional tech trees. - Combat and ship design add a lot of potential depth to the normal grand strategy combat (but see CON section). - Lots of opportunity for creativity and emergent narrative.   CON: - Midgame feels somewhat sparse. There aren't many events and the AI is a bit on the passive side, so you mostly tech up, fight wars on your terms, and backfill planets you haven't already settled. - Faction system feels very barebones. It has great potential but doesn't represent any serious threat to your empire in its current state. - Combat is not exceptionally well balanced. While ship designs have a lot of potential, there are clearly optimal builds that can let you dominate even the strongest empires.",

Now, if you suspect purging slave pops would fix this problem you'd only be half right. If you purge slave pops normally, they just get more angry.

Crazy levels of depth in the management of your space empire (manage your colonies, edicts, government leaders, policies, ship design, ground armies, naval fleets, diplomatic relations with primitive and rival alien species, technology and I'm pretty sure I'm missing at least 3 other aspects to micromanage). Narrative elements jazz up the traditional 4x gameplay, turning every new game into a miniature story.  Pros: Aforementioned depth (Cannot be oversold. Compared to many other 4x games, there's just so much more to do in this one). Variety in the leaders allow for different gameplay experiences. Has that 'one more turn' allure of similar 4x titles. Solid and clever writing.  Cons: Volume of different mechanics to internalize might be overwhelming. Tutorial leaves out several mechanics that you'll quickly learn are quintessential to your success. Some mechanics are a bit soft and may leave you scratching your head to figure out why certain things played out the way they did (looking at you fleet combat score). Game will require hours of your time and probably some independent research to fully immerse into.  Would Recommend To: Fans of the Endless 4x franchise games, Crusader Kings 2 players looking for a little more gameplay, Civ 4 fans who felt Civ 5 was too much of a streamlined experience.

There are so many ways that the game fails to keep you aware of your empire that you're constantly clicking around and I've found i have to keep a note pad next to my keyboard to write things down that should be available in game. Here are a few examples:  1) Remembering things you discovered - You'll often encounter points of interest - early tech species, anomalies that you should study further, etc. Oftentimes you can't do anything with these right away and will want to come back to them later. The game doesn't track these for you well or give you an easy way to review things that you have already discovered. Again, better keep a notepad handy. There is a Situation Log that does track some things for you, but for some crazy reason it only tracks certain types of items and not others.  2) Knowing that you're being attacked - the game autopauses for some things like 'you discovered an anomaly' but, crazily not for things like 'your home planet is under attack' or 'your scout ship is about to get smashed'. Glad I'll never miss an anomaly, but I'd sure like the game to also pause and call my attention to the fact that one of my planets is getting invaded.   3) Tracking hostile encounters - if you encounter hostiles in a system you can click on that system and see the strength of the hostiles while your ships are there. If you don't click immediately and physically look at it before your ship runs away, all you get is a 'there are hostiles here' with no indication of strength. If the hostiles move, that 'hostiles here' marker stays until you can see the system again, so there's already an awareness that the info could be out of date. So why not show the strength of the last known contact?  4) Starbases - starbases are you main hubs for activity in the game. You build ships there, you rally defenses, but they don't, amazingly, show up on the map view. You have to remember where you built your bases and to access them you have to click on the nearby inhabited planet and from the planet screen, click on the base. Later in the game when many of your planets are in Sectors, you can't even modify your planets anymore, you're only managing the bases, yet the bases are still invisible on the map and you still have to click through the planet.  This game has a lot of potential, but a game designed around managing space empires should be better at helping you track the key things you should be managing / interacting with. At first it's only an annoyance, but as the game progresses, it just becomes painfully obvious that the designers didn't focus enough on situational awareness.",

The only issues I have with it are instabilities in the later stages of the game, although that might just be mods or the sheer size of the galaxy I like playing in. If the developer manages to add more events in the later stages of the game or make planetary combat more engaging, this would be a near-perfect game in my opinion.",

            "review_text": "If You like real time stratergy and scifi you will love this game. I particularly like four of the main aspects of the game.   Tech, unlike most games does'nt have a set tree or web it is random and the more you specialize into something the more techs from that area will come up. e.g. when playing as a religious militant race you are likely to have psionic weapons come up as a choice to research, but as peaceful scientific race you are more likely to get a scientific boost tech like administrative AI which reduces research speed by 5%. overall this science mechanic is more realistic and is a refreshing change to games where you have a set tree that encourages rushing to techs.  Exploration is really fun with the game heavily rewarding those who explore and expand quickly, these are core aspects of 4x games altogether and it does not let down in stellaris. The different anomalies you find can give distinct advantages to science, military and political power. in one of my games I recovered an alien frigate at an anomaly and was able to use it to my advantage in an early war, but also in the same game my scientist personally went to inspect an anomaly and died causing me to mis out on some early exploration. The exploration in stellaris is engaging as the risks and rewards can very important to your growing Empire/Oligarchy/Republic...  The Questlines are, in my opinion the cherry ontop of the cake with stellaris. They are well thought out and are very important in game. like the anomalies they give a distict advantage and also give the player smaller goals to aim for other than total galactic dominance. The questlines are also relatable today and aren't some far fetched future plot that is uncomprahensable. This was show when someone changed 6 words in the quest log and turned the underground civilisation quest into something donald trup could have said to justify his wall.  Lastly the race designer is and will always be my favourite part of stellaris. The amount of ways you can tailor your race and government to your playstyle is staggering and the amount of time people have spent developing intricate backstores of how the currrent Grand Emperor got into power of how the communists took over earth inspires me to create my own races with backstories. The Race designer reallly adds alot to stellaris and is easy to use, this puts it infront of other strategy games like Civilisation where you have to rely on mods to get close to what you want.  Overall this is the best scifi strategy game I've played since 2k and firaxis released their version of Xcom.",

            "review_text": "Ok, so I've been playing this for a while now, and I can honestly say I'm impressed. Firstly, I use a top range LAPTOP from just over a year ago, so around the standard running power for most PC's, and definetly NOT a gaming PC, and the game runs almost perfectly on the largest map, just a slight drop frames late game but nothing really noticable. And for those that are maybe a little pushed for specs, there are also ways of turning the graphics down, though unfortunatly its not in the in-game settings just yet (there is a tutorial in the guides to show you how).  To me this game seems like a cross between Sword of the Stars (the first one, my all time favorite and one that I compare ALL 4x space games against) and Sins of a Solar Empire, combined with the experience of a company of reputable Grand Strategy games. The game is however not without its faults, namely research lacking a tech tree as you 'draw' 3 choices each time you complete a tech, plus I would also like to see more weapon types/weapon graphics entered into the game, as well as trade, both amongst your own planets and that with friendly civilizations (maybe even include a specific trait that increases friendly relations with those your trading with)  Overall though I've found the game addictive as it lets me play my own way, with huge customisation all around, from ship visuals and ship setups, planet names, goverment types to empire stats and rulers, plus has a decent ammount of replayability, as with every government comes a different choice in both diplomacy and research, for instance I've mostly been using Millitaristic Research Dictatorships so far, whos approach to reseach is either 'lets shoot it then study it' or 'we don't have time for this' whereas more.. peaceful governments would be likely to study it from afar, leading to different research techs to study (alongside the usual 3 random techs, and these dont dissapear till researched either). Also included is a 'sector' system, meaning that you can (actually, HAVE to) set certain parts of your Empire into an AI controled sector of space, thus freeing you from the duty of having to micromanage 50+ colonies late game. The game also works very well with the workshop community, so for those thinking the game needs more they can find it there. Would certainly recomend this to anyone who likes both Grand Strategy games and Space, I know personally I have found another benchmark from which I can judge other space games with this one (alongside SotS).",

First of all its alot more 'easier' than other paradox games maybe even little too simplified (just personally think so), still has some bugs and balance issues, it doesnt have fancy big stars voice acting or so called 'tactical combat' and it doesnt need any of that. Its a perfect real time (yes no more turns for you) grand space 4X strategy game and Paradox makes sure to improve their games with DLC (what are some of you guys complaining about? paying couple of times a year 10-15e to expand your games life?) its only 40e   Ill end my recommendation with a story of my game (spoilers). I was minding my business mid-latish game anexxing xenos under the human empire trying to find out which ugly alien muck should I make my vassal next when suddenly even uglier xenos from another dimension showed up by 'we found the feeding grounds' message, now me and xeno scum have to unite to kick these dudes back to ugly alien dimension.  Is it worth for 40e? Most definently this game has potential for hundreds maybe tousands of hours of gameplay.

            "review_text": "This is the best 4X space game I've played in over a decade. Stellaris is like a tremendous breath of fresh air for a stifled and stagnant genre.  What makes it so interesting is that your population is not just another resource or set of stats, but truly central. They have their own social values, and keeping them happy according to those values is key to success. But those values can change and evolve and, of course, the other races have different values of their own. This makes things interesting when your population starts to get diverse as a result of conquests or cross-migration (yes, they migrate on their own too).  Paradox games are known for gameplay that generates interesting narratives. Thus, for example, an empire built on brutal war and enslavement can find itself embracing emancipation and reforming its ways as a result of internal or external pressures. If you conquer a bunch of pacifistic individualists and don't have the heart to genocidally exterminate them, then you either have to moderate your ways or learn to live with constant rebellion. If your powerful neighbors revile your treatment of your people, you might have to choose between easing up or risking a war against a coalition that you might not be able to defeat. But the choices are there, and that's what makes for such a compelling game.  It isn't perfect. The interface still needs polish and I've had some problems with troop transports. Nevertheless, even right at release it's already a huge amount of fun and brimming with potential for continued growth.  Good job, Paradox. I was very skeptical when this title was announced, but I'm glad to say you've exceeded my expectations. If only more studios would step outside the usual conventions like you have here, maybe people would stop talking about the death of PC gaming.",

I think the reason is, I tried being relatively peaceful and that is not a very good idea. This game has options for pacifistic playthroughs, but they are not very fun nor viable. The only two win conditions require expansion, which in mid to late game is not possible without wars to take another empires land. At first, I was fascinated, but then it all became repetitive after 80 or so in-game years. I would only recommend playing as a militarist until more win conditions arrive or they add more mid to late game activities.

Because it's Ironman, there are no toher save games I can use instead, and Paradox support gave me one suggestion and have then said there's nothing they can do.   So basically, there's no way I'm playing this again. I don't mind ploughing hundreds of hours into a game, but I'm not going to do it if there's a chance the game is just going to wipe it all.

What really made me lose any faith in this game and give it a thumbs down is the fact that Paradox has no idea what this game should be. It's still stuck 4 months after release as a mediocre 4X game in the early expansion phase and then a mediocre grand strategy game in the later phase of the game once all civs are boxed in with no room to expand. None of the big patches that paradox released improved anything (some would argue that they made it worse due to the new bugs that keep poping up) and even in their development diaries I see nothing that will help shake things up.",

A good choice too, for anyone new to grand strategy, as it avoids some of the overt complexities and micromanagement of Crusader Kings II or other Paradox games, but instead focuses on the broader, galactic view, to let the player make decisions on a scale comprehensible to a newbie, while still giving the micromanagement options to the more fastidious. The Alien races at the time of writing are a bit bland and samie despite the randomly generated traits, skins, names, and behaviors. Honestly after about ten horus the aliens all start to look the same and you stop caring about any in particular. That being said the roleplay value of this game, similar to other grand strategy games, is phenomenal. Want to play a race of cruel slavers? Check.

That sounded amazing! I religiously followed all the vidoes and developer diaries every monday morning and I could not wait to play the game. However after playing it for a few hours I was a bit dissapointed.   Here is a list of just some of the problems.  - the game crashes every so often...it is very annoying - the space battles are pretty messy and not visually pleasing - limited diplomatic options...where is the spying, sabotaging, embargoes and more. - there are limited options on how to deal with uprisings and revolts.. - the federations (which sound cool) are just overated alliances, with no real change - the AI is just awful at managing sectors, they do little to produce or advance their planets productions or build things in general - the AI oponents are pretty boring and stupid. When going to war your allies just tend to follow your fleet instead of making calculated advances - there needs to be more map modes like in Europa Universalis IV to see different things going on in the galaxy (alliance, rivals, resources, terrain etc. - It gets pretty boring in the mid game after exploring the galaxy, the game kind of comes to a halt when there is no more exploring or neighbour AI's don't do anything - most tabs and handling of the game seems to be unfinished and messy - there seems to be a bountiful amount of little glitches and issues with the game right now - there is a lack of different resources and the things that they do  The only things they got right was the government types and special traits. However overall I was pretty dissapointed, I was hoping for a lot more. The game is pretty much a hollow game right now. The foundation is there, but it looks like Paradox is just going to fill it up with expensive DLC over the next few years. I would not recommend this game to anyone right now...wait till they fix or tweak some issues first.",

Sure the endgame has a couple of problems, but it's a small tidbit in a twelve foot pie.   Now, let's get one thing straight, this game is beautifully designed. The Hud in my view is okay, and has it's share of problems, but at the end of the day it's actually very functional for a strategy game. I would liken it in the way of Shogun 2.   Now the few problems I have with this game, and I'm sure others had is the aforementioned zoom button (the lack of one hotkeyed for laptops)   Some of the ships seems to have different values for their 'cores' and I think an update would fix this, but I have found myself confused on some of them. Like four hangers, being only three, with a large turrent slot.   Also, some of the diplomacy options are very difficult, and unrealistically so. Like if for example.   I have an empire that has literally steamrolled three other empires (one of them much larger than my own.) I have multiple fleets with over 100k in power, and I open my little diplomacy tap, and decide to be a bully.   I find this one empire, has four planets (mine has twenty four.) everything is pathetic compared to mine, and they feel threatened (and since they were in the way of my main prize, a fallen empire whose fleets were way weaker than my own at the moment, that was a legitmate fear.)   I played nice at first, built up some trust, and then demanded they open their borders (Nope.)  I then demanded their alliegance (refer to the open border answer)  They then started saying we were weaker, that we were beastly creatures...and I think you know where that song and dance went.   I had multiple weaker fleets, and I poured in like the reapers did to earth. I'm pretty sure their sheperd died in a science craft trying to run out of the well (it got hounded bya dozen corvettes.)  I got on the comlinks one...last...time, and they once again refused. So, I did what any space emperor would do...utterlly destroyed his enemies.   But, the point is. If you see an empire SIX TIMES YOUR POWER, you feel threatened, but you better be ready to take an out when given. (And they didn't) My compliant is the realism to that situation.   Realistically, they should had surrendered when I demanded the first time around.   However, if that's not fixed...I'll be the reapers of the galaxy I guess.   Anyway, back to the reveiw...sorry.   The music in the game is great, but several mods in the workshop is absoutely amazing, and that's the thing that makes this game better. Mods, MODS MODS MODS! and oh my god isn't their just a healthy plathera of Mother humping mods!   You got starwars, babylon five, Anime, mass effect, fan made, halo, and will someone please make my star ocean mod (The Last Hope...because that game was the greatest JRPG I had ever played.)   Mods in this game added to the fun, and my god aren't some done beautifully. The ship mods are the ones I love the most since (I think) they add dreadnaughts, and carriers. Which are OP.   I had a fleet of five Dreadnaughts, armed with lances, and torpedos. They faced an enemy of over a hundred corvettes, and mutliple frigates and destroyers. The owner of the said huge fleet was a lower tech, but cheap mass producing race that decided they hated me.   My dreadnaughts, and I watched, pick off the units as they came within firing range.

Furthermore the species creator is very interesting, the implications of ethics and the political possibilities that they produce is just great. I do not know in what way that this game is worse than any other 4X game out at the moment.   Masterful Additions Technology - A genius idea of having there be 3 tech trees going at once, Science, Engineering, Social. So you are not waiting around for that 1 technology you are researching to drop, you have three techs on the go all at once. Loved that addition. Unit Builder - I thought that the ship building was actually better than Galactic Civ 3 even though it lacked the sheer customisability of GC3. I found my choices were more significant, and that the ships I was building were more meaningful to me because of it.  Different Species - Oh the different species, and all of their lovely art, and differences. I loved that i can conqure a people who are better adapted to arctic planets and then just deport them off their lush contiental planets to the arctic planets i have not yet fully colonised, so that i can settle my more continentally adapted prime species onto it. I love all the different ethics, and i love how my peoples happiness is so effected by how i behave.    ",

Subsequent playthroughs become less engaging as you come to grasp how the different knobs and levers of governance work. The main issue is the mid-game- there is little to no content in terms of narrative or challenge. You are not facing financial ruin due to a sudden inflation rate, You are not quelling an uprising, or straight up secession apropos of sudden political change too quick to respond to, you are not dealing with terrorists, funded either by malcontents within or without of your borders, you do not have to deal with the continuous challenge of holding your empire together because of competing political blocks (irregardless of whether or not they have any say within your political system). There are no sudden disasters that require delicate bipartisan co-operation between uneasy borders. There is, in short, little to nothing to add more flavour to the game beyond altering the difficulty.  Fleet combat is a numbers game, technological research means nothing in terms of specialisation. There is no subterfuge. Nothing that really gives the 'strat' element to a 'grand strategy'. Even the win conditions are vague at best.  In short, its a game that has a lot of potential and I'm holding out for more, I recommend the game, because at its core, even with all my complaints, I still find myself looking at the clock and wondering where the hell the hours went.",

Enter Stellaris; In many ways the game feels like MOO2 refurbished and upgraded to a 2016 version. Stellaris is what I wish the new MOO could have been: The galaxy is large, the tech tree is laid out in a very nice manner, being more random than the traditional fixed tech trees - and also being dependent on your civilizations' ethics and biology. For example if you start with a scientific materialist ethic and a biology evolved for a tropical world your research options will mirror this: You are more likely to get options to research robotics than spiritually inclined civilizations and you are unlikely to get the opportunity to research colonization of planets with a climate far removed from your own. You are for example unlikely to quickly learn how to colonize tundra planets but more likely to colonize e.g. continental or ocean worlds.  What I do miss are: A more intricate diplomacy system. It is quite good as it is, but it doesn`t fit with the complexity of the game in other respects.  Spying and tech theft would be nice. For example when integrating a vassal empire into your own it would make sense for you to also acquire their technology. Some technology should also be acquired upon conquest of another empire.  There is very little control over what happens in battles. You send your fleet in to duke it out and control appears to be taken over by the AI. You control troop movements on the galactic or solar system levels, but not in a battle.  Still, the game is excellent and I would warmly recommend it to anyone who is fond of 4X games.",

Each of those games left me willing to replay Pax, this one does the opposite, after what I've seen here, I don't want to go back to Pax - it's that good.  Now some praising that you can skip and just go buy this great game: Graphics are decent. You configure your own ships. Diplomacy is great, don't listen to bad reviews, they probably didn't get it. Research is almost like it was in Pax and it's probably the best part. And unlike many other 'space' games here the tech tree actually makes sence. Exploration, surveying, anomalies, random events and so on - you feel that the Universe is alive, it lives and breathes. I mention this not as a generic praising line, it's really the case with this game, events make sence, they don't end at some point and many of those events are the results of decisions that you made.

Originally I played for about 90 minutes and found myself very turned off with the game so I got a refund. Then I had a number of people say that I should have given it longer so I picked it up again. I really wish I hadn't because the game still continues not to be my cup of tea.  Compared to other 4X space games that I own Stellaris (at least for me) ranks near the bottom. It just doesn't have that one more turn sort of feeling. Every minute I spent playing Stellaris was a minute I spent thinking about how much I like the new MoO. I don't know exactly what it is that Stellaris is lacking for me but it just feels so incomplete. I will try to write up an actual review so this is just a place holder but I wanted to just throw it out there that the games is very meh. It isn't horrible but it just doesn't have the soul that I had hoped it would, something that is strange because Paradox strategy games almost always have a ton of soul to them.  I will most likely play another couple hours before I do my actual full review but as of now even after getting a refund then deciding to try again I wish that I had just left well enough alone and hadn't bottered with the game. Maybe like some people have suggested the reason the game feels lacking is that Paradox left out a bunch of things to sell via DLC. If so it is a shame because you have to have a good game before you can 'enhance' it with DLC. EUIV and CK2 are great examples of having a great base game first then improving with DLC later. I just feel that Paradox released a stripped down game instead this go around. Once again I personally enjoy the latest MoO many, many times more and it is still in early access.",

Obviously, the UI is different (YAY SPACE!), but the biggest difference between Civ and Stellaris is the ability to create your own race, and within that race, to customize your ships, armies, and even your home worlds.

            "review_text": "Stellaris is a cross between a traditional 4X game (Civ, Galactic Empires, AoE) and the Grand Strategy genre that Paradox reinvented (Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron).  The latter genre deserves a bit of explanaton. PDX has a reputation for designing incredibly complex games in exhausting historical detail with a legendary learning curve and menu upon menu. But in space, there is no history, and PDX has tamed some of the complexity that puts more casual players off of their other titles.  What remains is still one of the deepest and largest space strategy games ever designed. It includes all of the traditional 4X elements like research, colonization, strategic resources, exploration, etc. But the game goes far deeper: from hundreds of beautifully-scripted random events that you may encounter in the dark corners of space, to endgame crises, first contact with civilizations that crumbled due to their own foolishness long ago, or meeting ones you can help take their first steps into the stars. There are in fact so many game mechanics that they cannot all be listed, but the AI singularity, genetic modification, fully custom ship design, internal politics, and complex cross-galaxy alliances are just a few. There are so many ways to achieve an objective, that there almost is never an obviously correct strategy for any goal.  Stellaris can be played competitively, and often is in random-match multiplayer. But where the game truly shines is in a more creative, role-played form of play. The species creator offers unprecedented freedom relative to anything you may have used before and most players create their own civilization with traits, personality, lore, forms of government, and more, many of which have complex and surprising consequences. You will find yourself becoming attached to your species and more concerned with its own goals and objectives, heroes, alliances, and story, than on conquering the galaxy. After all, a peaceful religious species is going to behave differently than a warmongering dictatorship than an anarcho-capitalist syndicate no matter the so-called victory conditions.  The single-player experience is very deep and complex, and offers a useful sandbox to study the game and try new strategies. AIs have very detectable personalities, from the ruthless militarist to the peaceful trader, religious fanatic, hermit kingdom, corrupt democracy, slave dealer, etc., and they will each evaluate your empire and its policies and actions according to their own ideals and morality.  While random-match multiplayer is possible, at an accelerated speed Stellaris takes on more of a StarCraft flavor. But the traditional way to play Paradox titles is tabletop-style, with an ongoing campaign at a pre-set weekly time over several months. Each group is a little different but may be very competitive, relaxed, diplomatically oriented, or story-focused in nature.  Not all is roses. The midgame is a little boring in timed competitive play. There are several annoying bugs that were missed in the QA process for a game this size. The UX is poor for hunting down that missing strategic resource across the entire galaxy. Some things are too automated, and some things aren't automated enough. And diplomacy is currently a little uninteresting, where 'uninteresting' is code for 'merely Civ-quality' from the grand strategy snobs who are used to far more complex mechanics than the usual stable of alliances, insults, and trade agreements.  The good news is that PDX has a storied history of continuing to develop their games for many years. Crusader Kings has some 11 expansions (priced around $10 on release and less after they go on sale) and is still actively developed in its fourth year. And each expansion arrives with a free sizable patch that adds many mechanics, refinements, and rebalancings even to the base game. The result is MMO-like continual development, but without the fixed monthly subscription. The next three Stellaris patches have already been announced, with 30+ additions tentatively planned in the next few months.  Already Stellaris is a bright star, easily surpassing Civilization, Beyond Earth, and Endless Space in breadth and depth of gameplay. It has not yet reached the pinnacle of strategy of Distant Worlds or Europa Universalis, but it seems destined to eclipse them soon.",

That's why i stopped playing it. Stellaris has a better system and i don't feel insignificant anymore militarily speaking. in fact, i feel like i'm even with other races for military strength.  This game has a great in-game tutorial and it explains everything that you need to know and with humor. I found a ceramic pot floating in orbit around a star. I got the reference instantly and i almost fell of my chair in surprised laughter.   The customization of your race is AWESOME! it's very customizable and lets you decide what you want your race to be with a lot of freedom. Lots of different types of lifeforms with at least 10-15 different variants of each type of lifeform.  i've only played 11 hrs thus far within 2-3 days. i would have more logged in if i didn't have any stupid obligations like a full time career and a full time college to attend and a girlfriend who likes to hold hands or whatever.  in short.

Stellaris lets you establish your own story with your empire. Do you help the survivors of a ship disaster? Will exterminate the species that is still in the machine age next to your home star, or will you nurture their progress and gain a new ally? All of these choices come with consequences and Stellaris doesn't let you forget them. The cherry on the top is that Stellaris generates a Sol system in every galaxy. This system can contain a destroyed Earth, where nuclear weapons have ravaged the planet and pre-sentient cockroaches now roam the wastes, or it can contain Earth in a multitude of states, such as during the world wars or at their discovery of FTL.   In the start, the game is amazing. The dawn of a new age has arrived and you must explore the surrounding systems to discover all in them. Habitable planets? Space drones? Black holes? Who knows! All systems have a history, whether it is a small asteroid collision with an alien craft 12 million years ago, or a tomb world that foreshadows the return of a big mistake. The game plays more like a story, with you itching to discover the next habitable world or anomaly.   First contact is especially exciting, as you find a ship of a unknown design, you must decipher communications and establish relations with a empire that wishes to build a federation or an empire that wants to exterminate all alien life in the galaxy. All the empires have personalities based on their ethos (individualistic, materialist, spiritualist, militarist, xenophobic, ect) that determine their behavior throughout the game. The Fallen empires are exciting too, with their superiority reigning over every empire in the galaxy. Will they awaken to fight a great threat? To unite the galaxy? Or to dominate it?   Stellaris is less about the gameplay (which is still wonderful) and more about the story. It creates a relationship between you and your empire and soon, you find yourself a part of a galactic community that responds actively.  With the addition of the Horizon Signal, it is a must get.",

Multiplayer is probably what most people should do in this game as you can make your own diplomacy as you go with the other human players.   The AI is severely lacking, and it will decide you are one of three things:  A. a threat in the first 50 or so years and declare war on you (about one time in the game I've yet to see an AI who lost a war attack again). or B. not worth noticing and will be completely passive towards you or C. an ally at which point it will never break the alliance throughout entire game.

I can't really figure out why certain techs become available to research and others aren't. In my last game I needed better reactors on my ships in order to power better weapons and shields but they never came up in the research options and I have no idea why. The technology tree is far more fluid than in games like Civ or other MOO clones and there's no way to see where you are on it, what tech's unlock others or why certain ones aren't available to be researched. I find this very annoying because it makes the research tree a bit of a crap shoot.  Diplomacy tends to be my least favorite part of these kinds of games because it usually defies all logic. There's a distinct lack of feedback on why another empire dislikes me. I get declared a rival very early in many games and then they declare war on me saying that I'm the hostile one when I've done nothing but colonize worlds and build mining and research stations in surrounding star systems. I've done nothing aggressive at all that I can determine. I've had races that declared rivalries and then war within a few years of meeting me.

Diplomacy is rather simple and the universe feels more like a randomly generated place, where solar systems, anomalies and so on are distributed evenly over space. While this would lead actually to a negative review, there are some items, which surprised me positively, like research system (where there is a tiny random factor inside in tech tree, because you cannot choose completely freely from all techs, you want to work on) or fighting, where you can see projectiles, hits and direct battle impact of your weapons and battle technologies. Therefore it made it for me still a positive experience.",

Plus: blob to your heart's contenct. Also, you won't have many problems with the interface, the buttons are right there where you expect them to be.  - Appoint leaders much like you would appoint chancellors, stewards etc. And succession plays a role in the leadership too! Though not the kill-all-the-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-nephews-and-marry-a-Viking kind of succession issues.  - It's less deep than CK2, by which I primarily mean no long-term thinking. Where in CK2 you somethimes had to keep track of 100 family members and plan your strategy for generations to come, in Stellaris it's more 'in the moment'.  - Naming stuff! If you're a fan of naming stuff, including people, planets, empires, ships, you name it (heh) - you can name them all!  - Idle waiting.... I major draw-back for many Stellaris players is that a lot of the game is spent waiting, at a certain point. Luckily for us CK2 players, we're used to waiting until King John the VII'th is finally of age and can marry the Pope's sister.  - Finally, CK2 was all diplomacy. This is a lot less powerful in Stellaris. There are fewer factors that can influence relations with other species/empires. Stellaris is more resource management than people management, so be prepared for that.   Final note: The (in)famous 'Can You Run It' website told me that absolutely no way I could run it. That's nonsense: running without lag at high graphics.",

There isn't anything glaringly wrong that should prevent you from buying it at some point. Just for the moment, it's not all there.  I will use a Not Recommended tag for now, only because I do not think Stellaris is finished yet. Once it is patched up, this review will change if it's good to go.  Here are the PROs that I found - The music is quite grand and fitting. I never felt like I needed to disable it. - The nations and species are diverse. You'll find species based off of humanoids, avians, bugs, and so on, and those species break further into sub categories. In a galaxy, the main empires will mostly not be alike the other. You can potentially find a primitive race that seems to be similar to an existing empire, but that's a believable idea anyway. The nations themselves will be fairly diverse as well, from democratic soceities to xenophobic nations of faith to reclusive nations. -The options for elimitating micromanagement are a good idea (more on that below) -The beginning of the game is full of exploration, quests, and danger. You'll start by exploring your system and the neighboring system, finding anomalies and resources on other planets. These discoveries can also lead to quest lines that reveal more about the galaxy, such as a story line of a long lost race. - End game crisis is an excellent idea and allows for a legitimate ending instead of 'Ding, got conquest victory, done.' - It has space cows.  Cons: - This is galaxy full of implied activity. However, if you are looking at everything, it's quite dead. Capitol planets, for example, have absolutely no visual activity around the planet despite being potentially a galactic center for commerce. There should be visual elements added to increase the feeling of a large empire. For example, civilian and trader ships that you cannot interact with moving from sector to sector. - Horrendously dumb AI. They will send colony ships everywhere without actually using them, or transport boats with foot soldiers that never land. This also extends to AI used for determining pop migration. On a recently conquered planet (inlcludes the -25% happiness debuff for recently conquered), despite being super unhappy with the situation, will williningly migrate to a planet controlled by the conquerer. - You cannot 'fail' a first contact, it just happens. When another species or nation meets you for the first time, how that interaction will play out is already decided. They either like you already or they do not. There is no challenge in first contact, and it ends up being a chore. This is because the decision of the other nation party is decided by the traits that you picked at the start of the game. For example, a democratic nation will start off as friends with another democratic nation, whereas slave nation will be hated by the freedom nation. -Your responses to primitive civilization events (such as reaching the Steam Age) is almost literally 'That's nice.' There is no other purpose. -If a primitive civilization exits the early space age and reaches your level, they instantly are granted the entire system if you do not already have a colony or frontier outpost. This inludes any mining/research/observation you have in that system. The primitive civilization already appears to be very familiar with the galaxy, as there is absolutely no benefit to being the first one to contact them. There are uplifting mechanics you can do, to manipulate the civilization to get to the space age faster, but what if you do not want to meddle with their progress until they reach the stars? - While the end game crisis is an excellent idea, it is not executed well. For example, I ran into the robotic uprising crisis. This did not happen within my borders since I refused to take on robotic pops. However, my neighboring federation ally did. However, that nation took absolutely no steps to retake the systems or even prevent it from getting worse. In my efforts to free the nation from the robotic overlords, I tried to give systems I liberated back to the ally, only to find that they then went back and put robots back on the planet and lost it again to the uprising. Furthermore, I only wanted to get rid of the robots, but since this is the same thing as taking over a planet by hostility, it also destroys the planets atmosphere (for example, a tropical planet will become a tundra planet). This made any further attempts to free my ally to be not worth the effort. - Sector management is almost punishment for making a large empire. The idea is that it will do all the planet management for you, but it quite honestly has no clue how to do that. You just have to cross your fingers and hope they do contribute to pop happiness. I am ok with a system to manage multiple planets at once, but I also need to be able to control that system easier. - Upgrading ships needs to be reworked. It is currently not beneficial to upgrade fleets as the amount of time to upgrade them is basically a rebuild. - Foot soldiers need to be able to be healed while in orbit of a friendly planet. You have to land armies on a planet in order for them to heal. This is tedious when your army is larger than the planet can handle. - Trading Star Charts causes you to not see the discovered primitive civilizations until they achieve the space age. - Democratic nations need more customizations. I made the mistake of supporting a presidential canidate only to then discover that this causes the leader to never lose an election and ended up serving 11 presidential terms before finally dying of old age. There needs to be controls on how the democratic elections are run. - There is no more space exploration once you discover a few nations around you. Unless if you negotiate border access with them, you are boxed in. If you do become friends with them, they will spam you with Star Chart trades to the point you've 'explorered' the entire galaxy.   Stellaris is also quite buggy for the moment. Here are some: - I had an Admiral that reached 186 years old, with a death chance of 104%. He is still alive at this time and leading my main fleet. - If a system changes hands while you cannot see it, you enter the system to find stations in space with no owner and tells you to research an alien race that doesn't exist. - If you trade star charts with another civilization and they discovered a primitive civilization, you can't see their civilization, only the fact that they exist on the planet. If you try to put an observation post on the planet, you cannot control it as it says you do not own the observation post. - IF another nation also has researched the ability to put Xenos in positions of leadership to the point of being the face of the nation, the Diplomacy screen will refer to them as the wrong species, causing confusion. For example, it will show a human as an avian migratory flock if a human is their president. - If you play as the United Nations of Earth pre-made nation, you may find another Sol, planet Earth, and humans, all identical to your own. I ended up needing to rename this new Sol and Earth just to avoid confusion. - You may accidentally put a Pre-Sentient species in control of a system. If you conquer a planet, a faction of pre-sentient beings may appear at which point you can grant them independence, even though they are marked as pre-sentient. I had a nation of Snakeoids put an embassy on my world even though I'm pretty sure they cannot read, speak, think.        There isn't anything wrong with the idea behind the game. I think it's all there, it mostly needs tweaking. I'm sure I will be seeing a lot more of this game some day. For now, I'll wait for the next major patch.",

            "review_text": "Ah... Great game for many reasons listed in all the positive reviews stated here. Let me start off by saying that I agree with most of them.   However, I have to give this game a negative review and NOT recommended it. This is why this game didn't work for me, and if you can relate, may not work for you, even though there are a lot of positives, the two following reasons are why you should save your money:  THE FIRST REASON IS THE TECH TREE: The tech tree is not a tech tree per say where you can plan your empire's technology by following a strategic path determined by you, like in other similar games we are accustomed to. The tech tree in this game is like a deck of cards, where each cards represent a technology, divided into three different stacks. Each turn you get to choose from three different options within these three stacks. Sometimes you get rare cards (rare techs), and the deck is 'stacked' in the sense that for example, at the begining of the game, the likelyhood of you getting critical required techs is much higher, so that you do not start at a disadvantage. The logic behind this from the developer is to have every game feel like a different one, since you can not choose your techs, but must work from the random draw of cards. The reality is that makes the game less fun. Let's say you want to play your empire a certain way, for the sake of this example, you want to play it as an economic pacifist nation. You need to improve your hydroponic farms to improve food output in your colonies. In previous type games with a regular tech tree, you would research the path that leads to the technology strategically required for your empire. With this system, imagine you keep getting military related technologies in the draw. You are therefore OBLIGED to research military technologies. You can't improve what you strategically had planned for your empire, therefore you are forced to adjust and end up not being able to play your empire the way you wanted to. The whole point of a game like this is to be able to create something you want, and to have success doing it. If you plan a strategy, but the game doesn't give you the techs that go with that strategy, you must change it. Bottom line is that you end up playing a way you didn't want to, and that's no fun. At least it wasn't for me. There are other ways to create a challenge, I feel that not letting you go the direction you want to (which does indeed create a challenge, but an artificial one) is not the way to do so. It’s like creating a challenge in Mario Bros where Mario sometimes doesn’t jump the way you want him to. Yes the game is harder, but is it fun? I certainly don’t think so. I like to roleplay my empire, and I like to decide which way it goes, not have the game do it for me.  THE SECOND REASON IS YOU ARE FORCED TO RELEGATE CONTROL OF YOUR COLONIES TO THE AI: Yes you read that right. You can only control a certain number of colonies (4 or 5!!!!) and the rest have to be put into sectors, and given to the AI to control! Yes you can give general direction to the AI, but you can NOT micromanage your empire if you wish to do so! You MUST relinquish those colonies. In other games the options is there as a convenience, when your empire gets too big and you wish to focus on your fronts. Then you the player, can decide if you want to or not. In this game, this is forced on to you, which is a very strange decision that I do not understand. I don’t see how in a strategy game this is something the player would want.  These two factors, which are both things that remove choice from the player, are game breakers for me. It means that my empire is not truly mine to control, and all the other great features just makes these two annoyances even worst, because I realise what a great game this could be, if only the game would let me rule my empire the way I intend to.  Hope this helps.",

            "review_text": "In it's current state, Stellaris is far too rough to be great. It isn't bad, it just isn't really meeting expectation for me.  First, the midgame drags just incredibly. Once you stop having things to explore, or at least a point to exploring them, the universe loses a lot of it's charm. To add to this, quite a few of the event chains i've run into have been bugged and are uncompletable or uncontinuable past a point - I have completed the objectives, but they just sit unfinishable in the event log. Past the first 150 years or so, the game slows massively (just processing time-wise) on the default-sized galaxy, adding to the feeling of drag.  The AI isn't aggressive at all, or at least hasn't been in my game, so I have only been in wars I have started. All fleets seem to be largely the same speed, and the retreat option is extremely powerful, so actually chasing down a fleet that uses the same travel method as yours is almost impossible. My transports have also been unupgradable, so while my fleet's warp ranges have increased, I can't actually bring troops to land on the planets I bombard - all I can do is chase down every military ship and station until the enemy surrenders, which is painstaking and a bit boring.  The UI is very clunky in places - the 'e' (galaxy map/system view toggle key) only works properly if you have the system highlighted 'perfectly', so I often end up snapping the camera to somewhere that feels utterly random. There is no way to center the map on a fleet in the galaxy map, only in the zoomed/system view, after which you have to rely on the toggle key to hopefully leave you still looking at your fleet. The research screens do not indicate when you have more than 4 research options very clearly, so it is very easy to miss until you get into the habit of trying to scroll 'just in case'. There is no event log, so it is very easy to miss things if you accidentally clicked through something or want to remember what just happened. It does not seem possible to change the notifications at the top of the screen like it is in other Paradox games, so there is no way to add pauses on important events, nor is there any way to hide the dozens of 'hostile fleet detected' popups during a war whenever you detect a science ship or single corvette, apart from just clicking them all away.  I trust Paradox to make this extremely good in the coming months, but I regret trusting them enough to preorder this. It needs a serious dose of patches before it should be honestly recommended.",

This is a barebones game that failed to deliver a solid foundation to build DLC and content upon. I'd argue the only thing it got right was economy, which is superficial and simple at best, sometimes very tedious but otherwise well thought out.  This is a game that i FULLY expect to rewrite the review into a positive one as the developers take time to clean up the ♥♥♥♥, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI and user experience. They delivered a relatievly bug-free game but they didn't deliver a good game or a polished one. It's a game that's not in any way balanced and it's missing some of the most obscene quality of life improvements for the user. It's not a bad game for the first 10, 20, 30, 40 or maybe even 50 hours but the more you play, the more you find design decisions and non-existant balance in terms of warfare, non-existant AI in terms of combat and the 'blobing' of ships as the only strategy unforgivable.  This was a rushed product. What you're buying is an early beta. A product that was not meant to be released but was to keep a deadline. This is an   Early Acess title .  Here are the things you'll learn to hate about this game if you purchase it.      HORRIBLE AI. Even playing on Hard or Insane, the AI is just bad. What it gets is insane handicap bonuses. It doesn't outsmart you, it outbrutes you.     Horrible BALANCE. Corvettes are by far the most powerful Hull size. Everything else is OBSOLETE. Among weapons, nothing can light a candle to Lazors in a fair fight. Always use the smallest weapon module with the highest accuracy lazor. Missiles can be shot down by point defence and missiles and cannons result in insane overkills. The larger the module is, the less accurate it is. If you're happy with only hitting 1% of your shots, take the big dakkas but you'll lose. Stack evasion and hit% on corvettes. It's ungodly, unsightly and a complete blashphemy for a strategy games.    The only strategy this game has is to take the largest possible fleet of corvettes and stick it up your opponents behind and anihhalate their fleet. Wars are decided in a single fight with both empires and allies fielding the largest blob of corvettes possible. Once the fight is over, if anyone got substantially ahead, the war is also over. because of the game balancing decisions. The greater the difference in strenght, the greater the pummeling the loser will recieve. The difference can be tiny, a fraction of both forces and yet one side can come out with an overwhelming advantage. Advantage that is not due to weapon decisions, armor, shield or engines. An advantage given by the broken combat system.    And yes, combat is UGLY. They fit a fleet of hundreds of ships in a tiny metal ball, ignoring collisions, safety distance or sides and shoot at eachother at range where they could hold hands from one hull to another with missed weapons (as if any could miss) flying from the center like fireworks.    I've only touched upon the combat, because it's one of the most agrevious insults to the buyers of this game. It's a game with a lot of promise and i expect i'll play it a lot. After they manage to fix it and i dump some 60 bucks into DLC i suppose. Most of all, i'm dissapointed. Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, they're practically useless when a corvette dodges enemy weapons 99% of the time with good technology. Corvettes are so broken, other ships don't even come close.",

The 7-8 hours I have on record are not the full extent of my experience.  I love this game.  Don't buy it.   The game uses only a single CPU core to calculate everything. There's a lot of things to calculate. It's a realtime 4X game, after all. This on it's own would not be an issue, however, it does severely limit the amount of things you can process without it slowing the game down to a crawl.  And it does. Often.  Currently, the game has several crippling performance issues, caused not only by it's engine not having proper multithreading, but several problems from the game's AI, such as sectors shuffling pops endlessly. Which, by the way, the devs promised to fix by release. They didn't.  Currently, on my system that far passes by the requirements, I can only play the game at about 20 frames per second, with the game's simulation speed slowing down to at least 1/5th of it's speed. While the game is definitely not unplayable, playing on Fastest in the endgame pretty much results in playing it on Slower. Core 5 is taxed 100%, while all other cores are entirely unused.  The only way I could get this game to function at a reasonable speed is by overclocking my CPU to over twice it's capacity, up to 6.8GHz (!!!), however, unless you're cooling your system with  liquid freaking nitrogen , this is not feasible.  Do not buy this game in it's current state, if you can't put up with this. I can, and I'll suck it up, because I love the game that much. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, I can't recommend it to anyone.  Note how I have not actually talked about the game itself. Have you played a Space 4X? You've played Stellaris. The genre is slim pickings, and quite frankly, in the current state of the genre, Stellaris is the most well designed one in terms of theme, aesthetics, and gameplay.  But it runs like ♥♥♥♥. And it probably will continue to do so, until the devs finally decide to retire this old, awful engine, and make one from scratch that can actually multithread.  If you can stomach this, play it.

The AI is as dumb as a doorknob    There is barely any content      The AI:  So often there are AI ships stuck in a system not moving anywhere, even when that empire is under immediate threat. If you click on the fleet, it will show that it is beginning to warp to another system, but then tries to warp to a different one, and it sits there flipflopping between the two. I managed to defeat my first major battle, despite me being severly underpowered, because I exploted this by attacking two systems on either side of the empires main fleet.  When you declare war, every other empire within your control (including allys), 'look to you for wisdom'. By that, they turn your highest 'power' fleet into a deathball by following it with their entire army. This is so moronic that even if the enemies begin bombarding their planets, their main fleet will still follow you around like they are on a leash. Now, this is helpful in some circumstances. You can take out some much more powerful enemies when you have a few empires worth of ships all attacking the same target, but come on, it would have made much more sense to split up and attack some different targets, especially in the end game when you outpower everything.  God forbid, if you decide to join a Federation with your Alliance. It works by giving each member a 5 year turn at being leader. They get to choose who to go to war with and what the demands will be in the case of victory. When it came my turn I found myself declaring war on 4 lesser empires just so we would still be at war for at least part of their turn, because in the 100 or so years that I was in a Federation, I think we declared war on two other empires, and had them declare war once on us. In all 3 circumstances, the AI leader would set the demands to liberate a few enemy planets. The problem with this is that the liberated planets still take a lot of work to befriend, so it's usually easier to just declare war on them and cede them like the AI should have done in the first place. Liberating planets is literally the dumbest move you could do in your war demands as it just prolongs an already severly drawn out game.   The Content:  I probably spent 2/3 of this game on the fastest speed setting,  AFK , as I waited for things to happen. The first few hours of the game are pretty interesting, your borders are under immediate threat and you have a lot to get done, but after that, basically nothing can threaten you. There are a few quests that pop up, and   an alien race will invade at some point  , but they are few and far between and even the few that I did get were pretty much bugged and uncompletable. A game where I sit around waiting for things to happen (and I can't make things happen because the terrible AI doesn't know how to control a federation when it's their turn) is not fun to play at all.  All in all, this game feels like it should have been early access and given another few months for playtesters to give the devs something to work on.",

Sadly this promise, like Trump's, is one that is full of hot air, because Stellaris is a remarkably bland 4X game. I am a huge fan of Paradox and their strategy games. I have never played any game with the feeling of depth and stories unfolding that Crusader Kings 2 has. So it is all the more sad to see this game lack anything like it.  -The choice of species is entirely cosmetic, and except for humans, males and females look exactly the same. -The diplomacy is static and unengaging, mostly consisting of trying to make the aliens like you better (which is damn hard unless you happen to share political traits with their civillization). -The 'storytelling' (which Paradox usually excel at) consists of a few random events. -The tech research consists of 'pick one of these three choices and hope you get somewhere good'  I could go on and on, but to sum it up: the game lacks depth, variation and most importantly, soul.  Now, this being Paradox, I know that they will of course roll out DLC's that will improve the product a lot. And there are already a lot of great workshop mods out there, but without a complete overhaul, this will never be 'CK2 in space'. If what you are looking for is a generic space 4X with great community support but not much story though, this is for you. Otherwise...wait for a DLC that will make it worth the price.

Well, buy another game. There are basically no options at all (besides turning the music on and off) - no reassigning of fastkeys etc. .   The ui is a mess. for example: there is a list of all the other empires. I would expect to get to the diplo screen by clicking on one - nope. You have to search the map and click your way through - thats 90% of the gameplay, It´s a new genre: click´n´search. No ledger, no mapmodes. You want to know, if there are unhappy citizens in your empire? Just click on every planet. Whos allied to whom? click, click, click.  The ui is poorly designed, especially when you consider, that it is made by paradox (lot of experience in strategy games) and not by some 12 year old kickstarter newbies.  All about luck. Your leaders traits influence the game big time. Your leader has weak traits? bad luck. Your starting system has no resources? Too bad. You dont get the tech you need? oh well (it took 35 years, before i was allowed to build bigger ships). Your explorer fails all the time, even with 93% success rate? nothing we can do.  Diplomacy went back to the basics. You like me, you good. I want fire, ugh. Really wonder, how they couldn´t be embarrased by that poor performance. Worse than the original civ.  The 'discovery' missions are 99% useless, a complete waste of resources, if you dont know, which to pick.   You will spend the first few hours micromanaging your planets, explorers and constructors (click, click, click). No production chain, or a 'build-that-as-soon-as-there-are-enough-resources'. Assigning sectors doesn´t really help. I gave them (3 different sectors) the task to earn energy (credits, money), gave them resources to help them grow, and they built spaceports. After that they upgraded the spaceports. Good job.  You get punished for success. The more population your empire has, the slower you tech up, for example. Which makes perfect sense, because reasons. You´re getting punished for exploring. You just want to expand and discover and don´t want to focus on military in the beginning? Have some space pirates. You want to play without space pirates? Just go to the option menu and turn off the music.  In the endgame I was thinking: do i really want to spend resources and clicking on building another colony, when it wont help much, but seriously harm my tech? why would i want to fight that empire? The game doesn´t fell rewarding. It´s more like: 'great you achieved x, you really earned a kick in the nuts.' (some achievements are bugged, but getting achievements didn´t really help.)  There has to be some kind of AI somewhere, but it´s really hard to find. The game is way to easy, because the AI behaves like a toddler. Good thing they´re cheating resources and tech, otherwise the ai would destroy itself, before you´re even able to attack.  This game might be interesting for roleplayers, who want a very slow paced game, with a lot of pointless clicking. But it just isn´t a grand strategy game. It´s the incestuous son of ck and eu, hidden away in a dungeon, screaming: ESMERALDAAA, playing hide and seek with his own snot and loses.  So if you like clicking, but flappy bird is too fast paced, if you have been overwhelmed by the option menu of super mario world and really hate it, when any of your decisions have influence on the gameplay and you love gambling in online casinos, this is THE game for you.

I had taken my new colonies too close to their border and so they comanded me to give up those colonies. I accepted and lost this colonies but the border wasnt retreating.  So after a while the Fallen Empire comanded me again to give up more colonies and so on. After repeating this 4-5 times i gave up this session.  The next game (1.3) i conquered around 2/3 the galaxy and was fighting a awakened fallen empire. They had already conquered two other Fallen Empires and some NPC realms and they had a huge military strenght. So i produced an armada of 340k military strenght. In the first fight i could destroy the 160k+ forces of the awakened Fallen Empire. Problem was... i couldnt split my armada now, because i didnt got the 'ship window' anymore, when i activate this fleet. It works with construction and sience ships, but not with my armada.   It eats up around 2.6k ressources each, so i have not enough to build up new forces fast enough to fight the small fleets of the fallen empire and it slows the game really bad. So there is only one option that makes sense, to stop playing this session... again ;(  Because of this i cant recommended Stellaris, till Paradox takes bug fixing seriously.

But this game has now replaced my favorite strategy game, and THIS is now my favorite space-strategy-game! Not only has this game let me make my own empire, which is pretty sweet, I am also able to play it in a multiplayer game, as if it was already pre-determined to be in the game! So add that, plus many other features, like more realistic galaxy creation than Sins of a Solar Empire, and you've got yourself an instant favorite right here!  So buy this game! You deserve it.",

I like both but the new Moo feels like a child/candy version of Stellaris now.  Currently, as of this writing 32-11-2016, the crisis are most of the time a Game Over. Which is not so bad in itself since, as with many Paradox titles, there is no 'real' end game. Yes, yes. you can conquer the galaxy and get a You win screen. Which is really tedious with the inability to conquer more than four, five of solar systems at a time.  But with all the things your explorer can discover the different events unfolding and the crisis, I seem to always be attracted back to start a new game.

The stellaris mod community is big, so there is a lot of content to add if you feel like something was missing or if you like, say, star wars, star trek, there are conversion mods out there ;)  Cons: The game towards middle game it's a bit slow, the lack of army customization, the small variety of military ships.

Stellaris is, without a doubt, the easiest (grand) strategy game from Paradox to date. It is a good thing because other games such as Europa Universalis IV, Hearts of Iron IV or Crusader Kings 2 can be a bit too difficult for new players. It is not to say that this game is easy when you are playing it on harder difficulties. Sure, it can be a bit wonky and sometimes AI acts a bit strange but overall Stellaris is still being polished and, knowing Paradox, will continue to be in years to come.  As with other major strategy games from Paradox, you are allowed to create and install mods. From a simple cosmetic mod to major total conversions and various fixes, balances - if vanilla game does not suit you and you are able to create or find a mod that changes this one, frustrating little mechanic... than it is as simple as pressing this subsribe button. Very easy and very helpful.  I am sure that many other reviews say what I have just said. It is worth repeating however as it is my belief that Stellaris is worth its price. Sure, when you have played it long enough you start to notice a lot of repeated events (planet discoveries etc.) and your performance of the game is getting worse with each passing decade but that is the nature of those games. If you can forgive those small nuisances than you are going to really enjoy Stellaris.",

This is a recommendation, sincerely, but as truly fantastic and engrossing as this game is, it may well not be for everyone, for a couple reasons.  Stellaris is difficult to define even when compared to other games of it's kind. It bears the most in common with other grand strategy games, but is quite the departure, and at least marginally more acessible to the newcomer.  It is, essentially, a simulation of species, from the first steps outside of their solar system, to whatever future you make for them. Be it conquering and enslaving or seeking to form a federation for the ages, your options (and customizations) are vast.   Gameplay early on can be dreadfully slow, sending out your little science ship and learning more about your surroundings, but ultimately the second you colonize your second world, build your second ship, meet a neighbor, it starts to ramp up and doesn't stop. By the midgame you've got potentially dozens of planets, ships, surveying, each planet needing to be micromanaged into what buildings it has, all while desinging vessels to counter your neighbors.. it's a treat. It's a real time game, but much like FTL, the ability to pause is used frequently to stay sane.  It is, again, not saying this lightly, my favorite game of all time, and I shall be playing it indeed for the REST of all time.  The DLC in my opinion is skippable but also really highly enjoyable!",

Then you look to EU4 or CK2, and you know the game is gonna be great 2 years down the line, in fact, you can already SEE how good this game is gonna be while still playing this basic framework.  Every big patch is bringing new stuff to table and does not shy away from redesigning core elements, in my opinion so far for the better. While there is still a lot to do (my biggest gripe is still that endgame crises are not formal wars and thus the AI is unable to recognize them as enemies and doesnt do jack against the doomstacks of extragalactic invaders) I'm positive the game is only going to become better as time progresses.",

Having played multiple empires with a variety of crisis events and endings, I've experienced the whole spectrum the game offers. It starts out exciting, then mid game it almost dies. Till the galactic crisis hits your systems, it's mostly an arms race to amass the largest military and declaring war on nearby nations. A peaceful or trader playstyle would be almost impossible I imagine.  If they could add civilian traders and other aspects of commerce and trade to the galactic economy like some of the mods in the workshop offer, it'd definitely give the player more activities to do during the dead silence of the mid game. I also wish they'd make the planetary building construction automatic.  All that said, I love the game. It was my first 4X game, but I've had experience in the RTS genre (Tiberian Sun) that drew me to this game. My overall recommendation is it's a great game, but if you're used to another fully fleshed out 4X, then wait for a year or two when they have time to release updates, new content &amp; DLCs.",

But then it is a paradox game and the patches i've seen so far have fullfilled my expectations: more events ,depper story short more fun and potenial for infitive hours of fun. As any good paradox grand stragy game this will grow with every month and dlc. Sure the prices are to high but every dlc is a new game you buy, because at this level you dont need a new game to get into after 300 hours of learning time, now you need 50 hours of new learning time to enjoy a new rule set, with expanded graphic and more settings for only 9,99 for both. Which sounds like mound but think again... you'll play over 100 hours so you'll pay less then 2 cents per hour.. no there is no better Deal. Where I'am going is-- Stellaris is not an close to perfect Game right now.. but it's the closest du a Space-Faring-Grand-Strategy Game why have. And in the Grand-Strategy-Genre it's without that cut one of the best.. and it will be better with every day. Like a good cheese or a whine. Because Paradox loves it's Games!

Some Notes: (Why I do not recommend this game at the current time)  -Late Game content consists of only one of three different scenarios, after dealing with them the game becomes EXTREMELY boring.  -Early Game has a lot of potential with events, anomalies, exploration and fending off space monsters and pirates.  -Mid Game does not exist. I have yet to see any Mid Game events specifically engage during the Mid Game.   -Diplomacy is very interesting and it is fun dealing with so many different AI personalities. That being said, there is a large lack of diplomacy options. I feel as if hitting a progression wall is very easy in this game. You either conquer someone straight away or conquer them later.   -Federations a a lot of fun, but once they are formed there is little to do with them. They help out a lot but there is no peaceful way to take over your federation.   -All in all this game is still worth the buy, but I am getting frustrated waiting for hot fixes, patches and DLCs that should have just been part of the original game. I would recommend waiting for a few DLCs to be released before trying out Stellaris, as to avoid a lot of frustration.\\  Edit: I'm seeing a few nice updates that keep being released for this game. Nothing to the point where I would say it is worth the buyy, but I am hopeful that soon Stellaris will feel like a fully fleshed out game.",

All you have to do is ensure your fleet is well armed and that they can take a punch.   The diplomacy is pretty simple, similar to that of civilzation but less 'I'LL MURDER YOUR FACE FOR NO REASON!' It's been handled well enough for what the game is.   Graphically the game is simple, but beautiful. Zooming in up close to ships and planets reveals a lack of high quality graphics, but what were we to expect? When viewed from afar it is beautiful.   Multiplayer is well handeled.

It works great in single player, and from the limited experience I've had in multiplayer it works just as well. Though I can see the hassle of dealing with people who pause the game every 30 seconds. In multiplayer getting a pop-up doesn't pause the game.  The inability to alter the control scheme is a bit unfortunate, but it is simple enough that you don't really need to. The only thing I found that I wanted to do was change the pause button from space to my mouse.  Research is quite unique in the way it has been presented. There are 3 types of research, each with a large amount of tech trees. However being able to research a specific tech tree all comes down to chance. Each researcher is presented between 3-whatever choices. Typically three. Each choice is randomized after a tech is researched. This requires the player to pick and choose which tech is more important to them. Do they go for the research that allows them to build destroyer sized ships? Or do they instead get defense stations?     10/10 would pre-order again. I don't see myself playing anything else for awhile. As I paly the game I may change my recommendation, but as is it's a thumbs up. Get it, the price is worth it.  ",

Even Sol system seems like a huge space, that needs exploring.  The game is a certain base, and knowing Paradox - we're going to get loads of amazing DLC's. But one thing that has to be mentioned is the almost infinite modability of the game. I am assuming, that in the couple next months we're gonna get many great mods, including total conversions (and I am keeping my fingers crossed for Star Trek, and hopefully Star Trek vs. Star Wars mods :) ).  Basically - if you are into the 4X genre, if you know what amazing things Paradox can make, if you're a sci-fi fan - just buy this game - you will not be dissapointed.",

If you like a 4x-ish game with more diplomacy and less mindless fleet mashing, this is the game for you. (Don't worry, there is still plenty of fleet-mashing). They do an amazing job of making you care about your empire and species. There are lots of great things about this game from top to bottom, but because of that, lets talk about what's still missing:  Could use a bit more internal politics to keep you looking inward and not only trying to expand outward. the uprising/faction system still feels a little too easy to handle. Could use more traits for leaders and such to keep characters feeling more dynamic(Especially negative traits). The sector system is great and really smart, but it becomes hard to do anything with systems in a sector, there should be an expandable tab to let you look into a sector from the empire menu. overall the game starts really strong and dynamic, and then can leave you hanging a bit in the middle if you're not trying to murder anyone/everyone. Could use trade/espionage systems, and maybe a few more diplomatic options to really put the last nail in the 'our Diplomatic system is better' coffin.  At the end of the day, this is THE BEST space-empire-strat out there, and it's only going to get better. I'd put my $2 on Paradox already working on most of these feature improvements for the next big update.",

But it's not because of the awesome ship designs(which still REQUIRE a coloring feature) and the various species you can play as, but rather because of the little ways it brings the immersive part of your brain to life. If you try to play this in a roleplaying fashion, and not in the 'I named my plant species The Weed Bros lol' fashion, then you'll quickly find yourself coming up with snippets of everyday life in your homegrown empire. You'll think of all the conspiracy theorists on that frontier planet after your leader is mysteriously reelected for the fifth time(even if you just really need his fleet-building trait), you'll picture grand parades as your rookie admiral(who has the arm-chair commander trait) leads your fleet to victory and you'll be thrusted into a darkened conference room next to your fellow alien peers as they whisper about 'purging' those troublesome fanatical spiritualists who have been protesting on a planet rich in minerals vital to your fleet construction(causing literally no gameplay hindering effects other than a differently colored happiness bar).  I've never actually finished a game, my computer can't handle the armadas that everyone has towards the endgame, but I still keep making new games because I love the immersive value. There's more to just a game grid with a galaxy color scheme, there's more to planets than their sizes. The game doesn't pull you into an immersive experience, you won't even notice the transition.  For example, on my first playthrough I had a mining station on an asteroid in a middle of nowhere system. As I researched more and more, that asteroid turned out to hold a bunch of strategic resources. Lucky me, right? Then my neighbors, peace loving tapeworms, colonized a nearby planet and suddenly I no longer owned that asteroid. By this time I had found another exo-planet with equal value, but I went to war over this asteroid. The game refused to let me name the war, but I always refer to it as the 'War of the Rock'. The War of the Rock took twenty years, and saw the tapeworms lose twelve admirals before sneaking a fleet by my lines and bombarding my home planet. My population enraged and my key fleet-building station compromised, I gave my last admiral the divine blessings and ordered him to punch right into the tapeworm home system and lay waste. The War of the Rock resulted in a single asteroid's mining rights return to its previous owners and a Democratic Utopia crumble under the weight of rampant genoicde carried out by my vengeaful populace.  This is one possibility of interactions with an empire you encounter on the playing field. Gameplay wise, I could have conceded for economic reasons but I didn't. It wasn't a game then, and I still had 22 more Empires to interact with while the crime of genoicde hung over my empire. That's 22 potential space epics for you as well. And Paradox is doing all it can to help you make even more, because YOU'RE the storyteller in this one.  9/10, needs ship coloring and war naming. Oh wait; 11/10, makes up for it in endless entertainment derived from just staring at a planet grow and thinking of the horse colonists working side by side with robots and tentacled neighbors.",

From ancient space battle of imense size near jungle planet with strange small moon near it, to the plant pot placed precisely on orbit....just WHY ? The thing´s are not alway´s on orbit or on planet after it´s discovery. Your colonist may find a sealed vault, filled probably with treasures of immense size. You have just to ignore bloodlusting, geneticaly modified creatures that swarm´s of vault. Just ignore them, not like they will take over planet and butcher everyone on it. This is the part you can just play and then write a bestseller book about it. Mid game is relatively balanced as stronger empires are slowly swalowing smaller and less powerfull, or unfortunate races. This is the time where your technology is reaching interesting level and ship designer comes in play. It is glorious. With very little explanation like in real life. Like this laser has bonus againts armor, this mass driver is firing faster and this rocket is rocket. You thing rocket is best ? Try going againts ships with point defense systems. Nobody told you that they exist ??? Well its a shame that you are uncivilized uneducated savage. (this is a joke, to be uneducated, you still have to develop some technologies) The late game is lot of status quo. Nobody wants to attack anybody, just a bit of smaller empire here a bit of smaller empire there. Like modern diplomacy. Until somebody came with idea that they can conquer the galaxy. Or make some stupid rift in a space that allow something bloodlusting to pour throug it. Great job, whatever his name was. Lot of people hate late game, cause everybody is passive, but i liked it. It seems more real and this is not RTS, where you just build units and send them to die for you (in this game you wait and made some terrible diplomatic mistakes previously).

I was basically a fanboy who saw what the game could be and not what the game currently is. So far Paradox has released two fairly important updates that changed an amount of things in the game. Problem is that with everything they fix, they break something else.   Now that really isn't too big of a deal. We can mod our game how we like and there is a mod for just about everything. But some of the issues that the game has right now are ones that the developers need to fix and not the players. It doesn't take an entire studio to fix some issues and not having the others work on other things is a waste of resources. So the whole 'OMG WHY ARE THEY DOING DLC? FIX THE GAME FIRST,' thing is silly.   The problem that I have with the game is that after like ~50 hours in you can really tell how rushed out the door and bare bones this game is.Vanilla CK2 and EU4 had way more to offer mechanically than this game does now. That is not to say that Stellaris won't be great down the line but what we got on offer at the beginning I don't think was worth the asking price.  If you are still on the fence right now about buying it, hold off for a little while.   ==================================================== Original Review ====================================================  Never thought I'd say that I can't wait for DLC...",

            "review_text": "I have been holding off on Reviewing Stellaris because I wanted a clear picture of what the game is!  After having put more then 100 Hours into Stellaris I have found that I still can't answer that question reliably.  So I think I am going to start off with Broad Questions:  Is the game fun? Yes Is the game good? Yes Would I recommend this game to others? Yes Is it worth its price tag? Yes  So with that part out of the way I want it to be clear that I very much like this game BUT:  Stellaris is having a hard time claiming to be a Grand Strategy game!  It lacks Casus Beli's The Game Pace is far too fast, it takes about as long as a Civ 5 game! There is a complete lack of content for any playstyle thats not map painting! Diplomacy is Abysmal And Bug's are Galore  Basically I get NO Grand Stategy feel too Stellaris when I play it! Infact it sometimes feels like it wants to be a Grand Strategy game but its not capable in its current form of grasping that role! The game basically feels Naked with only two victory conditions that both involve lots of Pew Pew.....  So then I try to compare it too 4X games of new and old and well that leaves me in a similiar confused condition. It just doesnt jive in my mind. At times I feel some Masters of Orion or Galactic Civ like gameplay but by and large its so confused on its identity that it doesn't feel '4X' either....  So one of my biggest issues that I am having at this point in time is simply trying to classify Stellaris in my mind. But whatever classification it finally evolves into its far from complete. That is the one thing that really rings true when I play the game currently (1.0.2 - 5/17/2016 Only 8 days since release) its not fnished. Infact it often times feels like I am in a building with no walls just the 2*4 Frame and a roof.... There is a ton of work to do yet, its pretty obvious!   (Understand I am a Hardcore Paradox Fan who expects a Certain Level of product from Paradox) The things I dislike the most:  Diplomacy:  -Very Lacking in options.  -The options you do have are again rarely if ever excepted by the AI unless you meet a very specific parameter. -The AI itself fails to use the few diplomatic options that are currently in the game correctly.  Victory Conditions: -An utter and complete lack of a victory type that doesnt involve Pew Pew??? You feel like you have more options playing as the Germans in Heart's of Iron then any Race in Stellaris....   Events: - Severly lacking, this is the part I am most disappointed with, as all the short comings above I could easily ignore if there seemed like there was a credible effort put in to really make the world rich with events.... I really think the lack of events is what most makes Stellaris not feel like it has an Identity in my mind. And then the events that are in the game are so MEH.... They almost feel like background flavor that has little relevance.   But with all that said,  Stellaris is a GEM its got a skeleton in place that has the potential to become a game thats better then Crusader Kings 2.... It has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. Its addictive, its flashy, its a must buy! Even if its current state is filled with bug's and balance issues, and a Haven for Min Maxers.... Its addictive!!!   ",

            "review_text": "Now, Stellaris is one of those games where you can just tell that the dev team cared a lot about their game and worked really hard to make it as great as they possibly could. As soon as you get into the game you realize just how large this games potential could be, from you being able to create your own species all the way down to it's ideals and beliefs, to being able to bring the entire galaxy under your control and all the other races in it. Unfortunately for all it's polish and care, the game has quite a few bugs, especially for one that has never been in early access, but the majority of them that I encountered were mostly minor (graphical glitches and UI problems). So I'm going to list all the good and the bad about the game and make my judgement from there.  Pros:  (+) Game's art style is astounding and obviously a lot of care went into every detail.  (+) Gameplay is solid and entertaining, even hours later.   (+) The amount of technologies, weapons, and designs means that even though there are very few ship designs, it still feels like you're fighting something new.  (+) Subtle references to other space related movies and games, like having a Xenomorph army from the Alien movies or one of the fungal races being like a virus taking over a host's body like in the Last of Us.   Cons:  (-) Quite a few bugs. Even though they were minor ones, they were in just the right place to make them more noticable (and more annoying). Things like the portrait of a planet's background showing up black, or a large green box covering the top 25% of the screen when you open a menu.  (-) The ships don't default to your flag's colors, and there is no ship painter. This can be disappointing when you're engaging a race that uses the same ships as you do, and that they look exactly like you do.  (-) Little room for expansion. This game suffers from what most other 4X games do, in that, it places your neighbors extremely close together. I understand that it's for action's sake but sometimes when you are surrounded by neighbors who hate you, there really isn't much you can do.  Overall, I have to give the game an 8/10. It's really fun and looks and sounds nice in places, but there are a few glaring issues that could and hopfully can be fixed. Maybe with a patch, maybe with future DLC, but fixed either way. I'd definitely recommend Stellaris to anyone who likes space games, 4X games, or the sort.",

For 16 play hours hasn't crashed even once and I couldn't see any major bugs. It has vast diversity of races, leaders, planets, stars, researches, etc. And before I say anything bad, I wan't to remind those of you, that are playing 'Europa Universalis IV' and 'Crusader Kings II', that once upon a time, there was 'Europa Universalis I' and 'Crusader Kings I'. Keep in mint that this game is a different Genre from their other big hits and the developers would need a bit time to adjust and take care of all issues. But for me, the game is way better then quite few other games of that genre, possibly the best, if not, will be, no doubt. The biggest issues for me, are that space battles are not that exciting and some times are lagging. It shouldn't be from my PC. Also, more depth into the diplomacy is necessary - I can't convince a 4th race to join my alliance so I can form a confederacy, even races that I enlightened with my technology, won't join our alliance. And it might be from my race - mammalian - Scyldari(pacifistic direct democracy) but my leaders are too honest. I miss the good ol' backstabbing between leaders or maybe my race is too civilized and it's lacking crooks. I also couldn't find a list with surveyed habitable planets or potential sources of resources. The AI needs improvement. Hard to switch between planets when on surface screen.  The music is quite good, but if Paradox add few more music tracks and an optional voice-over for the events - I picture Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen or Morgan Freeman... impossible right, or not?. Also fleet formations are necessary because the battles become more graphical compared to EU &amp; CK. Having stances is a good feature. The graphics are nice, however there is still more room for improvements. I am absolutely impressed by the diversity of races and avatars - I met 30 civilizations so far, all unique and none from humanoid race - amazing. It makes you think how tiny we are, because I absolutely believe the universe isn't that a lonely place, as right now from our point of view, based on the lack of official mainstream information.  I hope to see how the game will evolve in the future and capitalize on its enormous potential.  OFF-TOPIC: I also want to say that if we meet an alien civilization, the chances are that another Christopher Columbus situation may occur... I hope not.",

Some systems currently lack depth and espionage is absent, but as with any Paradox title, I fully expect to see tons of cheap DLC's released expanding all these systems as time goes on. That does not mean the game is not fully fleshed out right now. The species creation system allows you to replicate any sci-fi species you want, aside from some portraits not matching perfectly. The ship designer is perfectly balanced and allows for tons of customization without being a spaceship designing sim. The combat systems are excellently balanced.

It is refreshing to see the direction this game takes with alien civilizations, contact with them, the various special research projects, etc. It is also nice to see the sector concept get added even though it is done a bit differently than I would have done. Overall, the game is quite fun and addicting. They have successfully stopped colony spam and ship spam. They are finally no longer the de-facto tactic to winning a 4x strategy game, despite the fact that they have kept colonization and fleet building an important part of the overall strategy. I'm not entirely sold on the randomness of which technologies show up on the list for research. It certainly adds some flare to the research process, but I think it's a bit too random. I think it needs to weight the lower cost techs higher the further into the research tree you progress so that you always have at least one lower cost option available to research. I've had too many times where the only techs I can research are ones which take ages to complete while missing out on much needed weapons upgrades. I also find it refreshing that planetary improvements complete in a reasonable amount of time and that the whole game is not all about managing your colonies. I would like to see a notification come up each time a planet finishes growing a population, however. That would let me stop digging through my planets to find where I need to build a new structure. But, as I said, overall, it is a very good game.",

The search for finding a game deemed to be better than the original Masters of Orion games has finally been answered!!!  Stellaris takes games such as MoO2, Sword of the Stars, Imperium Galactica 2, Distant Worlds: Universe and demands they move aside...  There's finally a new king of 4X sitting upon the throne.. It will likely take another 20 years before it is once again beaten.  As a side note concerning the grand strategy element of Stellaris. It does fall slightly short to its own predocessor, Crusader Kings 2.. But not by much.  I need not praise this game any further. With a little more patch tinkering and an expansion or 2... This already great masterpiece will become a legend many will talk about for many years to come!",

I get to build my own fleet and customize the ship loadouts. My research ships are in deep space far from home.

Now eating up all the Artic &amp; other Planets.. land on an Oceanic world.. found some Pre-Sentiant Mamilians living there, Just Finished the Tech to Uplift Pre-Sentiant life, uplift the Mamilian's.    They turned into the only Humans in the Galaxy, even more awesome they have a Trait 'Irradiated: This Species evolved to withstand Extremely high amounts of backround Radiation +30 years Leader lifespan +100% Habitility to Tomb Worlds.' Took them &amp; Seeded every Tomb Planet &amp; many others..   As I learned the Hard way though I had allowed for AI Sentience to be made (before my ability to Uplift), gave them Civil Rights &amp; Leadership Roles, but even with all that as soon as I uplifted Humanity they got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off &amp; declared a Civil war, crush their so called uprising, then they just go to Nuking my human Colonies (not like they Read the Wessari's Love for Radiation so Thanks for Nuking Non Tomb Planet's)). After Realising that they weren't doing anything to ♥♥♥♥ me off to much they started blowing up space station's.. ok thats annoying,,, and after that they went to go Rebel in the other empires that had Made AI,,, thx god there not in my borders anymore.

            "review_text": "I feel that, after 540+ hours of conquering the galaxy, I should probably write a review about Stellaris.  Firstly, a TL:DR. Stellaris is a wonderful strategy game that I feel I'll be playing for a long time yet with charming graphics and an excellent soundtrack too. It isn't without its flaws, but I'm confident they'll be improved on over time. Definitely a worthwhile buy.  Now, onwards!  Positives  Graphics and Sound: I don't generally care about graphics in my games. Content is much more important to me. But for Stellaris, I'll make an exception. The graphics are amazing, the soundrack is wonderful. The charming portraits and all the extra details the graphics bring to the game does it wonders, really helping to make the galaxy feel alive. From the little animations of the pops to the stunning laser weapons (I just love the tachyon lances), Stellaris has done such a great job with the aesthetics, I feel it worthy of comment.  Early Game: The early game is truly where Stellaris shines. It has, arguably, the best early game I've ever played in a strategy game. Thanks to the anomalies, pre-scripted systems, randomly generated stuff, space monsters, and a whole host of other things, it managed to create a sense of wonder found in few other places. I never tire of finding anomalies (even though I've basically seen them all), or stumbling across a pre-set system (which I won't spoil). And simply preventing communications with aother empire until I translate their language makes things slightly more unknown, slightly more tense.  Stories: To be clear, the game doesn't directly make stories, rather the events of any given game are perfecft for making unique, memorable stories that I can't help but tell everyone else about. It's a joy to be able to recount how I sacrificed everything to halt a signficant threat to the galaxy with the aid of my federation friends, or how my space foxes used cockroaches from an irradiated Earth to drive off the Human Remnant and prevent their conquest/purging of the galaxy. Though it can't quite compare to CK2, Stellaris still makes for some wonderful tales of galactic history.  Neutral Points  Sectors: This is a hugely debated issue, and one I don't actually feel strongly about. Sectors handle every system beyond the core worlds (default, you can have five core systems. This increases with tech, and can be modded). Yeah, sure, the sector AI is a bit... incapable. But I always see sectors as the undesirable side-effect of building a galactic empire; I can't physically run everything. Sure, I could micromanage every colony, but I don't especially want to. And I can mod it if I need to. Sectors can be a pain, but don't detract enough to spoil the overall game noticeably (for me at least).  War: An odd one perhaps, for a war game. I really enjoy war, on the whole. The doomstack battles make last stands seem so satisfying, and since it's all dictated by Lanchester's Square Law, I appreciate how this is the inevitable outcome in space. The problem is that, although the big battles are impressive, it means that in any given war there's really only one big decisive battle. And then it's just a case of conquering planets and swatting the odd raider. Again, this doesn't detract enough to spoil the game, but means I can't really say war is excellent (yet).  Negatives  Diplomacy: Don't get me wrong, I don't hugely mind the diplomacy. There's a reason I build federations. But it's a bit lackluster, and a little problematic at times. I usually only trade resources as bribes. Federations make the AIs a bit... enthusiatic... about who they want to be friends with. Certain events completely mess up the diplomacy. And it's way too easy to ignore the diplomacy and just rampage across the galaxy. All in all, diplomacy just ends up disappointing me.  This is a non-exhaustive list, I can go on forever. But I hope it may be of help for potential buyers in some, small way.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Read the Conclusion at the bottom of this review!  2265 A.D. - 3 Collective (meaning Slavers) alien races declare war onme. They have a combined strength of 15K-20K. Me, playing as the human United Nations, had overstretched. Too many planets, and a navy with only 2K strength to fend off 3 enemies with 10 times my military size. There was no way I could win, so I cede. I negotiate a peace treaty with 2 of the alien races and give them 2 of my planets  They then proceeded to enslave every human on the 2 planets I gave them. I had abandoned my own people to slavery on the promise of colonial riches. I actually felt bad for abandoning them :'(  But I also went into a fit of rage. I was still fighting 1 alien enslaving empire. Despite still being outnumbered, I fought a war of attrition, getting them to attack my space stations to decrease their strength, despite losing some of my space stations. My economy went into overdrive, every planet was churning out ships and I was running a government budget deficit.  2281 A.D. - After 16 years of war, I defeated the alien bug race with whom I had was still fighting against. I had smashed their military and economic strength and my allies, who initially didn't send fleets in, eventually sent them over and helped me defeat my enemy.  But the other 2 empires still had control over my 2 planets that I ceded to them. Worse yet, the humans they enslaved there were running out - THEY WERE FORBIDDEN FROM BREEDING :'(  There was still much work to be done.  2291 A.D. - After the 10 year ceasefire was over, I went to war again with the alien race I had smashed earlier. I won in 3 years, although I failed to successfully capture their capital planet, their homeworld, I still managed to take out the rest of their planets and establish a Vassal State which eventually integrated into my empire.  Initially, I purged some of the aliens living in the vassal state that I made once they integrated, but my people didn't like that since they were very individualistic and as such, I went back on my purge policy. Purging is a combination of ethnic/species cleansing and genocide.  But the 2 other empires still had my 2 planets where there were still a few humans left.  2309 A.D. - A few years before, the 2 empires that still had the 2 planets with humans enslaved in them had gone to war against another, powerful empire. This was good news, all I had to do was wait. Eventually their military would wind down, they would become weak, and then I could strike, reclaim the 2 lost planets with whatever humans were still left there after over 5 decades of slavery :(  in 2309, the time came. I negotiated help from a different empire that I had good relations with. My plan was, I can't go after both the empires on my own, but if I can keep one empire distracted by fighting a war with my ally, I can focus on the other one.  2325 A.D. - The plan worked. After another 15 year war, humans were once again united everywhere. It had been almost 3/4ths of a century since those planets were lost in a peace settlement which saw them abandoned, so I decided to give them their own independent state, but I also sent them a guaranteed monthly economic aid of minerals and energy credits to help them themselves back up on their feet. It comprised almost 25% of monthly government profit. Within 2 weeks they asked to become a vassal so they could be protected properly. Soon they will be re-integrated back with the rest of humanity.  So what happens next? I don't know, but I now enjoy having the most powerful military in my region of the galaxy, and a healthy economy capable of growing my military into twice or even 3 times the size it currently is.   CONCLUSION: This game gives you amazing stories. Let your imagination go wild and run free, it's the best way to enjoy this magnificent work of artistry that Paradox has produced =)  I give it a solid 8.6/10.",

Thought it might be to basic as I am an old school 4X player who hates old school style games. I wanted a polished state of the art latest gen pc top end game.  Finaly brought it after months of thinking about it. This is waht you get....  A surprisingly well put together game that has all basic gameplay mechanics that work well together. A deep and strategic play through that is always enguaging. AI knows how to play the game. Interface is simple yet very functional. Graphics are good, and could be great if better models were to be created. I am talking about top end textures, lighting of ships. Models are my greatest disapointment as they are about the same or worse than sins of the solar empire (2008). Yes 2008 game trumps some of the texture and models used. Lesson for Paradox, provide some outstanding high end models with more animations. If you are a graphics nerd, do not let it put you off as this game is so good to play it gets away with it. Soundtrack is great. Depth of play is remarkable in that after 200 hours I still feel that I have not reached the games limit. It always feels fresh and interesting. Fustration is minimal concidering the complex nature and size of what is offered. This is the big question. It is complex, it is huge, it is built for veteran 4X players, but if you have the patience it will reward you in spades. DO NOT GET if you want a quick and easy game to play.    This is a single player long game made for any fan of Si Fi 4X games. Combat is hands off, but funcional. If it used Endless Space 2 combat it would be a perfect game. You must like large fleet battles as oppsed to intimate flotilla style combet. Long learning curve required, but interesting. Extensive mod community at work. This game will be the best 4X space game thanks to modders. Everything can be changed,   If you are on the fence and have liked what you have read. Just get it, it is worth every cent. It will only cost you cents per hour to play as it takes ages to finish a game. If you are a die hard fan of complex space 4X, then get it now, plays better than any of the old classics.  Paradox has put together a very polished slick game here and with some better models it is going to be fantastic game for years to come. Well done Paradox, I do not give praise lightly.   If you need a score then as it stands now it would be 9/10  ",

Or else it just hurdles up in a corner far away and skirmishes with mini nations . meaning: u never get to fight them anyway.  still a true gem. go get it. :-)",

Creating your very own civilization with custom traits and government style allows the player to rule the galaxy in his/her style. The art style and music are truly wonderful. The addition of Leviathan DLC provides further enjoyment in mid/late game. The combat is mediocre, but the game forces the player to set goals and objectives for wars prior to the declaration. This mechanism prohibits boring unending wars from occurring, which frequently results in later stages of many other grand strategy games. Where the game is lacking, however, is diplomacy. Diplomatic options are available, but I seldom felt I could negotiate with or manipulate A.I. players.  Despite its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed Stellaris, and will continue to do so for a long time. I’ve also felt that the developers are actively listening to the community feedback and improving the game bit by bit.

This is my summary as of 1.3.2    Pro:  Stellaris is the only game I have seen that simulates the old sci-fi trope of colonies ideologically diverging from their home planet. Build multi species empire and deal with diverse pops through assimilation, migration, slavery or purging.  Emergent storytelling and lots of different event chains.  Cons:  Not enough weapons for my taste. It currently has only three classes of weapons (missiles, ballistics and energy) and missiles are not competitive.  Not enough freedom in ship design and not enough classes of ships. There are currently only four classes of ship. These are not well balanced right now either.  Star bases are very underpowered mid to late game. Early game, bases and star docks will stop early rushes, as it should be. Once you overcome that hurdle, bases become more or less worthless outside of niche uses. They fail to scale in power with fleets.  Combat is similar to EU4, and I think that is a bit of a shame.  End game threats need a rebalance. Many are too weak and the Awakened Empires are too strong.  Lots of micromanagement with exploration.  A terrible sector system that only allows you to control 5 planets at a time. The rest must be given to the AI to run.  ",

I use that to inform my playthrough (if interested PM me).  There is tons more improvement needed for the game. But that is what I like about Paradox. There games will get tons of free patches with major overhauls and great DLC. I never felt Crusader Kings was complete until the Old Gods came out.  That being said, Stellaris has some amazing potential. You can really feel the kind of diversity in playthroughs even at this early stage, just by choosing what FTL system you will use.

With Warp, your ships are pretty much autonomous and free functioning, but their warp systems draw heavily on power and increase the cost for production.  Hyperdrive ships still require a good bit of power for their systems, I think the cost is reduced. What is most important is that they have some of the quickest cooldowns after arriving in a system. That being said you are dependent upon a pre-existing hyperspace network to get anywhere.  Wormhole requires the least amount of power and least cost to the ships. The ships have a large spinup time (as the ships prepare to take off). However, you are very dependent on wormhole stations, and essentially create your own logistics/transport network. If you have 6 fleets moving through a system and only one wormhole station, you can expect a long wait for all of them. If you have 2 stations, you half that time, and so forth. Wormholes allow you to literally jump over enemy space into pockets of unclaimed terra nullius. However, for all these benefits there are major drawbacks. A smart enemy can target your logistics network and strand your fleets. Imagine sending a big fleet to confront an enemy medium sized fleet, while you are doing this, a smaller lightning raid takes out your wormhole stations and harrasses constructors at the closest system. All of a sudden your fleet is stuck.  This kind of variety is already ingrained into the gameplay, and I expect to see more of it. Just as Merchant Republics changed things for CKII, I imagine we will be seeing new ways the game can/will be played. There are some problems, but those will get handled in due time.",

I actually don't mind the idea of the sectors and handing off portions of my empire to the AI, but it does take much of the enjoyment out. All you can get from the majority of your empire is what to focus on and a cut of their profits. But   You want to have your empire build you ships? nope You want your empire to build specific buildings costs? Nope You want your empire to defend itself? Nope  Beyond the sectors, there are other frustrations that creep up after quite a bit. You end up with all of the areas around you with closed borders and can't do much about that except declar war. Oh, the guy next to you seems pretty easy to defeat, you attack but he's protected by his big neighbor. Nevermind, how about going this way, no that enemy is massive and part of a federation. Oh that one is a vassal. Is there anyone I can attack singly? not usually. And even better, sometimes they'll ally with a foe on the other side of the galaxy. You can destroy the local enemy but can't win the war because he is tied to someone that you can't reach. That's right, because there are closed borders everywhere.   Waste of time, going to another 4x game.",
