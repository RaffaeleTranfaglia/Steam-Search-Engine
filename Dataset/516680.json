            "review_text": "Thi s game starts out like it will be good, then the game starts. The control keys don't function so there is no easy control of the aircraft. It self destructcts anytime you get slightly above ground level saying you went too high. I tried changing the control keys on the options screen, but half of the ones I tried to enter didn't work in the game.   I was disappointed in this game because of the controls. I would not buy this one if I had known how bad it is to cotrol.",
