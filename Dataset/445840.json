    "description": "Undead vs. Plants is a cool ricochet shooter with 150 levels and simple rules for fun play. The bullets bounce off everywhere, but players should be careful to aim well and not use too many of the bullets. The game is easy to handle, but hard to master and it is a real brain training pastime fun.",

            "review_text": "3.6/10- It's More Fun To Playing Angry Birds on Your Phone!  I don't hate this game it just doesn't have much depth to it. The price tag of $7 is quite ridiculous when you can grab far better games in this genre for free or cheap. Itâ€™s just like Angry Birds except you use a gun instead of a plethora of unique and clever birds.   There are over 150 levels which sound like a lot but really isn't considering how fast and easy they are. In about 25 minutes I completed nearly 50 levels. (I was drinking a bit as well; likely not impressive...) Each shot you take has several ricochets which make completing the round in 3-5 shots super easy! If for some reason you can't complete the level you have (50) nuclear bombs to drop throughout the 150+ levels to make sure you continue to progress through more of the same.  Worth $0.99; like every other app. Complete in about 1-2 hours.     Accidently Reviewed",
