Though I enjoy this very much, and it clearly has a lot to tell, especially if you are the kind of person that enjoys atmospheric, beautiful games. You'll be in for a very twisted fun journey with this one.  Full release update: Alright, so those who own this game know that it didn't have a good launch. But nowdays, that doesn't surprise me anymore. Inspite of all this, the team is working hard to fix these issues, and until I see them being more sorted out, I'll give this game a full playthrough.",

Sad to say, Dream was a big dissapointment for me. Explorating the dreams and finding hidden paper notes with real meanings of them was quite exciting, but after a while I found myself annoyed and tired of walking and solving weird puzzles...not because puzzles here are too hard for me, they just lack of something that would made me stay with this game for longer. Maybe I will comeback to this later and change my opinion, for now it's just a annoying exploration game. And I really like exploration/adventure games.",

The mechanics got some taking used to, the puzzles were sometimes difficult, almost unfair. So I stopped playing. Flash forward to several months later, when the creators of the game made leaps and bounds towards one of the best games I've ever played. The voice acting is more fluid, I know the characters better because of the little conversations in between and during dreams. As a young adult who will inherit property someday, I'd never thought a game could put my hesitance and challenges into words like this game does.   The music is wonderful, creative and sometimes a little bittersweet. I've never enjoyed a soundtrack more. The graphics are beautiful, so much in fact that I sometimes play just to take a peek at the rolling desert sand. The storyline makes this game a gem in a plethora of crappy indie games. The humor is kind, in fact, the entire game is kind. You never feel rushed unless playing a nightmare, and even then you're free to explore as much as you want.   The only thing that needs a little improving are the puzzles. They can be frustrating and almost nonsensical sometimes, but otherwise, 8.5/10",

Your uncle (a successful writer) has just died and bequethed his estate to you. You soon find that nights spent there lead to strange, surreal dreamscapes. Each dream presents a variety of challenging puzzles you must complete to develop your sense of self-worth, while nightmare scenarios serve to haunt you with your own insecurities. The graphics and soundtrack are lovely, the voice-acting is pretty good, the puzzles sufficiently engaging and the whole experience wraps up nicely into a fun game.",

I actually like this game (to an extent for the time being), but I wouldn't suggest buying this right now.

Then I started finding pieces of paper and items. OK, so that meant I had to find more stuff like this.  Well after an hour of walking around and not finding anything else besides some obscure graveyard puzzle, I'm calling it quits.  This game is just too laggy and slow to be playable and enjoyable. Yes, the scenery is nice, but the music gets on your nerves and the slow responding controls are too unbearable.   Save your money.",

The Holiday food puzzle, half the buttons just stopped working, so I could not complete the puzzle. 3. I got stuck, literally couldn't move in several places, had to restart. The game is a good effort, but is still horribly broken. Don't buy it, crack it, it is not worth £10. It is worth £3 at most. Developers, you need to fix your game, seriously.",

            "review_text": "Ok I recommend this game IF you like 1st person puzzle games (Like Ether One, though it isn't nearly as good as that) AND don't mind a slower pace. It's fairly interesting, The puzzles are nice and I like the setting. However this game does have some downsides that seriously injure it so wait till it's on sale. Don't pay the full price unless you think you REALLY want it.  Let me give you a rundown of the largest cons.   -THE ITEMS! I beat the whole game without using a SINGLE item. Oh it gives you plenty and you have an easy enough to understand inventory that allows you to swap between them but all I could think was 'What is the point of these useless items?' Well here's the thing, the items have uses but you can beat the game without using any of them, additionally the game never bothers to tell you that you can use an item by hitting F while you are holding it.  -The forced dialogue! There's a conversation that gets revisted several times throughout the game and basically it builds the background. As you progress through the game more and more of the conversation gets revealed (about 4-5 segments in total). It's a cool mechanic HOWEVER, there is no way to fast forward through the parts you've heard already meaning you will be hearing the same begining conversation several times and it will get longer each time. So basically be prepared to go do something for a few minutes every time you finish a level.  Minor beefs include:  -too much character visability for a first person game. (This is just a personal preference of mine when I'm playing first person games I don't want to see the character other than arms or in the occasional mirror) -controls are a bit shakey (not terrible you get used to them soon enough) -not really enough puzzles -slightly empty at parts  Good things This game does a fair amount well. -The setting is cool and the level designs are interesting. (Personally I particularly enjoy settings where things are slightly out of place and this dream game does that well.) -The self narration seemed odd at first but I think it goes well with how the game turns out as it's about understanding the character. -The puzzles are enjoyable for the most part.  TLDR: If you like 1st person puzzle games, get when on sale.  Tips for playing: -F to use current item -select the empty hand if you don't want to hold an item atm -the paper changes when the dream changes check it often -the alarm clock wakes you up allowing you to exit the current dream if you get stuck.
