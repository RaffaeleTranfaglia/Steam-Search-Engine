            "review_text": "Excellent little Medtroidy style game about an alien and his saucer trying to save his world.  The game looks and plays amazingly. From the great environments to the many tools you gain in your quest.  The Multiplayer (although dead, it's super easy to start a game with friends) modes can also be played solo, and has a surprising amount of RNG and challenge that I feel is overlooked in this game.  The overall campaign is around 8-10 hours, but it's very enjoyable, and never feels tedius.  It used to be GFWL, but the Dev switched it all over to Steamworks so it doesn't die with the GFWL platform. (Thanks Devs!)  Definite, absolute buy!",

            "review_text": "I bought this game expecting to dive into a dark abyss of cool monsters and 'visual madness' (if that makes any sense to you), as the title 'Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet' suggests. I watched the trailers and knew there would be puzzles and it wasn't a hardcore game, but all the time the whole 'insanely twisted shadow planet' feeling seemed to be solid and interesting. Well, it wasn't quite like what I wanted. Here's a list of pros and cons:   Pros: - Great visuals overall. - Really good and original enemy design. (even though some of them are re-used with little differences they still are great to look at) - Nice soundtracks that fit in with the shadowy atmosphere. - Fluid control.  Cons: - The plot is extremely simple, being almost meaningless. - The puzzles aren't challenging, some will require a little bit of thought, but overall they are pretty simple. - Bosses are quite easy. - Too short for its price. (finished it in a little more than 5 hours and it could be much faster)  There are many indies games that are very simple and yet you find yourself wondering about what's happening or wanting to help the characters to reach their objective. As already mentioned, you don't get attached to the character's objective or anything, you simply have one mission and complete it. The game is very forgiving and will give you several checkpoints along the way so you don't lose almost any progress when you die, I didn't put that on the lists because it can be pleasant or not to you. The most challenging things are to get optional upgrades, so you should have in mind it's pretty casual.  In the end I recommend only getting this game if it is on sale and you want something casual to pass time.",

There are plenty of puzzley parts that require some actual thought on what to do, and which upgrade to use. It reminds me of Metroid, but flying in a ship instead of hoofing it. You get lots of different upgrades to progress as well as open up areas in places you've already explored. My only complaint is that it is too short. I finished the game in about 7-8 hrs, plus another hour to find the remaining upgrades which weren't required to beat the game.",

Didnt get far in the solo campain, but LOVE the coop mode. This is where this game really shines!  Coop is local or net, but I strongly recommend a local game on your couch.  Together with a friend its great fun, with 4 players its fantastic!  The game mode   Latern run   this is one of the best coop party games along with some beer. :-) You and your friends are little flying saucers who try to escape a giant tentacle monster chasing you.  Totally worth just for the fun in the local coop mode. 8/10",

It's pretty challenging too, which is nice, yet the controls are intuitive and easy to handle. I love the artistic style of this game as well, it's a very simple aesthetic that conveys the alien-ness of the world you're exploring very well. It's also not too long; I finished the game with 100% completion in 6 hours or so, so if you are looking for a relatively short yet complete experience and you like the genre, pick this one up.",

The online part is dead and I managed to try it only because I create a game and played it with my brother.  All in all a little gem.",

            "review_text": "Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet follows the Metroidvania formula well with a diverse selection of weapons, all of which suit the theme and present new options both for exploration and for combat. The world is almost entirely open and gates that can only be unlocked with new weapons pop up from the beginning. The map clearly shows what has been explored and what hasn't and can even note the weapon needed for a particular gate. It's all here, save the fun. There's just too much frustration to allow fun to flourish. Enemies respawn at surprising rates which would be fine if it was any fun to shoot them. Past the first time realizing that a new weapon would be better used on this enemy or that, fighting is a chore. The often narrow, obstacle-fulled corridors would be more at home in a puzzle-platformer which Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet very nearly is, and would be better for being. The two co-op modes - a feature that should be an absolute boon for such a short game - doesn't help with that either. They both emphasize the worst elements of the game by adding more combat and forcing the player to cart something around for the entire mode, a mechanic that only serves to point out how finicky the grabber arm is. Both modes also feature a timed element and remove all the enjoyable exploration and permanent advancement that made the main campaign so close to being something great in the first place. And there is something great hiding in Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. Sadly, it's just too buried under layers and layers of poor execution to really shine.",

They're probably fun enough too but I wouldn't know. I enjoyed the game for what it was. $15 might be a bit high of an asking price, though.",

However!  3 hours of 2d content really isn't worth the $15 pricetag. While it looks big when you first start playing, you get through it way too fast, it could really benefit from a few more levels or bosses or anything in terms of more content really.  So if it goes on sale for like $2 or something, i'd say go for it, but as it is now, it needs to fill out quite a bit to justify the price.",
