What you get: - 24 missions - tower defense where you not only need to destroy enemy units - these units fight back, so you often must be really carefull and do some micro-manage - cool graphics! game looks really great - tech tree you must invest into to get new towers, powers and buffs; technologies you pick up have real influence on gameplay - different difficulty levels - and medium is not too easy :)  I didn't encounter any bugs or issues so far and game works fine on my PC, which is little outdated now (Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM, mediocre graphic card).",

            "review_text": "Anomaly Defenders is the third game in the Anomaly series. In the previous games the player controlled Human forces in a unique 'tower offence' mode. Defenders changes the format, and now the player controls the aliens in a more traditional tower defence mode. The aliens are fleeing their homeworld, and you need to prevent the Humans from destroying spaceship launchpads. The main twist compared to other TD games that I've played, is that the Humans can shoot your towers, instead of just ignoring them.  As with most TD games, you can build and upgrade various types of towers using carusarum (effectively money). Carusarum is earned by killing enemy units and you can also build harvester towers to extract carusarum from specific points on the map. You can also use special abilities on your towers, such as repair, rage (damage buff), sniper (range buff) and shield (reduce damage). These abilities cost energy, which is also gained from killing enemies.  There is a tech tree which allows you to spend points on upgrading the strength of your towers and abilities, improve your economy through improved efficiency of harvesters and better cost of buying/selling towers, and increase energy storage. You gain tech points for completing maps based on score and difficulty, and spend them between missions.  I wouldn't say there is a great variety in towers or enemy units. Most are as seen in the previous games, I think the only new enemies are the aircraft. A couple of maps have environmental effects, such as electromagnetic storms and falling debris, which can disable/damage your towers and enemy units.  I played on the middle of three difficulty levels, and only lost one of the 24 maps, but the second half of the game does get quite frantic. I can imagine the top difficulty could be quite challenging. I think my previous experience with the franchise helped me to quickly figure out the best placement for each type of tower. Later map layouts become fairly complex, with enemies attacking simultaneously along multiple ground and air paths. You can influence the enemy path with your harvesters, because the Humans will try to attack those before your launchpad.  The story is non-existent, which is disappointing. The previous games' stories weren't amazing but at least they made an effort. I also find it strange that the Humans don't have a commander (the player unit in previous games). I guess it might have been difficult to program the AI controlling him, but it doesn't really make sense based on the established series lore. The Human forces would get annihilated quickly in the previous games without the commander, so why attack now without him?  The music is fantastic and I didn't experience any bugs. There are no mid mission checkpoints, which means if you lose a map (or crash for any reason) its back to the start. Each map should only take around 20 minutes though. I finished the campaign in 8 hours which is fine relative to the low purchase price.  Overall, if you like tower defence and have a few hours available, this is worth checking out.",

            "review_text": "I truly enjoyed this game. I usually don't like tower defense games very much, but this one seems to be an exception. I found the strategy element to be quite good especially at higher difficulties. However if what you want is a story this is not the game for you. Other than 2 short (~15 second) videos there is no story at all. Not even short the short text based level intro conversations that are often used to set the mood. Other than a location name and a description of the level you are given no background whatsoever. Usually I, myself, would have problems with enjoying a game with no story, but the gameplay made me more forgiving.",

            "review_text": "The 'Anomaly' series is a truly unique series if you analyze it from a tower defense perspective simply because it puts the player in the position of the attacker, not the defender. Anomaly Defenders however is a return to the classic tower defense genre and it's not surprisingly at all judging by the way the story evolved in the previous games.   Unfortunately, it has nothing to the tower defense genre and moreover, it has some issues that stopped me from loving this game, no matter how much I struggled to do so.   From a technical standpoint, the game is flawless. The game looks great yet runs smoothly even on older hardware and I was unable to find any bugs (not that I actually looked).   The gameplay however is where it fails, more or less. The best thing about this is the technology tree. This one is actually well made, easy to understand even for less experienced gamers and offers some interesting features and upgrades.   From here on, things go down.   The game features 24 maps and 3 difficulty levels for each map, each level rewarding the player with a certain amount of technology points. About half of the maps are very well designed and offer some tactical variations and different approaches while the other maps seem chaotic, leaving no chance for tactics and reducing the gameplay to a state of pure brute force with a trial and error approach.   The towers, while the same towers from the rest of the games, now seem very underpowered and, with a few exception, there is not much difference in what damage they can take and make.   The ability wheel, that allows you to build, sell or upgrade towers as well as access the abilities seems and can be quite unintuitive when being used in large battles. You can often find yourself selling your tower instead of upgrading it or buying a different tower than the one needed because of the small am very similar tower icons.  On the other hand, the enemy units, mostly the ones from the other Anomaly games, can seem very overpowered quite often.   The enemy units are very slow paced when they enter the map but change instantly when they are close to the towers, forcing the player to pause the game to repair/upgrade or use other abilities.   Combining these with the poorly designed maps, you will often find yourself having to choose between towers that prevent the ground units from advancing and those that will prevent the air support units from wracking your towers and base.   And as if this wasn't enough, some maps have 'random' hazards/treats, like meteorites falling from the sky that will destroy the towers if not repaired on time or lighting strikes that will disable EXACTLY the towers that are firing the advancing enemy units. So much for the random element.   The game is mostly incredibly easy but some maps that combine all the elements mentioned above, can be ridiculously hard.   In terms of story and atmosphere the game simply fails, especially if compared to the other Anomaly games.   Overall, the game was a disappointment and far from what I would expect from an Anomaly game or even a tower defense game.   Again, it would be nice if Steam would have a 'MEH' option for reviews. This is one of those games that I cannot down vote but I shouldn't upvote as well. You could give it a try if you have the chance to get it on a sale but don't expect much from it.",

I DO recommend it as a game, but its risky, chances are if it don't work your screwed (I have had no responses from steam about this, decided to write up this instead)",

Anomaly Defenders is a Tower Defence game, instead of the well-renowned Tower Offense games. This is contrary to the thing that makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. The Anomaly Franchise is famous for its Tower Offense games and I felt that Anomaly Defenders ruined it, therefore I would not recommend you getting this game.   If you are new to the Anomaly Series and you are interested in getting this game, try Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 instead as I do feel that the gameplay in those games are more enjoyable, especially when the Anomaly Franchise is well known for its Tower Offense. If you are interested in a Tower Defence game, don’t waste your money on this game and I would suggest you getting Sanctum 2 instead. If you had played the other games from the Anomaly Series and you are interested in getting this game, do not bother getting this game too, unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Franchise and have extra cash to spend on.",

Defense zone 3 comes out at the end of this year 2014'around winter sale time ;) (only 1 person have created these games)",
