            "review_text": "This was a surprisingly good game. There is a mild learning curve until you learn the way the game's puzzles work, then once you get a few upgrades the levels get richer and very addictive. In particular the way adjacent rooms interact with one another was very clever, especially once the upgrades start to work together to solve rooms. The difficulty was spot on for my modest platformer skills, slightly above casual only. For achievement hunters, an easy 100% that takes a 5-7 hours maybe. ",

I really wanted it to be as nice as it was intended to be.  * Music is basically simple, annoying, and repetitive piano chords * Resolution is abysmal, so you either play with a tiny window (480p I think), or a very poorly stretched fullscreen, despite the fact that last update mentions 'true fullscreen' * Gameplay could be nice, but it's too cruel for a puzzle game. If you step onto the wrong invisible square, you might fall out of the stage you're in and lose your progress. Not only that, sometimes it's very hard to backtrack to where you were. So it basically becomes a guessing game with some puzzle elements after the guessing is over. * The big map is close to useless, since you can't zoom in and all rooms are very, very small in the map  So basically this game just has a good idea. Not worth playing =/",

The central mechanics mesh well together, and each room has a definite idea behind it - reminds me a lot of VVVVVV.  The puzzles are well designed and the abilities you gain are satisfying, overall it's quite absorbing as you explore the different rooms and solve them as you go, returning to finish more rooms.  Not the prettiest game - and sometimes quite frustrating - but a solid game at its heart. You'll easily while away a few evenings with this, which is damn good value for the asking price.",

            "review_text": "1000 Amps is a simple little platformer where you must go through empty levels, lighting the way. Everything you touch becomes a wall, some sort of platforming obstacle, or node. The goal is to light all of the nodes of each room before progressing. Through the game more power ups and obstacles are introduced, making puzzles become appropriately more challenging. Most rooms had multiple exits, allowing the player to solve rooms in different orders.  The music is repetitive, but easy to listen to. It never bothered me in my hour with the game, but a little more variety would have been nice. The art is really simple, and easy on the eyes. Every detail of the game is distinct and easy to figure out what it means â€“ even the first time coming across it.  Overall 1000 Amps is a well-executed minimalistic non-linear puzzle platformer.",

        {
            "review_text": "At its core, 1000 Amps is somewhat similar to VVVVVV - you've got a whole bunch of interconnected rooms to explore, and will spend most of your time figuring out how to get to them all. That said, there are a couple of things going on here to help separate this one from its 'metroidvania' peers:  - Right off the bat, there's the graphical style, which is built almost entirely on sharp, grayscale squares; it might come off as dull at a glance, but for a world built with such limited materials it actually looks pretty nice. The simple black, white, and shades in between are pleasant and clean, not to mention spiced up by the lighting, which I'll get further into in a moment.  - While most platformers of this ilk immediately reveal the full layout of each room you enter, in 1000 amps the power has been cut across the entire map, so you have to feel your way around in total darkness and touch various blocks as you go to render them visible. The most important of these are 'light-up' blocks, since if you find all of them in a single room the power will be permanently switched back on and that room will be 'solved'; moreover, each one you find charges your battery, which enables higher jumps and the use of special abilities, so you'll often need to plan your route to complete the circuit. At this point I'll also note that there's no music to speak of until you solve a room, which prompts some manner of synthesized bell tune to pipe in; I can't say I was humming along to most of the music, but the overall effect suited me fine.  - If you're looking for combat you'd best look elsewhere, since there really aren't any 'enemies' wandering around in the traditional sense; actually, there aren't any dangerous obstacles here either, or any way to 'die' at all. About the worst that can happen to you is that you unintentionally pass through a non-solid floor or wall into a different room and lose your progress in the one you were working on; this can be frustrating, as there's no way to tell what's where when you first enter a new area (at least until you get the Sonar, one of a few upgrades you'll need to progress past certain points), but it usually doesn't take too terribly long to get back where you were, especially if you've already solved some of the surrounding rooms and can pass through them quickly.  So there you have the game's most distinguishing features; now, how do they all fit together? For the most part, pretty well: control-wise all you need are the WASD/arrow keys to move and jump around, plus the mouse cursor to guide the crucial 'teleport' ability, unlocked early on. There are a handful of technical 'tricks' to discover as you get more comfortable, which are essential to giving yourself that little extra boost you need to sneak over a wall or graze past a remote light-up block; the game doesn't present too many overt hints to this end, but I'd wager that players familiar with platformers in general should be able to figure them out without too much trouble. On the whole, that's pretty much all there is to know about 1000 Amps, which is fine: you explore, you experiment, you light stuff up and fill in the map a bit at a time.  Puzzle-platformer fans should enjoy themselves on the whole, but there are a handful of caveats. First and foremost, the creator's total devotion to the black-and-white art style can sometimes hamstring it: in certain situations you have to look closely to spot a less-than-obvious doorway or other element, and you'll be squinting particularly frequently at the (also grayscale) in-game map as you attempt to visually determine whether or not you missed a particular tiny passageway from way back when...and there's no way to mark or annotate it either. I can understand and appreciate sticking to one's guns artistically, but in this case I'd call it more of a hindrance than it's worth - I managed to get the completion percentage to 99% before finally giving up on figuring out which slightly-darker-than-the-rest speck on the map I'd overlooked.  Also be aware that there's no genuine transporter hub or other means of 'fast travel' here: granted, the map isn't super-huge and can be traversed fairly quickly once you're breezing through solved rooms, but there are more than a few lengthy routes which can only be completed in one direction, so if you need to retrace your steps you've got no choice but to slog your way to the starting point (which can, again, be tougher to determine than it needs to be thanks to the map's deficiencies) and begin from square one. This is compounded by a couple of rooms that are particularly easy to fall out of by accident until you've turned all the lights on, and a few others which require some fairly precise tapping and clicking to clear; most of the time things feel fair and forgiving without being condescending, but there is some grumbling to be had here and there.  Hopefully at this point you've got a decent idea of what 1000 Amps has to offer, and what it doesn't: it's only a couple of bucks to acquire, should only take you a few hours total to finish your first time through (though I'd imagine it's ripe for speed-running once you know where you're going), and for the most part delivers on its simple, pleasant concept of a visually-sound, non-violent exploratory puzzle-platformer. If that summary appeals to you, by all means save this one a place in your Library.",

            "review_text": "1000 amps is worth 1000% of your time. Short, and mindbendingly creative, I haven't felt this driven to finish since the original Portal. Do NOT overlook this game.  Made by a single man named Brandon, 1000 amps feels like the unsung indie hero of the platformer world. The jumps are smooth, there are no hitches in the graphics or glitches that ever made themselves apparent in my ample time with the game. Puzzles are smooth and organic, and even when you're stuck in a room and it's clear you can't solve it, you'll always be able to find your way out. There are only 3 major upgrades, and while I'll reserve them for spoilers, each one is a massive boon that feels perfect for the game, without breaking any of the challenge it presents, and echoes a Metroidvania feel that is always welcome in a game.   Above all else, the minimalistic monochrome art style is what stands out the most. Aesthetically, I haven't played any game like it before, and the fact that he incorporates the art style into the gameplay mechanics is quite fantastic, especially with how smooth all of it looks. While I respect all the retro 16-bit styles that have been pouring out of the woodwork, it's very refreshing sight to see an indie that has its own identity. There is very little story to speak of, but the final boss is perfect test of your acquired skills and abilities, perfectly implementing a challenging but reasonable fight for the final act.  Word of warning: The one major flaw that I came across was the fact that you cannot collect the last upgrade if you use all of your insta-solve tokens on the levels before, so make sure you hold on to at least 5 until you come across the room below the infinite. It took me forever to figure out, so hopefully you won't have to.  Finally, the main path is kind of obscure near the end, and while I enjoy the free roaming aspect, I found myself crossing through many of the same areas after making a wrong turn or falling into another room by accident. Other times, routes that seemed like secret paths were the correct passage to important areas, and often times if I screwed up and got lost, finding the correct passages taxed on time, for the minimap can only take you so far. Fast travel of even a limited style would've been most welcome.  Regardless of these criticisms, I adore this game, and given how cheap it is just as a base product even without a sale or tied into a bundle, there is no reason for you to not pick this up, and every reason for you to bask in its glory.",

What would happen if you took Metroid (tight 2D platformer, chamber-based exploration with upgrade collecting and backtracking), removed almost all the enemies and weapons, and made every single room a puzzle? The people that made this game are absolute geniuses. This game is really fun and extremely challenging. Just figuring out how to complete one of the mind-warping puzzles (again, almost every room) isn't good enough -- you've got to actually pull off the platforming to execute it. This involves some crafty timing and order of operations.  Example: As you complete a room you get increased jump height, so the solution for a room might involve actually solving a neighboring room so that you can jump with enough momentum from the solved room into another to complete it.  As in Metroid, you will find upgrades as you play that let you access new areas that you couldn't get before. Unlike Metroid, you're left to figure out these things on your own.  GET THIS!",

Yea it could have been fun if it wasn't run in flash, or at least had music in the background, but unfortunately those are its' two fatal flaws. The game itself is fun and original, there are some hard puzzles to solve, but the game will have you figuring out what to do by yourself soon enogh. Since I only have 4 hours played on it I'm just going to assume it eventually does have music? Especially since the promo video featured an exciting classic peice, but as I said, after 4 hours of gameplay not a single song has been played. This makes it feel like a chore to play it for longer than an hour at a time. The other major problem is that it runs in flash, so it lags constantly and doesn't like to run well at times even on great computers. Little things like this can make or break a game, and this game feels like it should be on a free flash game website, not on steam for 5 dollars.",
