But anyway I highly suggest this game I mean it could be a little more in-depth and have more things to do in it but other than that i would play it again in a heart beat. 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Before the game starts, you get to choose between two options: play with keyboard and mouse or play with Oculus Rift. I do not have the latter so I chose the former.   You are taken on a short adventure into the human brain, and you are the chosen one who has to heal a depressed patient by looking at his disordered neurons.   And so the journey begins, and you can admire the view inside the human brain. It is a short game which rewards you at the end based on how many neurons you got.   Try it. It isn't long, but offers insight in how VR-games could work. They have another game in work which will take place in human cells.",

Voice over is poor, using synth voice, rather than a decent actor  Hard to see what more of the same would bring to VR, but nice enough to try a single run through for free.",

I am sure the medical vocabulary will join later once they have established what works and what does not, makes sense to me. Cheers Devs!",

If you plan to play it with a VR device, you should take a note, that this game is really messy in terms of delivering a good and enjoyable VR experience, causing motion sickness and sometimes bugging. If you plan to play it without a VR device, then you should take a note, this game is very short, simple and pointless. In my opinion, the artistic side of the game may be the only reason to play it, and this side isn't quite remarkable to save the game. It was obviously created for usage WITH a VR device, and it fails there miserably. So, I can not recommend it.  + Decent artwork + At least, it's free  - Motion sickness. - Graceless VR design. - Doesn't really require any skill. - No storyline, setting or even idea. - It is, basically, just a short VR-demo.",

I really like to looking mechanic and shooting as objects are coming at you, the game is challenging and there seems like quite a bit of gamelay from what ive seen so far.   At times the looking for aim mechinic gets abit tiresome, but overall I cant really think of abetter way of aiming unless you make it only for the vive with motion controls. maybe that could be added in a future version.",
