            "review_text": "I did not receive a review key and this review is my own opinion.  While Hydra Slayer easily qualifies as a 'proper'/'traditional' roguelike, having turn-based, grid-based combat, dungeons, levels, weapons, potions and monsters, the combat is non-traditional as it involves calculating how to kill hydras based on how many heads they have, how many they will regrow and how many each of your different weapons will slice off, while also adding game mechanic-changing items into the mix.  This was originally a 7DRL (7 day roguelike) and is a perfect example of one as it has one central bizarre twist on top of traditional roguelike elements.  There are currently some rough edges: music on the game over screen glitches, isometric mode has way lower fps than it should have (30ish using opengl and 10-12 on my machine using sdl2 (which could be using dx or opengl)) and there are some grammar errors (mainly the 'fewer' / 'less' thing which comes up a lot becuase of the heads mechanic).  Graphics are not very good but functional and there's the option for ASCII which is great. Different race options provide new interesting ways to play and there's a daily challenge mode. All in all there seems to be enough longevity here and the price is good.",
