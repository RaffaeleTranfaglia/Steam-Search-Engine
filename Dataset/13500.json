Overall, it glitches a little from time to time, but it still holds its own in terms of gameplay, even with dated graphics. It is a great game.  Ubisoft, if you are out there, revamp this PoP trilogy!",

The only bug I encountered - I couldn't perform a long wall jump. Turns out, the cause was that the game was running at 150-200fps. I enabled V-Sync and the bug disappeared. The game certainly wasn't tested under such conditions back in the day:)",

            "review_text": "Warrior Within is the first sequel to Ubisoft's 2003 Sand of Time, taking place third Chronologically right after 2010's The Forgotten Sands. As I had said before SoT was an almost perfect game, with amazing story, unrivaled scenery, and perfect character arcs. Everything that lacked in that game this one improved, such as combat. However the once brown-haired insecure Daddy's boy Prince that was in the orginal is buried under a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-off emo hiding behind his black flowing hair and facial scars.   The game is not bad in any sense of the word, besides the horrible bugs that could cause you to skip ten hours of gameplay and be doomed to re-do or the most difficult battles in the series.. It's just darker and grittier, makes sense since he killed his own brother and been hunted like an animal ever since by the Dahaka.   If youre a fan of SoT it's worth the buy.",

Everything (both + and - ) is actually the same.  The gameplay became much more diverse - more aggressive, different approaches, swords that really make a difference, a lot of secondary weapons to choose from. Definitely the exact improvement needed.  Change in past-present was as satisfying as ever - cannot recall any other game at that time with such concept.  The plot is twisted, providing unexpected turns and decisions. At least it was confusing 10 years ago for a 11-year boy. A lot of different bosses, each recquiring a different approach - by far, the greatest addition since the previous game.  You can play the game even if you didn't finish the SOT part. Still rewarding.",

At first it seemed like they improved on the combat and overall gameplay but it sadly all comes down to the same in the end.  Enemies you'd rather ignore than fight just to get it over with. A map that is useless and music that is going to make your ears bleed after you heard the same song the millionth time.   Dont ever play on the hardest difficulty unless you want to lose your sanity.",

What makes this game different are the secrets that you don't see on the first time. And when you find a secret you are like: 'Damn, there are certainly more!'.",
