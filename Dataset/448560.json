            "review_text": "I'm indifferent about this game... there's a lot of puzzles, even the start of the game is a puzzle of it's own. There are plenty to solve, and get difficult as you keep playing and solving more, and a few are a mix of other games (Minesweeper + Battleship, for example) however...  You don't have control of what puzzle to do, there's no hints of how to solve a puzzle, and skipping is a bit tedious to do (have to reset 100 times to skip one puzzle) which is to encourage you to solve the puzzle instead of trying to skip it.  This is more for people seeking a challenge for their mind, not for beginners. Sadly there's no guides to help you out; you're pretty much on your own and any friends who can help you. Achievement hunters beware.  There are technical issues too: Every music track is a different theme than the other (and don't loop), you can't go into window mode (even by alt+enter), can't adjust the audio levels in-game, and alt-tabbing in and out can be rather annoying (alt-tabbing in starts a new track and may cause audio overlapping).  The quality of the game is mediocre, but the puzzles are difficult and may be frustrating to solve.  I'd highly wait for a sale for this game, and wouldn't put it at the top of your wishlist either.  Overall: If you're looking for a challenge in puzzles, get this during a sale and no other puzzle game on your wishlist, otherwise avoid.",
