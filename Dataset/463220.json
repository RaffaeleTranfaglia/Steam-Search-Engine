            "review_text": "So, I got a few bundles of  New Reality  games that were mostly garbage to be tossed in the trash. After digging through some bad titles, my eyes were set on  Dungeon of Zolthan . Immediately, I get a nostalgic Atari-age feel from the title, the graphics, and the gameplay. So, when I booted it up, I had to know if the retro urge would be satisfied. I was pleasantly impressed by the end result.   Dungeon of Zolthan  is a short Metroidvania that includes 4 bosses and can be speedrun in about 20 minutes (my best time is about 16 minutes). You don't get a story. You don't get a tutorial. Instead, you get a simple plug-and-play game that essentially teaches you through an 'Instinctive' tutorial you get from games like  Metroid  or  Megaman X  had (if you've seen Egoraptor's  Sequelitis , then we're basically on the same page). You run, you jump, you shoot, you dash.  I LOVE the neon look the developer was going for and I LOVE how true it stays to the retro conventions. It really reminds me of Atari-age and NES-age games. Back when games ranged from reasonably hard to Konami hard. Though this game did have some rage-moments (mostly speedruns, few deaths, and perfect boss runs), but after a while, it's all manageable.  I also love the retro music, especially for the final boss himself. In the end, I had a great experience from this title. Is it worth the price? Possibly so, but you still can't beat finding a good discount. Suggested price range between 50-75 cents.  8/10 A great retro experience for the retro player.",

Pick it up if you need something to pass a couple hours away or if you just like platformers. if you want a bad game then go look up tompi jones. that game is BAD.",

Controls are pretty tight and the platforming is challenging but not unfair. I died 56 times in about 78 minutes of gameplay, but I never really got that frustrated. I never felt like any of my deaths were unfair, and so I could accept them without frustration.",

            "review_text": "I'll be upfront - I generally hate platformers. So while this game is a platformer, I'm not marking it down because it's a platformer. Let me at least address the one thing it does right - aesthetic design. With the exception of the final boss, the entire game seems consistent in design. Sorta feels like an anti-virus adventure to delete all of the viruses. Not bad. Now let's move onto the bad things.  One sound track. That's all there is. Okay, you'll hear 3 distinct-ish soundtracks in the game, but it's the same one soundtrack with either increased tempo or increased tempo and instrument changes? Octave changes? It's really annoying after the first 5 minutes. Boss fights seem unfair. In games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night or Dark Souls, the bosses have tells. Each boss fight becomes reading your opponent and reacting to their moves. In this game? There's no such thing. You can't 'get better' at the game, you can only jump and hope you don't hit the boss as they move. It's really terrible boss design. Your health is designed in such a way that you get two shot very frequently. This isn't necessarily bad, but it can be annoying when it comes time to fight bosses. My biggest gripe with this game is the sheer amount of instakill spikes. They're EVERYWHERE. The game becomes less about platforming and timing jumps than it is about making sure you jump in exactly the right way so as to not hit the instakill spikes. Which - spoiler alert - get used to them. The entire platforming seems to have been balanced around them. It's annoying.   Definitely pass. A $1 game I'd say,",

            "review_text": "This is the most annoying 69 cents I've ever spent.  If you like solving a puzzle, then jumping and sprinting through a dozen or so insta-death spike cubes, then get to another screen full of insta-death spike cubes, to get to a third screen with an upgrade on it that you have to solve a puzzle to get to...then have to go backwards through all of that again to save (and repeat all of it if you die), you will love this.  The enemies take too many hits to kill. It could use a few more save points.  The two bosses I killed were simple but fun enough, and there were save points just before them.  The game is fun except the parts where it isn't, and it's 69 cents.   ",
