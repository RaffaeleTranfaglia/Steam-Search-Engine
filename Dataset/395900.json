    "description": "Loved by millions, played for centuries, backgammon is a two-player strategy game quite unlike any other. The goal is simple: race to get your checkers off the board first. The deceptively deep rules and rhythm of backgammon has secured it as a favourite among casual and veteran players alike.",

Maybe I just got lucky.   There is single player and multiplayer. I've only done single player so far.   Choose from several different board graphics. And you can choose music tracks (jazz, classical, etc).  There are lots of settings for rules variations. You can turn off that doubling cube thing (I never play with it).  I have had some problems with the game freezing, but I'm pretty sure it's my computer's fault. My graphics thingy got messed up by a windows update. I get green screen on some online video clips, so it's not just this game.  Controls are done by the mouse, though the store page says there is also controller support.  I can't think what else to say. If you love backgammon, definitely get this game.",

My only complaint is that there is no way to confirm the move you want/take it back if you mess up. I understand the idea of think before you play, however, when you're playing casually with a friend and you miscount a move it would be nice to be able to take it back before passing the turn.  ",
