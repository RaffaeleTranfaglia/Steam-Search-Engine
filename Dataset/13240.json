This game is seriously amazing but the community is not big, there are still people playing to keep it alive but it's not like Counter Strike or AAA titles, you won't see a thousand of servers with players on every servers but you'll find enough to have fun on it, the game is perfect, one of if not the best, FPS of all times, you should really get every Quake and Unreal Tournament games.  Those games will makes you dream.  11/10 Would buy again, there should be more area games like this and Quake and less ♥♥♥♥ like Call of Duty and nowadays cinematics FPS.",

Vast amounts of arenas in which you can gib and telefrag your enemies are available, and a very large community grants a plethora of modded content and extra arenas.

However, this is a truly great no-frills arena FPS and if you've never experienced such a thing and are tired of all the CoD tripe then I highly reccomend it. If you're the kinda person who likes casual FPS and looking at pretty graphics... well I'd still try it but it's probably not for you. XD  Pros:  + Balance - some weapons are more powerful than others, but what really counts is SKILL  + Gametypes - DM, TDM, Domination, CTF, Assault, and more  + Level Design - they just don't make 'em like this anymore  + Amount of Levels - more than enough to keep you from getting bored for a long time  + Singleplayer Tournament - climb the ladder in different gametypes with pretty decent team AI when commanded properly  + Multiplayer - Stille active after all these years, and doesn't require a silly gamespy account  Cons:  - Dated Graphics  - Takes some tweaking to get your mouse functioning properly (more on this below)  *Mouse Setup Guide* 1. Grab the Direct3D9 Renderer from   here   [www.cwdohnal.com] . 2. Put D3D9Drv.dll and D3D9Drv.int in your 'Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Unreal Tournament\\System' folder 3. Use your graphics card control panel to disable v-sync 4. Use your graphics card control panel to limit your fps to your monitors refresh rate (i.e. 60Hz monitor = 60fps cap) this prevents the game from running in superfast mode. If you aren't sure of your monitors refresh rate, just cap it at 60. A useful program for doing this with Nvidia cards is   Nvidia Inspector   [www.guru3d.com] . 5. As always, make sure you have Windows built-in mouse acceleration disabled. Go to your control panel&gt;Mouse Properties&gt;Pointer Options and uncheck 'Enhance pointer precision' because in reality this hinders your precision by applying OS-level mouse acceleration! This last step is essential for all FPS games.",
