            "review_text": "'Diablo 2 meets Monkey Island?' Not so sure about that--but DeathSpank may just be Guybrush's heroic (albeit slightly slow) cousin, sword-spinning his way to defeating evil Lord von Prong. Plenty of bad guys, loot, and, uh, snacks await you on this epic quest. Environments, items and enemies offer plenty of variety. In terms of replayability, there is not much to be had there--although the game may be worth revisiting after a year or two have passed. Multiplayer feels like an afterthought, but it is actually possible to have an (offline) friend assist you at all times. For your money, you're looking at around 6 to 10 hours of gameplay (depending on how you play it and if you want to do all the side quests). You decide if it's worth it. While you're at it, you might want to buy the sequels (DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue and The Baconing) along with this game, or else the ending (or lack thereof) may disappoint you. For me, the verdict is clear: It's great.  Works flawlessly in WINE, too.",

The fourth wall is broken repeatedly as means of telling the story. The gameplay is somewhat clunky in combat on PC, where mouse cursor adjusts where you are facing - meaning you may suddenly expose DeathSpanks back to attack when you just want to move past an enemy slightly. Still, this game is worth some time just for the dialogue.",

Had me laughing out loud to start with, but did get old, but still humorous after playing through to finish the game. The controls and use of all of the XBOX type control options are done well. Game flows and is pretty easy up until the final battle. Funny desctiptions of all of the wepaons and other items in the game as well. Battles became a little monotonous, but didn't detract too much from the game as it goes by quickly. Very good game that I highly recommend to fans of Tick type humor.",

There are a lot of side quests to complete (I think around 115 quests total including main/side quests) and you'll want to finish all of them.  It's mixture of cartoony 3D and 2D graphics around a curving world is a nice change from typical RPGs. It's also shorter than many others, as it can easily be 100% finished in 10-12 hours. Which, to me, isn't a bad thing at all. It isn't too short, and it isn't so long that you get bored and burned out by the end. If you're a fan of RPGs, I definitely recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Deathspank is loaded with fetch-quests, sometimes to a ridiculous extent. One quest giver sends you to the same place, to fetch one item at a time, at least a half dozen times. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek, but the irony wouldn't wear so thin if it didn't apply to most of the game. Also, it's sometimes unclear what you are supposed to do. You will probably find yourself hitting the online guides two or three times. I wouldn't recommend it for a hard core RPG or action player. However, Deathspank is a solid, funny local coop game if you play with someone younger, and it works much better with the gamepad than first-person games do. My seven year old had a blast playing it with me. If you are okay with exposing a kid to cartoonish violence and some mildly crude humor, and don't feel an obsessive need to slogh through every sidequest, you should give it a shot.",

Graphics it's a 3d word with 2d models gives it a pop up book effect really coloufull surroundings, the story is pretty flat just have to find items for the next quest or though it doesn't hinder the games over all score of 67/100 not great but playable.",

Pros:  + Graphic style / different kind of ARPG mechanic + Unique setting and unique locations you get to explore + Soundtrack + SFX + Voice acting + Progress is fun overall. New dialogue adds a lot to it and there are many weapon combinations you can use.   Cons:  - Not much to do for 2nd player in co-op - 1-Hitting enemies that can be hard to spot (or know of when it comes to giants) before it's too late.  - Sometimes in tight walkways enemies could block me from escaping (even suddenly lagged and appeared behind me). - Some enemies have attacks that make it hard to know when to perfectly block them.  - No way to immediately exit dialogue - You can't equip items with lower overall stats than your current ones. The game forces you to get rid of them. - The game has a lot of fetch quests where you backtrack a lot.. pair that with the same walking speed you always have and it's not very nice.  8/10",
