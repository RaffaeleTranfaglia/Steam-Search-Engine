            "review_text": "I really want to give this game a positive rating but the fact is, until they improve a few things I'll wait. This definitely still needs a battle royale mode and the ability to extend the time as long as wanted. Also, if one person gets the DLC the other people shouldn't need to do that also. In real life, if one person has all the decks, people can play off of him/her, and it should work that way here too. Lastly, unlocking cards is ridiculous. We're already paying to buy the deck, there should be absolutely no reason to have to unlock them once they're already purchased. You don't have to unlock it in real life and you shouldn't have to do that here.",

Met a ton of cool and funny people in just a few hours of playing this game which is just amazing! Integrating the twitch chat to vote just adds a wonderful dynamic factor to the game because now there are much more than just the two people voting in the game! It also makes the game an incredebly interactive game which is another plus.",

Twitch chat helps with the drama and they come up with some good arguments - It really become a community game. Incredibly fun and I've had some ridiculous arguments that have had me close to dying of laughter. Personally, some of the best money spent on a game and DLC (bought all the decks) and plenty more game play to come. Hope this game spreads like wildfire =]",

            "review_text": "  All I have to really say about this game is.. wow. Bravo. This game is amazingly well made.  [HOW TO PLAY] SUPERFIGHT is essentially a game where you debate and/or roleplay to see who comes out as the winner. To figure out who becomes the winner, both players receive three cards each. One white card being the person/entity, and two black cards which are the attributes applied to the white card. However, there are two cards at the bottom of the screen. The one on the left being where the fight is located (blue card), and the one on the right which is the event that effects both players (purple card). Whoever makes a better argument as to why they deserve winning rights is biased between the two other spectators in the match and people voting via Twitch if you're livestreaming. This is a game where pros and cons are critically applied. Whatever combination of cards you receive, that can either help you or hurt you. With that being, let's move on.  [PROS] - Lots of cards to choose from to keep the game interesting. - Twitch integration so viewers can vote. - Great music. - Nice sound effects.  [CONS] None, really.  [PERSONAL REVIEW] In my opinion, this game is all about replay value. You could play SUPERFIGHT for hours on end. This is probably one of my favorite games on Steam.  [PERSONAL RATING] 9/10",

            "review_text": "SUPERFIGHT is a pretty neat game concept wise. I friend introduced me to it a while back, but I never did get it. Having tried it in the free weekend I can say it seems neat but there is such a low player base it makes it hard to find meaningful games. Gameplay wise I feel the best way to describe it would be Twitch Steaming debates with cards that remind me of Cards Against Humanity. That being said, its probably not a very good description. I feel like SUPERFIGHT is worth checking out though if you are a fan of Cards Against Humanity. For those really interested, there is a tabletop version of this card game as well.",

Since I bought the game on the release day I wasn't able to find enough players to get a single game running :(  Unless you have a lot of friends who would like to play the game, I can't recommend it at this point. Maybe the devs will find a way to bring this game back to life...   ...one day.",
