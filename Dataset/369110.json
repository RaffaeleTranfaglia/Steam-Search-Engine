Each thief is randomised, and you will want to protect the cooler looking ones from dying.  I won't describe the features, because the page does that well, but this is everything an indie game SHOULD be; new and refreshing, but grounded in familiarity. The only criticism i have is that it would be nice if the starting thief was randomised, rather than the same one all the time. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I love the central idea that this game is built around. But I don't love the heavily flawed controls, and constant bugs and glitches. Just in the last few days of playing, I've encountered many glitches. I've gotten stuck in the scenery, I've had the Teleporter ability completely glitch out and freeze my character in mid-animation so I had to terminate them, I've had enemies somehow see me through solid objects and instantly kill me. When it plays well and how it's supposed to, it's really enjoyable, but when you die several times from glitches and terrain weirdness beyond your control, the gameplay feels cheap and unsatisfying.   The controls are not tight enough to serve a game which demands constant careful traversal. Sometimes I've slid down stairs onto mines, or had the jump button suddenly become unresponsive. Many of the commands sometimes feel like they're not responding. The game simply does not give you the control and polish you need for the level of skill it wants from you. I love the idea, the challenge, and the look, but the shaky controls, and frustrating glitches make it too flawed a gem for me to recommend. When I die in a game I want it to be because I screwed up, not because the game suddenly decided to get my character stuck in a wall.",

But I feel this game is not being completely fairly treated by the press - but read the VG247 review for an (IMO) accurate review.  It's a great little game for the price and far better than some of the review scores it's getting. Yes, it can be infuriating at times but it's designed that way so I don't see that as a bad point. Great graphics and sound and moreish gameplay.  I thought my 16 yr old nephew would think it was rubbish as he's been brought up with 3D and doesn't want to play much else other than FIFA, F1 (sorry mate) - but he loved it and we had a great afternoon playing it, laughing at each others pathetic attempts and greedy misfortunes.  Glad to see steam users rating is mostly positive!! The majority are correct!! BUT it might not be for everyone.  UPDATE Played 9 hours now. In that time I've really started to see how the game works and how I could beat it. You become more skilled so even when you have to begin again with no upgrades you know the early levels will be a doddle because you have improved and you make better decisions based on past knowledge. Don't want to give away any more. 100 days hah ha ha!!!!  Forgot to say - try not to lose over 10 grand when trying to get back to the airship. I only needed one more second.. the amount of Â£notes looked great floating down, but I nearly killed my cat!! (sorry Izzy)",

            "review_text": "Being a thief is hard, especialy if you rush in without some sort of plan. Smash a window, grab the loot and get out. That sort of thing. Well, this will probably get you killed. It's all about being patient, calculating your jumps and using your abilities as best as you can.   And that's exactly where The Swindle is a brilliant game. Each ability is usefull. Some don't seem that usefull but it's all about how you play the game. Knowing where the computers are seems like a waste of resource when it's that or a tripple a jump, but information makes the job easier. Tripple jumping to, sure. If you are unlucky and face a lot of empty void between too ledges.  Anyway, managing your money, establishing 'the best buying plan', min/maxin risks and rewards while in missions, figuring out how to get that heavily guarded chest...it's not just a action game, it's a puzzle action game. And with procedural genereration of terrain, the same situation is hardly encountered again. As for how it's proceduraly generated, well, don't expect the same few rooms over and over. There will be similarities but a small underground map can be as easily encountered as a huge 3 storys with a one tower or two. The map are diverse, there may not be enough sort of level but the increasing difficulty and payout rewards make them just the right amount.  One last thing, the music and sounds are good. It's just what you would expect of a steampunk era, and even more what you would expect for a stealth steampunk mood.",

            "review_text": "The Swindle is a procedurally-generated, real-time semi-roguelike solo heist game. You break into randomly-generated houses swarming with robot security guards and attempt to steal all the cash. Eventually you can move up the socio-economic ladder and break into richer buildings like banks and casinos. But it's all moving towards one goal: hack into the AI that is about to be unleashed on the city in 100 days.  There's two levels of failure in this game: You can trip the alarm, or you can die. If you trip the alarm, you get a frantic little while to scarper before the police show up. If you die, you lose all money on this heist and a day towards the deadline.  It's an interesting game. Not as refined as, say, Spelunky. The platforming is a little awkward, and occasionally the level can provide you with an impossible house. There's a nice upgrade tree that you need to climb, but probably cannot get it all before the deadline.  There's lots of great little elements. The heists themselves are neat, with steadily increasing dangerous foes. The atmosphere is great - footsteps change as you go from rooftop to floor, and the rain pattering on rooftops dulls as you go inside. And my favourite, Big Ben chimes when it hits the top of the hour in the real world!  The controls and feel need a bit of polish, but overall it's quite a neat game. It's a good colleague and counterpoint to Spelunky - a campaign rather than a run, upgrades instead of items, patience and care rather than running to the finish.",

You can buy agility perks, abilties like hacking, tools like bombs and unlock better districts. Robots patrolling, cameras, mines and even the polices when you sound the alarm, do not get caught. When you die you keep your perks but the thief is replaced with someone else. This game had me at Steampunk but all in all its a very fun game.",

And don't worry if you are, like me, not a big fan of hardcore stealth games: this one has exacly the right amount of stealth so that you cannot easily rush through levels but you don't have to be planning each move for ten minutes either.   As a steampunk crook, you have a hundred days of heists to prepare for the big one. Through these 100 days, you will, ahem, 'earn' money from every (procedurally generated) house you visit, and then use it to buy upgrades that will make you much better at your job. Those upgrades range from athletic ones, like double or triple jumps, to gadgets like bombs or bugs to help you steal more money, to ones that make the police take more time to appear when you set off an alarm during a heist. Which you will do, like, millions of times.  And yes, you will get caught. And you will die. A LOT. And you will curse at everything around you. And then you'll say to yourself 'okay, just one more heist'. And twenty heists later you will still be there, telling yourself that it will be just one more, and still playing. Remember Spelunky? Well, yes, that.  The graphics, the music, the whole ambientation of the game are just fantastic, and add up to the great feeling of immersion The Swindle has.   Don't be scared of reviews mentioning that controls are bad: even if that might have been the case for some people on the release date version of the game, sucessive patches have made them much better. In fact, the tweaks that are being added little by little by Dan Marshall on every patch are making the game even better and more fun to play while making the learning curve much gentler for first-time players.  So, long story short:  go buy The Swindle! ",

It's got some issues though, the randomly generated nature of the levels can make it more than a little irritating if you don't have some specific upgrades, such as the ability to hack security cameras, as one can be directly over a computer terminal and you won't be able to hack it without setting off the alarm. In fact, hacking computer terminals can be the only real way to get money in the game, as random cash found around the level rarely adds up to much. It would've been a little more balanced had the random cash amounted to a little more, and the cash from hacking computers accounted for a little less.

This is mostly, I'm not afraid to say, down to my incompetence, which this game isn't afraid to remind me of. Regularly.  To describe the core of the game - steal as much cash from each procedurally generated level as possible, without dying - makes it sound simple and repetitive, but that's sort of the genius. Your goal and the way you achieve it often is simple, but your one small mistake will cost you and you will hate yourself for it every time.  'I just need to drop down, whack that guard and the jump over those spikes,' you think, just before mistiming your initial drop, getting spotted by the guard, and jumping into those spikes in a state of panic. Of course, you then try and make up for that mistake by doing something more risky next time (you need to make up for that lost cash somehow!) and, well, you can probably guess why I've barely scratched the surface in 11 hours.  There are a huge amount of upgrades available for you to vary your approach and tactics for the inevitable sixth and seventh playthrough, which often leads to those confidence-dashing moments, too. Y'know, just as you found that perfect combination of upgrades that means that this guy is no longer a threa--oh, he got me.  I've read a few comments saying that it needs a tutorial of some sort. It really, really doesn't. The controls and the mechanics are as simple as they come, it's the real understanding of how you use the simple tools you're provided with, plus those you 'provide'* yourself, that brings the real fun here and that would be taken away with any sort of guide. If you really want help, watch 10 minutes of someone else play it on YouTube and you'll know more than enough to get going.  Basically, it's infuriatingly brilliant because it's always happy to give you the perfect opportunity to â¥â¥â¥â¥ things up, just as you think you've got a handle on it.   * I mean steal.

That's impossible to do in The Swindle because the consequences of being discovered in The Swindle are devastating.   Backing up a bit, in The Swindle you play a thief, whose goal (in addition to making a ton of cash) is to stop the police from inacting the Basilisk, a device that will stop all future theivery. You have 100 days to do it and you need to spend those 100 days working your way up from $0 to enough cash to purchase all the tools you need to steal the heavily guarded Basilik.   And wow. There are some fun skills here. Teleporters, hacking bugs, bombs, cloaking devices, etc. All of which are vital to remaining undetected. Because if a guard does see you... all hell breaks loose. Every guard on the level is chasing you, heavy duty security door are closing everywhere, and an unstoppable police backup is on the way. So yea, it is vital to sneak in, take out the guards one by one, hack the bank accounts and sneak out of there.   The difficulty curve definitely ramps up as you go along, so you have to figure out the best way to spend your money on skill upgrades. It's quite possible to upgrade the wrong skills at the wrong time and find yourself completely outclassed by the neighborhood security systems.

            "review_text": "A great game for hardcore players. The Swindle provides for the player a great challenge with high skill floor and a high skill ceiling both, which when surmounted gives the player great joy as he can appreciate the amount of skill and cleverness required to succesfully accomplishing heists.  When the player is first thrown into the game, there's very little hand-holding and explanation of how the game works. The player learns by experience, and typically by failing a lot. When the player finally thinks he has grasped the obstacles that were presented to him, his advance introduces challenges anew, putting on new twists and requiring even greater skill to surpass. At the same rate the player earns more and more tools that give more ways to complete a level.  The game's difficulty is easily explained: One of the core features limits the number of times you can play through all the levels, and at first these attempts are not enough for the player to reach the end as he must spend many of those by learning through failure, and the failure consequences must be faced. But the end result is that the perseverant players are rewarded with a lot of development in their personal ability to play the game. If a lower difficulty level was allowed, most would simply use it instead and not be able to fully appreciate their development.  Personally, after finally beating it, I came back for more, and found myself becoming better and better at it, completing the game faster and harder each time. This development and the pleasure it brings is the experience the game wants to invoke, and for me, it was utterly succesful.",
