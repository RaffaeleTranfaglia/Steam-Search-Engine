            "review_text": "Very good football manager simulation game. Its free and seems to be even better than Football Manager to me as they dont tack on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D graphics that are ugly, they just stick to text/2D style which is much better.  A lot of false reviews say you must pay for transfers. This is not true you can play this game 100% free. Of course there are going to be OPTIONAL micro-transactions in a F2P game, how do you expect the devs to make some money back? Its only fair and once again, it is completely optional you can sign big players if you're a big club, so its realistic.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes football.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to start off by saying that this game is much better than I thought it would be.  I played Soccer Manager 2015 and 2016 and I wasn't entirely impressed by them. I felt they were lacking and had a few problems that seem to have been worked out. *Note - This isn't anything close to how Football Manager is, so don't go in expecting that.  I'm currently playing the game as a placeholder I suppose for the lack of a better name until Football Manager 2017 comes out. You can start off with any team you want. Player ratings are done a bit weird, but it isn't a big deal. For the most part, transfer budgets are fairly small (about 20ish million). That budget is the norm for all big teams as far as I know. You can purchase 'Cash Injections' but you really don't need too, it is very easy to make money (Raise youth players and sell them, bring in players on free transfers and sell them, sell fringe players, etc. If you're losing money every month then that means you have a player who has a very large wage and you don't have enough cash so becareful of that.)   The game does 1 thing that I've seen never before in Football Manager: Players arrive late for training and don't perform well. I thought that was a cool and interesting feature, and funny when it was Nicklas Bendtner that did it.  Games go by very quick, not much to them. Pick one of the few formations available, set few tactics, and you can assign player roles. All games are done on a 2D match engine. I'd love to see a 3D match engine.  Transfer tips: Sign Christian Pulisic and take a look at the free transfers, you can get Martin Caceres and Alex on a free in the first season and some other decent mid to high 80 players.  I'd love to see the microtransactions disappear. I wouldn't mind spending 10 - 15 bucks on this game to have no microtransactions and a 3D match engine.  One last thing, I'd also love to see a redesigned UI and more information on players and clubs, in similar fashion to Football Manager.",

One problem is that the matches are quite boring to watch, but it can get exciting if your team scores a goal or if your keeper makes a save. It is also very fun to compete against your friends. I give this game a 9.5/10.",

But there is only 2 negative things i need to say to improve. Improve goalkeepers they don't save anything any shot that happend goes in. And also give us more money to start off with teams like madrid and barca should start with like $90m not $30m. Other than that this game is very good and i suggest to get this game :)",
