Lion quest is a charming and vibrant platformer with a lot of exploration to do. The levels are huge!   The multiplayer is a lot of fun with friends, and has a simplified and refined smash brothers feel to it. Lots of characters to unlock and one or two of them change the gameplay significantly which lets you replay the levels and find new things. The puzzles where you are controlling two characters at the same time are really cool, and the mind control effect was a nice surprise.",
