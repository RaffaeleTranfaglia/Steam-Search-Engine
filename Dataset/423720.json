            "review_text": "  You might be old enough to remember those brightly lit and colorful vector style games from the early 80's arcades...ones which ignited your imagination with awe &amp; wonder as they hypnotically called out for you to drop a quarter inside so that you could go head to head against both this marvelous machine, as well as fellow players, to see who would come out on top with the highest score.  I now introduce you to Color Chaos created by Daniel Riley, an old-school styled twin-stick shooter which seeks to capture and mimic that very magic of years gone by in those gathering rooms for teens which could best be described as an electronic wonderland for those fortunate enough to experience it.   I found the gameplay dynamic of this particular title to be rather unqiue &amp; intriguing. And the way it works, is that you are able to shoot enemy ships of any color except your own, and they in turn adhere to the very same principle when firing upon you. Two exact colors cannot harm one another here, but it becomes even more interesting still because both you and they have the ability to shift current colors to a different one, which adds an entirely new element of tactical play in this game.   There are also 2 game modes present by the way, 'Classic' (progressively harder and more numerous enemies the longer you stay alive) and 'Chaos' (described as more enemies, more firepower and more chaos), so as to inject a greater amount of variety into the gameplay.  Furthermore, also present is a nifty power-up system in place which allows you to temporarily increase your ships' abilities in various ways, by simply moving toward &amp; collecting the item whenever it appears on the screen.  I spent a reasonable amount of time experimenting with and playing Color Chaos to develop a good feel for it...in order to ascertain what its strengths and inherent weaknesses were. And in the end, I felt it was somewhat of a mixed bag. A very admirable effort to be sure, which, if tweaked in a couple specific ways could be even more fun.  Firstly, I will go over some aspects of it which I wasn't a particularly big fan of. I felt that there was simply an excessive amount of color bloom present, especially toward the center of the screen, where it all blended together into a hazy semi-translucent morass which wasn't very easy on the eyes I might add. It might have instead been optimal to leave the inner gameplay area a largely pitch black star-field to more nicely contrast with the pretty colors of the ships and boundary lines. That would have actually looked rather sharp and pleasing. It isn't to say that the the current effect is poor by any stretch, I just feel that it isn't necessarily ideal, and this is only my personal opinion on the matter. Others may or may not agree with this.   Secondly, Color Chaos is exceedingly difficult, especially when using a mouse &amp; keyboard. It was definitely designed for the hardcore enthusiast of this genre in mind....with each game typically measured in several white-knuckle seconds for the typical gamer, and certainly not in minutes unless you are perhaps a seasoned veteran who practices relentlessly. And because of it being sudden death, once you are dead then that's it - you'll need to start over again to strive for a new high score, which is clearly the main objective here incidentally. The difficulty stems from the fact that enemies are chasing you continuously &amp; relentlessly at all times, forcing you to mostly move in a wide circular pattern so as to avoid them, while also firing upon you with bullets which travel at a surprisingly fast pace. It was difficult to establish any kind of rhythm or groove since each individual game simply didn't last very long. Perhaps making the enemies sometimes change direction in a more random manner might have added even more to the satisfaction of the gameplay dynamic. As it was however, I just couldn't imagine myself sinking hours at a time into this, and thus it's more ideally suited to being played in short controlled bursts.   Now onto the decidedly positive side of things, I will say that the game itself runs exceptionally well with no framerate issues and even includes the ability to play with both keyboard &amp; mouse, or a controller...with remappable keys for the former.   Additionally, both the background music (ambient electronica) and sound effects were superbly implemented, and it is definitely one of the highlights to be found here. Together they both generated a very mellow and relaxing vibe to the game, which counter-balanced nicely against the sheer challenge of it. Somehow it works, and works very well.   Verdict",
