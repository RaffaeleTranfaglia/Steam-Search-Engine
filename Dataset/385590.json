            "review_text": "This game, despite it's appearance and relative 'cheapness,' is actually very well done and fun. It's more entertaining than some AAA games and simple to enjoy. I highly recommend this game for anyone who's just looking to kill some time. Although the story is a little contrived, it's still enjoyable. The gameplay itself is easy to master and fun to mess around with. The added bonus of being able to just sit in an area and 'farm xp' makes this a lot easier than just rushing through the story.",

            "review_text": "This is an excellent throwback turn-based RPG with a good storyline. The undead are taking over and as the king's right-hand man you are tasked with making things right again. You'll meet many people along the way and recruit several of them to join you in your mission. I've had a lot of fun saving the world from necromancy.  Pros:  Turn-based RPG goodness with fun cartoonish graphics   Upgradable weapons and armor via earned items from battle   Several characters available (once unlocked) to allow various combos and play styles   Dialogue that is amusing (at times) amongst the characters   Cons:  Can only have 3 active party members   Grinding may be required (though I'm not sure this is actually a con since it's a turn-based RPG)   Battles are often heavily influenced by you having the right element equipped   For the money it's absolutely worth the purchase, though I wish it was a longer game.",

I truly do suggest this game for those who are interested in turn based RPGs. The fact that you are at full health and your dead characters are revived after each round is just truly nice to have for once.   Yeah....I suggest getting this game and I sorta feel bad for being able to get it in a bundle but I would gladly have bought it if it wasn't knowing how it plays is all.",

Enjoying it so far at least, but there are like two things that I wish it had, which are; keyboard controls(everything is done with the mouse) and an auto battle button. Both of these things are minor, but it would make the game less tedious at grindy moments.",
