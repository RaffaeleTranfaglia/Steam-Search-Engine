            "review_text": "It looks like just a bunch of robots killing each other to most people, but Total Annihilation is one of the deepest darkest stories ever told. It's the only accurate game I've ever seen about our future, where humans are all dead and the arm clones fight the core planetary mind for control of the universe. They don't even care about being alive or anything, they just want to annihilate the other side so so much. Sometimes a battle can take like 8 hours and just grind on, it takes so much willpower to keep going, or to even notice when you get nuked. It's an endless battle. It also has a great soundtrack written by Jeremy Seole, who wrote a lot of the music in Secret of Evermore. The first time I saw Total Annihilation, I was in Circuit City and I saw this cool looking guy getting bombed by 50 fast moving fighters and planes and he couldn't stop the computer from killing him and he eventually lost his commander and then his last towers and the map went grey. It was like 1997 or something and he must have been horrible at the game and I don't think either of us bought anything from circuit city that day, but to see that cool guy get annihilated by an endless wave of planes was shocking to me. He said 'damn it' or something like that and then looked at his watch and said 'oh no' and then he ran away, I guess he had to go somewhere and was late. I saw it as a great challenge to become as good as he was some day, and I still feel like I'm not, but objectively I must have met that challenge because I have won wars against 10 computer players with population limits in the thousands. If I could go back in time, I would go back there, ask him if i could help, and save his base.",

It may be old, but that doesn't mean that it's mechanics and gameplay aren't unique. This game is truly one of a kind and its gaming mechanics and how it is played might not be replicated for a very, very long time.",

It was so ahead of its time and still provides great entertainment today. Tons of units, advanced controls, huge maps, 3D environment, great physics engine with satisfying explosions, an active modding community (still - almost 20 years on! check out TA Universe) and one of the best game OSTs i've ever heard courtesy of Jeremy Soule. The only thing that could do with updating a little is the AI, but skirmish is still great (hit * then x at the skirmish menu to unlock all 10 AI slots).  The only RTS i've loved since has been Supreme Commander (the first one), which was the spiritual successor to this game and made by the same people.",

Or even Star/Warcraft. Or even any C&amp;C title up to 3. Forget about C&amp;C 4 and anything after it. But I digress.  TA has withstood the test of time, has a active community that has produced quite literaly thousands of new units, and dated graphics as it has, still is an incredible and massive game, with a even more incredible original made music.  The only flaw I can point is that the minimap wont scale up with monitor resolution, a thing that for those like me that still have the original CDs, might be a tad frustrating.  Give yourself the chance to play this true classic of PC gaming, that deserves the same praise given to titles such as Doom or Baldur's Gate.  10000/10 Energy would 1000/10 Metal again.",

I'm running windows 10 Pro, my CPU is a quad core i7 (4770K), and my GPU is a GTX 780 Ti. Not only have I never once had an issue running the game, but I often play with NVidia Surround turned on so it spans across all three of my monitors. That's probably as much 'chaos' as I can put on the game's rendering engine and logic control, yet I've never had it not working flawlessly. It's not that it doesn't work on Windows 10. It just doesn't work on whatever configuration you have.  That said: Total Annihilation was the first strategy game I've ever played back when it first came out. I still play it to this day and I even play multiplayer with my friend and my dad. TA was absolutely before it's time. Weapons and vision are affected by real Line of Sight and you can gain the advantage when attacking from higher ground.  I don't want to go into a long winded review as that's not really my thing but this game maintains playability even after having already played it for 19 years so far (Released in '97). This really is a fun game absolutely worthy of buying! I've purchased it both on Steam and GOG despite the fact that I still have the original CDs. I definitely reccommend it.",

It's well balanced, it's exciting and the soundtrack is unlike anything you get these days, I still remember hearing my CD-ROM drive winding up as I was being attacked, trying to change songs to something more upbeat.  It's addictive too, with memorable and unique units across the board (especially the planes that are properly fast). Also, 1920 x 1080 in 1997.  This is the game that stood the test of time, and it continues to do so with every passing year. I could go on but all I can say is: Worth every cent.",

            "review_text": "I'm a pretty crappy writer so I apologize in advance.  Total Annihilation is an incredibly unique and intense RTS that was light-years ahead of its time and still is today. I still strongly prefer the original over the more spiritual-successor, Planetary Annihilation.  Total Annihilation features so many small features that just make it amazing, the battles can be huge and intense with massive amounts of units having a huge Warhammer 40k esque fight all on one screen, or the games can be slow and brilliantly thought out. This is a strategy game where you can win purely by 'defensive' play at times, something I find to be rather unique among a lot of strategy games that even today have rather narrow methods to win, usually by just having the larger and better offensive force, but not always in Total Annihilation.   A feature that makes Total Annihilation so unique is the true emphasis on a defensive playstyle, if you so desire. There are an impressive amount of options for defensive, slow play styles and faster, more offensive playstyles alike. You can choose to hunker down and improve your economy while building a large amount of turrets and upgrading to better ones over the course of the game, some are even capable of bombarding your opponent from the entire maps length, assuming you reach the demanding level of tech and economy required for them. Even tactical nukes can be constructed and launched over a map away if the game length and level of sustainable economy is reached. This allows for a lot of options for a lot of different types of players. There is also no real super demanding macro-memory required à la StarCraft II, making the game just a bit more accessable to newer players, especially in more team oriented game modes.  The game also features incredible physics for it's more 2.5 dimensional, isometric strategy experience. One of my favourite things about this game is seeing things like unit inaccuracy, especially when on the move or on unstable ground or even when taking pot-shots at something through the fog-of-war. Units will have better vision when on the high ground and worse vision when in a trench, making a lot of areas on maps incredibly strategic locations. There's even bullet physics, units will often adjust their aim higher or lower depending on the target, and when the steel corpses begin to litter the battlefield they will often block incoming rounds harmlessly while your units continue to trudge past the enemy fire. There's a gritty feeling seeing all your units charge an enemy fortified position only to begin seeing the missiles and rounds begin to rain down upon them and seeing a huge chunk of your force get obliterated by a large round, shaking the screen and sending chunks of steel flying in every direction, the steel 'gibs' even damaging nearby units who get hit by them.  The game also features an amazing orchestral 'dynamic' music score written and composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. The music really compliments an already fantastic game nicely, changing to a more brooding tone as you build up your base and switching to a more heart-pounding score as enemy fighters engage your army. It's an incredible soundtrack that you may even consider finding for your own music player. The sound design alone in this game is also very unique and give it a great distinct and 'mechanical' feel.  If there was one strategy that I think is criminally unknown to most people, this would have to be it. It's made an amazingly tight-knit community that continue to play the original and have a huge modding scene. (Seriously, try the Total Annihilation Escalation mod, it's just insanely good.) Some even going as far as recreating the Total Annihilation experience in full 3D via an open source engine called Spring, try Spring Total Annihilation out sometime, it has a great community still supporting it to this day.  Overall it's my favourite RTS game of all time, and I'm not even a huge RTS fan. It's incredibly exciting just to watch with an amazing soundtrack and huge, epic battles.  10/10, would D-Gun again.",

I also thought the story and lore of Total Annihilation was really cool, so I will give you a brief summary (Spoilers probably)    In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core, and their triumphs has set to colonize the milky way galaxy and set them in a long lasting time of prosperity.  All has changed when a technological breakthrough called 'Patterning', which transfers human consciousness into mechanical bodies, which makes them live indefinately. The Core makes this a public health measure and made it manditory to Pattern all human life forms. A rebellious group called the Arm protested and fought the Core because of this decision, resulting in a 4000 year war.   The Arm and the Core fought so viciously, which lead to the extinction of the human race, but the robotic armies of the two still manage to fight and keep the war going. Now it is up to you to decide who wins...    Overall, I really recommend this game!  ",

It still has issues of disappearing status bar at the bottom of the screen if you actually run AT your resolution (1920x1080 for example), you gotta run at something like 1680x900 in order to actually see the entire UI on screen, which is ridiculous. And it really is a must, because you NEED that status bar to see build rates, energy and metal rates, etc for selected or hovered-over items and factories.  The great thing however is that this IS the best working version so far. You dont have to edit .ini files or use third party apps to get it running properly in fullscreen without glitches, apart from the above mentioned. For that alone it is worth a rebuy (because we cant really blame the original devs for not considering Windows 8 / 10 compatability, now can we?) :)  That said, I highly recommend people to immediately get some of the convenience mods / balance patches out there. In some ways they are almost required to enjoy the game in a modern RTS mindset. Such as being able to select groups with just pressing 1, instead of pressing Alt+1 which was ridiculous at that time, and is still highly user-unfriendly today. Or being able to hold and drag buildings when holding shift. Makes building walls feasible, which it wasnt in vanilla TA placing one at a time, click click click click.  A great masterpiece of a game that DOES show its age due to some weird control schemes they opted for in the old days. But with mods to modernize and 'logicalize' the controls, it still holds up today, despite the awful pathfinding. The pure atmosphere and 'feel' of the game is still un-rivaled. No other RTS 'feels' like TA. Perhaps it is the music, perhaps it is the graphics, perhaps it is the clunky slow controls. No matter what it is, it is greater than the sum of its part. A robbery at this price, must-buy.",

As the son of one of the founders of the Freedom Fighters Alliance on HEAT, I was quickly introduced to Total Annihilation at a very young age, and quickly fell in love with it!  When I got a new computer, and lost Total Annihilation, and I never got to play it ever again, UNTIL NOW! I love this game, and I Totally Annihilate everyone! (Get it? hehe)  The soundtrack is if not, one of the greatest soundtracks ever! Composed by Jeremy Soule, the soundtrack has that suspencful classic theme to it whenever you are in combat, which just makes the gameplay experience so much better!  I also thought the story and lore of Total Annihilation was really cool, so I will give you a brief summary (Spoilers probably)    In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core, and their triumphs has set to colonize the milky way galaxy and set them in a long lasting time of prosperity.  All has changed when a technological breakthrough called 'Patterning', which transfers human consciousness into mechanical bodies, which makes them live indefinately. The Core makes this a public health measure and made it manditory to Pattern all human life forms. A rebellious group called the Arm protested and fought the Core because of this decision, resulting in a 4000 year war.   The Arm and the Core fought so viciously, which lead to the extinction of the human race, but the robotic armies of the two still manage to fight and keep the war going. Now it is up to you to decide who wins...    Overall, I really recommend this game!  ",

To be a commander that controles hundreds of units, weather that be land, sea, air, or a combination of all. There is K-bots, tanks, bombers, fighters, frigets, destoryers, submarines, battleships, lazer turrets, Big cannons, and Of course nuke launchers. That is just a fraction of stuff you can build, and incounter. You get one of two factions to choose from. The Core and the Arm. Both teams have there pros and cons which makes for diffrent tactics to be used for both factions. The battles get intense with a wonderful orcestrated soundtrack to go with it. The campain is a great way to learn the lore behind the machines. This game supports single player campain, single player skirmesh, and multiplayer skirmesh. You get a nice veriety of maps to play on and AI support up to nine which is nice but very cayotic and sometimes hard to play on smaller maps.(Because every one D-Guns each others face at start). The core game is grate and considering this steam reliese comes with both Core Contingency, and Battle Tactics expantions makes me prund to still love and praise TA as the best RTS from the past.   Long live the ARM!! RIP CaveDog Entertainment",

A buddy of mine bought the game and told me you gotta see this game. Never before had we seen anything like it and we were instantly hooked as were several other of our friends. Back the, you had to download a program so you play against others, so we opted for Lan parties instead. Since 1997, I have pulled this game out and played it everyyear since. When I tried to load it up a week ago, it didn't work. Was a little dissappointed and thought it was time to move on and then it popped up on my front page yesterday. I didn't hesitate. The base game and both expansions are here and there are at least 150 single player missions and more units than you can possibly imagine. Makes for very large scale battles, especially if you are playing on one of the metal maps. The graphics are obviousley lacking and the game isn't as revelutionary as it was then, but this game has great meaning for me and changed the way I viewed gaming. It was the first game that got me really excited and it changed the way games were made. I remember Chris Taylor saying he wanted to go straight to TA2, but they wanted to make TA:Kingdoms, which was a game I enjoyed, but not even close to as much as TA. And because they didn't go straight to TA2, well, the rest is history. TA:K didn't do so well and the company eventually went under with no sequel ever done. The ownership has changed many times over (last I heard a company in Japan had it and wouldn't part with it) and a sequel does not seem to ever be coming which is a tragedy. It is probably one of the reasons this game is as iconic and beloved as it still is today. After loading up the game last night, I coudn't beleive that 2 hours had passed so quickly. Still love and cherish this game.  Still loving this game and just played it for the 20th year in a row.",
