            "review_text": "I normally play RPG Maker games, but do play Rogue like games occassionally too. I enjoyed this game very much and have already spend 55 hours on it and am still extremely interested in the game. Let me share with you why I like this game, and what make it so captivating.  Firstly, this game is fun, and can be completed in short sessions. You start off with a team of 4 but should increase it to 6 as soon as possible to give you more firepower. Then, it is a matter of short and fun trips down the dungeon to get more XP and items. I believe it is the strategic approach that make the game real fun an interesting, and if you find the right approach, it will maintain your interest in the game.  The way I normally play roguelike games is to go as far down the dungeon as I can. However, this approach is not really effective with this game, because when you die, you lose all the items that you are carrying in your inventory, and the items equipped on your dead character. Hence I have to take a totally different approach when playing this game with the goal of NOT dying.  The way that this game is setup involves a boss guarding the stairs on every 5 levels. Usually these bosses are difficult if you are not fully prepared. You can leave the dungeon and go all the way back to town anytime you from ANY level once you find a stair. However, you can enter the dungeon at intervals of every 5 levels once you defeat the boss and find the stairs too.  So, to prevent unnecessary deaths, I do not face the bosses until I am fully prepared. I make short trips of 1 or 2 levels to gain more XP and upgrade better gears. I also make use of the facilities in town to Enchant or Fuse gears to get good items. Furthermore, I also farm for Epic Gears, which are the best in the game. Only when I feel that I can kill all the monsters easily, then I approach and kill the bosses guarding every 5 levels. So with this strategy, I have not died once, and have got down to level 30, killing 6 bosses, and got about 25 epic gears in the process. Like I say, the fun in this game is making short trips, gaining more fighting power, and making sure that your characters do not die.  I have experiemented with many different party setups but found this party of 6 extremely effective: === 2 paladins, 2 mages, 1 cleric, 1 warrior. === With this setup, you can have 3 tanks (2 paladins+warrior), 3 healers (2 paladins+cleric) and 3 strong casters (2 mages+cleric). Boss fights can be extremely tough and you definitely need 3 tanks in front and 3 dedicated healers to keep your party alive. Furthermore, the casters are the one that does the most damages with their AOEs that can wipe out an entire battlefield of monsters.  So, far I am only half way done with the game (killed 6 out of 10 bosses) but I know that I will be having many more hours of fun with this game!! I will give another update later when I finish the game too.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who like to play in burst of short, fun-filled game sessions",

            "review_text": "UPDATED! So far this seems to be exactly the type of gameplay I was looking for. I had recently beaten shining in the darkness from the genesis (on steam also) and was looking for another fun dungeon crawler that wasn't some frantic button masher. I really like the whole atmosphere of the game, setting and gameplay. So far though, the game crashes a lot. randomly, I want to help the game and report it, but I don't know how. Sometimes while moving, others while staring at stats on an item, and somtimes in battle. I think it has started affected my items and changing the stats and even maybe affected my gold totals. kind of a bother in an otherwise very fun romp through a grid dungeon. Once I can play a solid 20 minutes without a crash I will be really happy with this.  UPDATE: Two days afterwards the crashes all stopped. This game is a lot of fun, it got challenging towards floor 18. keep up the good work!  UPDATE #2: I have apparently put 30 hours into this game so far. It shouldn't be this fun, but it is. The game has so much charm and love put into it. Killin monsters is very satisfying!",

This is the game you can enjoy without having to keep a thousand notes or juggle a hundred different quests , characters and maps . You can play this , take a break and play something like Skyrim until you burn out on it and then come back to this and pick up where you left off . A great way to recharge and relax until you are ready for your next major effort .",

Procedural levels, turn based everything and a carpload of loot, that's my idea of a great dungeon crawler!   Also, after you clear each floor, you are given the option to go back to town or continue upwards. If you choose next level, you're stuck there until you find the stairs or your party wipes, whatever happens first. This adds fun as you can choose to push your luck until you're desperately searching for the stairs with a couple downed characters!   tl; dr: Its simple and fun, and the devs deserve your $$",

I won't take much of your time by writing about the ingame mechanics, there are already many reviews that do it (and better than I ever could). Let me tell you instead what you will be supporting if you buy this game.   This game is handled by a one-man team. The developer of this game is not only very active on the community, he also updates the game regularly with game fixes and content patches. He is always polite and kind on the forums.  Personally I think it's rare to find developers like this and I encourage everyone who likes to help the little guy (and the game is a bonus) to buy this game.",

Binding of issac, a 5 buck flash game, has better use of procedual than this game. -0 npcs and 0 story despite having a town you can go back to.",

            "review_text": "So far it basically looks like a beta with promise. There are good ideas here, and it's possible to have some casual fun. But it's seriously lacking in polish.  The graphics are serviceable. It's a game that doesn't need a lot of flashy looks for fun. But it's also a rather bland art style. Some sort of more unique and interesting style to the art and the game would help.  I do like the option of accepting quests (though they seem very limited currently, like 'kill 5 imps next trip'), and of returning to the town to recover and try some upgrading. It does end up with a rather grindy feel, though, even with being able to choose to re-enter at levels other than 1 every time. And venturing in to the ever-changing tower has quite a bit of appeal for exploring, even if it seems fairly limited so far.  Inside the tower you only run in to enemies when opening new rooms. You never know what's behind the door, a tough or easy fight or something else. You also won't know how much health and mana you've recovered until you step in to a fight, and can't do any preparation outside of combat. No potions are involved.  Misspellings are not rare. Character generation, you get to create 4 out of a potential party of six, is very limited. A very limited number of headshots. Species doesn't make much obvious difference and there's very little information. The only time armor rating for characters can be found is when entering the tower, for instance, and limits on what a class can equip aren't shown...you only find out when trying to equip. There's very little or no explanation about how most of the mechanics function.  There also appears to be some bug(s). Some of the level 5 traits aren't available to select despite appearing to meet the criteria. Locked doors you can find keys as loot on enemies, but I've yet to find how one is supposed to open blocked doors.   To sum up, I'd say that Darkest Dungeon does most everything Zavix Tower does, but far better. It just has that much darker theme. Zavix looks more like traditional D&amp;D style adventuring, but the execution still needs a lot of work.",

            "review_text": "Heads-up!   (No offense. I'm not angry. Just wanted to buy a really good, fun indie game.)  Jheesus, this game is a trainwreck. Doesn't support 1280x1024 monitors, GUI scales better to modern monitors, is only readable(maybe) on a 1920x1080 monitor, but that could be overlooked if the game were fun. This game is not fun, unfortunately. No offense of course, I __wanted__ to be surprised by an excellent product and while it was downloading I already planned to write a praising review, that I bought a good game based on 'Very Positive' reviews on Steam, I wanted to be happy for the developer, but ALAS: its impossible, when the whole product is mediocre.   Pros: + Dungeon graphics is okay.  + Some monsters are funny: wolf + Big main attribute fonts   Cons: - Item icons are too small - most of the GUI is badly proportioned - - tooltip font is small, out of proportion compared to its own window size. Look at the Diablo 1 fonts and window proportions. - item description texts are very small: comparing items strains the eyes.  - There is a large picture depicting a chest and tiny item icons for loot? Come on, man! At least learn proportions or hire somebody, who understands GUI graphics. - the music is bad. Okay, I understand.  - GUI is simply bad: icons should be 3x size along with the text (the devil is in the details, for some of us, you know) - character portraits are ridiculously small: as are their tiny skill icons - City (area) with stores, etc.. is mediocre work. The TABS identifying the buildings are wrongly colored and small, color scheme is weakly chosen, overall City has a mediocre art direction.  - enemy spell animations are horrible: come on man, hire a particle effect artist! - Humanoid monster models are ugly, made by an unskilled employee - gold is scattered around in some rooms, but party cannot gather it up. :) - Sound effects are bad, almost disturbing to listen to - Graphics is haphazardly done without much skill, probably the better looking walls and doors were purchased or made by someone else or just the artist has environment skills mostly? - Now I can understand the so many and relatively frequent updates: mediocre art and weak design is easy to update, it doesn't really costs too much energy to deliver low level work week by week.  Not recommended. This game is unfixable, too many bad decisions were made by the developer and fixing them would require a new game to be made. :)   Result: Asking for a refund.",
