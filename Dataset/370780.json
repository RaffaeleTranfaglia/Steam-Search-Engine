Please, if you're going to drop an obviously rpg-maker-esque game, SPELL CHECK YOUR DIALOGUE.   I can move past the low-quality copy-paste images for 'monsters', even the forced story without any real build-up, but obvious grammar mistakes and forgetting to end a sentence... That is too far.  You have to make me want to love the main character, or even hate him. I don't care, just make me feel something instead of spacing through long dialogues. I'm sorry, but after 30 minutes of gameplay I did not enjoy it for a moment, and I will be requesting a refund. I'll happily give more critiques, and I really don't mean to come off like a troll, but this game really needs to be reviewed. It's hardly playable. I'll even re-purchase it again if I hear about updates.  Sorry. FuzzyPanda",

            "review_text": "In Fated Souls the main character (Gauly) is thrown into an innocent enough sounding situation wherein he is called on to escort a maiden (and her mentor) of the 'Great Church' to a faraway temple. Simple enough, but, of course, obstacles of all sorts present themselves in this quick moving and absorbing story of a man (Gauly) who is tormented by his inner conflicts and past history as a mercenary. As the trio move across the world, there are many characters, situations, monsters, and 'anomalies' ---- boss fights ---- that have to be dealt with along with a lot of exploration and things to discover that will keep you alert and interested in this nicely told story.  Character development gets high marks in this game ---- each of the main protagonists slowly reveal their true selves and their motivations as you get further into the tale. Gauly especially is believable and interesting.  High marks go to the music in the game, which sometimes adds to the suspenseful atmosphere, and sometimes offers relief in the form of light and catchy tunes ---- but is never overpowering.  Artwork is very good, particularly in the battle scenes. And the world itself is bright and colorful while caves, gloomy forests, etc. are presented in good detail.  The game offers a bit higher challenge in the beginning than most, but once you get the feel of how to battle and use magic the balance is just fine for moving along easily.  It's a classic 16-bit style rpg that is exciting and smoothly paced, and I'm glad it has arrived on Steam. I hope the sequel comes along soon.  ",
