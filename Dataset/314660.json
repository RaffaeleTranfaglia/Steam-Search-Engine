I was skeptical after seeing a video complaining about how 'fast' things moved, and how they didn't pay 'enough' attention to detail, but I had bought it already -- I'm glad I did. This is without a doubt as close to a perfect remake of a game as you can get. They added a few things here and there I thought was a little 'odd', but then again, it's made for modern gamers with pure faith to the classics structure, after so much time into the game, you don't notice them and they do blend in with the creativity of the world. I haven't enjoyed a game on this level in a long time.  I can't wait for my kids to get a little older and show them this game and introduce them to another great 'man' named Abe.  Also: I use the Xbox 'rock candy' controller to play it, works fine on Windows 7.",

            "review_text": "  'In a carnivorous world where communication is key, you're a living snack with your mouth sewn shut.'     Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty  is a complete HD remake of  Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee , a cinematic platformer originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation and PC. In this game, you play as Abe, a Mudokon slave working for RuptureFarms, the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld. RuptureFarms is known for their delicious snacks made from live animals. One day, Abe stumbles upon a corporate meeting held by his bosses, the Glukkons, and discovers that Mudokons would soon be slaughtered and turned into another tasty treat. Our unlikely hero abandons his job and attempts to escape RuptureFarms and rescue all of his Mudokon co-workers from captivity, unknowingly fulfilling his destiny in the process.  As Abe, you must run, jump, climb, avoid enemies, and solve puzzles through many varied environments along your quest. Abe's controls are just as responsive and fluid as they were in  Oddysee.  The game is playable with a keyboard and mouse, but I suggest using a gamepad. The original game's unique GameSpeak system has returned and it is better than ever. GameSpeak allows Abe to talk to his fellow Mudokons to help them escape the facility. However, Abe can now get multiple Mudokons to follow him at once, a feature that was first introduced in  Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus.  This makes quite a few sequences in the game far less tedious to solve while not making the game too much easier. In addition to this,  New 'n' Tasty  has increased the number of Mudokons to save to 299, instead of the original game's 99. In order to save everyone, you will have to search high and low for the various secret areas hidden throughout RuptureFarms and beyond.   New 'n' Tasty  has implemented many new features to keep the gameplay fresh and more accessible for new players. Abe now has a health system and loses health whenever he is damaged, rather than instantly dying like in  Oddysee.  To make up for this, the game now has three difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Easy and Normal let Abe take a bit of damage before dying, whereas Hard Mode retains the original game's one-hit death. Difficulty also affects the number of throwable items that Abe can hold at a time and how fast enemies will react in certain situations. For returning Oddworld fans, I definitely recommend Hard mode. It provides a much more challenging and rewarding experience than the lower difficulty settings. However, if this is your first time venturing through Oddworld, you may want to try out Normal before diving into Hard. Checkpoints have returned, but they appear more frequently throughout the game. Quicksaving, another feature introduced in  Abe's Exoddus , has been added to  New 'n' Tasty , allowing you to save anywhere at any time.  Since this is a remake, all of  New 'n' Tasty 's graphics and sounds have been completely remade from the ground up. The remastered soundtrack sounds great and stays very true to the original. Graphically, the game looks absolutely amazing compared to  Oddysee.  All of the cutscenes have been updated and there are even some brand new cinematics as well. However, the look and feel of many places, specifically RuptureFarms, have been changed somewhat. Several areas in the game have been altered to look more bright and vibrant compared to  Abe's Oddysee.  Whether you like these changes will depend on your personal preferences, but I don't really mind them. The game still has its own unique style that is nothing like any other game out there.  In short,  Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty  is an amazing game. It retains most of the elements that made  Abe's Oddysee  great while adding several new components to improve upon the original. If you are a fan of the  Oddworld  series, you are sure to enjoy this game. If you've never played an  Oddworld  game in your life, you should definitely give this a try. This game is worth buying at full price, so be sure to pick it up if you find it on sale.  (Note: This is my first attempt at writing an actual game review.

            "review_text": "Really great remake. To me it's a perfect blend of nostalgia and novelty. If you played the original at all, you will recognize the levels and all the iconic landmarks and creatures, but from a different perspective. The way the camera moves along the level actually makes it an easier playthrough than the original, where you could only see one block of the level at a time. That's probably the biggest difference. That, and when you throw objects, it's much easier to aim. Beyond that, it stays true to the original and I really enjoyed it.  A couple minor gripes: the default controls for gamepad are not identical to the original, but you can change that in the game options. Another thing is the game lets you quicksave with a controller, but not quickload. You have to go into the menu and load your quicksave, which isn't very quick at all. The keyboard, however, does have a quickload key. But when you opt to use a controller, the keyboard controls are disabled, so you can't even tap the quickload key real quick and resume playing with your controller. If you play solely with the keyboard, this won't be a problem.  Even if you haven't played the original, definitely give this one a try. It's a great puzzle platformer with a unique world and vibe that I haven't really seen replicated anywhere else.  ",

            "review_text": "I saw Oddworld : Abe's Oddysee when I was just mindlessly roaming the internet, and I immediately loved the game. I downloaded an emulator and started playing it, and it was fun, but really challenging! I then saw a remake for the game had just been on sale. I WANTED IT BADLY.  Anyways, here's my review.  Gameplay wise, it plays alot more smoother than the original Abe's Oddysee, speaking that New N' Tasty now uses models and such. But at times, it could really be tricky to tell where something will effect Abe or not, due to the fact that it scrolls across the level instead of the classing screen shifting. I don't mind this, and it does bring more action to the fast paced levels. Here's the most important things that you'll need to play New N' Tasty.  A good computer, and a freakin' brain. This game requires some real thinking. It's really easy to get stuck on something for a while. This is basically a graphic enhancement of Abe's Oddysee, right? No, it's not. The levels differ from the original alot, and this time it's much more easier. I like this change, because playing the original seemed a bit too challenging for me. ( I'M NOT VERY SMART. :P ) The only problem are the glitches. But I have no huge problem with them. The ragdoll physics aren't top notch, as Abe can look like he buried himself into the ground, or have a major spazz-out. And at times the ragdolls can break the realistic flow of the game. But that's just me. But anyways, this game is really worth the buy. Just make sure your computer is strong enough to handle it.",

            "review_text": "Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty has been in development for quite some time now, and all I can say is it was well worth the wait. The game is absolutley gorgeous and rebuilt from the ground up, I can absolutley say that it is worth the £14.99 asking price, you get more out of it than some AAA titles that cost £50+. Not only are the graphics beautiful, but the game is also suprisingly easy to run at 1080p (i can run it at 50Fps medium settings) considering it is built in a 3D environment.  The gameplay does not at all let you down, with a few control tweaks which are easily accessible in the settings menu, you can create quick and easy controls for fast action platforming. The gameplay is very fluid and exciting, you might think it is another silly kid's game that can be abandoned in a dark corner of Steam, but no, it is one of the most thrilling and exciting experiances you will have as a gamer. The story, gameplay, graphics, sounds and animations are some of the best I have ever seen in a platformer. You won't be disappointed.  Finally, as a player of the original game, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (also available on Steam), I can say for definate that this game is a 100% improvement on it's original. If you want to experiance Abe's story, this is the way to do it.  Story - 10/10 Game design - 8/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 5/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Replayability - 3/10 (Mainly for achievments only)  Overall - 9.5/10  What are you waiting for!? Buy it now, it's awesome, fun and original, Just Add Water did a fantastic job, show 'em you are grateful and get your hands on a copy.  P.S. The DLC is awesome too.",

            "review_text": "New 'n' Tasety really captures the essence of Oddwold: Abe's Oddysee, but in 3D!  The gameplay is exactly the same 2d platformer, and everything is right where I expect to find it (even if it loks a bit different), but the areas aren't divided into small screens - each area is one continuous ...err... area. But what about these Sligs, you ask ? well, good question. As far as I can tell, as long as you cannot see them, they cannot hear you, and you cannot take possesion over them. (well, actually it's OK if you can just barely see them). One thing that I think was lost here is that Sligs can no longer run off screen when you chant before you take possession of them, which is a shame. (I did play the game on normal difficulty, so I may change that last bit after I finish hard difficulty).  Another new thing is difficulty levels. On normal difficulty you get 10 HP, so it's easier to escape Sligs that are sooting you in the back. I will certainly try out the hard difficulty soon.  There is one thing that I feel is a bit off, but I just cannot be sure - it feels like you have more freedome in Abe's position, and it feels like I sometimes die because my position was off a few pixels (opposed to Abe's old tile-based position). But again, it's just a feeling, so I may be wrong.  All in all this is a great game, and I recommend it to all Abe's Oddyssee fans and anyone who likes a good puzzle/action platformer.",

I'm overall impressed by how amazing this game looks, but there's a lot of lens flares and neon lights which just feels out of place. The game is nowhere as eerie as the original, but letting those things slide I think this is a truly masterful remake.",

It's the same as the original game , with better graphics , more muddokons to rescue and some little new things that you may or may not like , but i think it's ok .  At the very last part of the game , actually last chapter i suffer some stutter , and at alfs escape too , from 60 to 50 , while in other stages i can get over 100 fps (I5 4440 + GTX 760 2gb + 8gb ram @1866 OC'ed @2000)   Buy the base game + the free FAN MADE downgraded 720p Cutscenes for a 60fps experience (original cutscenes are rendered at console's fps....so you only get 30... even if you get 60fps in other games...talking about bink/bink2 videos ) . Do not buy alf's escape, its too short ,easy and it add's nothing to the game  ________________________________________________________________ UPDATE 13/01/16  After downloading the 'downgraded' movie pack , movies now play a sweet 60fps (instead of the original 30fps - if you get the original movies to even play at that framerate ) . So just after you download that re-pack movie , the game becomes a 60 constant fps game (with vsync on)   I will make a full review when i finish the game .  ________________________________________________________________ Previous review DONT GET THIS GAME . As a fan of this saga , this game is no (at the moment) a must have , movies (intro,cutscenes) will run at under the 30fps they are meant to be .

            "review_text": "FOR GAMERS WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED OLDER ODDWORLD GAMES:  This is unique and amazing experience. The world is so unique, full with twisted dark humor. Basically, this is puzzle platformer, but not your regular type - this is a game where you need to save your friends from slavery in the factory via unique Gamespeak system. That means you have couple of words that you can use to talk with your friends, and they listen and behave based on your input. Now for your usual RPG this is pretty standard stuff. But this is not RPG. I've not seen yet any platformer that incorporates this system beside Oddworld games.  Second thing that makes this game unusual is protagonists ability to posses enemies. This opens wide range of game play approaches, tactics, as well as some really awesome situations. Now, possessing enemy is really simple - just one simple press of the button. Situations for that? Well they are more complicated. And that's part of the charm. To figure when to do something and in what order - this is Oddworld. Also each enemy type behaves differently creating sort of unique ecosystem. For instance - one creature is territorial, one pact based. Based on their behaivor, you need to figure best approach to avoid them. Now, beside things above - this is the game that also requires quick reflexes. But the game is always fair and it trust that you will figure it out. In the sea of games that hold your hand, this old school approach is much appreciated.  Trust me, new gamers - try this one. It's really unique even by today's standards.  FOR GAMERS WHO HAVE PLAYED OLDER ODDWORLD GAMES:  I can't stress enough, how long have i waited for a new Oddworld game. After Stranger's Wraith we finally got new Oddworld game and it's remake of the first one - the one which started whole insanity in this marvelous world.  This is not a port, not a remastered version. This is fully rebuilded game from ground up of the Oddworld: Abe Oddysee. And it's glorious. While playing it i constantly had that stupid kid like grin. I was all over in 90's again. I remembered special hidden zones, some scene design and some really awesome moments.  I've been shot, eaten, cut, electrocuted, beaten, killed on various ways. And i wasn't angry at all. I missed that in Oddworld games. I loved it, loved the patience that it required. Loved the puzzles. Incorporating everything in one seamless image works amazingly well, graphic are nice and i've beaten whole game 4 times with a keyboard - didn't have problem at all. They really put their hearts into this, and you can tell. This is still same old Abe's Oddysee but visually upgraded for newer generations, and you know what - it doesn't need anything more (well except follow up in a way of Abe's Exoddus). This is the same game that i loved for 20 years almost.  DLC - ALF ESCAPE  Just short comment since this is really new thing in this Oddworld. It's awesome, great spin on well established gameplay. Insted of saving bajilion friends, in this DLC you need ti save only one. Easy? Weeell, not really. Various types od obstacles appear and you need to take care of yourself and Alf at the same time. I really wish there are more of this levels, since creativity is there - level design is awesome and Alf grows on you by the end of the mission. Loved this part.  Lorne Lanning - you did it again. Really hope for remake of Abe Exoddus. Wish you and your team all the best.  FUN FACT:  Cinematics for Oddworld: Abes Exoddus were soooo good back in the day that the team manage to re-cut them in short movie version and even managed it to submit it as Oscar candidate. (!) Thus making it first ever game video submitted for an Oscar nomination. That's how far ahead these guys were ahead of their time.",

I must say I didn't really think everything would be done pretty much identically but it is. Can't really complain since I loved the original.

            "review_text": "The original Oddworld games (and to a lesser extent, Stranger's Wrath) are amongst my all time favourites. Soulful, creative, imaginative experiences that in so many ways were way ahead of the curve. Even now we barely, if ever, see games with quite this degree of imagination, scope and heart. Oddworld meant something and it still means something. The original game still holds up perfectly save for one flaw: the limited resolution of the Playstation, which makes it difficult to go back and enjoy the richness that it once clearly possessed.   Abe's Oddyssey is a marvel in any context but after all these years, with 2D indie releases easily rivalling AAA output, Oddworld is like a beacon of great artistry and game design. So naturally, a technological upgrade is welcome, a means to keep an otherwise ageless game up to date. Enter New'N'Tasty, not simply an HD remaster but a whole re-make built from scratch, with sidescrolling and other advances bringing it quickly up to date. On the whole it largely succeeds in its ambition but there's a little something lost in the translation.  For the good, it's basically the original game with all new 3D graphics and fluid sidescrolling as opposed to the screen-by-screen swiping of the original. Which means certain sections, those demanding speed and reflexes, have been immensely improved and become all the more gracious. The array of colour and environments never fails to impress and the quality of puzzles, interactions and design remains as unique and inventive as it always was. A lot of the magic has really been recaptured and in places, for an old fan like me, is a joy to behold.  But it's not quite there for me. Odd(Hargh) little choices littered throughout the experience, an array of minor changes that on their own seem meaningless but together strip away some of the wonder and effortlessness of the original. For starters, it's a little too saturated. The grim, colossal monument to industry and the mundane that was Rupture Farms is now more of a nightmare factory. It's more cartoonish and the lesser for it. The game as a whole is a little less 'real', a phrase delicately applied to a world filled with gun wielding hand-slug monsters. There's a slight loss of grit in the areas of Rupture farms, an excess of colour that deprives it of some authenticity the original offered. The outdoor areas, Monzaic Lines, Scrabania and Paramonia fair far better and are as memorable now as they ever were. But Rupture Farms isn't quite right and surrounding areas, like the Stockyards, are too empty of the understated nature present in the original game. Some of the animation too lacks the weight the original brought to the table, Abe slipping and sliding, banging against objects and skirting away from gunfire. It's still there, somewhat but not quite as naturally.   All of which sounds like a big downer on what is a pretty excellent game really. But New'N'Tasty whilst perfectly appealing on its own, also give some attention to how effortless Oddworld Inhabitants made the original game look. What seemed so obvious at the time is now quite unexpected. Who knew there was so many tiny nuances to the game? So many seemingly insignificant details that I now see as vital.  For all the love, craft and success of this remake (and it really is, easily worth the money, honestly) a little something has been lost in the translation. The magic is not gone in New'N'Tasty but it is dimmed somewhat. In spite of being a great game, that can't help but make me a little sad.",

I'm quite amazed by the game and it shows the work put into it for such a small studio. The game delivers the story, mostly in at least equal quality. Some cinematics are even better, while others slightly worse story wise. Overall they average to around the same awesomeness. Graphics are nice, animations are good with very minor exceptions (for example, bumping your head on a corridor you were supposed to crouch isn't any satisfying.) and sounds are on a mixed scale, I didn't like some, I loved some, but I do agree that they needed more variation regardless.  There's some things I didn't and still don't like though:  -Controls can be a bit weird. (This might be due to being highly accustomed to the original. Having to change to the action button instead of up for using doors/vents wasn't easy to get used to.)  -Saying 'hello' a second time doesn't get a second mudokon to stand up, like it used in Abe's Exodus. You can either have one at a time or all of them. This makes some puzzles slightly longer than they would be possible to be done in Exodus, which was close to 2 decades ago.  -Scrabs look ferocious in the cinematics, but they kind of fall flat in the actual game.(compared to the nightmare that were the 2D sprites ones) Hoping for an improvement there in the sequel.  -Detection from enemies, especially sligs seems to be a lot more automated. Not a big deal, but it's harder to play with them, lure them, avoid shot up close, etc. It also makes me wonder how some rooms in the remake of Exodus will be done, because they relied exclusively on that aspect of the game. I have also up to this time have been completely unable to reproduce fooling Slogs by jumping at the same time with them.  Overall a must buy for every hard fan of the originals and not only them. This game's story, after all, has been one of my first interactions with the concepts of the true nature of capitalism and mindless consumption, without even getting the slightest of preachy about it.

Here are just a few things you can expect on your journey:     Traverse beautiful environments, from industrial dystopia to bizzare native temples &amp; landscapes   Possess enemies and use them to communicate, kill, scout, or just make them explode    Accidentally  run your new friend off a cliff, into a landmine, meat grinder, electric field or firing squad    Sing the native songs of your people, then have a fart    Free the slaves (or don't)   Brave the wildlife for some sweet ink, then turn into a crab-spider demi-god and shut down the corporations bruh   Ride on a...thing! or, How I Learned to Dislike Honey and Love the Bees   Meat sacks, falling rocks, grenades, secret areas, portals made of birds   Norb?   All while basically naked and wearing a goofy pony tail. If you've never played an Oddworld game, buy this game. If you've already played a game(s) in the series and are wondering whether you should buy this game, DO IT ya schlub.",

The game itself is, odd keyboard controls aside, nothing really to complain about, and nothing to write home about; the game is decent and exactly what you expect going in..  ..save for that it crashes violently, overrides default processor settings, and generally refuses to work.  I've installed and uninstalled the game twice now, and spent hours troubleshooting, and it continues to surprise me with new ways to crash. It's not a hardware issue. I've had three different kinds of errors and crashes now, ranging from the game overriding my processor settings to use the integrated chip (which obviously can't handle the game), to not communicating to the driver, to straight-up just instantly shutting my computer down. The one common thread has been that everytime it crashes, it crashes violently; my screen goes black, Windows completely shuts down and the computer literally stops functioning in any way until I force it down. I have to restart and boot-up from the safety screen everytime.  It seems like a decent game well worth your's and mine's time, but it simply isn't well polished enough. Give it a try if you like, seeing as this seems to be a rare issue, but be prepared for 'odd' crashing behavior.",

Can't count how many times I have died by walking into a pit only because of unresponsive jump button, or not having escaped fast enough because either the character wouldn't duck and roll or simply didn't turn around and run away.  The quicksaves help a bit since you can save just before a tight spot, though the loading is really clunky as you need to go to through menus every time, after first waiting for the character to spawn to checkpoint unless you were fast enough to pull out menu before dying.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Played the game using PS3 controller mapped as X360.",

There was also an annoying bug at the time that I played the game with the fast meat grinders, where they were so fast that there was about one frame of safety in which you could actually make the roll, which meant that you sometimes spent 5-10 minutes quicksaving and attempting each roll over and over.  It has one major quality of life upgrade which makes play a bit more enjoyable, which is the ability to have multiple Mudokans follow you at once (as you could do in Abe's Exoddus, but not in the original Abe's Oddysee). This was nice, but having just literally replayed the original Abe's Oddysee before playing New N Tasty, I don't really feel like this makes the new version an overall improvement.  I don't regret buying the game, but I don't think it lived up to the original.",

Desparately needs a patch of some sort, all the other characters can get killed but me, bullets are stuck on the screen, glitchy graphics even when run straight through the graphics card and on SSD.

Mac games in Steam are generally hit and miss with respect to quality and playability but this game is beyond any limits of acceptability.  If anything, games like this and Steam in general on a Mac will undoubtedly convert more Mac users back to Windows for respectable gaming.
