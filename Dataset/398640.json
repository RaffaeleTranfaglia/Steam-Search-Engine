            "review_text": "This game is a really great simulation of collge football. The only thing that currently holds it back is that the game was released right before the huge change over to all of the various spread option formations and philosophies that now exists in college football circa 2006. It is good that the developer is now beginning to provide updates to the game once again and hopefully this will be added in the near future.  That being said I have heard some in the community for this game say that a new game is needed. The engine for the game is actually quite good and truthfully if they would provide an update that would make this game more comparable to current day college football I think really that would be all that would be needed to bring excitment back to this game. The current price tag for the game at $14.99 is definitely worth the price but just that one update would in my opinion bring about not only more sales but excitment back to the game once again.",

You might get away with an arcade game that repeatedly messes with your progress, but for a text sim, it's a one-way ticket to being uninstalled.",

            "review_text": "First let me say I am huge fan of many 'text based' sims -- from OOTP series to FM Manager. This game doesn't have nearly the bells and whistles of a AAA title like OOTP or FM series but it compares favorably in many ways and in some ways falls quite a bit short.  The biggest annoyance by far is the frequent crashing and lack of hyperlink based navigation. The game seems to have a memory leak and will freeze every other season or so. This would be a huge deal if it had auto save feature and/or didn't require a entire system reboot in order to come back. Luckily I have learned to frequently save and the game does always load after a reboot -- haven't lost a single save yet (knock on wood).  The navigation is clunky at best and the game won't scale fullscreen as well. These are two huge 'quality of life' issues and I really hope with the increased scrutiny and money from Steam sales they fix this. I would love to be able to play this game in 1440p and to have hyperlinks for players, conferences, etc.   Those annoyances aside -- I pretty much lost last weekend to this game, it's that compelling. Following recruiting is as addictive as real life (can I can get that 5 star???) and quite realistic as well. If you don't spend the $$$, time and have a high enough prestige you'll often have to settle for 3 star prospects or offer few 4 stars at a few understocked positions while enticing them with immediate playing time, which the AI seems to do a good job recognizing from what I can tell; I offered a 5 star RB with only middling prestige and when I offered him playing time (I had zero good back on the roster after graduating my two seniors) he ended up committing.   But go after too many very hightly touted recruits as a middling school and you'll just end up with a handful of walk on levels players after everyone leaves you hanging.  That said, if you recruit 3 stars into your team that excel at areas you want to play them (say athlete QB on an option team) you can build a program -- more slowly, but you can.  I don't personally get too deep into the game plan besides occasionly stepping in on a big down and guiding the way, but from what I've read you can spend hours just setting up the weekly strategy. I don't prefer that level of micromanagent but if you do the option is there.  But as far as gameplay and replay value this game is just as addictive as the FM Series or OOTP. The simulation is usually solid (hey, these things are hard, you will occssionaly see the absurd like 7 fumbles in one game from one team) and the gameplay is solid all around from the simulation engine itself to the big picture stuff like choosing your coaches and gameplan and recruiting.  I recommend this game but it is with some hesitation as for some on smaller monitors (I have a 27' 1440p on my main gaming rig) the text is unreadable and the constant crashing is a pretty major annoyance as well.  But given that this game is only, $15, if you have a large monitor and enjoy sports sims, pick it up now you'll consider it money well spent.       ",

            "review_text": "Game is not very realistic or rewarding. When you recruit you dont feel like you are getting anywhere and seems random if they swing your way or not. The actual games feel predetermined as the previous poster suggested, you are not picking plays to set up other plays like other football simulators - there is no need to be strategic.   I gave 25 hours to this game so, I tried very hard to like it with the lack of any NCAA type games availble but, no dice.",
