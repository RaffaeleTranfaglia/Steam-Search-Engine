            "review_text": "Greetings fellow Steam user, let me tell you of this game.  It has everything a good little puzzle game needs, It's challenging but not too much, it's a pretty fair and you can activate Relaxed mode to take some of the challenge away from it, without Relaxed getting the maximum reward (Level unlock keys) per puzzle can be pretty damn hard, but then again it's not absolutely necessary to get every single key on every puzzle to unlock everything (Achievement unlocks excluded of course) you cannot unlock every achievement in the game with Relaxed mode activated at all times, for all you fellow HundoHunters out there.  The music is really nice and fits Alice in Wonderland perfectly, talking about Alice in Wonderland, this entire game is focused around that eh?  Well, the mosaic puzzle pictures are all related to it, if you are a fan of Alice in Wonderland this game is pretty good in that regard.   If you are like me, love Alice in Wonderland AND like puzzle games, this game is a must-buy for a mere 5â‚¬.   PS: Yes I am totally biased, but I did not get money for this review.",

It's a relaxing unriddle game, better use your short brake, not a long resting time.  8/10 Better if opens the workshop function.",
