That being said, it's a  gorgeous  game. Full hand-set pixel-art scenes. This is a $3 game with  full voice acting . There's even a secret ending!  Think of this as a music video or one of those 15-minute sci-fi movies that sometimes crop up from a crew of talented cinema students. It's not a big game, but it's a pretty game, and certainly an unique game.",

Murder is a beautifully crafted, visually stunning game with obvious care and attention to detail jumping out from the screen. This is an experience intended to be revisited and appreciated again and again. Atmospherically this game is second to none. Albeit a short experience (25 minutes for me personally) this is in no way a hindrance, considering the extremely low price. Murder delivers a thoughtful and stylised experience that will stay with the player and most definately will be the subject of reflection and discussion after playing.  Murder is most definately a testament to the idea that video games are an artform.   Highly reccomended by myself. An experience not to be missed out on.  EDIT: Trigger Warning - Friend of the Dev",

The engine and style, and the story, have a lot of potential, but this is way too short and lacking in choices for me to give a strong recommendation. I hope the story is continued in further chapters, though, as the game does have promise.",

The soundtrack and visuals where top notch. The voice acting was impressive to say the least. The overall vibe was on point for a future noir title. I'ld say give it a shot...but you may be dissapointed by the time the credits role. Not for quality's sake but for simple fact that a good thing ended too soon. Tip of the hat to the creator.",

The voice acting is solid overall but some of the police agents could have been better. People aren't wrong when they say you can run through this in about 30 minutes, but there's also a few side things you could miss if you just cruise through it. For example, in your apartment building there is a droid that has fallen into disrepair and if you talk to it you can learn a pretty fascinating backstory.   My biggest complaint would be how the game handles fullscreen. It doesn't render the pixel graphics to nearest neighbor, so in full screen it looks pretty blurred out. There's no reason not to pick this game up for the price but I strongly recommend playing in windowed mode.",

Unfortunatly this isn't enough to save the game. The story had some potential as a prologue to something bigger. I was rather shocked when the game ended ten minutes in. The sound effect of the robot in the corridor was awful, and the soundscape/music made some awful glitching noises in both my speakers and headphones.",

There are other games such as The Fall or SOMA that tackle the same issues but those games actually invest you in them enough to care. While it's hard to compare a $2.50 game with these, it's plain to see that this format of game just doesn't work in such a small installment.  I wouldn't really recommend it but it is only $2.50.",

But I was overly disappointed by the short length and lacking story.  The same ~6 different screens shown in the trailer is all there is in the entire game. You visit them twice by basically just walking from one to another.. you could finish the game in ~15 minutes if the character didn't walk so slow.  The story doesn't tell much.. while it's nice for it to be voiced there's so little to it and so vague... I have the feeling the game is simply incomplete. As if they had run out of funds and couldn't afford any more lines so they had to keep it short.  Even as cheap as it is, I cannot recomend it.",

The game is less than 15 minutes of 'gameplay' if you can call it that, and the story, well, isn't a story. There's no beginning, middle, or end -- it's a bunch of pixel art strung together with animation, click targets, and really bad voice acting.  Don't bother. Seriously.",

Not really, if there is a smart and valid point the game and the creator tries to get across. In 'Murder''s case, there is nothing, there is no deep twist, no message, no interresting topics, it's just a messy unfocused convolute.  It seems like the creator didn't understand the topics he wanted to talk about nor did he bother do go into any detail. The most obvious cyberpunk tropes are smashed into the script and are reduced to 1 - 2 sentences with implications lead ing to nowhere.  It tries so hard to be smart that it falls on it's face when it comes to basic character development and writing. Dialogues are very unnatural and cliche, the games scene changes have no natural pacing and it all ends with a forced 'Stanley Parable' twist in that feels completely out of place.  It's really a shame, because the audiovisual aesthetic feel absolutely wasted on 'Murder'.",
