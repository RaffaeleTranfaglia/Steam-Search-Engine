It says that it will not run on Windows Vista or Windows 7, but it's running fine for me on Windows 7 and I didn't have to do anything to make it work. I simply installed it and it worked. Now, to the game. I really enjoyed playing Railroad Tycoon 3, being my first Railroad Tycoon game on PC (after having played Railroad Tycoon 2 on the PlayStation 2) and in my opinion, it is a much better and simpler game to play than its predecessors",

            "review_text": "Note before review: This game works well on Windows 7, both 64 and 32 bit setup.  Railroad Tycoon 3 is one of my all time favourite games that I love to play. Managing your company to go against the competition, you work towards earning that extra $ to afford upgrades and much more. Buying the industries, you learn to add companies to use the resources. An example of this would be the logs --- add Lumber Mill, Furniture factory, Toy factory (it will tell you when wood is no longer accepted) and paper mill.   Lay a track down next to these and add a station to start your freight trains to the cities to build up their reputation. The higher the star, the greater the demand making your company increase in profit and helping the cities.   Add hotels, restaurants and pubs in the cities all help with your company getting the very best out of the game. Invest in other companies to eventually take over and add their lines to their your business. Start with single tracks, upgrade to double and then to electric...the game just keeps on going to eventually you become the main man or woman.  Overall I love this game, its the best! I recommend having the industry map for this to help you, any one who wish to have a copy of this map is more than welcome msg me for a copy! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED game to every one on Steam...just excellent!",

If you enjoy semi-simulation games? You'll enjoy Railroad Tycoon 3. Strategizing where to place your stations, what type of cargo to carry and where and the routes plus switching station locations? Makes a pretty damn fun game. ;)",

This ♥♥♥♥ing game wont work at all and there's no longer any ♥♥♥♥ing support what so ♥♥♥♥ing ever. Steam doesn't support it 2k doesn't support it and even ♥♥♥♥ing Poptop doesn't support it anymore even though it's one of the few games they have on steam and is the highest rated but nope they've given the middle finger to us and said ♥♥♥♥ off. If you can get it to run it's a good tycoon game. One from before all the tycoon games comming out became ♥♥♥♥. So if you get it working great game if you can't you'll just feel like you got scammed. Steam needs to ether put a warning on this ♥♥♥♥ing game., delete it out right or ♥♥♥♥ing fix it.",

After so long, nothing has quite managed to top it, and nothing has quite managed to produce the same depth and detail while not skimping on the railway-centric aspects.  It's atmospheric, fairly pretty but most of all provides complex gameplay with a certain amount of depth. It really is astounding that nothing has managed to hit this balance so nicely since then, and it makes the fact I have to turn here rather infuriating.   Great selection of locomotives - albeit not the most detailed - and a great selection of activities available; not to mention a fine amount of scenario tools to help get the most from the game's vast scope. I thought this looked astounding when it was first released, and while it's definitely not aged seamlessly, it still holds up well enough to make for a very pleasant experience.   RRT3 is a masterpiece, but by God, I wish somebody would come by and do it better already. For the price you simply cannot and will not go wrong.   Incidentally, it works fine on Windows 7, too.",
