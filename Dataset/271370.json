            "review_text": "I've been looking for this game for years. I played it about 10 years ago when JoWood first released it. It also came with an editor in which you could build a multitude of different 'unique' buildings requiring different materials. However this isn't included with the Steam Version.   The Campaign missions for the US and Europe are the same as the original game. I haven't played the Australian missions before this release, so that's all new to me, however i know they were also released as an add-on a couple of years after the original game came out (I bought the add-ons but my crappy computer at the time wouldn't even recognise the discs).  Pros for the game is it's diversity of starting points. If you start in 1850, it's with horse and cart, simple ships, and a 'horse train' options. As you start in later years, more updated modes of transportation become available. Road quality is just a gravel road in the 1850's, but can improve to Autobahn standard later in the game. An endless number of maps can be created depending on what type of game you want to play, from a mountainous continent to a small island archipeligo and everything in between.   I love the view of the game. There are plenty of in-game options eg if trees confuse the view, or the names listed are in the way, then you can simply remove from your view by clicking on the appropriate button on the bottom of the screen. Discrete but effective. I always remove the trees, they dont really serve a purpose in the game except to clutter the screen. The mini-map is movable or can be removed from view is you require. I personally leave it in the upper right corner as it becomes a quick guide to locations.  The only part of the game that bugs me is the train connection system. If you start a line, then future additional railway lines additions MUST come from the lines already placed. There is no other way to create a new railway line. If you want to create a line on an separate part of the map, then it must join with an existing line before it can be built. Many a time I have wanted to create a railway line far away form my original line, but have had to use other forms of transport, or spend a lot of money on getting a virually useless line to my new setup.  I haven't had any screen issues as what may potentially happen as per the game page. The game seems to run as it did many years ago. ",
