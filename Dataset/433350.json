            "review_text": "This game used to be such a fantastic shooter back when Outspark was creating this. Sadly, it has turned into quite the horrible game. Lag dominates who wins and loses a fight.  This game started in about 2010, or 2013... i can't fully remember... and back then it used to not be filled with such horrible pay to win and lag issues. The game used to be greatly balanced and had no issues what so ever... but today, the game has been made into a joke.  I would shoot people directly in the chest and see nothing happen. So I shot at a wall to see if maybe it had counter strike like aiming, but it didn't. This game was a point and click adventure that failed to understand the click. The intro to the game was also horrible, making you constantly click through things you should've known by now by playing any basic f2p fps game. Telling you 'go to this menu.' 'click this to make a character' and forcing you to wait the 10 seconds it took to get through the message, and then half hour it took to even get the button to function.  In other words... please... do this game justice and don't download it... If you want to see how this game was before, look to see when Outspark owned the rights to this game.  Nobody has been able to match what Outspark has started with this once beautiful game.",

It sucks because everyone is super paranoid of everyone cause theres so many hackers. Like most of them don't aimbot cause it's way too obvious even tho some still do, but what most of them have are wallhacks. They will know exactly where u are in the map at all time, they start shooting around a corner even tho you're walking and not making any sound. Don't get me wrong there is some legit good players like in every game but like i said the amount of hackers is unreal and it creates this ♥♥♥♥ed up atmosphere where if you're slighty good at this and don't cheat, you will probably be tagged a hacker and get votekicked.

            "review_text": "It's ok I guess. Not like you HAVE to spend money to get kills. Just grab and 'AWP' or any other sniper and don't miss. Sniping is probably more fun than using 'regular' guns anyway. I've played a LOT of 'pay 2 win' games my most played being 'Blockade 3D' and this really isn't anywhere near that. Sure you can buy guns but you cant keep them unless you wanna pay over and over. Like I said before just get a sniper and you're good to go. Most players are using snipers anyway so im surprised it isn't called 'AWP simulator'. I personally think this game is ok. Not the best game I've ever played, but much better than lots of other games out there I've played. It's very much like CS:GO in a lot of ways. In fact that's the first game I thought of when I first switched guns. One thing I don't really like is that some maps (I've only played 2 so far) are very much one sided, meaning if you spawned on the other side you'll be sniped very easy since one side is perfect for 'head glitching' which I ended up going like 35-5 or something like that. You'll know what im talking about when you play it. Not sure about 'matchmaking' or balance issues since I have very little time played but it all really depends on what you're willing to go through in order to become 'good' at the game. It's a bit frustrating but it can have it's moments. With all that being said I'd give this game a good 6/10. *Waits for angry replies*",

Wish you luck with keeping this game alive as long as you can.  If the game is making you angry then just take a break instead telling people that this game is P2W, rly!?  Got angry&gt;Take a break&gt;Play again and git gud. (You will learn how to play, just be patient and don't be a ragy flaming kid and don't accuse players of hacking/bugusing when they are just better than you, instead you could just tell them on all chat that they are good)  PS: You will know when someone is hacking/bugusing. It's the only one thing I hate in games and I can understand when people are raging because of them cause they are destroying the fun of playing a game.
