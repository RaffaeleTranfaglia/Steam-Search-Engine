Big E’s “special weapon”, especially. That was… Yeah), so if you feel triggered/angered by racial slurs, tons of rude words, “stereotypical” characters, violence… This game isn’t for you. It will ♥♥♥♥ you off.  BUT if you don’t mind and feel like reading something weird, go for it. Although, I recommend getting this game on a good sale; it’s not so short, but it’s quite expensive for a kinetic VN. Not worth paying the full price, in my opinion.  The art style is cute, BG and BGM were good. The VA was okay, I just found that men voices were a bit too low than the female voices. Intro and ending songs were also good.  5/10. The story had potential, but I think they focused more on the crazy dialogues than the story itself.   And by the way, here is my favorite dialogue:   Big E: What a boring bunch. Don’t they have any balls? Lackey 2: They died, so no, they have no balls.   lol",
