            "review_text": "After completing both paths and 100% the game I def recommend it. Yes it is a walking sim that requires you to not only walk but experience at beautiful atmosphere. Both paths are unique and provide you with a interesting journey to find this Genie.   I recommend the game to walking simulator and 100%ers lovers especially.  Gameplay  You have the option to take either path Red (left side) or Blue (right side) The red path had the best storyline in my opinion BUT the blue path had the most beautiful landscapes (screenshot lovers prepare yourselves f12) As you begin walking your journey and story begins. The story is narrated and you can have the option to have the text displayed (settings) like me. I enjoyed reading beside the narrator.   As you are walking you are also exploring and in some rare cases interacting with the surroundings. You are also challenged in the journey with some jumping areas which are honestly easy.  Storyline  The game is about a chosen girl that begins a journey through you.. Your village is in trouble.. and it is up to you to walk and find this Genie.. Your journey takes you far and the path you take will affect the ending.  The game talks about some life experiences which I enjoyed the most.   The music compliments the narration but at times I feel it overpowers her voice.  At times you find yourself so emerged in the scenery, the sounds of the rain and beautiful landscape you tone out everything else. I for one find it relaxing hearing the rain and looking at streams.   Final thoughts?  If you want a first experience on a walking sim this is a good start. Final note I was given a key for a honest review without any commitments either then the review of my experience. Thank you for the chance to play a beautiful game. Definitely would recommend the game in its current state. No bugs or issues when I played it.",

The scenery, the music, and the sound of the rain and thunder...just beautiful. :)  I would like to feel more in control of walking speed as most often feel like I am jogging while I would rather be strolling. :) I have to keep stopping to take in the views. LOL  I might be half way through now and although I did get lost a time or two (not that it matters lol), and the couple little tricky parts I figured out (that was fun). So far so great. :) ",

            "review_text": "Drizzlepath: Genie is a fun and relaxing 'walking simulator' with a rich storyline and really amazing voiceover. Don't walk the Drizzlepath looking for challenging opponents or difficult puzzles. You won't find any of that here; in fact, there's only a couple of actual interactions with the environment in the whole game!  What you  will  find are incredible vistas, intriguing landscapes, and bunches of weird little 'easter eggs' hidden here and there, all accompanied by lovely and literate poetry revealing the inner thoughts and memories of the game's main character, Lula, a village girl tasked with finding a mysterious 'genie.' There are two pathways to explore, each with its own ending, but venturing off of the path will yield some surprising and even seemingly incongruous finds: hidden objects, and even people! It's a virtual sightseeing tour, through the eyes of a young poet.  If you're in a hurry to get somewhere or to find answers, you may find the lengthy journey (five hours or so, if you walk the path at top speed and don't stop to smell the roses) a bit tedious. If, on the other hand, you like to see beautifully-rendered scenery and explore unusual and imaginative terrain at a relaxed pace--without anything jumping out to kill you--then Drizzlepath: Genie might just suit you.",
