            "review_text": "Well, after long years of being a huge fan of this game, I finally finished it (I had an original Russian actual version released by Buka company).  My feelings are mixed. I'd like to point out some pros and cons for the game, and you guys will judge for yourself.  I solemnly swear to keep it spoiler-free for those who still hasn't finished it.  Pros: * A pseudo open world to explore. Due to some scripted restrictions you cannot simly go to, say, Vaterland from Krai. But it doens't mean that actual exploration is not fun and to some extent rewarding. * A variety of trucks to choose from with a great deal of customization. I love all of them, except for maybe Belaz since I didin't touch it at all. * A wide variety of weapons to satisfy anyone's taste, from machine guns to plasma cannons. * Lovely soundtrack and visuals. A bit outdated, but the game is almost a decade old! Explosions and energy particles tho. * The narrative in terms of lore. Just read the in-game books.  Cons: * Extremely poor narrative. Both from the point of telling a story and the story itself. I dunno, maybe it's just those Masks that make every character to look the same way? Or voice acting? Or the final which is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT? * A dumb AI. More in a matter of path-finding than fighting. Extremely stupid! Sometimes a bunch of trucks cannot make it through a hill because instead of driving around they try to come over it. * Not really much stuff to do aside from some interesting side quests now and then. * The final boss battle. A huge disappointment also. No spoilers! * Dialogue is just a stub. I understand that in such a mission there need to be less talk and more action but damn! I felt sorry for coming to Ben's place and leaving the same instance without even saying good bye. No love for the old guy. * Restrictions on where to go and what to do. Try to cross that river in Vaterland. Just go and do it. * Some things are just unnecessary. For example, some inter-regional shortcuts. I never used them and have a feeling that never will. Sad but true.  CONLUSION: This game has it's flaws, and narrative leaves a nasty touch on my tongue. But I still love this game. For the sense of freedom that it managed to give to me despite all those restrictions to go where I want. For the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic road to nowhere. You just go where the wind blows. I just wish I could dive into this world a bit more, leaving all that main storyline somewhere on the side. Actually, a sandbox open-world RPG in HTA setting would be much appreciated and would become a must-have in my collection. Maybe with some neat multiplayer like it was, say, in Freelancer? I don't know, and probably will never know.  Anyway, that's my review. Still love this game and recommend it to everyone interested. Give this game a try.",

Customize your car, fight against road bandits, scavenge goods to sell it in the town shops - everything for the real Road Warrior!  As the old game, it's pretty hardcore (but not really hard)- no chackpoints, health regen, fast trevel, or other casual (poser) stuff! Damaged in battle - repeir for money, died - load game. But you can save in evevery game moment, even in the middle of a fight! Fun gemeplay and It also has a pretty good story. The second one ('rise of clans') is good too - it's pretty mutch the same, but with some improvements (more cars, customizations, and so).  I recommend both of these games - it's worth money!",

            "review_text": "A decent game with some flaws. This is one-of-a-kind game, you drive a truck, fight other trucks, collect and trade gear, go on missions, talk with people in cities, buy new gear and trucks in said cities, visit several lands, all the while trying to discover who killed your father. It sports one of the best soundtracks ever, which adds to the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Combat is against other trucks, generally you'll have three adversaries which spawn and try to chase you.  Pathfinding is ridiculous. Merchants carry goods from city to city, but mostly try to climb up trees or manouver in circles. Baddies are a little bit more intelligent, they'll follow you but they never reach full speed, so it's very easy to just outrun them. There are also some scripted ambushes and boss battles. The plot is nothing new, but it gives a thread to follow, and opens new areas to explore. Trading goods generates good money - and you'll need it to buy more powerful trucks - but the best way to strike it rich is through combat and gathering of the remains of your enemies.  The game lacks polish, the translation is approximative and it has its lot of annoying bugs, but it can be quite rewarding when you buy a new truck, new gun or discover a new area to explore. Even the plot becomes interesting after a while.  Give it a try, it's worth your time.",

            "review_text": "Fallout: Trucker! Ok so, You're a truck, with a big ♥♥♥ gun mounted on the cab. You blow stuff up, sell the bits to buy bigger guns, better parts, and badder trucks while going on kill this or go there quests with some flavor variation.  The gameplay while seemingly simple at first is very solid and feels good.   There is a heavy focus on vehical customization, and you can be a bandit hunter or a merchant type player (haul'n cargo, buying low and selling high) and still advance.   The world is (so far) visually simplistic, sporting graphics that would look at home on a late life PS2 game, however the world itself is filled with various factions and different events that change wildly based on the choices you make, like who you ally and who you decide to blow up.   The dialogue is a bit cheesy and the voice actors are just bad enough to get by without being ear grating, But the music is surprisingly good and fits the situations nicely when it plays on time (mostly in battle or in cutscenes).  I am having fun with this game, definately got my monie's worth already and I plan to put a few more hours into it at least.  Final Word: Upgrading your ghetto ♥♥♥ farm truck held together with duct tape into a Bad ♥♥♥ DOOMBUS of Badassery is the big draw here, though you'll find yourself wishing the game had an 'autorun'/cruse control button before you get some of the faster vehicals.  OH! Don't forget to save! I lost a bit of progress when i minimized the game and it froze up. No auto save function aparently.",

My playtime doesn't show because I had to get a patched .exe (and a program to extract some compressed game assets) to get this to run without crashing. This game is a Russian open world car combat RPG from 2005. It is EXACTLY what you are expecting from this game, including the difficuly in getting it to run properly. It feels like it was made by robots. Dialog is stilted and very awkward, there are typos everywhere, missions are simple, the story is absolutely insane. The gameplay is fine, but the main draw of this game is Russian weirdness. A large chunk of it is driving from point A to B. If you're even looking at this page, you know what you're getting into, and it's a wonderful janktastic world waiting for you.",

Ive tried 2 or 3 of the advices that steam forum support give and they work once and then it keeps persisiting to crash. Then steam suggested contacting the developers, so you go to the website which is in russian but does bring up an option to translate. But its still difficult to navigate, so you try searching for the game and then it reverts backs to russian and your stranded. (unless russian) if anyone has any other ideas of how to stop it or the developers update and fix all the bugs then i will highly recommend this game because what i have played is really good. Until then i suggest waiting until they sort it out.  QUICK UPDATE! Ok so i deleted the game and then reinstalled and it loaded my saved games perfectly! fingers crossed i dont have to keep doing this everytime i want to play. I still stand by maybe waiting just incase deleting and reinstalling isnt a perminent solution.",

Then they proceeded to vaguely explain the story but putting emphasis on that everyone wears magic masks that save them from the bad atmosphere, when it is just a rationalization for not bothering to properly animate speaking or give any kind of quality to face construction or color. But all that aside I gave up playing because the voice acting was so flat and terrible, every line is said with such a unique 'Why am I saying this' quality. Its as if the voice actors were just paid to say the lines and not to act... If the graphics were 10 more years advanced and the voice acting up to subpar levels, I could recommend the game for its mechanics and playability, but then they would have to also work on the UI which is vague again and without explanations or tool tips to assist you (despite the game asking if you want tool tips on, all they give you is a screen where they explain everything in nausiating detail while throwing all the information at you at once the giving no information when you are actually at the choices you have to make)   tl;dr bad graphics, bad voice, bad ui, ok gamelpay. 1/4",
