            "review_text": "Holy shitballs where do i start. This game is HUGE, by that I mean in depth. Yet it still manages to deliver a huge open world.  You are able to trade, Mine, Bounty hunt, Take missions, Retrofit your ships, Hire mercenaries, Captains, Crew, Train crew.  There is an entire fleet system mechanics, Formations a loot system and there is what seems to be a very indepth Drone system that I haven't even touched yet... I'm addicted and haven't even scratched the surface at how much depth this game has. For example there is a very fleshed out character progression system in game where experience points can be converted to skills, the system is incredibly similar to how fallout 3 handles this, with each interest having a skill point from 0-100 and then perks for each captain in individual ships of your fleet.   It's a fully 3D game with Homeworld esque style controls, However it's more centered on individual ships and the mechanics therein.   So far, I'm intrigued by the story.  It's got beautiful fleet combat, epic brawls and the combat is very stylised. Some might find it very difficult, So tactics is everything.  Only downsides thus far is dated graphics which can improve and the need for more optimisations to allow a lag free environment with lots and lots of individual ships. I might also nitpick about the voice acting which is painful sometimes, But it can improve - Augment.  ",

            "review_text": "I haven't played this too much, but from what I have played and played around with...  It's Awesome! It starts off slow because there is a learing curve involved with playing this game. Any hardcore players will love this, while casual gamers will probably have difficulty paying attention for 2 seconds. Afterwards, it gets easy because you get a feel on how to navigate through open space (watch out for those radiation clouds - yikes). There are loads of missions for you to do, ships to hire, missions to accept, items to be bought and sold, commanders to be trained and equipped for each ship where each ship has its strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot of content in a seemingly easy enough concept of a game. I absolutely recommend this game.   There are a few problems that aren't really game-breakers, but would greatly improve the game if implemented.   1.) While thrusting through space at max speed, I find going up and down difficult (even though there isn't a up and down in space). Which means it's easy enough to travel left to right, but if I want to get a better strategic position behind a asteroid or to flank an enemy from below, it's quite difficult. I know that you have to hold shift while commanding your ships to travel, but it seems rather strange to me. For me, it would be much simpler and enjoyable to just point and go. Meaning wherever I point in a place in space, I go directly there.   2.) I only played for a bit, and maybe I missed it but I find maneuvering in space combat a hassel. It probably doesn't matter because all of the pirates have homing missles and lasers to shoot you with dead accuracy. But when I was in a firefight with the enemy, I couldn't move and fire my weapons at the same time. It would be nice to be able to fire weapons while going to different position at the same time. If there is a way to do this, or if it has already been done, that would make battles very intense and awesome.   3.) When I first started playing this game, I went straight towards the tutorial. Call me a noob, but I actually want to know how to play the game. Now, I don't have the worst eye sight in the world, but much of the HUD, or symbols and text on the screen was very - VERY small. I found that I would go full asian and squint like I'm staring directly at the sun just to see the text and symbols. If there is a way, or if it's already been implemented, it would be excellent to have resisable text and symbols in the game. Or at the very least, re-write the code to make the display size for the text and symbols at least 4 times larger. This is especially important when staring at hundreds of items in your inventory and you have to grab a magnifying glass to look at your computer screen! Bigger the text, the better!   4.) Maybe I'm a sucker for sound, but I like music in game. Maybe you can come up with some unique songs in a DLC and import them into the game. I have no beef with the tracks that play over and over again, but there needs to be some variety, at least in my stupid opinion.   5.) Lastly, this is a little bug in the tutorial. When I started firing my rockets at the dummy targets, I accidentaly blew a gaping hole in my A.I.'s ship. Because the crew didn't feel like dying that day, they moved from where they were, to inside of the particle cloud. Now, the particle clouds make it so that no one can see them or track them. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for one of the tutorials being how to trade. I couldn't get the ship back into visibility and thus, couldn't do the trading tutorial. This is because to do the tutorial, you need that ship to be available - which it wasn't.   Overall Awesome Game! I can see this getting a lot of attention and fame. I totally dig it, and it was worth the money I spent.   '10/10' - Would hug the producer.",

            "review_text": "The good:  - System Designs are well thought out, robust, and add depth to the game. - Concept is great: Squad/Small Fleet in space (been waiting for something like this for awhile).  The bad: - The art style falls into that awkward category of games that look old but don't pull it off in some charming way. - Character portraits look like they were made in EVE Online in 2003. - It's difficult to get into without going through the tutorial which is bland and more or less like reading a manual.  The ugly: - Precise navigation feels impossible. I can only guess I'm doing something wrong, whether in map mode or in 3d space, I can't seem to get my ships to arrive at the right x,y,z coordinates without major headaches. - Interaction with objects is difficult as well. Non-ship interactible objects seem to be the worst offenders.  - NPC Ships can (and will) follow you across the map. While I don't generally mind that idea, it only leads to frustration. One time I was trying to read quest text, and a bunch of little drones were swarming me, so I bolted away, then started reading the text again. They followed and blew me up. Several hours lost since my previous auto save. Another time I had traveled to the main space station. I was docked with it, changing loadouts when I was attacked and destroyed by... Well I have no idea what it was, but it wasn't fun.  Final thoughts: - I'd be more excited about the game if it were early access so the 'ugly' issues could get addressed, I don't feel this game reached the quality level that you would expect for an actually released title. (indy or not) - If you can get over the old-style art and initial learning curve, there could be dozens of hours of fun. - If the game were $10 I'd probably give it a thumbs up, but only for those who are system design nerds and/or are into sci-fi ship management.",

Best way I can describe Cres is the remnants of an epic space adventure, burried under a mountain of poor voice acting, bugs, more bugs, clunky UI, and a littany of issues that get in the way of being able to become immerced and enjoying the game. Its a shame.",
