            "review_text": "I bought this game a long time ago, when I was still a new member of Steam, and I played it for about five minutes! It was a great game and it seemed like it would offer plenty of fun for the money but there were other things in the way of long playing sessions - like life! - and I started playing Skyrim. Needless to say Skyrim kept me busy and Arcania fell by the wayside, waiting in the wings for me to take it up once again. Tonight I did just that - by the lambent light of my keyboard I loaded the game and set the options, no problems incountered - my Asus ROG 74X machine has 12Gb of DDR3 ram, with the Nvidia 560M graphics card that has 3Gb of ram onboard, and to top it off the machine has the Intel I7 dual core 2.0 Ghz chipset. The game runs great, no chatter or ghosting or other problems as I killed a pack of wolves and took up my life with a sheep no one else wants and I can't kill - I tried with sword and bow but nothing works. Thus far the game has my attention and I doubt I'll finish it in less than 100 hours as I tend to look under every rock and behind every bush for loot and potions. I love playing a game and squeezing every drop of programmer minutae from it, my money bought the game and therefore I feel justified in taking as long to play as I like. No need to rush, I do that in real life and frankly, I'm sick of doing it at all. Gameplay is solid, a bit easy even on 'normal' but the upper modes of play are more challenging and there's enough of them to satisfy just about anyone playing the title. My knight is awesome looking, his armor appearing solid and strong, the weapon in his hand, a flaming sword, looks very dangerous and the shield looks as if it could hold back a dragon! No complaints on the gameplay or graphics. HOWEVER - there is no help file on how to play the game or what keys do what! For instance, I cannot level up despite the fact the message has appeared twice already to do so. How does one level up? I'll keep playing, but I'm getting better in battle and can't benefit from the improvements or points earned to upgrade with. ]Saving is a snap and the game loads quickly and smoothly. Some people have had problems with WIN8, which I have installed on my laptop but I don't share their problems with the game, which is not to say they aren't having any, just that I'm not. Game is easily worth the money dropped on it and I have no regrets on the purchase or playtime invested. Another Steam hit, and one more reason to stay faithful to the best gaming site ever!",

            "review_text": "Picks up at the end of Arcania, so if you have your save file you can carry it all across. It is a very painless transition and unlike games, such as Mass Effect, every item in your inventory are carried over.  However, this is more likely because of the Expansion-like feel of this game. Overall it is an anti climax to the prior game. There are fewer encounters, those that exist get pretty tired. The Boss battle at the end is almost identical to the boss in ArcaniA.  If you have to get the game to complete the saga, I guess do it. However, there are only a few new enemies, no new powers and you will feel that the expansion really only rounds out the story.  If you were picking this up as a standalone, I don't think you will get the relationships between the characters and thus the story will just feel like a shallow chase to kill a demon that is cursing a kingdom. The greater conflict is lost and the chance to make something epic of that showdown is lost even without the prior story knowledge.",

            "review_text": "This is a fairly disappointing expansion to a fairly disappointing game. The only good thing I have to say is that it lets the player use a save file from the original game, so all the ♥♥♥♥ I did and leveled up wasn't just a waste of time. Unfortunately, like Gothic 3's expansion, this takes place outside of the main story, which is depressing, especially considering how well Gothic 2 nailed it.  The very linear add-on takes place in a massive, unexplored chunk of the map from the main game. It just seems like a tease, to have it there in the first place, with this expansion being the only way to get to it. However, this significantly smaller area doesn't give me the stuttering problems I had in the original game, leading me to believe that the engine is just set up to render most of the playable world simultaneously.  As I mentioned earlier, the player can import a leveled character, but this snaps the already fragile difficulty in half, because by this point most of the skills are probably maxed out. I kept pausing the game to check whether I was really still playing on the hardest difficulty because this was such a cakewalk, and on top of all that, there is much better equipment to be had here as well, making it even easier. I don't think I died even once.  Finally, it's too short. I beat the thing in less than 3 and a half hours, and I did every single quest... not that the expansion has a lot of quests to begin with, but that just goes to show how utterly lacking in content this $15 is. Thank God I got it on sale, at least.",
