This game allows you to go to multiple rooms and for once, you don't have to watch the robots. You actually get to interact with them! You get to fix Funtime Freddy, pass Ballora though the Ballora Gallery, and pass though the Funtime autitorium! So that's why i give this game a 10/10. Keep up the great work, Scott! (I maybe made some spelling mistakes, but i don't care)",

            "review_text": "Five Nights at Freddy`s: Sister Location is one of the best besides the first.   Instead of just the same gameplay mechanics as last 3, Sister Location dose something new, while keeping the classic Five Nights at Freddy`s feel. Nights no longer run on a timer, and each night has you doing a task, once you complete the task, the night ends. The game is frightening, not just the jumpscares, but the atmosphere, sounds, and of cource, what these animatronics have in-store for you...   I highly do recommend this game, even if you are not a fan of the series!    EDIT: My only faults I have with this game, is how short it is. I know, It`s a FNaF game, but the nights should have at least some more task to do, especially Night 4 instead of winding up Springlocks for 3 minutes.",

            "review_text": "what most is impressive about this game is that it includes every element that the past fnafs had and some that did not, the game even being shorter than the other 4 has its own science and let me explain you why it is such a big concept for the game.  starting with the elements that were included in the last games:  the intersting part is that the game is including all past game mechanics in difrent parts of it:  the first aspect is on night 2 where you have to sneak up on the ballora gallery to pass to the other side, the aspect in this part is listening, most likely from FNAF 4, you have to hear if its safe to advance due to hearing how close and loud her sound is, similar to fnaf 4 again.  next is the breaker room, in this place the challenge is to restart the power on all rooms in the map and at the same time control fun time freddy not to murder you by USING sound, not listening, this part is similar to FNAF 3`s mechanic of maintaning the facility and distracting springtrap with sounds but in a much easier way, it also includes a little reference of the camera function on the first 2 games, witch is nice.  next is on night 3 on the funtime auditorium you again have to pass trough the room with a flash beacon and pass to the next room, with that you need to use your flashlight to make foxy go away, very similar to the FNAF 2`s mechanic of keeping (not so coincidentaly) foxy away with your flashlight, but now you have no other light sources and you have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what you are doing.  next part witch is probably my favourite is the mantenance room beacause it gets most of players, it first tells you to press an amount of buttons on freddy`s face to open it (sounds really weird) and when less expected a jumpscare comes out when freddy`s face opens rapidly, it uses FNAF 3`s way of jumpscaring the player without killing them, after you have to open his chest witch leads to another weaker jumpscare, you then remove some type of power template (im not sure) to deactivate him, it then tells you to do the same on the bonnie hand puppet but when you look to the left, its gone, this is my favourite moment beacause it always get people off guard and lead them in confusion and panic as they desesperatly search for bonnie, to catch him you have to point your flash to a corner of the screen and slowly raise it to the opposite side and WAIT for bonnie to slowly move up and catch him, this type of mechanic does not look familiar to any of the 4 games but if you think about it it is the FUN WITH PLUSHTRAP mechanic of waiting for your target to then catch it on the spot!  and then night 4 where you have to defend yourself against the minireenas and unluck the spring locks to escape the suit but you also have to check both sides and keep the minirinas (those freaks) away by wiggling when they are crawling on the left or right side, sounds familiar? if it doesnt, know that this is the FNAF 1 AND 2`s mechanic of checking and clearing two sides at the same time as you take care of important chores for your survival.  those are the only recognised game mechanics so far, now onto the aspects that were NOT present in the past games and were included in this one:  first is the humor, that is a great plus that has been lacking in the previous games and actually got a lot of people including me with ironic sitituations  another important thing that was included in this game is not having any time objective (with exeption of night 4), you can stay on the same spot forever that either you will die or nothing will happen, that way the player doesnt need to have a stress about the time left beacause they dont know when the shift will end.  next and probably the most important aspect is PATIENCE. Something that was needed for a game like fnaf. In the past 4 games, it could be noted that the played is being overwhelmed beacause they had to do things as fast as possible, if you try to rush on this game, you`ll die.  onto the downsides:  -game is too short and should be charged for a smaller amount of money -the popcorn stuff between nights is not just badly animated but weird and desnecessary too. -again the game is too short, maybe there could be a 6th night or somehow a chapter selection so you dont need to restart the whole game just to play that one part you wanted to.  -please make achievments for this and other fna games, they feel much more rewarding.",

However, this game added that you basically have to do tasks to survive AND you also have to move around a lot more than you could in FNaF 4. Also, Scott managed to sprinkle in a cutscene, voice acting, and comedy. All in all, this game is one I would definitely reccomend.",

            "review_text": "So, I decided to delete my last review and make a new one. Here's my new opinion on the game:  Five Nights at Freddy's:Sister Location is the sixth installment in the series and it's very different compared to the last original four games. The voice acting in this game is amazing and the gameplay is fun 'for the most part'. However though, I can't really recommend this to someone who isn't a fan of the series or someone who is new to the series. If you've been following the games for quite sometime, I can recommend this to you but if you're new to the series, just play the first four and then play this game.   Now, here's what I like about the game: It's different from the others and it's fresh while keeping the FNaF feel that many have come to love. The voice acting is good, the lore is great and the gameplay is fun. The sounds are amazing and creepy, seriously I actually got creeped out playing this game.   Now, here's what I don't like about the game: Some nights can be very annoying and I don't mean that as it's hard or anything, it's annoying sometimes. Like on Night 2 for example:You have to reboot the system or whatever while keeping Funtime Freddy at bay, it was not fun or scary, it was just annoying and this is coming from someone who loves the games to death.  Overall, I'll give this game a 9/10.   ",

            "review_text": "This game took a HUGE jump from FNAF 4 by adding in Diverce Nights, Voice Acting, Semi Free Roam, and more of a story then the other games. But one issue for me is its not that difficult. If you know what to do you can 100% this game in under an hour. And with there not being extra nights or a custom mode I dont find much replayability to it. However this is a really good game, and its worth the money.",

All in all, if it's any of the five games you play, let it be this one.",

The only real way i would suggest it is if youre a fan of the series and want to play them all...otherwise it just is a bit of a waste of money. There were a few good moments of fright but most of it seems tedious. You either get told exactly what to do or aren't told at all. My biggest problem is i saw all of this cool things and cool animatronics and then the game seems short, as a joke and just not that fun.",

The voice acting is the one I really liked the most about this game! Hearing the animatronics speak creates tension and more story in the game. But, there is only ONE thing I don't like about this game and it's pretty minor. The game is kinda too short. The other FNAF games were long because of the extra nights and the 20 mode. But, I don't have that problem with the game. So far, I give this game a 9.5/10. This becomes my second favorite FNAF game behind FNAF 4.",

It still keeps the simple yet suttle gameplay and even though I haven't completed all 5 nights (it's hard) I had to write a review on it sometime. I still say this is an amazing farewell (At least I hope) for the franchise.   Allthough it is a lot harder than the rest of the game, I still reccomend. Even if you have a distate for the Five nights at Freddy's franchise it is worth a look. It creates vibes of other video games like portal or the stanley parable still locking in at the taste of horror and suspense. Although the jumpscares are not as shocking as the other installments... the creepy eerie atmosphere more than makes up for the less scary jumpscares.  The voice acting is brilliant and brings that spark to the game which makes it all the better.   The animatronic designs, although not as threatening as the nightmare designs.. they feel much darker in the terms of their faces opening up.   The humor is fantastic and simple. There's just enough humor to give it that lovable go-lucky side and not too much to turn it away from the horror genre.   The tense moments of the game really give you that frightened feeling. However as fantastic and mind blowing as the game is, there's not much inside to explore: It's not a very long playthrough and there are no real extra nights involved. It is literally Five nights.   There is some small extra stuff but other than that there's not much to look into unless you're someone who is really only fascinated with the lore and back story.   I for one am much more interesting into the gameplay than the lore itself, but I like it anyway.   So overall I say this is the most unique experience of the series and you should certainly give it a go.",

In the previous games the story was in hidden easter eggs and little details, without it really being there unless you go looking. However in this game, its different as the story is there, but to go deeper you really need to look. And unlike in the old games, there are little tasks you have to do in this game to get past the night. None of the survive until 6am premise (Or is there?......) So overall good.",

The others where so focused on story that I felt gameplay got dropped, (Cough, 3 and 4.) This game is actually fun, story driven, with really good acting and a nice dose of humor.  Edit: Now that I've played the game back to back, I want to take the time reflect on what set this apart from the other Fnaf. I also removed my point 2 post, so this doesn't take forever to read.   Story 8/10. Very, very interesting. If you can overlook the few kinks in the story, you'll find a level of lore that reached the depth of all other Fnaf games combined in just one game. Certain moments had me yelling at the screen (Which I've never done before :) ) At the risk of spoilers, I'll say this- the story is definitely introspective, but not confusing enough that you can't have fun.  Gameplay 8/10. No spoilers here, but each night has you doing a different task that taps into your primal fears. Like walking in a dark room with no light, knowing the thing that goes bump is out to get you. Engaging, enjoyable, except for the letdown night 4.   Overall- Not a masterpiece, but an all around great game. Here's a final thought. If you posses an HDMI cord, use it to plug your PC into your TV. That way, you can play on full screen with better sound and invite some friends over for a scare fest. But only if you want them to see you scream like a girl.",

I think the best fnaf games were 1 and 2. Awesome animatronic designs and the prequel plot twist was pretty cool. Fnaf 3 definitely had the best lore and backstory however was way to easy. Anyway so some good things about this game. 1. The voice acting and character models were amazing I think baby's voice acting was especially good. 2. The secret room was pretty cool it was nice to use the camera's again and be back to original fnaf. I also thought the TV cut-scene's had no purpose being there. Well that's what I have to say about this game if you won't a change from original fnaf I highly recommend this game if you don't then you won't like this game. I'm going to not recommend this game as I really don't like it aside from the voice acting of course.",

PROS: this is the most story driven game in the fnaf series and is a huge leap forward and i like that, the previous fnaf games told their stories through 8-bit mini games and/or secret newspaper clipings which left most of the story unclear but in sister location tells the story clearly, now some story bits are still left in the dark but not as much as in the past games.   the robot designs in sister location are just amazing, scott was always good at making robots and sister location shows off his best work from the highly detailed looks of circus baby and ballora to the simple, yet refined looks of bidybab and minireena to the nice redesigns of freddy, bonnie, and foxy    ok now i talk about the things i don't like in sister location.....   CONS: the gameplay, in the first 3 fnaf games, they had camera and power management mechanics and in fnaf4, it had sound based mechanics and all previous games, each one of the 5 nights got harder and harder but in sister location...it's basicly a diffrent minigame each night with story bits in between  night 1: tutorial night  night 2: hide and seek with bidybab and red light, green light with ballora and freddy  night 3: hide and seek with foxy and bonnie  night 4: i'll talk about night 4 in my next point.......  night 5: follow the leader with circus baby  i found most of these nights to be vary boring and tedious and i only sloged through them to get to the next part of the story.   final con.....night 4, it's easily the worst part of the game, at night 4 you get stuffed in a springlock suit and have to keep the springlocks from getting lose while fending off minirenna, sounds okay on paper...till you actually play it  1: there are too many springlocks to keep track of, this wouldn't be so bad if not for minirenna  2: every time minirenna grabs on to you, you have to shake it off causing the springlocks to get lose faster and due to the high number of springlocks, you get overwelmed fast and end up losing the night  3: everytime you die, you have to sit through a 5 min. cutscene...and you can't skip it  4: even though scott made the night easier in a recent patch, it's still frustrating to play    and well..that's it for the review, overall i wanted to enjoy the game and i'm happy scott is willing to change things up, this was a poor exucution and still needs some work but for something i paid $8 for...i guess it could of been worse   (scott announced a custom night update to the game that will be released in december, when it comes out i will update my review to share my thoughts on it)",

It's like all five levels were put together into a basket, shaken up, and then arranged in whatever order they were plucked out of. The first night, the tutorial, is obviously a no-brainer. The second night took me over an hour to complete. The third night I beat on my first try, and the fourth level, as with many others, is breaking my balls.  Scott, please consider rebalancing the game a bit so that the difficulty is incremental, not schizophrenic. I want to like and continue the game but its levels are all over the place.",

            "review_text": "Well, where to start? I'll begin by saying that it's nice for Scott to try and correct the errors of FNaF 4 (the lore being too vague, it simply being a rehash of the first game's mechanics etc), but Sister Location could have been better. In terms of the good, huge steps were indeed taken in the form of voice acting, which adds a new level of both terror and intrigue to the animtronics, as well as actual movement to different rooms. Due to the game's engine, this feature was of course limited to 'point-and-click' and basic WASD, but Scott made the most of what he had available. Also, the idea of each night being unique and centred around completing different tasks was a fresh take, something this franchise desperately needed.  However, the great shame comes in the fact that the concept of something different every night, which is the main gameplay aspect of the game, isn't carried out very well. Many of the game's mechanics are either explained poorly, too easy, or too hard. There's no sense of balance or stability for the majority of the nights. For me, sneaking through Ballora Gallery and repairing Funtime Freddy in Parts/Service are the only bits of the game that feel immersive. The rest is a whole bunch of talking, which I understand is for explaining the lore, but again there is no balance between it and the gameplay. Shocking the animatronics could have gone further in terms of a mechanic, but it just feels abandoned, and I feel the same about many other parts of the game. The horror aspect also rarely makes a decent appearance.  Overall, Sister Location is on a 50/50 basis with me. I like how it took the series in a new direction and proposed various new gameplay mechanics or ways to tell the story, but it falls flat in many of these ideas that have great potential on paper. Lately the FNaF games have been declining when it comes to replayability value (to be honest they didn't have much to begin with) but this time it came to a new low. There is virtually no reason to play through all the game's nights from start to finish more than once, especially considering the abomination that has come to be known as...Night 4. Nevertheless, I'll recommend this game since I feel like it will serve as an experiment, to see how people feel about a new take on this game series which, as of now, has an uncertain future.",

Story: The story is pretty boring and not fascinating at all it's pretty much every horror story ever.  The Community: This is the part i really despise about these game's the fandom is cancer and why the hell is there rule 34 of these animatronics? I just don't get it's really creepy and overall disgusting  The Music: The music is boring as hell and makes me want to go to sleep that's all i have too say about it.

The Custom Night: It's the same excact thing as the other 4 games nothing special except i just don't get why the main animatronic 'Baby' isn't in the update.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: With Patch 1.02 out, I'm going to take another crack at this and try to give it a bit more fair a review.  If you're looking for a continuation of the previous four(five?) games, it's a bit hard to say whether or not you would enjoy this one. It seems to disregard everything FNaFs 1-4 set up, the murders, the cover-ups, Springtrap, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. While you can find references to past games, they're few and far between, and as far as I can tell, the only thing worth noting that this game makes reference to is the time period of a certain event, one that about half the fanbase already knew about. The 'horror' is also incredibly weak, and while the first couple of nights work with the atmosphere and setup fairly well, it seems to just kind of give up around nights 3 and 4, relying more on difficult puzzles than actual fear-inducing setups. The 'free-roam' isn't free, the mystery(if there is any) is practically spelled out for you, the jokes aren't that funny(not that a horror game should have that many jokes, especially not with this much frequency), and the scares are, well, not scary.  With that being said, Sister Location isn't *bad*, more or less just...unexpected. It's a change of pace from the previous four main titles that nobody was really prepared for, but that's not always a bad thing. The animatronic models look really nice compared to the previous titles(which, in all fairness, weren't slacking either), the voice acting, while it does take some time to get used to, is overall pretty good, and the story, as blunt as it is, is decent.  If you're looking for another FNaF game that builds upon the mysteries and mechanics of the others, you're not going to find it here and would probably be better off saving the money. If you're just looking for a distraction for a few hours, go ahead and pick it up, you might be delightfully surprised.  5.5/10",

I have heard that there is something like that as an end game bonus, but I don't want to risk spoiling myself to find out.  That said, what you get in this game is pretty good, if not a tad unfair at times. The first three nights do a good job of indicating what you need to do, and the stuff you do on those nights are a good mixture of fun, challenging, and tense. Night 4, however, doesn't do a good job of telling you what you need to do (aside from the primary objective; anything about how to reach that objective is not indicated to you, and it took me a good 3-4 deaths to figure out the pattern).  Sister Location also does a good job of being more story driven than any previous entry. The voice acting is excellent, the writing is a good balance of humor and horror, and the visuals are as horrific as you would expect from a FNaF game.  Overall, the game so far is worth the price tag. Again, those looking for a true FNaF experience, similar to one or two, will have to look elsewhere. But if you're a horror fan looking for a good, cheap game to get for Halloween season, I highly recommend this one, regardless of your familiarity to the FNaF series.",

You don't just sit in an office and spend 6 hours trying to survive, you have actual different objectives, every night is different than the last, and over all just so unique compared to the last 4 games. however i have mainly two problems with the game. 1.) This game just felt really short compared to the other games, and 2.) what really bothered me was the fact that everytime you died, there isn't too many checkpoints. For example, say your on night 2, and you are in the breaker room, and you just got killed, once that happen, you are back in the control module, meaning you have to crawl back through ballora gallery, and reset the rooms all over again.
