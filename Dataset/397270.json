            "review_text": "Are you searching for meaning in life? Tired of pondering the intricacies of the greater universe unfathomable?  'A Kiss For The Petals' or Sono Hanabira is the answer. It is the shining beacon of respite in a world without enough yuri. When you may have troubled yourself as to life's mundane purpose, you smile, knowing that you must trouble yourself no longer, for it is done, and Sono Hanabira is on Steam.  Notes:  This was originally a mobile/iPhone supplementary game in the Sono Hanabira series, and this is clearly an experimental English license. Fans will be supporting this release wildly for further localizations, and for newcomers, it may seem a bit overblown. This is not a long visual novel, nor is it entirely representative of Sono Hanabira as a whole. With that said...  'What's with 'Sono Hanabira?''  For long-time fans of the series, this is the seventeenth game, and one of two that are 'all-ages' (the other being Hanahira, for those of you interested in continuing your adventure into Sono Hanabira while staying within the 'all-ages space). Sono Hanabira started as a doujin nukige (doujin: amateur work by a small group of individuals; nukige: visual novel where the plot is only around to allow for 'plot') that was very well received for its tone, atmosphere, and high-quality character designs.   'Finally, yuri done right!'   A core cast of couples was developed, and multiple releases furthered the story between each of them. The success was too much to ignore, and after ten doujin releases, the company 'Yurin Yurin' was founded and it became a professional endeavour. 'St. Michael's Girl's School - Maidens of Michael' was released as a full length visual novel that connected, expanded, and meaningfully explored the characters in a way that previous entries didn't have room for. A shorter sequel was released, focusing on the new couple Risa and Miya (the ones featured in this game!), as were wholly original ventures (such as ones focusing on a post-high school Nursing School) and even a 'New Generations' series re-boot with an entirely new cast, as 'Yurin Yurin' was replaced as developers by 'St. Michael's Girl's Academy' (again, a company founded entirely for this venture).   At this point, fans are dying to play Sono Hanabira in its wholly professional and full length visual novel glory, but, it has far outpaced the fan translators and official English licensing and releases are wanted. So, with everything we've got, fans support Sono Hanabira in its fullest with this game! With enough support, the more lengthy games will be licensed, and the age of yuri can be heralded!",

Take this as a stand alone experience.   Pros  - Good artwork - The music is good and enjoyable - The writing is well done  Cons - Story is kinetic, there are no choices (only a con for some) - Story is short, 2 - 3 hours tops (again, only a con for some)  If you enjoy romance or sweet stories then this is a good way to spend a few hours.",

The story is pretty sweet. It follows the memories of two girlfriends as they remember how they first were introduced. Unfortunately, as this is a side-story for the main series of games, the actual coupling of the two is not shown, only their first few weeks of school. The official release of the rest of this series is dependant on the success of this game.  Those looking for a sweet and short (very short) yuri story should check this out.",
