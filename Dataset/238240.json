            "review_text": "Looks like I got this game on July 9, 2013. Today the game came out of Early Access as v.1.0, and unfortunately, the game is still rather hard to digest.   When I first played, the game had a few graphical issues, and it looked like it could have needed something like an editor to an author. Fine, I could always go back to it - though at this point I was beginning to regret buying this. At this point (and a couple subsequent playthroughs), I felt the game was not intuitive, unfriendly to beginners, and rather difficult for a game where you literally build your character to advance. Gathering materials? The laser pick was extremely weak and could not be as easily manipulated as Starbound's (as much as I don't like comparing, especially to Starbound). I took a long time gathering enough supplies (after dying a few times, some from mobs in the starting area and some from falling off the edge of the map) to make anything. Also, while the game no longer has the difficulty (sort of...) and the 10 free respawn limit, those things severely discouraged me from doing anything. So I waited.  Today, I opened the game with no expectations of things and found myself facing similar issues from the first time I played. The UI needs a lot of work - this doesn't look at all like a modern game with a futuristic setting - the dialog boxes look like just hastily placed rectangles and fonts (I spotted some serif fonts...) look like they were not even picked with intent. Some of the tips need editing in syntax and grammar, and overall, the game feels very much like a beta still. I wasn't pleased by the 'tutorial' either, since the first thing I saw was a codex full of unnecessary text.  Nothing in the game has struck me as intuitive so far, even regarding the gathering of materials. I got the DLC items and the pick is marginally stronger than the starting one, and while it's got a wider beam (3 tiles wide), the width becomes useless because the pick target cannot be directly chosen - so if you just dig downward, for example, in the same direction, you just end up with a 1 tile wide chasm, walls either damaged or already 'healed' to normal. Everything seems so grindy already - I know that games won't have you start off with good gear ready to kill bosses, but in the first quest of the tutorial, each one of those enemies (although they do no damage) took many hits to die. I don't see any fun in spending minutes killing common mobs (because face it, you're gonna attract aggro for all those missed attacks and some of those enemies move too fast with the starting rifle) and then spending minutes gathering.  I'm going to pass. Sorry, I tried, but more than 2 years did not give sufficient progress for me to enjoy this - too grindy and too unpolished.",

The game is laggy, choppy, the sprites clip and glitch around, the physics are wonkey for gravity (shoot enemy they fly straight upwards?), it's such a mess at the start. Their idea of a tutorial involves talking to a flying shark and gathering stuff.....it's very dull.   I'm sad that waiting for nearly a year on this resulted in this mediocrity.

            "review_text": "I have stayed away from this game for a while due to its low ratings, but decided to buy it during the christmas sale. I wanted to play it for myself to see how it was. Here are my thoughts from just an hour and a half of playtime.   Pros: + Has something like a main quest line + Has mini events that appear on the planet, with objectives + Has a crafting system with trees that look like they have a reasonable amount of items + Has an npc with a bunch of dialogue, uncommon for this genre + Has a strange (but interesting) artstyle that reminds me of AVwW, but a little different + Some of the equipment looks well drawn, and very nice as future outfits  Cons: - Crafting system requires large amounts of materials to make mundane or low tier objects - Enemies and destructibles drop lots of loot and it feels like my inventory is weighed down with junk just a few minutes into the game - The tiered system for items/crafting isn't intuitive or sensible (other than weapons/tools named 'Mk. 1', 'Mk.2', etc.) - The tiers locking you out of building or crafting some items feel arbitrary despite being in an already arbitrary game setting - Mining the necessary materials for the beginning quests or items is very slow, boring, and repetitive; it's so unengaging that it feels like busy work - Mining laterally is A PAIN at times because the laser eminates from your upper chest and you can't mine a straight line below or above that level due to that constraint - you have to mine extra blocks to get line of sight for your laser (which technically makes sense, but this isn't real life and an arbitration could be made here, even just letting us CROUCH would fix half of the problem) - Moving the character is clunky, you stop on a dime and using the jetpack arrests upward movement to begin a slow acceleration upward (but using the jetpack to slow your fall does very little to slow you unless you were already falling at a slow speed) - The npc with dialogue is annoying, makes annoying sounds each time you respond to it, and doesn't help you with the early game much other than telling you what the tutorial pane (accessed with the U key) does. - Several parts of the game are very arbitrary, like being magically unable to mine in an event area until you complete the event (but then able to mine with no problem afterward)   Conclusion: The game almost has the barebones of a sandbox crafting adventure game, with what looks like a reasonable amount of content added in. But content doesn't make a game, it only adds to it. The base gameplay, the platforming, the item collection and crafting, just feels bad. It does not feel finished. It feels like a prototype with extra content.",

            "review_text": "This game has come a long way since when it started in Early Access. It is now the first 1.0 'Official Release'as of last week. I'm a thumbs up but if you read my full review you'll see below what can be impoved on as well.  I've stuck with this game and I still enjoy it. It is a crafting, exploring game in 2D... but it's in space! And if you like space games that are open world and exploritory, I think you'll find this one not to like. The are lots of materials to search for, interesting knowledge tree to work towards for crafting new gadgets and gizmos, and plenty of creepy monsters and weird vegetation to learn about. So if you like figuring out the unknown, you'll like this. It's kinda like Terraria, Metroid, and Star Trek blended together, with a dash of Avatar but something kinda unique too.  The Edge of Space development team says they will keep improving this game post release and I hope they do.  3 things which need some immediate attention by the development team include:  - The game engine processes data and movement too slowly compared to other games in this genre. The result is that movement is slow and battle can be clunky for game play. I don't think this is my processors' or video card's fault as I play similiar games with even better graphics and gameplay, without so much latency. Maybe the coding could be tighter / more real time. Seems like a lot of processor overhead going on.  - The opening movie is pretty untelling still. It's better now that it's 1.0 but this is supposed to be the intro to the adventure. The user doesn't get a good sense of what the background story is and where they fit in. And what's with the other 3 organizations with different symbols? Are they competitors or allies? Are they the Ark Corp council? Are they the ones who blew up our ship or was it an alien war? It's hard to tell and it shouldn't be.  - The addition of Fineous the Shark has helped teach new players (and older ones) what the controls and game mechanics are. It could be a little more obvious though. Probably the best way is to make sure the Codex has more content and the user knows right away that this is their one stop shop for learning about their new world, and how and what an agent of Ark Corp is supposed to do and try to acheive. Some more work on the goals of the game are needed. The Codex should be like our 'Hitchhikers Guild to the Galaxy'; everything you need to know when you thunk on a new planet in a Cryopod without any friends or contact with where you blasted off from, after a long cryo-frozen nap. I like the sense of humour though so far; keep that going.  That's my thoughts on this game so far. I recommend, as long as you don't expect perfection just yet but I think it's worth supporting and playing. It's fun and interesting to explore.  This Review was written Sept. 20, 2015. ",

            "review_text": "Those who are willing to put in the time to explore the world of Edge of space will find a colossal amount of content just waiting to be discovered and enjoyed. The sheer variety of weapons, deployables, pets, mounts, materials, dungeons, bosses etc is impressive, and although there are some obvious similarities to Terraria for instance, it is in fact a very different game. I would definitely recommend trying to find someone else who you can play with though, as it does enhance the experience a lot.  There is a sort of tutorial in the form of a friendly laser shark who asks you to do a few short quests to get you used to the basic mechanics of the game, but the rest is mostly left up to you to figure out, (there are instructions on how to do everything if you dig in the menu) and so a degree of effort is required in order to get into the real meat of the content. Once you do however, you'll realise just how much there is to do and discover.  Edge of space is very colourful and is graphically the equivalent of eating too many packets of Skittles in one sitting, the pallette is well chosen and easy on the eye, the art style is great, and everything stands out. Some players have complained about the lighting system but personally I haven't had any problems with it.   The music is great, very relaxing and suits the mood well. The best thing however is the splendidly warped sense of humour that the developers obviously have and that comes across not only in the design of the world but in many of the descriptions and explanations that are there to be read if you take the time (and I recommend that you do)  Gameplay is a lot of fun and some of the weapons in particular are extremely satisfying to use. I know I have only just started to scratch the surface but already I am enjoying flying around on a net full of jellyfish with a small glowing fox creature following me around and helping to light my journey into the planet's extensive cave systems.  In summary, if you like randomly generated 2D exploration games with crazy amounts of content and are willing to put in the time and effort required to get through the initial learning stages, then you will get very good value from Edge of space, even more if you can find someone else to team up with.",

Not all games actually make it!  It didn't take much to impress me, this game had it all. That's not to say it needs to improve highly, but the devs once promised there is a lot of updating planned for it. I really love this game so far, it has major potential.  Having played Terraria for some time, I knew this game would be a great addition to my Steam library. It has a long way to go, even after it was released to the public, there is a lot of content that needs to be added, and lots of bugs that need squishing.

The gun play is satisfying and a multitude of guns gives a lot of choice to the player as to what they want to use.

As such, I've desperately tried to like the game and pushed myself to give it more chances.  Now, with that in mind - The game has potential. There's some really great ideas in there as well as a unique art style (Though given the size of the sprites, I can't imagine there's much modding going on with people skilled enough to pull it off).  The problem is, as always, execution. Edge of Space feels very empty, despite its vast size, and there's not much to really do other than 'Dig deeper, grind for better gear'. The controls feels pretty floaty, and the gathering mechanics tend to get very weird when you want to mine a block right in front of you. Their attempts at humor are dry and fall flat on its face, as I've come to expect of indie games lately. Also, on top of frequent bugs and crashes, the game also needs some SERIOUS rebalancing around the crafting system and output. Often times you will have to grind your butt off to get a better gun, only to find that the one after that is almost trivial to acquire. Enemy frequency and damage scale up disproportionally to your ability to defend yourself.  So what DO I like about the game? The crafting system is quite brilliant - Much like the (newly released at the moment of writing) Fallout 4, you mostly rely on braking down items into basic components, in this case minerals. For instance, you can build a nice looking base with just some basic metal and dirt, no joke. Building is also a charm, as you can place blocks all over the screen without a fake limit. It's also quite refreshing to get a hi-tech tool from the get-go. I s2fg, if I have to deal with another spacey game that gives me a pickaxe, I'm rioting. When the game works, it can feel very satisfying.   In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game, since it still feels heavy WIP, even if it improved GREATLY since launch (It was simply awful then). The content is limited, and it's pretty clear that the game is very much unfinished at this point.  I've found a way to enjoy it, but without the intial reason, I would have abandoned the game for good.",

If you really enjoy this type of game and/or you play it with friends you are probably going to have a good time. Still can't completely recommend it but I am more on the fence now rather than a full thumbs down. Try it on sale if in doubt and you likely won't be too upset if it isn't your cup of tea.  Note: very involved and hard working developers. I am sure this game will continue to improve as time goes by.  __________________________________________________________________________________  OLD REVIEW:  OK game but quite repetitive, crafting doesn't make too much sense, i.e. use dirt and make armor, crafting button instead of 'craft' label has a 'science' label,... can you say non-intiutive?. Early access so game not finished, world and characters deleted relatively frequently for updates. Forced limits of exploration depth based on equipment type, i.e. can't skip equipment and just build higher levels tiers you need to plod through each level of equipment. Never seen the cool shark and polar bear enemies advertised on the store page, just crabs on speed, flying jellies, cyborg flying brains with beaks, velociraptors, and a few others, some weird ecology going on there.  Recommendation: pick up on sale but don't expect much and/or buy later when it's complete",

It has vehicles, a decent progression system, quests and NPCs.  Sure, it has some downsides (most annoyingly UI lag) and parts of the game feel unfinished (vehicles IMO could be much more useful than they currently are). But overall I found the game reasonably enjoyable and don't quite get all the negativity (I think it's more of a case of unmet expectations than the game being objectively bad).",

            "review_text": "Overall: I think that in it's current state the game shows a ton of potential and has some very great features. I really like the Terraria/Starbound 2D worldcraft type gameplay and the controls/combat of this particular title does the style justice. If you're a fan of these, this game is a must-play as it is a bit more forgiving than Starbound or Terraria in some ways but also very challenging in it's own right.  Positives: There is a great amount of appealing content in the game so far. The combat is a lot of fun. I like how easy it is to find and upgrade resources as well as unlocking content by simply fighting monsters and mining. Each (fighting/mining) give you exp points equally. There are also mini-dungeons you come across regularly to clear out. These in addition to deployable tower defense and other styles of mini-game dungeons adds a fun spin to the roguelike worldcraft indie style.  Negative: The biggest issues I have with the game are stability issues and bugs. After initially binging on the game for several hours, I lost everything I had built due to a client crash. I still had my character and all the inventory, but the planet/area's safe file was corrupted so I had to start from a fresh new save. This made me lose all my storage and the structures/bases I had built. Also it seems that about half the time the game has trouble deploying your character as playable into the world. Sometimes the screen is dark and everything responds, but you cannot move or take control of your avatar. It is easily fixed by a restart or two (if it happens sequentially).   Neutral: This game isn't a solid world like in Terraria or Starbound. There are large open spaces inbetween land masses that you must use your jet pack to travel between while heading deeper in the map without taking damage on impact as the gravity is similar to that of earth. This I feel like has both negative and positive effects for creating elevator shafts and fast-travel between different levels. For instance, one thing I liked about terraria was creating an easily navigated mine-shaft to drop very deep very quickly, although in this you can just build a teleporter wherever you want and teleport straight to it. So it really allows you to focus on more combat if you want to.  End thoughts. Worth overall. I will update my review as it is developed.",

            "review_text": "The positives: Uh...... it has a terraria reference? The neutral stuff: Kinda grindy and mining is slow.  The stuff that are pretty big flaws but could have been okay: A 'research' system. In other words, not just one, but TWO methods of forcing you to work your butt off to get a incredible reward!..... Just kidding, you 'll also get stuck behind so many progression walls there are enough for several mazes of utter misery with the slow mining and finding out SURPRISE! you now need a new workstation. Alright, i'll go dig out ANOTHER massive crater to get some XP so I can research that. (An hour later) Alright let's see what I need for this thing. Looks like some uranium and a ton of aluminum (That's not actually a recipe but an example of the sorts of recipes there are) Time to go get some aluminum!.... Got that, what about uranium? Oh... I can't mine it. So what do I need to make a laser to (hopefully) mine it? Looks like more giant crater making for me. Hooray. Three cheers for whoever decided holding down on your mouse and moving it for hours was a neccecary game mechanic. What killed the game: There's no satisfaction to ANYTHING. Completing quests? Grindy and unrewarding. Exploring? Fun until you realize all the terrain is the same. Progression? There's progression? Where? Where'd you find precious progression? WHERE?!?! Combat? Yes there is! It's combatting the woefully weak jellyfish who die after about 20 seconds of holding the mouse button down! There isn't even different fighting styles. Sure you can pick between 'pew pew' guns, 'pew... BOOM' guns or 'PEW............... PEW' guns but compare that to terraria where you can get a massive variety of weapons, from classic swords to lances to boomerangs to flails to variants that deal more damage, look cool, fire off an array of projectiles from various actions (hitting enemies, when swinging, whenever there's an active hitbox...) or inflicting debuffs. And that's just THE MOST BORING CATEGORY. Not to say they aren't cool, it's just they're the trump 6 out of sixes and tens. There's also guns, bows, bow/gun hybrids, spellbooks wands+rods and staffs, throwing lances, throwing knives, shuriken, yo-yos, a portal gun, a voodoo doll, and that's just the stuff I thought of in a few minutes. Sorry about the massive rant. Overall, it's a 2.5/10 on the scale of games that aren't stupendous but aren't one of 'those' games. You know them. Zelda CGI, Flight Control, Slaughtering Grounds. The type that get videos dedicated to laughing at the sheer amount of crap that they are. Anyway, hopefully this helped the devs and the people who are thinking about buying it. Here's some games that hold up to the 1$ per hour of fun rule. Terraria: a 157 hour epic, and i've only gotten to late prehardmode and skill is the limiting factor in that. Cave Story+: The original indie game with new graphics and a handful of extra content including difficulty settings, new characters and a new level cut from the original game because it was apparently too dark (clones of a friendly character who attack you) which makes no sense considering it involves drowning as well as being forced to kill a character who was fed the red flowers (you'll understand if you play it) along with a character who tried to protect his friends and killed them accidentally. Seriously. It also has multiple endings. Undertale: AWESOME game involving SPOILER SPOILER who SPOILERs SPOILER. It's kinda loses half its appeal if you already know the story. Not to say the story is great and the gameplay is bad; all of undertale is fantastic. It's just that the story and gameplay are SO interconnected that spoiling one makes the other not quite have the impact it's supposed to. Also, bring a friend and a tissue or two. Seriously. Undertale is the only game ever to make me laugh so hard or cry anything exept tears of frustration.",

If you enjoy this game good I'm glad but my disappointment turned into anger after playing it again.  You can tell its a good game when it lags when you open it up and when you create a level you could make a cup of coffee in the same time (pc master race) and when the screenshots taunt you with an interesting game. But you know its a fantastic game when the first mission of the game with the shark to protect it from the 'evil' jellies or you could just leave the abomination alone to its demise and still complete the mission and return to it without any consequences. I hope this is in early acess so it can improve but its still a bland game which makes doing chores fun, but dont worry you can unlock this cool item if you grind throughout and then you can battle that cool boss advertised if you didnt quit already. As if something needed to be added at the start of the game buildings are here and have generic repetitive tasks that sometimes dont make sense such as bombs appearing in a jelly base for you to randomly press buttons in order to dissarm it or do what I did and blow it up. There are no biomes in a alien world which after aimlessly wandering around discovering that the hud looks bland if the game is about to be released. Edge of space is a failed attempt into reaching 2d sandbox fame and if its true that this game is out of early access then there is little hope of improvements to this game.

Devs are posting regularly in the steam forums. This game remembers me of an insane mix of metroid and terraria. Your an astronaut and embark on a mission to reclaim and terraform a split up planet. The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection ! Of course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !  Now you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start! Dont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)  Basically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.  I think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.    TL;DR Basically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns. Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.  It maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)  But take notice Win Xp is NOT supported ! Mac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation!   Just check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on. When starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.    Edit2: Not recommended anymore, because its abandoneware. The website shut down and community manager got fired!",
