            "review_text": "Mirrored is a mystery first-person point&amp;click puzzle-game.  It's rather short and just plays in one room, where you have to collect and combine items and solve puzzles to progress.  The story, told in small cutscenes and some notes throughout the game, is rather mysterious. You hear a message on your phone from your twin brother, who needs your help. Apparently he is chased and needs to secure an item from these people. So you head to his office and try to find whatever he is hiding first.  The puzzles in the game aren't that hard, but there were 2 where i struggled a bit. Atmosphere is pretty good and the story seems pretty interesting. although you don't get to know much. It's basically just some emails and notes which gives you hints of the broader story.  Game ends on a big cliffhanger, so hopefully there will be more chapters soon.  I enjoyed it and would recommend to everyone who likes these first-person puzzle-games and is not put off by the fact that the game is quite short.",

            "review_text": "An pleasantly artistic and atmospheric point-and-click puzzler. It's a little demanding at times, requiring you to really think outside the box, but the puzzles are nonetheless clever for it. The story is fun, and leaves you wanting more. The playtime is pretty short, but the low price makes up for this. All in all, if you're looking for a short, well-crafted, and story-rich puzzler that claims to have more coming, Mirrored - Chapter 1 is for you.",

It took a while for me to understand what exactly i was supposed to do but after exploring the environment everything seemed to click together. The story is very intriguing. I only wish it was a bit longer, however It surely felt like a short introduction to something bigger. I am interested in playing the next chapter.  Although short, do not expect to complete this game in a few minutes. The puzzles are difficult enough to keep you struggling but still wanting to answers just as much as the protagonist.   If you want a game that really makes you think, I highly recommend this one.",

I'm looking forward for next chapters, gentlemen! The puzzles are at the right level of difficulty, is not straightforward but if you try to make the connections you finally get it. Also, I have to say that the graphics are really good and I loved the cut scenes between the acts. Well done!",

I eventualy had to go read an walkthrough but even then i was thinking to myself that it was nonsense. From there the game lost my atention and curiosity.   I hate it when the game doesn't give the player enough information about something he's supposed to do. There are no puzzles, it's just get something then use it on something. Also, i hate it when the game doesn't let you do something before you're supposed to (ex: Find something that was there the whole time but you can only interact with it now).   Wouldn't recommend.
