            "review_text": "This game is actually quite entertaining. Some of the puzzles provide a good challenge, and each puzzle seems to be procedurally generated which makes it likely that you'll never encounter the same puzzle twice.  I would like to see a reset button on the level that resets the level back to how it was when it was generated. Currently if you go back to the menu and back into the puzzle, a new puzzle will be generated and the previous puzzle will be lost.  Puzzles are always good for the brain, and for the price you can't beat it.  Since it was just released today and has room for improvement, I'll give it a solid 7/10.",
