            "review_text": "I backed this game on Kickstarter and just got the key today and wanted to share a review.  If you have ever played a Jack King-Spooner game (Blues for Mittavinda, Sluggish Morss, Will You Ever Return...), Beeswing is more of what you'd expect. However, this particular outing is quite a bit longer than his other games, so it has more to sink into. Beeswing is King-Spooner's warmest and most personable game so far. There is a lot to interact with, and it's lovely to take this game slowly, savoring everything. If you liked any of his other games, don't hesitate to try this one.  For those who haven't played a Jack King-Spooner game, come into this expecting more of an experience than a game. Yes, this will fit into the 'games as art' category, but it's just so damn affecting. He does things with images and interaction that can't be done in other mediums, and gad, he creates atmosphere and weird and beautiful moments that will stick with you forever.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to see games perforate the expectations of what games can and should be. This game is for those who look for moving experiences and interesting storytelling. It's not for everyone, but when it resonates, it resonates hard.",

            "review_text": "A surreal and beautiful slice-of-life story. Jack King-Spooner blends extraordinary sights and sounds to create a personal environment full of emotion and imagination. While most may see it as another 'walking simulator,' it is surely one of the most engaging of its kind.  8.5/10",

            "review_text": "I can't explain it, but as strange and avant-garde as this game is, it speaks to me. There's a surprising amount of lessons to be learned and stories to be heard just by talking to people. The art style is practically the definition of gestalt: unassuming and very amateurish on its own, but taken together, it all looks gorgeous and unique. The music is hit or miss: some of it is amazing, and some of it gets a little grating. Add all of this into a playtime of 2-4 hours and you've got a great package.  If you don't like games with a slow pace or the so-called 'Walking Simulator' genre, then this game isn't for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in a world that's meaningful, bizarre and artistic, Beeswing is an excellent choice.",
