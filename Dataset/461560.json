Pros: Fantastic artstyle, very ambient music (feels like an oddworld OST), the game's free, easy to get 100% achievments, okay platforming,  Cons: The map is pretty inaccessible, it's very short, sparse details on story, falling from a high place &amp; getting back up can be a pain  Overall this game is pretty neat, and for how short it is and the price, pretty much anyone can beat it and everyone can try it. It doesn't really fit into any genre, but it has a great vibe to it. I love the music and the art even more.",

The art was incredible, with all the layers and the movement, the banners blowing in the wind, the broken statues that were each totally unique instead of just reused models, and the waterwheel at the beginning that almost looked like it wasn't even pixel art. Gameplay-wise however, I have to say it was rather lacking. Don't play this expecting an exciting adventure or anything, rather play it just for a little peaceful and relaxing ride.",

It has a story yes. But i personally couldn't follow it. It really is an amazing game. I'd recommend it to anyone who even remotly enjoys chilling with a slowpaced game and just relaxing. Yes the jumping is annoying but you can't be perfect right?  Overall i'd rate 9/10.",

You can tell that the creators spent a lot of time making this game as proffesional as possible, and the look and aesthetic is nailed in this game. Mandagon is a very calming and atmospheric game, with tons of calm and light colored visuals. The only gripe I have is the gameplay couldve been a little more fun or exciting.  While Mandagon wasn't very long, it was an enjoyable experience overall. I think the fact that it is so short makes it a little bit more enjoyable, instead of being long and drawn out for the sake of content. Nice job to the creators, and I highly recommend this to most people looking for a calming experince.",

It is a 2D platformer featuring only one solidly designed level whose mechanics include jumping, elevators, teleports, and underwater jet streams that launch your block entity upwards. It is very quick to satisfy you with reward.   The primary rewards is a sort of interpretive mystery that I wont spoil you here. Suffice to say there are no enemies, only obstacles, and that growth I mentioned first is sort of designed for your block character get reach what it does not know it needs or wants. There is no real narrative other than the atmosphere, so that’s why there’s room for a fair bit of interpretation of the values hidden amongst notes around the level (actually, they are totems with humming inscriptions reading you two-sentence anecdotes and proverbs). I would say that this game could actually benefit from playing it twice. It wont take your more than 30 minutes to get through all of it, so perhaps stopping to observe every nook and cranny would be fair idea.  Also, the soundscapes are intoxicating. They sort of carry you along. They aren’t filled with melodies; it’s more like listening to a synthesizer with ocean and wind sounds being played as music. That’s the best way I can describe it. They’re meditative sounds and very relaxing.  All in all, I’m surprised to say that a one-level game is as solid as this. So, good job to the developers. I look forward to other ideas from them.",

I believe there's around 24 total sages to talk to. This directly correlates to the Dharma wheel. You play a totem, but in looking at the character itself, it seems like you actually play a hungry ghost rather than a totem. There are six tablets you have to get, which translates into the six different groups within the Bardo. Later on, you see three Buddhas lit up, which could correlate to the Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya, or the three bodies of Buddha. I also find it quite enjoyable that you meet Avalokiteśvara, a bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas. Even more truly, it's kind of enjoyable that they placed this bodhisattva above you, because their name literally means Lord Who Looks Down. Although, in their depiction, it could be the emanation, Mahakala. I'm not sure what sect of Tibetan Buddhism they're basing from, but oh well! Great job. I enjoyed it.",

There isn't much else to do other than to ride elevators, levitate, and look for stone tablets to open a giant door.  To the developers, you did an excellent astounding job on the game environment design as well as the sound design, but the *gameplay needs more. In the meantime, my Final Verdict is: 6/10",

The controls are easy: a simple WASD, E, and SPACE game. The graphics are amazing in terms of how charming they are, and how they portray a very religious mood and unique art style. If you have an hour to spare, I suggest you play this game just to experience how good it is.

No health bars, no time limit. Just music and great graphics.  - The characters in the game is well-done, too.

Overall, I wish this game was long, as it only took me about thirty minutes to beat it, and I don't think it will take much longer to get all of the achievements. It is a great game though for being completely free, and if they make it a full-fledged game I would drop twenty bucks on it.

That's because the only functions included are basic movement, jump, and interaction with objects. The next step to expand upon what exists in this game would probably be npc's and AI.  Note for the developer: There is an issue the collision code when pressing against a ledge that ends. The only examples I know are walls that are underwater above the tunnels that run between areas.

Reflections are on point, brings this feeling of being alone and you're in a path of discovery. -Mysterious story, from the start you're put in a spot of finding out what's going on. Which I like, being put in a place with no manual, you're figuring out the secrets that lie ahead which gives a nice like, this is cool feeling. -Music and sound is top notch. Music makes you feel alone like Super Metroid, but the journey that lies ahead will be enchanting.

Simply based on the artwork (I didn't even take the time to read the description or the story line).&nbsp;  Its 35 MB and took me 1.3 hours to complete from beginning to end. I didn't expect this to be a very long game, nor did I expect it to have a lot of reputability which is totally fine in a one off game. It was released to Steam on August 4th, 2016 (a mere&nbsp;&nbsp;9 days ago) and to be honest I am only slightly disappointed. &nbsp;&nbsp;  The artwork is what initially grabbed me, I grew up with pixilated art style games and have watched the industry grown and leave that style behind. Its only been somewhat recently I've seen some developers go back to that style and really revamp it. I can say without a doubt that what Mandagon felt like, a revamp of games past.&nbsp;  Its a jumping scroller, that takes place on a single somewhat, seemingly large map. You are a totem that must collect tablets from houses on pedestals and place them in the appropriate slots around the map in order to unlock a door that looks as if it leads to the inside of a palace guarded by 3 identical statues with 4 hands and closed eyes. &nbsp;Just when I thought 'This is to easy' I found myself lost on the map. I couldn't tell where the palace was, or which hut I had missed that held the final tablet.&nbsp;  But I managed to collect all the tablets and unlock 4 of the 5 Achievements within 1.3 hours, the last one I didn't unlock is sort of what slightly disappointed&nbsp;me. In order to understand the whole story there are Wisdom Totems scattered around the map with a line or two of a story. I'm not sure how many I missed as it doesn't keep count, I could have missed 1 or 10 and I wouldn't know without going back and making my own map.&nbsp;  There is no health system so if you could find a way to drop from the top of the map to the bottom there is no consequence. But there is also no way to zoom in on the map or check it without being at a tablet deposit to check your location in relativity to somewhere else. So getting turned around is easy.&nbsp;  Unfortunately with a game made for a one time, short adventure like this one I can't use the rating system I came up with for bigger games. So I will have to tweak it a bit.&nbsp;  I would give this game a solid 4 of 5 Stars,&nbsp;  Star&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;Artwork: I loved the artwork, its got a beautiful Tibet style to it while being pixelated.&nbsp;its what grabbed my attention.  Star 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Audio:&nbsp; I loved the music, it was simple yet serene and calming, I could easily use it to do Tai Chi to or fall asleep.&nbsp;The effects of jumping were there but were not over powering so it didn't interrupt the music.&nbsp;  Star 3&nbsp;&nbsp;Plot/Story The story while it could have been executed a bit different &nbsp;(perhaps a totem count so you know how many your missing. a better incentive to go looking&nbsp;for the others)&nbsp;  Star 4&nbsp;Challenge/ Difficulty&nbsp; I wish there was a little more to the adventure, but I also like it the way it is. &nbsp;Its challenging in its own way without a death/penalty system  The only star its lacking right now is reputability. The only reason I'd go back to play the game would be to get those last few Wisdom Totems I'm missing for that last achievement. And thanks to the way the saving system works, it might not be that hard to.&nbsp;  WARNING: FROM THIS POINT FORWARD WILL BE SPOILERS  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT  From the Wisdom Totems I did speak too, it seems that the totem you are moving (WASD to move, space bar to jump, tab showed hints to the next tablet you had discovered) was once a man. A father. From what I could gather he once in life had a daughter;&nbsp;she was very sick and in a slumber, and a trade was needed to heal her.&nbsp;  'A Child So Fragile With Bones of Clay' 'A Fathers Soul Promised For A Trade' 'And In Your Passing A Weight Is Lifted' 'With Noting Cured, Only Shifted'  These are quotes from Wisdom Totems in the trailer.&nbsp;  'Lung for Lung, Eye for Eye, Old for Young' was the jist of one of the totems and is shown by some drawings on the temple. From what I pieced&nbsp;together&nbsp;the father made the trade and was stuck in&nbsp;Limbo, climbing the map until he reached the palace. Upon reaching the palace you confront a blue god with four arms who tells you that they have been watching you the whole time and your sacrifice isn't in vain, a piece of you was left behind,&nbsp;but you would be climbing the tower and repeating upwards ever more. At the point the game ends and the credits roll.&nbsp;  All in all it was a nice break from my usual gaming habits and I do hope to find more like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ",

            "review_text": "Beautiful, minimalistic, atmospheric, and just a little pretentious, Mandagon is a very short game which is very much worth your time. There is little challenge beyond exploration and the most basic of puzzle-solving as you cannot die, get stuck, or otherwise reach a failure state, but the brief quest your little totem embarks on still manages to feel like the epic trial it is implied to be.  The story is perhaps a little TOO minimalistic, almost completely conveyed through the poetic ramblings of the totems scattered about the world, a couple of pictures painted on the walls, and a brief monologue from the game's sole NPC. Considering the subject matter (which I shall not spoil), it would have been better if there had been a little more shown and a little less told- maybe a few simple, symbolic cutscenes, to help you empathise more with a major character who never actually appears, and is only mentioned.  The atmosphere and aesthetics, though, are simply unparalleled. I'm honestly not sure whether there were 3D graphics used in the game or whether it was simply extremely elaborate pixel art used to simulate 3D motion (the fluttering of banners in the wind and the like) but either way the game is one of the greatest testaments to the effectiveness of 2D graphics in our modern 3D age. The game's design is rooted in Tibetan culture, and also seems to contain elements of Hinduism, but either way it certainly gives everything an extremely unique appearance. The music is stunning and the minimalist sound effects punctuate the mood with ringing intensity.  What little gameplay there is, is fine. Controls are responsive, and while the game world initially seems massive and easy to get completely lost in, frustration is minimal. Your tasks are initially completely opaque, but rapidly become clear and you will not be likely to become stuck and frustrated unless you're particularly slow or just plain unused to video games in general.  Mandagon is ultimately a beautiful, if brief, experience well worth the short amount of time it will take you to complete it. It's hardly life changing and could possibly have done with a  bit  more fleshing-out, but it's still an impressive piece of gaming art. Recommended.",

The artstyle and music is enchanting, and the strange poems around the map hint at a broader theme of rebirth and renewal. I'm not sure if I'd buy this(I think it deserves money but I'd probably overlook it if it had a price) but it's certainly worth getting, especially with its low price of $0.00.
