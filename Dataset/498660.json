The puzzles are fairly simple and straight forward, but it's a fun exercise while waiting for something to install or just a moment of down time. The rotation of background and 3D objects might not be OK for everyone. Right now 'Great Schematics' level 6, the 36th puzzle has a design flaw that traps the ball in a loop of up-the-ramp behavior because the bounce at the bottom of the ramp isn't strong enough. Neither peice is movable, but up to this point it was nice to spend 10 minutes here or there playing. Because I cannot skip a puzzle, the rest of the game is locked. It came in a bundle, so no real loss, but it would have been great to have gone forwrad.  Overall the game was nice and the kids enjoy the challenge themselves.",
