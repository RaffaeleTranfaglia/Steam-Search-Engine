A great melody: On the Beautiful Blue Danube by Johan Strauss will accompany through the game, you can´t hate that one. Some will remember the 2001: A Space Odyssey movie when playing. The cynical narrator (presumably Stephen Hawking) will make you smile when you crash the Lunar Pod. The game has a good difficulty as you advance. 20 levels are the downside here.  For all of those who will play Terra Lander with a keyboard and mouse, I will give you an advice: when It comes to shoot, just shake a bit your mouse and press left mouse button. I was going crazy the first 10 minutes.  Good replay value If you´re one of those people who just want a simple but fun game to play for an hour tops.  A must have for Retro Gamers. 8/10",

I have tried everything from hitting every key on the keyboard to even clicking the mouse, and I haven't figured out how to use the weapons yet. I'm labeling this game as incomplete.",
