It's only about 4-6 hourse if you decide to blaze right through it. For it's length it's pretty pricey at 10 $ but If you manage to get it on sale it'll be worth your time to grab it. Way back in the day I got this together with Battle Engine Aquila bundled with a graphics card of all things and spent a good few days playing and replaying it.",

Although a simple restart of the game is the fix for this :)",

It had been in my backlog for quite a while tho.  The only problem this game had is the mouse control. Flying using the mouse is hard as you will occasionally damage yourself by bumping on building a lot after you transform in a city before you got the hang of the flight.  Since the game isn't really deep and it is fairly short. So do the review for it.  Buy this during sale tho.  7/10",

Cannot move and aim precisely, as it feels like you're constantly panning in one direction or another. And there is too much glare when trying to move or aim toward the sun. But, on other platforms maybe it works ok.   Music's not too bad, tho...  (Note: Acquired via a bundle)",

That alone, no checkpoints, made me uninstall and begin the process of forgetting I wasted any time on this.  Even if the game had checkpoints, the controls are still garbage and there are two horrible problems. The first is that a lot of times you have to be going in the direction of the sun because enemies are right directly in front of it so you have to stare into a god damn supernova sun while you fight and it will burn your ♥♥♥♥ing eyes out. I had to play with my eyes nearly closed half the time. That and your crosshair is barely noticable during heavy action which is always. I CONSTANTLY in all the action and confusion lost my crosshair so most of the time I had no idea where I was shooting. Another problem is that the big ships shoot a constant stream of green lasers that are not dodge-able no matter where you are, and you have to be within range to shoot them so it makes no sense and you get ripped apart fast.  NOT a old classic at all, just a old pain. But hey it got 75% positive reviews so it has to be good right? I just need to get good right?",

I have always been a firm believer that a game has to grab you within the first few minutes of gameplay to come to conclusion if you will continue playing. Same with girls choosing within 5 minutes if they will sleep with you. This game brings forth great awesomeness. It brings me back to the old school Afterburner Arcady games mixed in with over the top MECH Warrior action. The graphics are a bit meh, but it pays homage to so many games. I actually enjoy the fact that the developers paid more attention to gameplay than graphics. Love this game, the controllers are amazing, honestly better than most Triple A titles. The action is intest as well. Sorry this review is all over the place, I am far too excited for this game. Buy this game, do not hesitate, stop reading this crappy review and BUY THIS GAME.

The downside is, that it ends too quickly. And that price. For 13-year old game.",
