            "review_text": "TL;DR  This game game can become really messy for your eyes, make sure to play in a well lit room or RIP eyes. Also I have no idea how to play with a keyboard.  Besides those two little problems, Dyad is a really interesting game. It becomes pretty addictive once you really get into it because there are so much things that get added in the gameplay as you play. But I'd like a option to have the game running on 'Windowed no borders'. It'd be super.  Let's get into things. In Dyad, you basically are a little... non identified thing with kinda tentacles (just what I think, maybe it has a name) and you must grab onto 'enemies' being little light orbs. You must make pairs of enemies that are the same colors to boost your speed and get more points. That's basically the base of the game.  But it's not only that. Sometimes, you just need to make pairs and finish the level. Sometimes, it's a race and you need to finish is in less time as possible. Buuut, you can also start to 'graze' the enemies by grabbing them. A circle will appear around them and then you just need to pass close to them. This'll build up a 'lancing' bar, then you'll be able to 'lance' on the enemies. This is like a super boost and you can hit the enemies like that to go faster and make the lancing last longer (I think? I'm not sure about this) Those are the only things I tried so far. There must be some other modes and special things to do. Also the music and sounds are really great.  Since I always have my game controller plugged, I still haven't figured out how to play with a keyboard. But the experience with the controller is really enjoyable and easy to play. You just need the buttons and left joystick. And fingers. And hands. And eyes. And a brain. You get it.  This is the kind of game you'll want to play a level over and over again to master it and get a high score (at the time I'm writing this I hit the 9th place of a level on the global leaderboards after trying a level a few times). The fact that you can edit the way you play the levels after finishing them once ('remix') is really interesting and I really like it. You can even play a non-ending game just to, like, relax or practice without being scared of a game over or the end of the level. But I don't know what some of the things do though.  If you're epileptic this is not the game you want to play at all. As you play, the colors and lights become more intense. I myself am not someone who's really sensitive to that, but at one point I had to take a break because it was too much. I couldn't even play the damn level anymore (the game reminded me of Super Hexagon. Must take breaks while playing this or you just slowly become crazy). Also I'm someone who tends to change windows a lot when I play (to take breaks and all) and when it's full screen it tends to freeze the game and sometimes make it crash. An option to have the game windowed but without borders would be really cool. I don't want to touch the launching options because I don't know if it works just like TF2.  After this kinda novella I can only say 'Yes, I recommend this game'.",

            "review_text": "'It's like psychedelic shaders - the game. I watched nothing but colours for five straight minutes and somehow it was the most rewarding ending a game has ever offered.'  I got Dyad some time after I first saw it being played by its developer, Shawn McGrath, on a Twitch stream. It looked incredible. Like, I wasn't sure what to think. I just wanted to have a go. After eventually buying and playing the game for myself, I'm still not sure what to think. It's probably better if you just don't think, plug your senses into the game and feel it. Feel the game. Feel the game playing you as you play the game.  Dyad is kind of post-genre but definitely arcade in nature. Imagine playing Tempest but with the pace of Burnout. That's kind of how it feels to play. The actual gameplay is essentially pair matching similar to the match-three style gameplay of Audiosurf. You need to be able to think quickly while remaining relaxed. Otherwise you'll never be able to figure out what you're doing, never mind wou're supposed to be doing. Also like Audiosurf (or any other rhythm game), Dyad lends itself well to short bursts of play as well as long sessions of score chasing on a single level.  As confusing as it looks, (and it always looks confusing, even if you've played it,) it's a remarkably simple game. The concepts are fed to you at a satisfying pace, increasing the difficulty of the game as you progress through each level. To start with, you just have to 'hook' two consecutive 'enemies' of the same colour as many times as is required to complete the level while also avoiding the enemies themselves. However, as you encounter different types of enemies and you learn to use your second ability, 'lance', things get difficult quickly as the complexity layers on and you start moving ever quicker through the infinite tube the game takes place within.  If you like fast-paced, twitch gameplay, rhythm game-like mechanics, and are willing to be blinded for a few seconds for going on a lucky streak, you'll probably enjoy a quick session of Dyad or perhaps a long one if you're feeling competitive.",

            "review_text": "It...  Hang on.  Dyad...  Right. OK.   Dyad is a game that is hard to describe. Many of the other reviews describe the effect like being on drugs, and I agree. It feels amazing and responsive when you pull off a level perfectly, and while the difficulty ramps up rather quickly I never felt as if I was out of control. This is definitely a point in its favour, because the graphics are... trippy, to say the least. Imagine the Doctor Who opening without the Tardis or the music, then synch up some weird electronic beat and underlying melody,add in weird beeps and boops when you hook an enemy and that is pretty much the experience of Dyad.   Plus you have taken all the drugs.",
