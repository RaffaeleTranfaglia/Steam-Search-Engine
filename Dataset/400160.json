            "review_text": "Sorry; not my cup of tea. It's not actually got anything to do with city building, and the difficulty ramp is simply brutal - which is generally fine so long as people are aware, but games take a REALLY long time and you don't get any warning if the later terrain is stacked against your character or not.  As a card game, I'd class it as a deck builder (like Marvel's Legendary) played on a board; you start each game with a shallow pool of tier 1 cards (which you do get to customize with a limited range you unlock while slowly leveling), and you gain more - or replace them - by spending economy points from placing particular structures. You don't keep cards between games, beyond unlocking them for your starting slection/randomized pool.  There are 5/6 card colours, but most are only useful/viable to a single character so helpful unlocks are pretty far apart (they don't generally clog you up too bad though, as you get a random selection of 4 to choose from when purchasing in-game). I did not find the characters to be remotely balanced; there's a woeful techie guy who posed no resistance at all (no point scoring abilities in a point scoring game), then at the opposite end of the spectrum there's a military lady who scores points in an inverted fashion - which gives her free reign to 'poison' the entire board, which is an incredible hinderance to others and gains her massive economic advantage.  Positives + Unique (on PC - not sure about table-top) + Good game if you're looking for a challenge &amp; can play for long sessions + Charming  Negatives - Brutal diffculty - Games are very long &amp; not very dynamic - Questionable balance - Not actually anything to do with city building",

            "review_text": "This isn't actually Simcity, it's actually Dominion (the deck building board game) meets Tetris with a City Building theme.   Bascially, you have a deck, you will need to fill each row with X points worth of houses to clear the row (Tetris style), but you modify your deck as you play, removing low value cards and adding high value cards into your deck to increase the overall value each time you shuffle (Dominion style).   For some reason it lacks Internet multiplayer (only hotseat multiplayer).  It may not be in your taste, but you cannot deny it's interesting due to its uniqueness. Is there any other video game that says COMPETITIVE CITY PLANNING?",

There is alot of depth in the games puzzle mechanics so be prepared to give your 'grey matter' a workout.",

Bad moves cost much.  I can hardly see a flaw. Not that the game is the best ever made, but art is good, sound is good, acting is fun, GUI is alright, stability seems ok (so far so good)... Totally worth the praise.  This is a game for slow paced, relaxed, hardcore mindgamers. Clicking around won't lead you anywhere, and no time is ticking! Each move counts, so sit down and think for a change.  EDIT : alright, there is ONE flaw. Once buildings are constructed, there's no way to review bonuses each tile gives to another, you can't even see the building name, so you can't even deduce it from that. With good memory, you can keep track of what is happening, but with a better GUI, more information, it wouldn't be a problem at all.",

I poured countless hours into the game while it was in beta. Now that it is finishend and polished to shine, it's even more amazing. Of course, stuff like artwork and music are subject to taste, and I love the style. And the voice-work is brilliant. The game just has huge amounts of personality. ...but most of all it's the mechanics and the way the game flows that blows me away.   Beta-play was a rather relaxing affair of cunningly placing your tiles and picking cards for your ever growing deck. Campaign now is more challenging and the Solo-missions tasks take more carefull planning.  ...but, boy... don't get me started on Versus-Mode. It keeps me on the edge of the chair. Cursing myself for every missstep and more so cursing the AI for outsmarting me. (I am looking at you Marina, you devious bringer of ruin!)  In short: It's a game to easily pick up but hard to master. I can't wait to play against a friend. I am pretty sure that this game can end friendships :D",

            "review_text": "I expected a city builder and instead I got a super-polished deck-building puzzle game with brilliant mechanics and quirky characters.   This game is Tetris where all the pieces are buildings that interact with each other in tons of interesting ways. Instead of simply filling rows to clear them and get points, you have to collect points by raising the property value of certain squares and then placing down a 'point collecting building' (typically houses, hotels, dorms, etc) to raise the point value of the row above a certain threshold. Some buildings instead lower the property value, but give you other bonuses such as boosting your economy. As your economy increases you gain access to new abilities (specific to each of the several characters you can unlock) and new buildings with more powerful effects for your deck.   But as you spend more money the point threshold for clearing a line increases and the game gets more difficult, which is great because with all the new tech you have by the end of a match, the game would become trivially easy otherwise.  There are also versus matches, which feel like a completely different game and are no less compelling. The depth of the game really shines in these matches, and the AI is no pushover. The different characters go about building their city and scoring points in completely different ways, and the 'city planning fights' are surprisingly diverse as a result. There's even a character who prefers to dump industrial buildings everywhere and make scoring points difficult for the other player, while herself benefitting from the negative point values in various ways. She's fun.  Overall this game is fantastic and the amount of fun I had with it surprised me. Definitely worth a buy if you have even a passing interest in puzzle games (or even city builders - though this isn't really a city builder at all, the theme and mechanics are strong enough that you'll feel like you're making tough city planning decisions throughout the game). There's a lot of great content here and I can't recommend this game enough.",

            "review_text": "This deck building, victory-point, city-planner game is absolutely wonderful and relaxing.  Pros:    Deck building is innovative and competitive (if playing versus). You get to pick new cards, replace, remove, apply buffs/debuffs to the board or your opponent, advance the skill tree, etc. This aspect of the game offers a lot of options for the player to try strategies and adapt to the situations.    'City planning' may be a stretch, it's more of a victory-point, 'worker'-placement system. You need to score VPs by combining the cards in your deck and skills in your technology tree on the map tiles. The random nature of the card draws add some skill and decision making, while the tech tree offers direct or predictable outcomes. You need to mix both to advance.    A variety of playable characters, each with their own tech tree and style of playing and creating combos.    Campaign is funny and challenging. It took me 18h to finish, I failed a couple of scenarios while doing dumb stuff or getting the wrong characters to a task. I would buy another DLC campaign (or a second game) in a heartbeat.   Cons:    The campaign maps, even near the end, are too short, so unless you play a tech-oriented character, it's very hard to reach high tech levels and awesome tier 5-6 cards before the scenario ends.    Although understandable, the campaign do not force us to explore other characters. I finished the game using familiar characters because the AI will crush you if you play poorly and don't understand the character. After being destroyed twice playing new characters, I stuck with Laney, Giles and Marina for the rest of the campaign.    Too many versus scenarios. I'd wish we had more challenging solo maps, as they are quite easy compared to the versus maps.   Loved this game, would love to see DLC or a second one.",
