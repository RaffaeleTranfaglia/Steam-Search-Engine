            "review_text": "The Bug Butcher is an arcade style Shoot’Em Up that’s inspired on the classic game Super Pang. Instead of shooting boring balloons you shoot bugs. The game is a fast action game where your reflexes are important. You can go from left to right and always shoot upwards. The more you play the game the more coins you earn. With the coins you can upgrade your equipment and moves. The point of the game is getting a good high score. When you have all the upgrades with practice all the achievements are doable in Single-player.  + the game has nice graphics and good music and sound effects + after finishing it you can try higher difficulty and getting a high score on the Steam Leader   boards + it’s quite addictive, but a little short + it’s worth its full price of € 7,99  It’s a fun little game to pass some dull moments, once you start you’ll keep playing.  I recommend this game!",

The single player mode is based mainly on a campaign divided into missions whose plot and dialogues though simple and minimal are still funny and humorous and well suited to the aforementioned art style.  The package is completed by an arcade mode, even in this case single player, and the co-op offline however I haven't yet tested.  Controls are good.",

I say 'little' because while the content that is present is certainly fun, there is little complexity or depth. Leveling up weapons is fairly limited, and there are not a large variety of them, either. The music and artwork are pretty good, to boot.   Pros:  +The price-point is definately appropriate. Good replay value, even if there are not metric tons of levels and content. +Tight controls. Controller support is good. +Lots of fun to be had in local couch-coop. +Artwork and music are appropriate, and well done.   Cons:  -Could benefit from an increase in complexity and variety of weapons and levels.   Try the demo. You'll know right away if this is your thang or not. ",

            "review_text": "I was interested to see somebody give super buster bros. another shot. I have to say, this game's art and animation are very well done and in general it has a lot of polish. I was happy to see that it had co-op and played with a friend which was a major selling point for me.   I had about 30 minutes of fun in co-op but the fun dried up quickly. Mainly because I found the upgrade system to be not very well thought out. The choices are not very strategic since the weapons drop at random, and the more upgrades you buy the less you know what will drop. You cannot buy more then one shield (you should be able to but with increased cost) and some of the upgrades are confusing like the 'extra health'.   Also, why can't you play the normal levels 2 player? I really think that would have given the co-op a lot more staying power. Overall I say if you watch the trailer and it looks cool, go for it as long as you are not buying it for the co-op. It's a very nicely polished game and a lot of people haven't played buster bros, so it's good we have a solid example out there to cary the torch.",

            "review_text": "This is a positive review - but one thing should be made clear: this game doesn't have much in common with Super Pang (AKA Buster Brothers).  Super Pang is a precise platforming game where you methodically wore down bubbles while being careful and picking your moments. You tapped the fire key with a deliberate rhythym to hit just the thing you wanted, and because you normally could only have one shot on the screen you were defenseless for a while if you wasted a shot. You don't play Bug Butcher that way; you play Bug Butcher with the fire button held down, you shoot everything you can until there's nothing left, and you do it fast and loose and sometimes you take some damage (in Super Pang, you died in a single hit, which really changes the feel). Both games have bouncing things, but deep-down they're very different games.  But anyway, yeah, Bug Butcher is a good action shooter; sometimes it feels like sort of a 'bullet hell platformer' maybe? Great music, fun atmosphere, really satisfying powerups, and good variety of enemies and challenges. Solid game.",

If you don't like highscores, skip it. But if you do like it, you'll spend many hours trying to achieve that one combo score or trying to get higher in the world ranking. There's a bug (pun intended) in the localization, and some placeholder texts are still there. But these are minor flaws: it's about hectic gameplay, not about story. Nice start for this new indie team!",

            "review_text": "92 minutes. Is what it took me to 'beat' the game on easy. Got almost all upgrades, etc. So if you are looking for long term motivation, I doubt this is the game for you. If you just wanna have a good (short) time, or if you're a completionist and want to 3 star every level on the hardest difficulty, then just get it. It's cheap anyway and only developed by a few people.  Basically it's the evolution of space invaders, with interesting levels that make the game more challenging, as well as a variety of different enemies, which, combined, can really mess up your day.  You can only shoot up with your basic machine gun. Periodically the game will spawn power ups and weapon pick ups, like beam gun, lightning gun, health...you also gain a random power up after you've dealt enough carnage, like freeze all enemies, or become invulnerable, etc.  All of these can be upgraded in the 'campaign' mode. There's also an arcade mode, which seems like an 'endless shooter'? Dunno. You seem to be able to upgrade on the fly here.  Anyway, nice little indie game from mobile. Could use a bit more content though, imho. Maybe different characters, some more levels and modes, etc. However, I think it is way too expensive for what it offers. Got it during a 50% sale now and I dunno. There are games out there for 5 bucks which offer you a lot more. You need to decide.",

            "review_text": "What an amazing game. It relies on the good old PANG type of gameplay, but adding elements from games like Contra, Metal Slug... and weapon/extras leveling using the coins every enemy drops through the game. It also includes a nice kills combo system, for good measure.  The artstyle and controls are top notch, on the same level as indie hits like the Behemoth games, or multimillion productions from Ubisoft...  I particularly enjoyed the difficulty: the game lets you play it with ease, but keeps getting harder, to the point where you are playing a bullet hell title, but not to the point of frustration.  I hope this game gets the attention it deserves. There are too many games shilled everyday on youtube and blogs that look like a weekend hack job, or just a weird idea that spawns a thousand ripoffs.   this is the most solid indie title that i have seen in a long while.   looking forward for more from this guys, cheers 9/10",
