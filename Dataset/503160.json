The only thing I disliked was the VA; Iâ€™m sorry, but it was really bad. I understand that this is a free game, but the voices were so bad that I cannot overlook this. Also, sometimes the characters would say something and it was different from the text on the screen.  I liked the art style and concept, it caught my attention. With a bit more of work, this VN can turn into something interesting, regarding the story itself and gameplay.  5/10.",

The devs seem active and receptive to community feedback so I'm sure they will iron out the few bugs I encountered. Its free guys, give it a try.",

However there is no interaction at all from your part, other than making a choice in dialog from time to time which affects the outcome. The dialog is slow and transitions painfully at times. This experience would work best if it integrated some action, for example, let me fly as an angel or game type action sequences where appropriate. This really does not take advantage of the Vive's potential.",

            "review_text": "I think the concept is good. The voice acting was professional but the pause in between was way too long. If the developers would fix this it would flow much better. The story so far is decent but not something that grabbed me. This is all just my opinion so don't overlook this one just because of my review. Give it a try. After all its free.  I originally gave this game a thumbs down because of the things I mentioned. However after thinking this over I decided to change it to a thumbs up. I am doing this because I feel that this is a genre of VR gaming that I would like to see more of. If the developers are open to community suggestions, which they seem to be, I think this could turn out to be something of interest.",
