My grandmother suffers from Alzheimer, and learning how the MC of this game sees and remembers the world around him… It’s painful in a way. A quite accurate description of this terrible illness.  ∞/10, would cry again. I’m really enjoying all the works from these developers, I hope to see more works from them soon.",

Anyways i won't talk too much about it because you just need to read it. its also cheap to match the length. anyways we all know how Dementia can destroy lives. it really sucks. anyone who has been around it because of family, friends, or even work knows what this can do a person. so you can relate to this novel.",

            "review_text": "Took me about 40 minutes to read (with a little break), so be aware it is a quick experience. This is a kinetic novel, so there are no choices or inputs of any kind. This works well especially with the theme, dementia and aging, as in a way, the reader feels similarly unable to control what is happening.   As for the story itself, I found it to be compelling. It is both sad and hopeful at the same time. The focus isn't so much on what is happening, but how the protagonist experiences it. The lines between memory, dream, and reality get intentionally blurry.  The visuals and audio were simple, but appropriately expressive.  Overall, I'd recommend the experience. It got a tear or two out of me, and got me to go hug my parents afterward, so it definitely affected me.",
