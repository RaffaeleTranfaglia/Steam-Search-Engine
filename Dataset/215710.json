            "review_text": "A semi-open enenmy pathing mechanic makes this game exceptional. Similar to how sanctum works, the enemy path is created by you as you maze your towers as effectively as possible. Enemy re-pathing isn't always consistent and can lead to difficulty disigning mazes at harder levels that limit your design by introducing new level mechanics or obstacles. Good fun overall and recommended for any casual td player.",

This is originally an iOS game, but it's a great little game to play at your desk too. The PC version has commentary, like you'd find on a DVD, on each map after you've beat it once, The art style is fun and there are some interesting map designs and Tower effects that make for good old fasion fun. Easy to play to just sit and knock out 15 minutes only to realize 2 hours shot by.",

So much extra stuff to do, and choosing your own towers most of the maps is great! Once you complete the goals on the wave maps, you can then continue on Endless mode for mass cash which you use to buy power ups which you use to complete missions. Awesome full circle playability.",

The problem is ive nearly 3 star every map and I still have alot of towers to unluck yet i fear within the next 5 or so hours play time i will have completed it, without much reason to return. The good side is that its a really good TD game, Ive enjoyed every frustrating minute! Just wish there was more.  Played on the pc version only. ",
