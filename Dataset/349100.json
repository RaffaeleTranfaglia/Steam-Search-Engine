    "description": "You have crash-landed on Notrium. Your food supplies are running low, and a pack of predatory aliens have your scent. You're out of bullets for your pistol, your only weapon a handful of rocks. A freezing night is setting in, and you are desperately looking for firewood. Can you survive?",

            "review_text": "Notrium is a game I played extensively 12 years ago. I played it for hours as a kid because it was quick fun, had exploration and crafting and a vibrant community with extensive mod support. I taught me the basics of modding which later got me interested in programing.   The game is still as fun as I remember, but the community is quite gone -- which is where Steam comes in. I can only imagine what kind of mods steam users would make. Until then the base game and original mods will keep you busy!",

I definitely recommend playing it, dont look up anything and just let the world of Notrium suck you in :) theres hundreds of things to do and to explore, loads of items to find, create, combine and improve! If you like the concept of levelling up, download the expansion mod 'werivar' which adds even more stuff. Great game!",

            "review_text": "'You accidentally step on a red plant, its fluids splashing on your leg. Suddenly you see an old wound on your leg heal rapidly!'  man, this game still have its charm, if you like survival games this one might be old and doesn’t have some conventions of new survival games (including standard control, the first thing I believe that will kill you if you never played old games before), but its damn good, the theme is great, the choices and discovery is simply a joy, has lovely dialog and the playable characters are so diverse that you will feel like playing a different game foe each one of them, even though it is the same generated maps, the game has several surprises, different endings, and an interesting items diversity that will keep you guessing which one could be combined with which, the game will give you some hints but most items have different combinations, heck, just everytime you have tons of items go through them, but remember to save first XD  and yes, this game has kinda fixed maps and sometimes u will get some of those fix maps sometimes not, and each map has certain items in it, I mean if you want sand and you didn’t get a desert map, well good luck in finding some. and it is not that huge world, but the experience itself is huge, thanks for items diversity and different endings it doesn’t feel as random luck or the experience is lacking, instead it feels it gives you a good space to be creative and try new things everytime. The game is a bit hard, based on your style and which character you picked. For human I.e it is not easy to go out in the dark with extreme cold at the night or extreme hot at desert area without preparations, sometimes your death will be swift if you start without finding good supply and wondered in wrong maps without knowing! Sometimes you will venture long till you discover your character is starving and die with hunger, but in general the game because easier with each run, u discover how to use things in better ways, what expected from each map u visited, and what's ur character weakness and strength, all in the hard way.  as you can expected, i played the game when it was like version 1.2 or something and followed it till the dev. decided to focus more on his space starship game, he had like 3 models without textures at that time, so hopefully there is something new in this version, if it is small and insignificant i would still looking forward to see it. (edit: I found a weird thing that seems doesn’t belong to the theme, wonder if this is the secrete, but it was fun)  What only worries me in this game … why is it sold for 2 dollars? People might get confused and think it is a bad quality games, I enjoyed playing this game more than a lot of games that I bought for 10-25$",
