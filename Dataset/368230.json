            "review_text": "So, after over 40 hours spent playing the game I felt it's time to finally write a review.  First of all, I really enjoy this game tremendously, but I'd say it's not for everyone. If you read other reviews, you probably have a good idea what the good part of the game is, nice art, awesome soundtrack (first time I ever bought a game OST, and not regretting it one bit). These are the two things I think everyone can agree about.  Then it gets more tricky. The gameplay isn't for everyone. It's literally discover everything for yourself. including how your own guys behave, even how your own horse behaves. The real problem can come from when you don't figure some things out (like how to keep your horse running or how to make your dudes not suicide themselves constantly) and then give up thinking the devs didn't think of that and write review claiming the game is unfinished or lacking.  On the other hand, simply reading a guide after 5 hours of play, is basically ruining the discovery experience, so in my opinion if you want to enjoy the game try to not look up too many things (or maybe just ask a simple singe question in the forums instead).  Now, that being said, another big deterrent can be the lack of endgame content. (It needs to be said though, that the devs are working on adding more stuff (for free), so that might not be true anyore in a few months.) For me, it took me over 10 hours to beat the game the first time I think, and after that, there where achievements for doing it quick and for enduring long. The speedrunning aspect I really liked, but the endurance aspect (trying to survive as long as you can) is really lacking atm. Once you're set up there's not much to do for 30-50 days, cause you're defenses are just that good. So if you really enjoy building up a large empire and surviving a long time, this game is in it's current stage definitely not for you (imo). Me personally, I really enjoy the speedrunning aspect of the game, so trying over and over to finish the game quicker and quicker is really fun for me and is mostly what kept me going for the last 25 hours or so. (Especially since people keep getting quicker and quicker :D) It also means that one has to learn more and more details about the game mechanics, which I really like too. I've played over 40 hours and still learn new stuff.  But even without doing speedruns, I think the game offers enough content to be worth the money, unless you basically spoiler yourself with guides before you even start (at which point it's getting a bit boring and mechanical, as the normal playthrough isn't that dificult once you understand most mechanics). A big fun aspect of the game is losing horribly a lot and then learning more and more how stuff works and then at some point you just easily beat it using all your hard gained knowledge and it feels really good. But if you just look up everything, that sense of achievement will never happen and the game will probably feel a bit bland.  Two last negative points I want to mention, one is a bug the other a framerate problem. There is still a bug that can break the game a little. Like it can happen that you win, but you don't get the victory and all your dudes stop working. If you don't know that this is a bug it can get quite frustrating. The first time I actually beat the game this happened and I didn't realize it was not supposed to happen, so I spent another 20 days trying to figure out how to win until someone in the forums exaplined to me that this is a bug. (If that happens to you, just exit and start again, and it should put you before the bug happens and you should be fine from there on). The framerate issues 'luckily' only happen later on (say day 60 and upwards and usually only during blood moon nights where a lot of monsters appear), so if there wasn't an achievement for surviving 100 days most people would probably never experience it. But there is. And they do. Regardless of how good your computer rig is it seems.  I want to end with saying I had a quite magical time with this game. I bought it right when it came out and a lot of people were streaming it at that point. Since there weren't any guides available at this time it created a very unqie atmosphere, where I would hop from stream to stream watching a bit, seeing what others might have figured out that I haven't, sharing some small tips here and there myself. It really reminded me of the earlier days of gaming, when you couldn't just look up everything online but went to friends places shared and small discoveries with each others. That's something I haven't experienced in over a decade and I probably won't in quite a while. So I just want to end by shouting a big 'thank you' to the devs for creating this marvelous experience with their game and I stay curious to see where they take it from here.  TL;DR : If you enjoy being a scientist, testing stuff, doing things to see what happens, learn from that, be willing to accept to fail a few times until you get it right, enjoy atmospheric pixel art and great soundtrack the this game might really be for you. If you want to expand and grow an empire and survive a long time, don't enjoy to figure stuff and gameplay mechanics out for yourself, then you might give this game a pass (at least for now). There is more content coming, so maybe come back in 6 months and see how the game has developed by reading the latest news and content updates and see what people have to say then.  Anyway, hope this review helped give a good voerview about the good and bad aspects of the game. Please thumbs up if you find it helpful as well, so others can benefit from the reivew too :)",

            "review_text": "Great game, really interesting spin on tower defense, as everyone has already said the visuals and sound design are excellent, and I could imagine myself playing this game over and over but its just so incredibly frustrating and not in a good super meat boy way, in a more 'i hate this AI, what are you doing? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!' sort of way. I played the game til just past day 40 and then just got fed up when my whole army was stolen by flying venus flytraps for the 4th time, this was my 4th run through, I always had more money than I could spend (which should never be possible in this sort of game, every coin tips the balance my ♥♥♥), I had about 70 archers at my peek but that didn't stop them all from being picked up and killed and missing all the time or even better firing arrows into walls, I had fun with the game but don't pay £6.99 for it until they fix it. Great potential but isn't there yet, really never thought I would be giving this game a bad review but I can't give it a good one because it got to a point were it was greatly disappointing and I can honestly say I regret buying it.  complaints:  1. farmers are miserable idiots. 2. catapults get 1 shot per night and thats it. 3. everything and everyone is too slow, except the enemies obviously they are ridiculously fast. 4. the random map generation makes some games impossible.  here are my complaints explained:  1. I learnt the hard way that farmers at night go to the base initially UNTIL you build a mill and they will then stand there and all die destroying your cash flow completely since they cost so much, easily avoidable but a stupid thing to have in the game in the first place, completely ruined my first 20+ day game.  2. Builders don't stay with catapults, I don't understand why they don't just equip themselves to them in the same way archers attach themselves to watchtowers, I really think the game would be possible if this was a feature but as it stands it just gets impossible round day 40+ because every bloodmoon there are loads of flying enemy units that just eat all your guys, and they dont just eat 1, they eat multiple units and the only way to get them back is to kill them, i got lucky once and a catapult managed to kill 4 at once and i got my men back, but this is so rare and they are so brutal because those are men you have spent the whole game collecting you can never make up your numbers again and you will lose its just a matter of time.  3. All the units are too slow, just far too slow, your horse is ok when it has stamina but that stamina quickly runs out, but the other units are just painful, AI units should be able to at least run away from enemies from behind one wall about to break to another because atm you have loads of walls, loads of towers but after the edge ones go down it doesn't matter because the only way your going to win that fight is when the enemies have all they can carry. Then you have to hope you have enough coins to re-recruit your army before they all leave.  4. Everything about the random map generation is a pain in the neck because you can end up having only 1 shrine, camps that are ridiculously far away, rivers that are far to far away from your main camp, long stretches without walls, long stretches without towers, its like the programming is just a bit off, it would make sense to me that towers should have walls within a certain amount of units but at the moment it seems completely random. and theres some games it would just be worth giving up at the start because you won't be able to win and you will find out too late.",

At first, I was really enjoying this game, I enjoyed learning some of its foibles, failing, then starting over and doing a bit better every playthrough.  The game (purposefully?) does not really properly explain its mechanics beyond a very rudimentary tutorial, and you can find yourself in a position where you really can't win. That's not too bad though, as the game is designed around multiple paythroughs, and failing and starting again using what you've learned can be fun.  Unfortunately, however, the game suffers from a number of game-breaking bugs, which makes it impossible to recommend, despite my early enjoyment. Random crashes, switches to desktop, sound not turning on, AI and pathing issues of both friendly and enemy units, and, worst of all for me, the game failing to recognize I had beaten it, after a grueling session. I may return to this Kingdom at a later date, but, for now, I recommend you wait until this one has had more time in the oven.",

            "review_text": "You can enjoy it for a maximum of 3 hours. And that's stretching it, most people would lose interest after 2 hours and some after 1 hour. So lets say you get 2 hours of enjoyment out of this, is that worth 10 Euro? For me it's not, I compare it to a dinner out with my family at a simple restaurant and I enjoy that more than this. ( And I'm a huge beta nerd playing vidyas all day )  The late game is abyssmal, huge kingdoms that you can spend an entire day running through and there's nothing in them to see, it's all barren as you cut the forests down so no wildlife either. ( And wasting an entire day of just running through your kingdom is horrible as you have ♥♥♥♥ to do before night comes ). As others have said AI is abyssmal, and you need a ton of recruits but the problem is that recruiting people is a finite resource, and to expand your kingdom you have to destroy these camps where you can recruit people.  In huge kingdoms you gain so much gold your pouch can't hold it, and if you try to pick up too much gold the king or queen will throw the coins into the river, so picking up too much money makes you destroy money. In bigger kingdoms you try to avoid picking up money so you won't destroy it.  It's an interesting concept, with beautiful pixel art, but horribly executed. It's a good looking front with nothing in the back.  As you can see I got 7.3 hours in this game, I lost my enjoyment after perhaps 2 hours into the game, after that I simply tried to finish the game, I kept expanding, I tried stuff to see if there was anything I had missed to do to continue to progress my kingdom. But no, that was actually the end, I had done everything I could do except finishing the game. No matter how large I made my kingdom I could not make any more improvements. And improving your kingdom is basically what made the game fun. After 2 hours, I had done everything in the game. The rest of the time was wasted, I was simply confused as I couldn't believe I had already done everything.  I might play this again, to try to finish it, see what the end holds as the developers have been very secretive about it but I won't have any hopes that it will be good from what I've seen of the late game to be like. The worst would be if you win when you have expanded to the end of the world ( a bridge that you can't walk on ) if it's anything like that I will come back and edit this review.",

It has all the ingredients for a great game, but it has too many issues that are game breaking.  The good: the art is amazing and the animations are really impressive. The controls are simple and the gameplay is very intuitive and fun.   The bad: it has game breaking bugs (not crashes, but bugs) and performance issues.   The worst bug I've seen so far are shields not working properly. You need shields to assign knights that can attack portals. For some reasons the shields get stuck up high and no one picks them up, thus it's too hard to attack the portals directly.   The performance is really bad when nearing the game's end. When a giant throws a rock and a bunch of arches drop their bows the game gets stuck for several seconds, even a minute can pass where the game is stuck like that.  A gameplay annoyance is that your kingdom gets too big for you. When a red night comes and you are on one side of the map and need to travel to the other it takes forever! That's kind of ok, that means you need to prepare better, but there's no way to tell which side the horde will come (not that I'm aware of), just that the sun looks red before a red moon. And then you gallop from one end to the other and everyone is throwing money at you and it gets laggy and annoying.  The game is too short as well, but I hope the developer fixes this by adding more content over time (I really hope that's the case, but they are in no obligation to do this).  All in all, I really enjoyed the game, but I can't recommend it until these issues are fixed, specially performances and bugs.",

In the hour I played, I enjoyed it a lot and lasted a lot longer than I thought I would for my first time. It all ended with flying monsters that grabbed my villagers and took them away. Anyways, the reason why I said maybe I wouldn't recommend it right now is because of the following reasons:  -It's buggy. At some point it wouldn't let me get rid of trees. The trees just wouldn't take mah money. So then my farmers were left unprotected and I lost both of them. If you can't clear out land, you can't expand. Now this was an isolated problem, it only happened once and hasn't happened since. -The AI is weird. The farmers didn't go inside town at night for protection. Therefore, expensive farmers were dead. -The way the camera moves. They need to make that smoother. I don't get motion sick, so it doesn't bother me very much at all. However, it was annoying still.  Someone mentioned in their negative review that the game was difficult. I didn't find it very difficult at all, and I wouldn't consider myself a 'hardcore gamer' or anything. I'd say this game is a 'challenge' type of game. Take it for it is. It's an unforgiving game, you make a mistake, you're probably going to end up paying for it down the line. With that said, I still believe this is casual gamer friendly.  Edit: -My second time playing the game, there was this invisible wall, it wouldn't let me explore much on either side, so I got stuck with little to no villagers. I restarted and it happened again. Restarted and it hasn't happened since. So, it seems like the game is buggy but only sometimes.",

As the game says, Nothing Last, and that is a very good mindset for the game. As you build walls, towers, soldiers, and more; all can be swept away in one night if your unlucky. Yet even losing a single wall can affect the next day, as you try to rebuild and fortify that position. I've started 3 seperate attempts, each one making further than the last. You'll likely lose the first time you play, but everything you learn helps you hit the ground running the next playthrough.  I highly recommend this game, even if it's not on sale.

            "review_text": "TL:DR  The game is… worth 10 dollars, but ultimately tries to be more, and fails on delivering a satisfying experience at either the 10 dollar price point or above. There was some satisfying early game, dull mid game and downright tedious end game pre-patch. Post patch is nearly identical, except the end game has been completely broken.  Complete Review (possible spoilers)  Couple of things to get out of the way. Just because you put RNG (or RMG as one review called it) or whatever you want to call it in the game, does not mean it adds anything. If RNG is not adding replay to the game, then why is it there? What’s random and how does the RNG impact your gameplay: - There are 2 shrines which buff your towers/walls or archers. They can either be close to you, or behind gates. Generally if they are both behind gates you might as well restart your map. If one is behind gates you can work to free it before killing gates becomes a lost cause. This adds no replay and in fact ruins some starts causing the RNG to essentially ruin a gameplay without adding anything quirky or fun. - 1 upgrade building, which really doesn’t matter where it spawns. Just run to it quick and you will never need it again. Doesn’t matter if it is far or close, as long as you get it out of the way quick. No replay here either. - Wall and tower placement, fields with rabbits, peasant camps and mill spots. These add some variety to layout, but largely will never impact your gameplay what-so-ever. They seem to be less random as well, in that your start is pretty set with tower/wall after your initial castle area. Peasant camps seem to be more accessible on the east, less on the west (adding to an already tedious ride across the kingdom mechanic). - Maybe some chests… which offer a minor boost in the form of gold and aren’t worth going out of your way for. Most I have seen is 1 on either side, sometimes so far past gates you really could care less about them.  None of these being random adds to the excitement of a future play. Rogue, Dwarf Fortress and other well done RNGs get narrative out of adding in random elements because they have deep gameplay. This game is so simple it just feels like getting a 2 when you needed a 4 to hit on a D6. Arbitrary and characterless.  Gameplay is nice at first. Unlike many reviews, I found not knowing what I was doing to start refreshing, and avoided looking up let’s plays and “how to” guides. I felt, pre- the first patch, that the gameplay was right on early game. There were things to do while your kingdom was small (recruit peasants and herd deer towards your archers), and later you could run around upgrading, finding merchants and setting up an economy of farmers.  Once your kingdom starts to grow, however, some interesting mechanics start to fight against you. If you fully upgrade the castle your taxes get nerfed (mitigatable by having a healthy economy, but really adds nothing). Expanding, especially to the east, can remove your source of peasants (again, mitigatable, but really not enjoyable). Expanding your kingdom large enough and it takes nearly a day to get across the whole thing, which is brutally tedious.  Knights are far too few and attack parties far too weak post day 40 pre-patch. You can destroy gates, but it requires a strange mechanic of tanking for your attack parties and throwing wave after wave at the gates. Peasants move so slowly back to your castle to get equipped, that you can really only attack once every 5 days, which added to the tedium. Post patch you will never have this much time, so you will simply lose if you haven’t killed off 3/4ths of the gates early enough. Also clearing a side doesn’t mean that side is safe (though it may post patch)  Pre-patch, the game felt manageable in the long term, but boring and tedious. Post patch you just get frustratingly eaten away with no re-course, as every night spawns way to many, what I will call wraiths and trolls, killing off your peasants and chewing up buildings faster than your peasants can actually walk to construct them.  The patch dropped mid-game for me, and totally destroyed my longest run. I had one half of the map cleared, but can now do nothing to stop the waves of wraiths and trolls that come every night. Pre-patch I felt I could probably win if I stuck to the boring tedious mechanic of attacking once every 5 days, now I am just waiting to lose. The game hints that you need to win quicker with its achievements for wins within 25-40 days. But now the surviving to day 100 seems impossible (where before the others did). Prior to writing this no one has those achievements according to the global stats. Now with the increase in cost to attack, I think both are going to be nearly impossible.  The patch is an extremely confusing answer to the criticism they have got so far. Ultimately, the game is a nice little diversion, but not a satisfying experience in full.",

A very good game, albiet simple, extremely engaging, purchased it 24 hours ago and ive already played it ten of those! although very minimalistic and simplified, it feels almost lacking in some things, a head count for one would be useful, also some more control over your people would be helpful to say the least. maybe having a different command and build structure for male and female? maybe different building opportunities?  Good points. soundtrack not too intrusive, yet ambient.  graphics although pixelated for an asthetic appeal, nothing is lost.  enemies are ghostly and genuinely worry you when you sight them.  i like the lack of weapons for the main character but the character need much more control over his/her people.  Bad points. enemies ramp up their strength and numbers sporadically it seems, going from easily defeated grunts to thousand strong behemothes and flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s all of a sudden and then back to a few grunts. a little unbalanced is all im saying.

You start out on a horse you ride until you find your camp, you get money and pay ♥♥♥♥♥es to work for you. They build up your kingdom and defend it. Thats the game right there. You have no wave bosses, you have no end goal than to just survive. Which can be great but after a while it just gets really boring doing the same thing over and over.   Additionally you can have fun with this game, but as I said before as it currently is you will have spent what 10 bucks for this game and at the very least become bored with it in a couple hours. Never really getting your money worth.  I might change this review if they add a few things but right now it seems like the game took about a week to make. It has no content.  There are a few things in game that could be added that might change my review.   - A menu that lets you see where you have progressed as far as the ages go in what you can build. - Would have been nice to be able to see an expanded view of your Kingdom so that you can see whats going on everywhere like maybe a minimap or a normal map.  - Would be great if you had objectives to complete each day that earned you a small amount of gold. - Would be great if new players knew the overall goal of the game. For example like the portals can be destroyed.",

I have allways looked for a game where you build a empire or a kingdom i tried AoE 2, Timber and Stone, Civ 5, Rise of nations etc. but it was not what i was looking for. This is the game i was looking for, when i first saw a video of this my mind was blown. I wish you the best of luck and are really looking towards seeing the game grow.   Here are some tips for the devs: Make you so your horse dont run out of stamina when your inside your walls. Add more shops/jobs (this is what i want the most becuase we only have four diffrent jobs your peasents can do and if you add like 3 shop it would add 5 hours more gameplay) Cancel buildings Make so your guys know when they should fall back or add a recall button Make a counter so you could see how many guys you have (when you have a big kingdom you cant watch both sides at the same time it would be great if you could see how many guys you had becuase sometimes i see that one of my guys loost his tool and i dont know what he was) Add more things in the forest (would be fun with some exploration) More monkey demons please!  And for all the pepole that voting down becuase it misses stuff, IT HAS BEEN ONE UPDATE they will add more stuff but they are not a big team chill out and wait to review if you belive this game is ♥♥♥♥ it will get better =D /Uran1um",

            "review_text": "Kingdom is a 2D side scrolling RPG/Base builder/Resource manager game where you start with a simple camp fire and 2 peasants who you soon arm with a bow and a hammer so they can start building up your base/town and defend the peasants you bring in later on.  Your archers are also hunters by day and bring in even more gold.  By day you can go around and explore the woods to the left and right while at night it's best to stay inside your walls and wait for the early morning or at least the end of the enemy attacks.  I found it most effective to start slow and just build up your force slowly and expanding when you have enough gold to upgrade the new towers and walls as soon as you build them. Another good investment are the archery and builder shrines that you find in the woods while exploring. The archer shrine costs 5 gold to get the buff, while the builder shrine costs 6 gold. The archer shrine as the name says buffs your archers so they have increased accuracy and damage, while the builder shrine buffs your workers who in turn reinforce all existing walls as long as the buff lasts. The buffs last for 1 day and can be re-aplied or extended if you have enough gold.  All in all a solid game and easy worth the asking price.",

The artwork and graphics are pretty and it's enjoyable to build up your own little settlement from scratch.  However, it has to be noted that while all of the above is great the game does not swing well for the player. You have no control of the AI. Sure, you can make them tools and in turn they will pick them up, but other than that you've got no way to control them and tell them where to go. The AI will however balance itself between both sides of your camp so you do not end up with all your resources at one side, which is helpful.  Furthermore, the attacking AI is very overpowered and has little remorse for it's actions! Day 4 and you've got a red moon? Well, I do feel sorry for you because the defences you would have been able to build on this day will be weak and they will break through, steal your items and then probably want your crown too! Your town AI is useless and can't aim where they're shooting so if you have a big invasion your only option is to kite the AI around your archer towers and hope for the best.  The AI needs work, that is easily said, but I think for filler game like this, the enjoyment is still there.  TL;DR - It's fun and pretty, but don't smash your computer because of the AI!",

There are a few things I wish were a bit different though.  1) I wish there was a gamemode where dying didn't mean needing to restart. You would respawn and maybe lose part or all of your gold. This would make it easier for first-time players to understand the gameplay concepts without such harsh punishments.  2) More customability in your kingdom. While the maps are procedurally generated, there are set places for walls, guard towers, etc. The ability to place an object anywhere you want might detract from the simplicity of the controls, but I'd love to see it as an option in the settings.  3) A tutorial would be really nice. I've had to read through the few guides currently on the Community Hub to understand a lot of what's going on (e.g. the function of Knights and how to establish stone walls). This is another feature that could be turned on/off from the settings.  Other than these three items, the game is pretty much perfect. It's a lot of fun with tons of replayability.

            "review_text": "Kingdom is a somewhat complex strategy game wherein your main goal is to build, well, a kingdom. You begin the game with no knowledge of how to play, and a brief tutorial fills you in on the starting basics; such as how to light your campfire, recruit beggars, and turn those beggars into builders and archers. In fact, Kingdom is really just a newer, harder version of Lemmings with hoards of enemies that will come for you in the night. Every fifth night, a flock of foes will overrun your quaint campsite, tear down your walls, pick up your people and fly off with them, and leave you in ruins. Yes, as the tagline suggests... nothing lasts indeed.  After picking your desired horse/gender/clothing color all in one go on the very first screen, and having the brief tutorial, the game thrusts you into its realm with no further knowledge of how to get by. It's trial and error from here on out, but it really doesn't take too much to figure it out. You build walls and archer outposts to keep the monsters out, gather hoards of beggars that you then turn into archers to kill said enemies, and then upgrade your walls and base camp; which, by the way, ends up becoming your castle. The trick here is that it costs gold coins to do all of these things, and at the beginning gold can be hard to come by. During the day, archers will hunt rabbits and deer, if you run out of rabbits you will then need to herd deer closer to your camp; this is much easier said than done, as they run much faster than you and you can only turn them around if you happen to get in front of them, even then they'll run back most of the time.  As you expand your kingdom, you will be able to recruit two more classes; the farmer, who will provide you with abundances of gold, and knights that will march toward the enemy gates at your command. Once these classes are unlocked, Kingdom basically becomes easy mode so long as you keep a plethora of archers around. There are four enemy gates, two on either side of your camp, that must be destroyed. Once every gate is destroyed, and every monster that has spawned from them is slain, you will have won the game. Beware, for if a monster attacks you directly, you will lose gold; when you run all out of gold, they will knock your crown off, take it, and it's game over.  The pixel artwork is beautiful, and the landscape has a variety of randomized weather throughout each day and night cycle; rain, heavy fog, bright sun, and sometimes a combination thereof. The atmosphere brought on by these sudden changes truly adds a depth of mystery to Kingdom, and the folk inspired soundtrack is the polish that adds a shine to the game overall. However, the title is not without its flaws and it comes as no surprise to me that the game is made in Unity; though it is 5 and not the personal edition, thankfully. If you have enough beggars/farmers/knights/archers/builders in your community, the framerate starts dipping ever lower. My FPS was 60 (the cap) for the large part of my play time, but once I neared the end and had a huge gathering of commoners in my community, my FPS dipped into the low 40s and hung there consistently; especially when adding any dropped gold or incoming monsters into the mix. This is simply unacceptable for a pixel based game that really doesn't have any complexity to it in terms of mechanics, ambiance, or graphics.  Unfortunately, I just cannot bring myself to recommend Kingdom; even for the small on-sale price of $5.49 CAD I feel rather ripped off. The area that you have to expand within the game is limited and small, and once you get the gist of how to manage your resources and faux-Lemmings, the game is incredibly easy. The trailers made the game seem a great deal larger, there are also a very small number of different enemies, nearly every beggar looks identical, and most of the walls/archer outposts look the same even after you've upgraded your castle. Kingdom is a game that has fell victim to over-hype, it's okay... but not nearly as godly as other gamers make it out to be.   Rating:  2.5/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",

It's certainly a very charming game. I was addicted within 15 minutes of playthrough since strategy and tower defense games are a weakness of mine.  However, there were many problems that came about in just as short amount of time after.  I thought at first it to be a strategy game, but with 6 total playthroughs, I found it to be entirely dependant upon the RNG whether or not you will have a successful run. I do not like luck games that pretend to be strategy based.  I had to completely reset 2 my playthroughs after being able to have a walk around and discover the stream, walls, platforms, and statue placements were less than ideal. Even my final playthrough that landed success was absolutely horrendous in layout. There were areas of nothing but wide open field with no platforms or streams for farms, which irritated me and my urge to make full use of the land. Even if I had to pay double to make a wall or a platform in an area the RNG didn't desegnate it to be, I would have been far more content with that.  The AI is infuriating. When there was but one objective left, I found that the majority of my army was on the empty side of the map, doing absolutely nothing even in he event of a Blood Moon. With only 3 neutrality camps left to recruit from, I found filling the side that mattered to be nearly impossible. Like the RNG, I ended up winning the campaign entirely by taking a gamble and getting lucky.  I feel no satisfaction in my victory run.  It's probably a little late to make some changes, but if there could be the possibility in the future:  --RNG is fine to a point. The statues being between or even behind the portals is ridiculous though. Have these in more specifically designated spots closer to the center. --Allow for building of walls and platforms and even digging streams for a price. Being able to fill that bland, empty area at double the price is far more satisfying than 2 acres of grass. --Nerf the giant. Or at least the spawn rate. Most of my playthroughs ended in failure not because I hadn't a sizable army, nor walls to spare, but because the Blood Moon decided it would be a grand idea to spawn four of those boogers out at once on just one side of my kingdom. --Allow for the army to be assigned specific walls to protect. Having your troops all in one area is the very definition of terrible strategy. Having platforms and towers can only do so much when you're being invaded by flying monsters and giants and your entire footsoldier wave has been devoured. Perhaps find a way to where a certain percentage of your troops will be at the outer walls, and any excess will protect the inner walls. --Allow for the kingdom's inhabitants to change career. Specifically, the farmer. Too often the merchant ended up giving me more scythes than I ever needed and I've ended with over a dozen farmers just walking in circles with no job. Unlike Carpenters, there's no need to have extra farmers.  And this more of a nitpick on my expectations--I actually thought the game would be a little bit longer considering the amount of land there is to potentially claim.  It IS still a fun game. Just... frustrating in the parts that could definitely be better. I'll look for it when it's on sale.",

The game has a great concept and I love the style of the game entirely but it needs some work. Like for example add in spear soldiers. Add in better ways of getting money. Make it so I can upgrade my bag size so i can hold more money because I found myself at one point having too much money.. never thought i'd be able to say that. Make it so villagers can fish. Maybe make it so we can mark a point for the hunters to go out to and not venture too far out so when the night comes they don't make it back and I have no control over it and I get screwed on hunters. Make walls and towers better or give us better bowmen by upgrading the soldiers. Give the villages 3-5 people so we can have bigger 'Kingdoms'. Finally make it so we can upgrade things farther or give us different siege weapons because at this point I feel that blood moon waves are seriously OP for the enemies... If most of that could be done then this game would be 10/10 to me but right now it would be 5/10",

Gameplay was exactly the same 45 minutes in as it was 5 minutes in, I mean *exactly*. Because you can't directly (or even indirectly in the case of archers) command any units, you'll simply spend most of the time running back and forth checking to see if anyone drops money for you to use. When you include the fact that your horse can only run so long, and this amount is not shown anywhere, gameplay becomes repetitive very quickly.  -AI is incredibly bad. I'm not sure why some other reviews say this 'adds to the game.' Artificially increasing difficulty is not a good thing. Expect to spend a good amount of time watching your archers move to one side and shoot your own defenses as the rest of your land is overrun. Maybe if your archers could shoot through your own defenses or at least fire faster this wouldn't be such a big problem, but ultimately it feels like surviving or dying is out of your control entirely.",

            "review_text": "In this game, you're the King or the Queen. Your job is to gather gold and pay for the constructions and recruits. That's basically it. You need recruits to have builders, archers, farmers and knights. You need builders to build walls, catapults, farms and portals. You need archers to defend your walls and hunt which gives you gold. Knights will help you defend your otter walls and if you pay them, they'll attack the gates from which your ennemis spawn from. Finally, you need farmers to get more gold to build and upgrade everything everything.   You need these 3 things:   - You need to find the building upgrades to build your walls, towers to level 3 and 4, and to upgrade your town so you can have knights. - You need to find the archer statue: It costs 5 gold if you want your archers not to shoot like they're blind in one eye and have cataract in the other. You can spend up to 15 gold if you want that buff to last for 3 days. - You need to find the builder statue to make your walls stronger against enemies attack. It costs 6 gold per day for up to 3 days.  Once you found the 2 statues, your job is to keep on recruiting people to replace those who got their ♥♥♥ kicked, run after those who gor their ♥♥♥ kicked to recruit them back before you lose them, pay for their hammers, bows, scicle or shield, depend on what you want them to do and run from a statue to another to get your buffs. By then, you'll have so much gold that it's going to fall out of your purse. It's either going to fall on the ground or in the water.  Doesn't sound fun anymore? Wait! There's more!   - You can't choose where you send anyone.  - Your troops go where ever the hell they want.  - You can have 5 archers protecting one side of your city while no one is watching the other side.  - If you build a catapult, it takes up to 2 builders to move it around and to reset it after a shot. Once it's in place, it stays there even if the outter wall is destroyed. The catapult will move to the farthest wall from the town center, so if your outter wall is level 1 it's going to move there whether you like it or not even if you have a wall level closer to your town center. Once your builders are around the catapult, sometimes, they'll help you build something, sometimes they won't. - If you build a tower for your archers, the archers will stay there until something pushes them out of the tower. They will also stop hunting rabbits and they won't go towards the outter wall to the other towers.  - Sometimes, builders and hunters will go outside the outter wall and stay there until you have a wave of monsters instead of getting behind a wall. Then they get killed...  There is something positive about this game. If you feel like playing a game and you're braindead and all you have on your smashed keyboard is the the left, right and down arrow, this game is for you.",

You will lose your first game, and your second game and your fifth game and so forth until you finally stumble upon the one way the game can be played. There is very little gameplay to it; run left, build things, run right, build things, wait until you have enough money to do it again. Some of your decisions are meaningful, most of them are not.

As you expand your city, you will spend more and more time running from one side of it to the other. Your coin pouch doesn't expand which means that you'll have to keep running back and forth from the front line constructions to your farmers to collect and spend coins.   There is also no variety or strategy in building placement and unit types. There are 4 types of units: Builders, Farmers, Archers, and Knights (you can only have 4 Knights at most). There are 3 types of buildings that you can place in predetermined locations: Walls, Towers, and Farms. The buildings all have linear upgrades.   The only character you can control is yourself. It would be nice to be able to instantly swap from one side of the map to the other. Perhaps they could have added 'Commander' or 'Messenger' units to the game to help send orders and collect money without needing to walk and do everything in person.   A king needs to be able to delegate tasks. As the kingdom expands, more tasks need to be delegated.

You see, to be able to win, you have to destroy four portals, two in each direction, and to do that, you have to send out knights with archers.   You can only do this during the day, though, as they need to be standing by the standard outside your outer walls for you to send them out. They only LEAVE the walls after the bells that anounce the day has rung, and there's some type of bug where those bells sometimes don't ring until it's ♥♥♥♥ing midday!   The reason it's so important to send them out as the sun goes up is that if you don't, you'll have to expand for them to reach the outer portal before the night attack arrives and woops the asses of your knights with pure numbers! As long as they start attacking the portal, you're golden, the enemies won't come until the portal explodes, upon which it floods out like some kind of tidal wave, even if it turns night or not.  I tried to do a speed run, got a GOLDEN start, wiped the asses of the portals to the left and the first to the right before the 15th day had passed, and then all hell broke loose. Each time it would turn day, the bellringer was taking a ♥♥♥♥ing nap or something, because the crackpots wouldn't ring until a few minutes into the day!! Considering that the day is like 5 min, that's quite alot. Each time I was able to, I sent out my knights, but as they're slower than a snail, they where barely getting close to the portal each time, before it turned night, and a wave of monsters or trolls I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care, came and wooped their ♥♥♥!!  This went on until day 30, where I rage quit, because day 30 was the day I beat it on the time when I didn't rush, and expanded all the ♥♥♥♥ing way to the portals!!  Also, once you defeat the game, there's no way of doing anything at all! The camera zips through the world, from your character, to the left- or rightmost camp, depending on which side you beat first, and then zips right back to you, whereupon it stops, with the controls inactive. The game seems to still be running, but you can't do anything but awkwardly stare at your avatar, noticing details you didn't notice during the entire game, waiting for something to happen.

Archers often stand right next to money spawning rabbits and pay them no attention. When they do notice them their aim is quite a bit worse than i'd like it to be. There are also issues with the overall pacing of the game. A bit too much downtime for my tastes. I also wish the horse could would pick up money much easier.

However, the lack of content, depth, control and terrible AI results in a tedious and boring experience.  PROS:  - The soundtrack was nice. It built the atmosphere and mood of the environment and situations (battling/night and day/peacefuk).  - Art is pretty spectacular :) I am such a huge fan of pixel graphics and this game delivered tremendously. Everything had a beautiful design, the environment was created perfectly (rain, fog, night, day) and it all felt amazing.  - The beginning of the game is quite exciting. When you start off gathering workers and initially building the village it's great because everything is so close and you are getting use to the game.  CONS:  - To me this game lacks a lot of content. As said before, the beginning is actually very fun because I wasn't aware of the rest of the game. But as I progressed I realised that there wasn't much more to do. The game mainly consists of building and upgrading (which is very simple in its self), managing gold and workers and exploring (with little to find). Maybe if there was upgrade trees to buildings, different classes for warriors, upgrading yourself (the king/queen) so you can fight or move around faster (god damn you move slow).  - Terrible AI. The Ai is very bad in this game. The archers have heaps of trouble hitting things, the knights do absolutely nothing, sometimes the workers walk off into the wild. It really is frustrating.  - Lack of control over game. You can't control where troops are to defend, what occupation your new troops will take on. You can't choose where to build as there are build points throughout the landscape, this coupled with the procedurally generated terrain makes for some very limited and random defensive oppourtunities.  - Everything moves WAY to slow. Workers walk too slow and often get converted back while walking, expecially if they are too far away. Buildings that are on the outskirts can take ages to be built only to be knocked down again at night or not get built in time. The horse needs to move a little faster (or there needs to be teleportation things you unlock) as it takes ages to get to the sides of your kingdom once you progress. Also when your workers get their tools taken away it takes ages for them to get it back because they have to walk all the way to the shop again.  - No HUDs. There could be little indicators to tell you if you are getting attacked, how many archers, warriors or people you have. Also an overview of the map would be useful as you can see where buildings need to be upgraded or where you are getting attacked. You are very much not notified of anything in this game, which I think i quite unfair and punishing to the player.  - Not very resource-gathery. There is only really 2 resources you gather in this game, gold and people. I wish there could be more resources to gather and manage which would in itself open up more content for the game.  I know this game says it has a 'minimalist feel' but I just feel that it is WAY to lacking in content. Either add more content and replayability or lower the price tag. For me, the positives are heavily outweighed by the negatives. Sorry, but I can't recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "I have to say i really enjoy this game, HOW EVER there is a long list of tweaks that would make this much more entertaining and remove some of the repetativeness of it.  1. Archers are needed in massive numbers: with out tons of tons of archers it is very hard to stablize your kingdom, this forces you to keep a smaller territory for a long period of time while you stockpile many many archers.   2. Armies and Knights: 6 archers is far to few; with so few archers in the squad nothing happens to the portal and you can't do anything, i had more luck pushing my border up to the portal and building a tower next to it so they can just shoot it forever and then kill the wave that spawns with catapult shots.   3. Too much gold late in the game: When i got to day 40 i was already rolling in money (like a pool in a bigger pool in a mansion amount) and nothing to spend it on. I recommend a talent system of some form, pay to increase ____   &gt;e.g. horses get a tree that lets you slowly buff it up in speed and duration of running, each rank getting more and more expensive (putting money towards it counts up to a total so that you could even have multiple bags full of money per talent)   &gt;e.g. Archers can shoot more arrows OR shoots arrows faster choosing a path at the start and then adding more with each rank.  this would allow the game to have a tad more depth.  4. Some way to command your troops on a minor level (i.e. take them out of towers or tell them to ignore building/destroying something)  5. The kingdom becomes too large: When you reach the end game there is sooooo much space to run across and you must make trips across the ENTIRE kingdom to get to a building for repairs or w/e, perhaps put in out posts that let you send out orders to the other side of your kingdom? or maybe a form of portal? either way it would cost lots of money to make it.  6. Builders: these guys have a suicide wish... They march out into the night if you set up too many buildings or mark too many trees. They need to have some sort of restriction on their coding that stops them from leaving if the day/night cycle = night.  7. Lastly do something more with the monuments and castle, add in more levels to work with. I do not feel like an impressive king with a one and a half story castle... Add in more layers and size with mages or something (i mean come on demons attack us, why not mages? they could even be the top level of towers to make shields for the archers!) this would also allow more knights on each side (maybe 3 archers per knight? this lets you make a real army to go fight the portals).  All in all i really enjoy this game and got my fair share of play time out of it and will definitely play more in the near future. Would i recommend it? Yes, even with all these problems i feel like after a failure i can do better and want to try even harder the next time  Hope you found this criticism helpful devs and players!

Survived for 100 days? Sucks to be you, it's impossible to destroy the portals now. You can only summon two knights to a side, the extra knights on the cleared side of a map can't be moved, and even though you have 200 archers roaming around, only a few will wander near the side under attack at any one time. To attack a portal you can only send two knights plus six archers, and they move SLOWLY. Why can't you send your entire 200 man force at the portals and just finish the game? I have no idea.  Later in the game, your minions will have their pockets overflowing with gold, and will heap it at your feet as you ride by. So if five or ten of them are wandering around the archery &amp; farming booths, why can't you have them buy more equipment for you? Why isn't there a standing order to always keep four bows at the ready? I have no clue! You have to gallop your butt all the way back from the front, have your minions throw money at you, and then buy equipment literally a foot away from them.  Perhaps the devs slimmed down the interface &amp; gameplay to preserve the aesthtic they were going for? I can ALMOST get that...but not this way, guys. The game is just frustrating.",

It's a fun little flash game that takes a couple hours to figure out and a couple hours to beat once you've gotten the relatively few game systems down. Most of the fun of this game comes from figuring out the game. The interface is very minimal with only three buttons: left, right, and spend coins. Your view of the game world is limited to what your character personally can see. Because of this, it offers a fresh and fun perspective to the standard all-seeing top down view of real time strategy. Some of the most tense moments in this game occur when you're on one side of your kingdom during a blood moon wondering whether the far end of your kingdom is getting demolished. This does make the end game a bit tedious, though, as you march your monarch endlessly back and forth from one end of your kingdom to the other.  It was truly a joy figuring out this game. There are a few tips at the beginning of the game to get you started, but largely it lets you figure out for yourself how things work. The game teaches you the hard way what resources to prioritize, how to deal with threats, when and how to expand, and ultimately how to win. The downside of this sort of game is that, once you figure it out and beat it, you may feel no need to play it again. I still recommend it for what it is: a fun resource puzzle with a beautifully imagined and executed pixel art style.",

            "review_text": "I love to play games in this weired genre. It is sort of a mix of base building and strategy but with an emphasis on simplicity. the ideas within the game are pretty straightforward and I found it to be a fun, but rather short, game. But i feel there is some problems with the game you should take note of before decideing to buy it yourself.   Speaking of that general simple form, it comes with some good and unfortunately a lot of bad things. The first thing I should say is the game does not really tell you how anything works. You have to explore the world and find out what does what and how it helps you. The game has a bit of an exploration element where you mus venture out into the forest to find more people to help you and whatever else you can get taht will aid in your survival. Everything you do in the game revolves around haveing money. you need money to build your village. money to get more tools, and money to hire more people, you can even use money to fight in a fassion as you lack any real form of defending yourself. the overall idea of the game is to expand your village out and defeat the invadeing monsters to have peace for your kingdom.   But for what the premise of simplicity does right, it also has things it does wrong. The things I felt were the worst would have to have been the AI of your villagers and your general lack of intractability with them. Other than giving them money to have them work for you and giving them tools to use you have no real control of what they do, where they go, or how they work. This leads to a lot of problems with most of the workers. Personally I felt they were overall far too slow. I would not make them too much faster but when your nearing the end of the game it can take over an entire in game day for a villager to reach the edge of the village from the center. Another general problem is once a villager has decided on what job he will do there is no way to make them change jobs. this can of course lead to a lot of complications if you accidentally make too many of one type of worker and end up losing.   The archers Will mill about and sometimes go too far out of the village getting themselves caught, having their items stolen because they could not get back to town. Or they can be too far from the wall at the end of the day to help guard it. Additionally the archers pick what side they are going to defend themselves. this lead to one side being largely undefended or the archers will choose to go across the entire village to guard the opposite side even though they would not get there before the night ended.    At one point i had 30-40 builders on one side of the village because I would pay the traveling trader to give me some tools. But you cant tell the trader what kind of tools you want. Meaning he can give you tools you really do not want, and since any villager without a job will immediately pick up any tool nobody is using you are stuck with workers you do not need. Similarly with the archers all these builders decided to stay on that one side while the other side of the village had only 3-5 builders. The farmers are probably the best AI, but also the most simple. they usually are not a problem unless you have the farm outside your walls as they will sometimes will not make it back to the wall before nightfall, but otherwise they are fine.    Late in the game you can start making attacking forces consisting of 2 knights and a pile of archers to destroy the portals the monsters are coming through. But the AI for the army's is also rather horrible. One you buy the knights required to start an army the knights will randomly select 3-5 archers to join them. this can be a big hassle as they will often pick archers all the way across a large scale village making you wait 2-3 days for the army to finally gather. I feel this could be fixed by having the knights hire any archer they touch, up to the army capacity.",

I am pretty positive every 5 nights the Blood Moon(BM) will arrive, and you must have your village prepared to be attacked by many sorts of monsters, every new BM will have more and more monsters. It makes for a really interesting gameplay, because not only do you have a bunch of monsters that continue to build up every BM they only attack one side. Sound Easy right? Sometimes its not so easy, one side will be nice and ready and next thing you know your being attacked on the opposite side and almost loose your crown.  It seems easy peasy at first until you realise, your bag can only hold so many gold coins, and you only have so much time to build(should only be building during the day, nightimes pretty risky), and you're constantly in a cat n mouse chase with those gold coins, you can never have enough, or you have way too much and cannot spend anything..

Every pixel seems to be perfectly shaded. There 's only one glitch in the coin slots where pixels sometimes are a bit off, but that's no problem.  The controls are very very easy and the user interface is very very small and is hidden most of the time. Perfect combination...  There is no big tutorial or any other kind of help and that's the intension. You will need trial and error to find the prefect way to play this game. I beat the game after day 51, but there are people who beat the game in much less days which should be easier as the enemy grows stronger every day. So I still have some gameplay left, not only because of this but also because it seems to stay fun to run around on your horse, trying out stuff, throwing coins at poor folks ;)  Still though, there are things in this game that could be regardes as design flaws. I don't mind them. You take these things as part of the gameplay but a more 'realistic' game would have more options: There is no way to cancel orders, archers are 'afraid' at night and stand behind walls while builders are brave and just go out to work outside of these walls with no protection whatsoever. It's part of the sometimes weird game mechanics and once you accept them, you can actually use them. I really like this, but I can understand that some people think this is stupid or bad or something.  I totally recommend this game, and IMO, it's worth the full price.  Edit: After 51 hours, I finally got every achievement. And now I am sad... I still like to play the game, but no longer have a goal. Still... 51 hours for 10 bucks... not bad...",

            "review_text": "Throw money at your problems to fix them or make it go away!  This is the main lesson, and near only play-mechanic, of 'Kingdom'.  Not saying the game is bad, far from it. The animation, settings and music all make this game absolutely ooze atmosphere and it's absolutely gorgeous. The aesthetic really pulls me in. But to say that you're a valiant warrior king/queen in this game would be misleading as there are only 3 buttons and 2 directionals for you to play with. You go left or right, can make your horse gallop (You can NOT get off that high-horse, btw) and the other 2 buttons involve throwing money. See a peasant? Laugh in aristocratic mirth as that peasant scrambles to pick up the coin you just dropped for them. Congratulations peasant, your life now belongs to me. Now go forth to my town and pick up the first tool you find, for that shall be your job. Seriously, the AI needs work here. There is quite literally ZERO control over units after you hire them. EVERYTHING is automatic apart from you throwing money at things to be built/upgraded. Monster coming after you? So long as it's not a troll/ogre/big huge thing, drop a coin and it'll snatch it and run away (myyy preeeeeciouuuussssss....).  The game has a very simplistic nature and easy controls. The challenge feels VERY RNG tho. Do you get that early game boost with a helpful treasure chest in the woods? Are the peasant camps easy to get to, or are they clustered out beyond the demon gates? Will your archers roam too far to hunt during the day and, thusly, be caught by friendly catapult fire as they try to approach the gate, or just swarmed by demons cause they stopped outside the gates to fight that target that entered thier targeting range at night? Are the demon gates just too far away for your knights and archers to reach before the nightly swarm, even if you send them out as soon as possible during the day and invested in maximum buffs from shrines? Cause yeah... Those swarms. Knights can handle most anything that a gate will throw at them during assault on the demon gates.... except the number of mobs that the gates produce at dusk to assault your gates.  Pros: +Soundtrack 4 out of 5 +Graphics 5 out of 5 (I'm a sucker for beautiful pixel art) +Simplistic controls +Easy to learn (if you explore) +Continued support and development from the devs!  Cons: -ZERO control over units after hire ( They take the first job tool they walk to. Archers go off where they want during day and don't start heading back till torches activate at night. Units will ignore what is not happening at thier gate. Catapults automatically move to the furthest wall. Farmers and builders will automatically stay at watermill houses, even if it was built outside your protective walls. ) -Far too much RNG. -Not enough base on skill. There WILL be certain things that are impossible to do, simply because the objective is too far away for units to reach due to the randomness of spawn at the beginning of the game.  Overall, I'd say a 6 out of 10. A game to get when it is on sale. While I love the aesthetic of this game and the charm of the characters, there WAY too LITTLE actual control you have in game. This game is a simplistic resource sim at most, but if you make it to an advanced day with multiple farmers, you're going to have more money than you can throw at things.",

I just wanted to write down some of my concerns.  +Beautiful game and idea. +addictive for a few hours. +Exciting to learn your own strategy. +They have gotten kind words from many reviews. Even the ones below are all regretfully disappointed.   -There is no other information on growth.  -As the leader, you cannot attack or influence your men to attack. This seriously restricts your strategy. I might recommend to the dev's that they add a rally point option? -The AI for the units you can buy is a bit rough. -Your initial archer can sometimes take too long to hunt rabbits so you are not able to get the growth necessary to start your kingdom in the randomly generated areas. -Your archers are forced to shoot high arcs over your own defensive walls and hit the enemy as little as 25% of the time. -Enemies are about 90% your top speed on your horse. If you dont run until your horse stops to pant, you get caught easily with no where to run.  -The waves of enemies that come at night are massively OP. You can defend the first night of the blood moon with practice. After that you are expected to have enough coins to round up all of the villagers you lost and replace their tools. If not, you don't recover. -Farmers make the most money, but they don't automatically hide behind a wall or two like the archers seem to want to do around nightfall. -Archers do not shoot animals at night. Even if the animals are in the light. -Archers in towers do not shoot animals. -Growth through the stone age (and beyond?) is not written out anywhere. There is a method to the madness, just expand and hope for the best.  -Flying enemies take villagers back to the red portal and the arrows from the archers never hit them. They fly too high so once they have someone they are irreplacable.  Over all I hope the devs keep up the good work. I really want this to become as big as it's potential. Hope my troubles help with your ideas in the future if you do decide to buy this game!   ",

            "review_text": "Kingdom is a procedurally generated, 2D city builder game in where you take control of either a king or a queen, on their quest to build a kingdom that can withstand the relentless creatures that awaken at night. Whether you are a boy or a girl is random though you can roll a new appearance on the loading screen by pressing the S key. You start off with nothing but a few coins and must set up shelter before the dark hits. A small tutorial is given, though pretty soon you will be left to figure things out on your own. This is a trial and error type of game so you will more than likely die your first few times playing. Other than riding around and sprinting on your horse, your only other form of interactivity will be to drop money on people or objects. You have no forms of attack and must rely on your peasants to get you through the night. To recruit more peasants you go searching the wilderness for them and give them a coin to convince them. Why they need to be bribed when you are offering food and shelter from the darkness we may never know.    Giving coins to the stall with a hammer will get you a hammer that a peasant with no profession can pick up to start building walls and maintaining your defenses. The stall with a bow will allow you to buy the equipment necessary for Archers, which will be your main source of income early on as they will hunt the lands and return to you with the profits of poaching animals. Archers are also your only unit capable of attacking for a large portion of the game and are absolutely necessary to surviving the creature filled night. You will need to build a wall so that they stand a chance at winning since your melee units are only recruitable late in game, annoyingly enough. Guard towers will usually be able to be built behind walls and station an archer high above ground to defend your kingdom. That may seem useful but in reality towers are a waste of money in this game due to the Archers never again be able to leave from it. It does not sound that bad, but when you start expanding and you have a bunch of archers stationed in useless positions, while your forces are weak from the previous attack and on the verge of collapsing, it can very easily lead to your doom.    Your doom can still come easily in various cheap feeling ways. Archers have terrible aim and when you have a horde of relentless creatures tearing down your wall, which can easily result in them getting through and wiping out your kingdom due to not being allowed to have melee units yet. So build more walls or upgrade them further you may think. Well what you do in this game doesn't really feel like building, everything is preset for you in certain locations, so you have no say to where or what you build. You can upgrade your walls twice which is not all that durable and to upgrade your wall further you have to go deep into a random part of the forest and offer coins to some kind of shrine. It is fine to have little hand holding but that makes no sense. Tearing down buildings is not possible so be very careful about what you build. Buildings cannot be moved either, so new peasants that arrive when you have a quite a bit of territory will have to go all the way to the center of your kingdom to get a bow or hammer. That is a walk all the way from where you recruit them, down to the center of your kingdom and back to the outskirts of your territory where you actually need them.    Even then your peasants love to wander off and occasionally die a needless death when they are out after dark. It makes sense that your archers may lose track of time when hunting but when they see it is dark out they will very slowly make their way back without a care in the world. The dumb friendly AI and their slow movement speed combine perfectly together to make things far more tedious than they should be. Builders seem to have the worst AI as they will often times be off staring into space somewhere instead of being on the front lines doing their jobs and manning the catapults which only they know how to use. Sadly you are also affected by slow movement speeds and an asthmatic horse than can only run for a few seconds. In a game with no means of controlling anything other than going right up to the object you want to interact with, even if it is on the other side of the map, having a feature that hinders your means to do so is utterly unnecessary. Your horse can sprint a bit longer if you stand still and let it eat some grass though not by much.    Each day you receive taxes from your peasants and these are placed in the center of your kingdom. So imagine you have just withstood a huge attack and most of your peasants didn't make it. That means you have to go to the center of town if you need cash and then all the way to forests, while hoping that your very slow peasants make it before dark. Even if they do they certainly won't make it all the way to the center of the kingdom and back to the front lines to fight. You cannot tell them what profession to be either, they will grab a tool at random and you will not be able to change him into something else. There is no way of telling how many of your peasants don't have a profession and are currently useless unless you stumble upon them. The amount that they ask you to do in such a short day is absurd and quickly starts to feel like a chore. You feel like less of a king and more like an obsessive mother, trying to bribe her rebellious kids into doing what she wants, one that has never heard of a safe and decided to throw into a lake whatever extra money she may have that won't fit in her purse. At the very least they nailed the environments and atmosphere of the game. The mood of this game ranges from creepy to yet another perfect sunny day to good effect. Whatever the case may be the soundtrack definitely adds a lot to the experience.    The starting monsters in this game are greedy little creatures that will steal anything they can get their hands on and over all else want the shiny crown on your head which will result in a game over for you. They are easy to defeat most nights, however when the moon turns red they will attack in a massive horde that will likely be the death of you. Well actually these creatures will not kill you or anyone else but they will steal all your peasant's equipment and cause them to flee from your kingdom until you bribe them to stay. The other two monsters that appear later on will gladly kill all of you however. Which your blind Archers and lazy Builders seem all too eager to let happen. I don't mean to make Kingdom sound like an awful game, it's just extremely tedious due to poor design. It could have been an amazing game but every positive thing seems to have more negative to it. Sure the world is randomly generated but with buildings being preset for you it all feels the same with no room for experimentation. You are free to explore the cool environments but must micromanage far too many things in person and night is upon you before you know it. Yes you are the king, though it feels more like being the paper boy with no say over anything, that just so happens to have everyone's paycheck in his pouch. With better AI, a real time map of sorts that shows you how many peasants you have as well as their profession, longer days and maybe some sort of NPC that recruits peasants for twice the prize, Kingdom would become a much better game. As it is, I would suggest holding off on buying it and seeing if any improvements are made, if you are interested in what Kingdom offers.",

Pros: -Graphics are pretty cool if you're into retro visuals. -The soundtrack is amazing. -Addictive gameplay, until you figure out the mechanics of the game. -Potential to be a cracking series.  Cons: -Very limited gameplay which essentially consists of you riding around on your horse, and strategically buying upgrades for your kingdom. -BS endgame which complete dominates you, even if you've been dominating the whole game.  -You cannot control or order your subjects. Your builders will walk all the way to the edge, and then run back to the middle or meander about. This artificially boosts the difficulty in an unrealistic way. It makes no logical real world sense. Developer should have let you control your subjects and then build the game around that. -Very limited upgrades. After you've fully upgraded your castle, you essentially build towers and walls for the rest of the game in strategic spots. -Zero replay value due to tedious end game.  If you like repetitive gameplay followed by a cheap as #$!&amp; endgame, by all means purchase this game. If not, pass, but maybe play a round or two on your friend's computer. The game has potential though, and I would keep an eye out for Kingdom 2, if it ever happens. If the developers added and tweaked a few mechanics, they would have something good on their hands. ",

Like the art or not, if you enjoy it great, if not, looking past the graphics leads to a challenging management/survival game that is both drawing you in with it's atmosphere and curiosity because you keep wondering where those little maniacs come from. Not to mention the soundtrack really is amazing. I love the game, I thought it would be a risky purchase since I hardly heard anything at all of it, but i'm really glad i bought it now.  Obviously it's not without flaws, the level/worlds are randomly generated which leads to some levels being easier than others. Then the archery skill of the peasants is laughable at best, it's hilarious when they miss a bunny from 3 ft away but it gets frustrating when defending against a horde... but maybe I just needed more archers. Anyway my point being is that eventhough these factors add a certain challenge and the randomness makes every playthrough different it feels a bit unfair at times.   I haven't had any issues software wies with the game, I found it curious that it just dropped you of into the game with no option to change settings and I didn't think of pressing escape until I was a good part into my second world, i was just that immersed.

First off the game is both simple and complex as the same time. That said it is a nice casual game in it's own way. It is a Roguelike sidescrolling surval game with pixel graphics. The core gameplay is build up your small kingdom to ward off increasingly nasty goblin like creatures that want to steal your gold, and golden crown, at which time you have to start over. There is more to it, but that is the basics. You recruit people from small camps to become builders, archery specialist and so on.   There isn't anything ground breaking about the game, however it is the pure simple gameplay that make this one of the coolest games I have played this month. I like to also add my 10 year old daughters opinion and she loved it. It is more than simple enough for a kid, but more than complex enough for an adult. In my 3 hours playing so far I haven't found any bugs and each death (well crown stealing) shows me how to avoid the same mistakes going forward. My last go of it I made it to day 16 I believe and had quite the kingdom. I highly recommend this game. Even more so right now when it is on sale for under $5 USD.

I wish you could also throw coins tactically, instead of just dropping them.   You expand your castle into two directions, building farms, fortifications etc. After a while you become so large it can get quite confusing, because you can only scroll the screen by moving your character. You constantly move from one end to another and there is no indication of attack reported.   It's not vital, but I wish they added a population counter for your archers and workers.

The pixel art is outstanding, and the sprites, background, and foreground are simply sublime. You heard me, sublime. Then you come to the mechanics of the game, which are incredibly simple. I was so concerned about having to get up at 3:00AM and plug my mouse in, but there was absolutely no need. This game is as easy to play on a laptop as it is any other computer. The story is beyond imagining. It's constructed in such a way that the first five minutes of play give you a fantastic idea that there is something so much deeper going on. I have no idea what yet, but believe me, there is something going on. And I love it.  And then, with all of these features considered, the game is hard. It's not some simple walk in the park. You have to think, and you have to plan. At first you worry that you're not going to have enough choices, that the game will be too simple, and then you realise how wrong you were. This game is not easy. I am aware that I was incredibly far from the end in my first run through, and yet I was easily stomped because of my own lack of foresight and poor planning. Which again, I freaking love.   But the best part of the game? Oh boy, it's the discovery. You start off with a simple, incredibly ambiguous beginning, and beyond the basic controls, you have to discover everything for yourself. There's nothing there to tell you what you've done, other than starting at your own creation and learning from it.   In short, this is a beautifully crafted game that is well thought out. Whilst being minimalistic, it manages to pack it full of so many things that make it incredibly interesting. And at $9.99? You really can't do anything but get it right.",

Maybe implement a mechanic where the archers would retreat or maybe jump back in response to enemies instead of bunching up and just standing there while a horde of greed takes them out. The AI is dumb at times: hammer men will just run into enemies and dont even swing there hammers in defense to go repair walls (it would be cool if they could fight back and there hammers would just do half damage compared to arrows). If a cancel command was implemented this would be fixed. Also archers are inaccurate when trying to shoot bunnies (dont have to shoot into the air guy, a simple straight shot would work just fine.) -While I understand the ramping difficulty is challenging, maybe let's not have the floaters come in on day 7 and eat every person I have when I haven't even figured out how I'm supposed to kill them yet. -I keep getting a glitch where there are invisible walls preventing me from exploring the land, I can't go very far from the camp and I can't explore to find the statues. -Also a small thing, let us ACTUALLY customize our king or queen instead of using a random button to just randomize everything about them. If just those things were fixed, this would be a masterpiece in my mind. Still I'll recommend this game because it is very good and the devs deserve a good review. I just hope they read this and balance the maybe not so good parts.",

However I do have some beef with the game. The game is wonderful to look at however I have learned its not just how a game looks that makes it great, and don't get me wrong the gameplay is amazingly fun, great aestedics, simple controlls, and gameplay that is easy to pick up and understand. However it is lacking in many areas that I hope get fixed with the new lands vertion.  First  Once someone has a roll to play they keep it till they loose it.   This is bad because if you have to many builders and you need archers you are screwed Second   The archers evenly distribute until there is a knight,  at that point they all stay by the one they started with even if there arnt any on the other side  I survived over 35 days but starting at the 30th there were little to no archers on the left side and doom was enevitable  Third   Archers are glued to their posts  It would help if the archers had a full post infront of them or even two they would hop out and be helpful  This is a huge problem because eventualy you wont have many more people to help be archers and they just sit there Fourth   Builders stand still  it would be very helpful if the builders either stud at the middle and ran to either aide or split up like archers   Sometimes I have found that I need walls build on the left and all of them are standing at the right Fith  One a side is done nothing changes  If one side is completly safe the knights and archers should move over to the other side as nothing is needed from them on that side anymore  I hope this doesn't deture anyone from buying the game because again I HIGHLY recomend it. These are just a few things I found could be fixed to maximize gameplay, and that being said everthing mentioned above could be avoided if you pay equil attention to both sides.  I am also so so so glad I baught this game as it has given me many ideas for future games I can create. (Working on my first now) I added that because if anyone is looking to become a game dev this has amazingly different gameplay that gives you many Ideas and great insperation for your oun work.",

They go to build the walls, they go to defend a wall etc. But this works when the city is small. Your goal is to destroy portals on both sides of your town. I got to the 60th day with the right side of my town cleared. The whole army and workers stood there een though, there was no more threat coming from that direction. They were just wasted there. And at that point, you cannot simply recruit more people, they are all you have. Then a wave of enemies comes from the left and eat half of your soldiers. Now you are basically stuck with left side of the city too weak to defend themselves and the right side too OP but for nothing. Nobody goes back to help and repair walls, or to fight the enemies.   The first game was ok. I died because of my lack of knowledge about the game rules. But the second game I believe I lost because of the bad AI. And right now, after 13h of 2 playthroughs, that's it. I no longer have desire to try again for 5h and build another town.  But overall I was happy. I got 13 hours for a 7 euro game.

It's an interesting little game, my only real complaint is that I want more. I didnt expect the victory condition to be where it was, I kind of thought it'd keep throwing more stuff at me but it turned out I was well prepared when I finally beat it on my 4th or 5th try.   Has a great aethetic and musical score, the minimalist (nearly nonexistent) interface works very well, there's a very minor gripe regarding workers outside the walls and their tendency to not run back to base until sundown, but that's easy enough to work around.  Edit: I forgot that the game is very impressive technically as well, it ran perfectly the entire time I played, and given that it appears to simluate the entire world constantly, as well as the incredibly high sprite count, it's really quite astounding how well it runs.  Anyways, it's a good time, I enjoyed it, I imagine you will too, go for it. If I were to compare it to anything else in feel, probably banished.",
