            "review_text": "Do you have a lot of friends that come over to your house? This is a perfect party game. Instead of an emphasis on gameplay skill or quick reflexes, these games are much more focused on wits, intelligence, and humor. It's perfect even for people who don't usually play video games. We all know that one time when we went over to a friend's house to play Mario Kart/ Super Smash Bros or something and he crushed all of us without even trying because he's the only one who owns the godamn game damnit. There's no such advantages available here, since the game is mainly trivia/ humor based.  Another great thing is you don't have to go fiddling around with any Xbox game controllers or anything like that. There is a cool browser based system where you just have to enter a code at jackbox.tv, using any browser. This means anyone with a smartphone can easily connect to the game they want to play as long as they have an internet connection. This is genius stuff, some of the games can have up to 8 players so instead of having to fiddle with a bunch of tangled wires/ teach everyone the controls, it is simple enough to set up and play. I've had good success using Valve's Steam Link paired with this game on a large TV with a group of people, it's always a good time!  The party pack comes with these 5 games below, although you'll probably only regularly play 2 or 3 of them.  Fibbage: This game is played a lot I think, essentially some trivial question is given that nobody will likely know, it's pretty obscure stuff like 'What did Abraham Lincoln get as a present from this random governor on Independence Day?' or something similar, players have to input a good lie they think may fool everyone else, and then everyone chooses from a compiled list of lies from players and one truth embedded within. You get points for both fooling others and picking out the truth. Always a goofy fun time!  Earwax: Essentially Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity in audio form, everyone gets a prompt, and is given a list of random sounds to choose from. This can be pretty fun, like a prompt would say 'Superman, while drunk.' and you can respond with the sounds *Loud, Long Fart* followed with *Man Screaming*. However, the issue with this game is you don't get to hear the sound before you play it so sometimes the results are not what you expect.  Bidiots: This one is complicated. Everyone is given a different subject to try and draw on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little smartphones, and there's a set price to each art piece, which is kept hidden from players. Everyone gets only a few hints as to how much each piece is worth, and they take turns bidding on each art piece at an auction. Whoever makes the most profit wins. This can be pretty fun but there's quite a bit of strategy involved. It'll probably take a couple of times before people understand completely how this game works, but it's one of the deeper experiences in here, there's a lot of strategies like 'fake bidding' to raise the price of a piece you know isn't worth anything. Pretty fun but you need a group that's willing to learn a bit about the mechanics to get the most out of it.  Quiplash: Pretty popular game, a prompt is given and people write what they think would be the funniest response to it. After this, people vote on what they think is the funniest/ most apt response. It's mostly humor based, from what I can tell. I actually found this game kinda boring, there wasn't enough structure to keep my interest for too long, but you might like it.  BombCorp: Kind of a simpler Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, this game has you defusing bombs with a group of friends. You essentially shout out instructions on how to defuse a bomb and somebody tries to defuse it without it going off. This game only has 4 players maximum and is probably better suited for a smaller group of dedicated people. There is a psuedo-story mode and looks pretty fun, but I haven't played it much.  Jackbox Party Pack 2 is a fun selections of party games that will always be a hit with friends, unless your friends are big lame-os who hate fun.",

This is designed to be played locally, and it's great fun if you can arrange to meet up and play. It can be played over Twitch, but it can be difficult to set up, so just make sure you can actually play it before buying. It's totally worth your time if you can get the group together though!",

The MC threw a lot of comments at me and holy crap it was rude but hilarious - my type of humour. Definately reccomend it and if there are further productions that are similar, I would definately give it a go !",

            "review_text": "A great assortment of games for a okay price. Each game brings fun to the table. From picking surprisingly fitting sounds to match a given prompt to defusing bombs, this pack provides fun for any party night.  Small word of warning though. If you plan to play this with only a certain group of friends or two, I would not recommend playing Quiplash for a majority of the time. I know people say it's the funnest in the pack, but there is one key flaw, not with the game though. Friends may tend to repeat jokes. At first it may seem a bit funny but after spending a lot of time in it you may start to grow tired of what is a fantastic game in the pack. I would recommend not having this (or possibly Fibbage 2, it can apply there as well) to be your most played games in the pack.  To me the games that let this pack shine the most are Bomb Corp and Biddiots. Bomb Corp is a co-op game where each player gets a set of instructions (or some other form of handicap that requires the group to work together) that must be followed to diffuse bombs. If one person messes up ... BOOOOM! Back to the start of that day. It can be frustrating but fun at the same time, plus beating that one day you were stuck on is very rewarding.  Biddiots is a game where each player must draw 2 pieces of art and then bid on everyone else's art. The goal is to make the most money by buying expensive pieces for cheap. The screw mechanic from You Don't Know Jack is present in this game where you can FORCE another player into buying an art piece. It helps if you're about to win a piece you don't want or if you want to spike up the price of your piece, but be careful. If you use a screw on a player who can't bid that high, then the screw is wasted.  Overall this and the first game pack is fun. It has a lot of possibilities when playing with a pretty large crowd, plus with the new Audience function in some games it provides humongous meetups / events to have a fun game going. I could not recommend this more",

As others have said, Quiplash is basically Apples to Apples/Cards Against Humanity, but the automation via the browser makes things run smoothly. Bidiots is sometimes interesting with the right group of people. Overall an entertaining and useful party option that is a no-brainer whenever it's on sale.  ",
