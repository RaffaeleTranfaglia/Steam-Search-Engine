            "review_text": "The story does take a moment to really get going, as it is setting up the world, but once it does, it really takes off.  This is part one in the Magical Eyes series, though the story itself is self-contained. Think Fault:milestone one in the way the story grows and comes together at the end, but without fault's obvious cliffhanger.  The production values are quite good. I'm not sure what to praise more - the character art, the backgrounds, the music or how dynamic some of the scenes are. It's definitely not a run-of-the-mill visual novel.  Last but not least, I have to give props to the VAs as they do an excellent job of conveying the characters. It certainly helped pull me even more into the story.  What I'm saying is that if you like your thrillers/mysteries/character drama/magical world stories, I think you'll enjoy this one as is. Though now I can't wait to read the next episode!",
