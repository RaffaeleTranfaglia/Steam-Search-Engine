            "review_text": "This game is just bad.  Why is it so bad? Where to begin? Lets start... at the beginning.  1. Tutorial: Game says easy mode is for 'people who've never played RTS before'. Well I'm quite a strategy buff, but nothing I've played is much like this game, so that is an inaccurate description on their part. Most likely if you've never played THIS GAME before, you should probably start on Easy.  2. There's very little strategy. Unless you consider 'walking up to enemies and shooting them while trying not to stand on a bridge' a strategy. The game touts things like crossfire and cover, and ... not standing on bridges because there are armor penalties (or bonuses). But there's no real strategy. Its mostly just blasting enemies with as many guys as you can while damaged sections run away (tediously) to healing pads. If you're looking for anything resembling real tactics... you might want to look elsewhere. Before I explain what I mean, let me define a few things...   DEFINITION: Strategy Strategy usually means managing at a macro level (research, gathering resources to build a larger army, capturing choke points etc) for advantage. There are resource locations in this game, but they're not terribly useful excpet that they generate the money needed to heal units. Once your best units are in the field: there is nothing more to buy. More units just get in the way and distract from you trying not to get your best people killed (squad death is permanent).  DEFINITION: Tactics Tactics is about singular engagements (hitting the enemy in ways that they can't hit back, flanking, or rock-paper-scissors). What do I mean by 'rock-paper-scissors'? In a hypothetical modern warfare game, it would be something like.... attacking the enemy helicopters with AA, while your helicopters attack their tanks, while your tanks attck their AA. When you maximize the number of your units specialized at killing a particular unit type, with engagements against that unit type: that is a good tactic and makes for a good game. In this game, everything early-on defers to the all powerful heavy rocket infantry, and later on to mechs. All weapons have about the same range, so there's no sense of pinning an enemy down while snipers pick them off (etc). Its just NOT THERE in this game. Everything is about having the most guns to bear at a particular time and making sure that the 'last guy' in any unit isn't killed because then the unit dies.  3. The unit AI is abysmal. Its really annoying and frustrating, especially in a game where you constantly have to scroll around to do things like checking that enemies haven't spawned behind you, or sending units back to healing pads. You will frequently find that you will send an order, go do something else, and then come back to find out that the order was ignored. Units get stuck on the map, ignore orders to shoot stuff (or don't return fire when they are under attack). Attacked units will not complete their order. Units tasked with entering a bunker, may or may not just stand there and jitter spasmotically, while others allow themselves to get shot up by enemies standing directly next to them, or just wanders off to die in the enemy camp. The only thing that saves you from defeat at the incompetence of your idiot soldiers is that the enemy AI is even dumber. The whole enemy strategy seems to consist of 'reinforce as often as possible and send them at the player'. While this seems simple, its often made tediously impossible by giving the player 1 spawn pad and the enemy AI 6 or 7 per level, then forcing the player to also manage some other tedius task like 'evacuate the civilians' or 'don't lose your engineers' at the same time. And speaking of that...  4. Mission parameters don't make sense. Mission 1 the goal requires engineers. You can get new engineers at the drop ship pad. Despite the fact that you can get more, you 'lose' the game if you lose all your engineers in the level, despite the fact that you might have more in reserve... ready to be called down at a moment's notice.  5. The sound is REALLY messed up. Music is WAY too loud. I turned it off, only to find that the video cutscene sound (including voice and sound effects) are on the same audio track!  6. What's with the unskippable cut scenes?  7. What's with the non-standard RTS game controls?  8. The story is non-existent. I wanted to know more about the game universe, but clicking around on the strategic map only tells you planet name and whether there's a mission. Ingame fiction seems to have been overlooked.  9. WHAT DO UNITS DO? There is no encyclopedia that I can see. No hover hints. You pretty-much have to guess if a unit is what you want. But I suppose that makes sense, since all the units seem identical anyway. The game says units have special abilities, but I haven't seen it (other than for engineers). They appear to unlock later. So until then: enjoy your all-the-same units.  So is there anything good? Artwork seems pretty good. It has a compelling look, albiet overly-busy and maybe slightly lower quality than the game dictates. I like the abundance of fully-rendered cutscenes. This is one thing that has disappeared from games recently that I would wish to come back. And RTS for that matter: its not a dead genre. But big publishers won't make it because it doesn't port nicely to console. Its nice to see that a game company is at least TRYING to make an interesting RTS.  That's all I have for now. Thanks for reading!  ",

The campaign is very nice so far, letting me choose which allies I want, by performing the missions proposed by different factions. The background of the conflict could have been a bit more explained, but that's just a minor detail. Great game.",
