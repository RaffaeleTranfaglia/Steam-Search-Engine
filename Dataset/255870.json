            "review_text": "I remember Pixeljunk Shooter being good fun a few years ago when I played it on the PS3. But playing it now it managed to annoy me sometimes. Some of the deaths are annoying, sometimes even cheap, resulting in you having to replay entire sections because of one tiny mistake. And no, the sections aren't all that big and can be completed in just a few minutes. But it's frustrating when you're almost near the end of a level.  It's also the only thing that annoyed me, because what you have here is a cute looking, physics based, twin stick action game (it's not really a twin stick shooter, so naming it that would do it injustice) where you save trapped workers and try to find as many gems as possible. Why is the last one so important ? Because you can only progress until you have a certain amount of these gems. Still, it's not that time consuming, because the game can easily be finished (not 100%) in 3 or 4 hours. There are 3 worlds and they consists of several levels each, and each levels consists of several sections. At the end of the world there'll be a boss fight. Those can be a bit difficult, but collecting enough stars allows you to earn extra lives. You'll rarely have to replay an entire level. Anyway, the environmental puzzles are fun to solve, and it's cool to look for secrets (I don't know if you can really call them secrets, though).   Ask me if this is the best Q-Games/Pixeljunk game and I'd have to say no. That honor still belongs to Pixeljunk Monsters. Shooter is a close second, though. But ask me if it's worth it and I'd say yes.  [Rating: 78/100]",

Visual aesthetics are on very high level and music fits gameplay perfectly.  It's a great feeling to see, that such a small studio is able to make game like this one.  Every level brings something new, so you will never feel bored, and yoy will never feel that you repeat over and over the same actions. I want to finish single-player campaign and then for sure - I will try 2 player co-op (on one screen) with my sister. :-) I am sure co-op gona bring even more fun! Highly recommended and addictive - one of best indie games available on Steam. ",

It's totally different than their flag ship 'Monsters' but still brings some of the same great elements.  The navigation really impresses me. You have complete control over your spaceship. There are simple physics based puzzles, temperature regulation and other simple but smart things. Everything down to the last detail has that expected polish.  Each stage is ranked and compares you to the vast Pixel Junk database of players. There is the ability to play 2 controllers but there isn't a multiplayer option unfortunately.  Worth $5, but it's usually cheaper.     Accidently Reviewed",

Controls are super intuitive: WASD for movement and mouse to rotate. Left click fires, right click shoots out a grappling hook to pick up scientists and grab things.  You'll find yourself manipulating the environment by shooting rock, and directing lava, water, ice, gas, etc to open up different parts of the level. This is a typical PixelJunk game, unique and fun. Easy to spend a few minutes here or there or get sucked in as the complexity slowly ramps up.  Easy recommend. On sale? A no brainer.",

The learning curve is pretty small, but overall there is a moderate level of difficulty that is dispersed throughout the entire game utilizing different abilities without requiring a high skill level. The entire game in duration of levels is relatively short, yet still enjoyable for the non sale price.   The only downside for this game is it's low variety of songs played for the entire game with some songs re-used for most levels / stages. I feel the songs match the gameplay and the visual aesthetic, but just a few more tracks to help diversify the stages, if not levels.  I look forward to the next game that continues where this one left off.",

This game is more of a liquid physics and environmental puzzle game than 'shooter'. Liquids include water, lava, and slime/sludge. There's certain rock, smoke, and ice that come into play as well. They all interact predictably. Sometimes your ship gets certain upgrades on certain levels to deal with these obstacles as well. And yes, you will be shooting some baddies along the way too. You're objective is to get by these puzzles and baddies to save seven lost fellers every screen (panning). Five screens make up a stage. Five stages make up a level. Three levels make up the game.  Its short and simple but complete and fun. It made for a couple afternoons of interest. I more than took my time and went for the 100% and got a solid 7hrs out of it. I imagine just blitzing the game you could beat it in under 3hrs. Perfect little bundle game which is where I got it somewhere along the way.
