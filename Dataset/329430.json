            "review_text": "To all of the grouchy Squidwards who are poised to strike and dislike, you can gripe and complain about the way I wrote something very informed and to-the-point, but make it be known that I honestly couldn't care less. That goes ditto for doing it on other peoples' reviews. It's just pointless. But anyways...  State of Decay, in my opinion, comes with three games. The base game and its two expansion packs, but the thing is that all three each share their own style of play, which I'll break down. If any of these are to your liking, I insist you buy this game. Once I've finished covering the three different games, I'll explain the similarities. Sound good?  State of Decay; base game, is my least-played mode despite how story-oriented it is. I can't put my finger on what the hell I don't find attractive in it, but bottom line, I don't put much time in it. Still, it gives you the tutorial of everything SoD-related, and has a strong emphasis on the caretaking of NPC's, and trying to escape certain doom. If you want a zombie game with a plot, and one that is more focused on keeping yourself and your community in this apocalypse alive, this should be a steal for you.  Breakdown; my favorite, goes for a neverending, open-world experience that was highly requested of the developers. Breakdown has no end - unlike State of Decay and Lifeline, which both end once you finish all of the quests, Breakdown has no plot-oriented quests or ultimate ending. It's entirely focused on gathering loot, building a community, slaying zombies, and just seeing how far you can get before you ultimately lose everybody you love. Breakdown is the best part of State of Decay: YOSE, because of how limitless it is. If you want a zombie game that stresses open-world, limitless zombie survival with a sole focus on PVE, Breakdown was brought down from heaven and into the Steam Store, just for you.  Lifeline is a considerable challenge. It turns the difficulty up to the highest mark, and makes the gathering of resources much harder, so as a result, my Army FOB started out healthy and strong, and is now looking like my local Pizza Hut (the one with the bullet hole in the window). To add further insult to injury, unlike Breakdown and State of Decay, which have zombie 'assaults' as mere skirmishes with hordes that pass by your settlement, this one has zombies that mass up and slam you in overwhelming waves. It's actually kind of frightening. If you want a serious challenge, Lifeline provides.  All three games share the same mechanics and controls - one big thing about State of Decay is permadeath. Each character has one life. Nobody (except for one character in Breakdown) has plot armor; everybody is highly susceptible to being torn in half (the zombies seem to favor that execution over all others), and as a result should be treated with extreme caution. What puts great stress on this point is that each character has different skills and talents, which can be leveled and improved, so that makes them even more precious.  In stiff contrast to Dead Island, for example, there is an equal focus on melee and firearms, which I do like since I adore guns. Just as well, since, like Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare, Zeds only go down with a bullet or a baseball bat to the cranium (headshots), with the exception of any .50 caliber weapons, which can kill zombies with one shot anywhere, fire, and explosives/explosions. Guns are especially useful when you consider that these zombies are actually quite sharp - they move fast and attack fast. As a developer said in an interview, if you're dealing with say, two zombies in close proximity; no sweat if you know what you're doing. More than two, and things get problematic. Melee encounters with hordes are desperate pleas for death.  So ultimately what this game offers is three different variants of the same game, but they all share the same focus on building a community and rescuing other survivors. I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Pc version on Win 10 64 bit.  I think I have enough hours played in order to make a totally informed opinion. This game is quaint but if you love it, you really love it and can't put it down. Year One Survival Edition has game and both expansions, has upgraded graphics and new characters and content.  What it is: a mix of a shooter/hack n slash, base building, leveling of skills and base facilities, driving, making items, finding items, and going on various random missions.  The first game is a run through with built in tutorial, and is story driven. The second is the open sandbox mode and has 99 levels that get harder, faster, and nastier (bosses get more numerous and start getting perks they didn't have before). The third game is a set mission driven, base denial type game that sees the zombie apocolapse from the military viewpoint.  You will need a graphics card capable of DX11 but don't expect UHD graphics. Gameplay immersion is awesome and you will jump out of your seat if you round a corner and a zombie does a leap attack or the wife grabs your shoulder to get your attention (yes, I jumped out of my skin and she is still laughing). Any game that gets you that involved is something worth playing.  The downside is the engine they had to use sometimes allows zombies to go through closed doors and some other collision effects. I would have liked to see the company continue working on the game to polish minor points that could be improved but you get used to the glitches and they really don't detract from the game much.  Death is permanent for that character but you just transfer to the next playable character. You have to work at morale so that the others in your house are friends, thus playable. If you don't like 'death is final' games and just like to die, get up, continue, rinse and repeat then this game is not for you. I personally like the fact that you have to play intelligently and wisely so you avoid death situations, get really upset when you lose a hero that you invested time in, but sign a huge relief if you survive the encounter and limp back to base to tag out to another hero.  As of this post I am at Breakdown level 58 and ready to move on to 59. I think you will like the game but watch out for the feral zombies because they are the worst!",

            "review_text": "I own the original. Bought this one even though people said it's not worth it, and that it didn't add much if you have the original. But I knew what I was buying it for. I wasn't looking for the new character, or the 'better graphics', etc. I was looking for the increased difficulty scaling in levels.  In that department it delivered in aces. The challenge is real. And that's what made me like this game in the first place... it's just so... much... fun.  What people say about bugs is true. Sometimes the zombies walk through the walls. But instead of ticking me off, and wanting to ask for a refund... it instead made me go 'OOOOH SH**' and started fighting. It did not rob me of my fun... I was having a blast. Once I did encounter a bug where I had to exit then continue... had to start the mission over. I encountered it once through all my play. Whatever... I can live with that... it's just so much fun.  It got to a point where I stopped noticing some zombies passing through walls. Because when your survivor stands up after searching (even silently), zombies right outside will notice you. Before you know it there's 15 zombies inside the room with you. Quite frankly you won't care (nor notice) that 3 of them passed through the wall... because a dozen of them just crashed through the window.  There's nothing better than seeing the super-awesome powerhouse that is Amelia Crasman bust through the door of a house filled with zombies, eating a snack... and running the OTHER DIRECTION... leaving both the house and her vehicle behind in the background. Because seriously... that house is a job for a survivor I DON'T like. The size of hordes in this game is unreal... the days of casually standing there and fighting off an entire horde with just 1 or 2 snacks are over.  You know what's worse than fat zombies? Fat zombies who bring their fat zombie friends for a party at your house. Yep. Even worse... at higher levels... when you are grabbed by a fat zombie, it's instant death... there's no wiggling out of it.  Bloaters galore? Out of ammo? No car? You mean I have to walk across the field jam packed with ferals with only 3 snacks? Everybody sick and dying? I'm actually struggling to survive? COUNT ME IN!!  This new edition enhances this game's crowning jewel... the fun factor. And for me, that was more than worth the price.",

            "review_text": "Short version:  Standard Edition Owned = 5/10 - Skip it (unless making ammo in Breakdown is essential for you)  No Version Owned = 8/10 - A really great zombie game with some slight RPG elements and a solid survival feel.   Long Version:  Having put a metric ton of hours into both this version and the old version, I can with confidence say there are some significant differences between the two. Firstly, the actual entire reason I bought the YOSE version after having bought and played the standard version is that you can have the Munition shops now make ammunition in both the base game as well as breakdown. This alone makes a significant difference in the gameplay experience, if you are one of those who enjoying going through all the levels of Breakdown. It makes skilling your survivors out in guns skills actually worth it, which is something I wanted desparately from the start. However, this REALLY should have been a free update rather than a whole new buy. This fact alone makes this a hard pill to swallow and has made me question if I would buy anything from this company again.  Graphics are much improved, however stuttering is still a big problem, mainly when driving around at high speeds. This is particularly noticable in Lifeline as there is a lot of smoke and fire effects with most of the map being highway full of burning wrecks. You need to have a beefy system, quite a bit more than even the minimum specs as it doesn't appear to be well optimized for PC (surprise surprise). Even with an 8 core with 24 gigs of RAM and various Gforce 900 series cards, I still get significant framerate drops while driving around. However, it is still impressive given there are no loading screens for the quite large open map.   Still, it looks nicer that the standard edition, but runs worse.  As I said, you can now craft ammunition in breakdown and the base game, which is a game changer (for me anyway). You can make snacks and coffee in the kitchen now as well. A few more vehicles have been added like the Army truck from Lifeline is now available in Breakdown, as well as the ability to repair your vehicles in Lifeline, which is nice, not having to just ditch the Army trucks when they start smoking anymore.  For me, most of the bugs from the old version have been cleared up, but some new different bugs have been introduced which can be just as annoying. No more driving at full speed and then for no reason the physics engine decides it wants you to visit the moon, and launches you 500 feet into the air. Your survivor then automatically bails out of the car mid flight, and you get to watch as one of your best survivors plummets to their death with nothing you can do but watch in utter horror. Now however, doors/gates seem to offer very little benefit with stopping zombies, since about 50-75% of the time, they just walk right through them, which can make things particularly frustrating (and deadly) in Lifeline sieges.  So all in all you get a cleaner interface, some animation changes (blades skill animation has been tweeked slightly), better graphics, a few (very nice) guns, some olds bugs replaced by new bugs, the ability to craft ammo, snacks, and coffee, and some new survivors (Lifeline characters have been added to Breakdown). If you own the standard game, and none of the things mentioned interest you, then I'd say give this one a pass. If you don't own the standard copy and like zombie games, then I would absolutely recommend you get this version.",

            "review_text": "State of Decay was originally released in 2013 on the Xbox 360 and PC and two years later in 2015 we have a remaster known as Year One Survival Edition. I originally played the game in 2014 on my Xbox 360 and had hours to spend on it. I decided to buy the PC version when a new version of State of Decay was released, but the original version was taken off steam. I'm going to be reviewing the actual game itself, if you want to know the difference between this remaster or the original, then these are the differences. The game has been remastered, so that just means better graphics, less bugs and problems and more smooth gameplay, and the game has ticked all those boxes. But the most notable difference is that this version contains all the DLCs for free. If you have already got the original State of Decay on your PC, then I do not reccommed you buy this. Unless you want the DLCs and improvments to the original and you're willing to pay £23 or around $30 for this, just stick with the original.   Onto the actual game itself, you start off at a fishing lake getting attacked by zombies or as they though it was 'a cannibal family picnic'. You end up at a police building where you meet some other survivors. You and your friend, 'Ed' search houses and find a woman who's friends were killed. Eventually you make it out of the mountains and into a town where you meet a girld called 'Lilly' who you met on a radio. After that, you have your own free will to do whatever you feel. The story is slightly bare as the cutscenes are just as advanced as the camera system you have when you're still playing. But the gameplay is what makes State of Decay so good.  No other game is like State of Decay, it's a bit like a mix of GTAV, DayZ and Telltale's The Walking Dead. If that appeals to you, you will love this. As the game is open world, you can go anywhere in the Trumbull county. There are several towns to explore and lots of long countryside roads, but you will spendf most of your time inside the town your base is in and looting it. There are some vehicals to drive which you will probably blow up in 10 minutes and attract a load of zombies and there are tons of buildings to loot. But knowing where to start is up to you. This game makes you make choises by your own instinct.  Combat is very well designed when your attacked by zombies. You wack them with a mele weapon or just beat them to death. One zombie is easy, even ith no weapons and low stamina, you could take one on and not lose any health, but when your attacked by a dozen, it gets hard. You will automitically lock onto the zombie your facing and repeatedly smash it until it's head breaks. But when another zombie attacks you from behind, it will jump on you forcing you to try and shake it off. One thing to know is that this game is slightly over the top with gore. You can sneak up on a zombie and kill it by grabbing onto the head and smashing it on the the floor. Not to mention this game has some finshing moves that look badass. In terms of weapons, you have a lot but only really two types of mele weapons. If your using things like hammers, hatchets, cricket bats, you do quick slashes on zombies that take about five hits. But if you use big sledgehammers or an axe then you will do big swings at the zombies taking only three hits, but more time. This is simular to Skyrim with one and two handed weapons.  In terms of guns, they nail this too. You will often be scrounging for weapons, and you may come across a gun shop or police department, in that case, bingo! Because guns are very useful in some cases, in some missions you will have to protect NPCs from zombies by barricading houses and attacking the zombies. Often you are left with no choice but to shoot some, especially some of the 'freak' zombies. When you scavenge for ammo, you will not find a lot, making every shot count. You can get many guns, pistols, rifels, assult rifels, shotguns, even grenade launchers (not common).  AI is alright, the zombies aren't meant to be Einstein so they are pretty easy to sneak past when you are crouching. But when your trying to survive the apocalypes, you may make a lot of noise, and this noise willcertainly attract zombies. Shooting, driving, running, jumping, fighting, scavenging will lure zombies towards you, which can be difficult because you will be doing a lot of the previously listed activities. This is also useful when you need to make a distraction, using firecrackers will make lots of noise, attracting zombies in the area so you can get past or loot. The actual zombies come in many forms, some are stronger than others but the strongest are the 'freaks'. These zombies are much more tough or deadly, especially juggernauts. These are huge zombies with look like they have mixed DNA with a bear and tank, these are incredibly hard to kill.  Your community is controlled by you and your influence. Influence is kind of a 'symbolic currency' in your community which you can use to spend on different things. You can ask to find supplies or make outposts where you can store supplies or make facilities in your base, the concept is very useful. You earn influence by doing missions such as saving people, finding people, finding supplies, killing 'freaks', looting houses, talking to people and other activities. Your community also needs to feel safe, so that means you need lots of supplies and not a lot of zombies in your town, and no infestations. These are a sort of nest for zombies where they live and eat and if you don't clear infestations, your community may slowly fall apart.  You can find new members to join your community to help you survive, but this also means another mouth to feed, and supplies are rare once you have scavenged most of them. Your map shows the whole of Trumbull county and has crosses on the houses you have already scavenged. So sooner or later you will need to find a way to escape Trumbull county by following the main missions which lead to an alright story, what you would expect off a zombie survival game. I personaly had no problem with the ending, but I know many found it dissapointig. But this is a spoiler free review so I will not say anything else.  There are several vehicals to drive, but as I previously mentioned they tend to be about as safe as petrol and fire. Some vehicals are big and protected with a lot of space to store supllies and some are small and fast with little protection. One thing to note is that youi can change your character to go on house raids or when your character dies you can change to another member of your community, and then find the supplies of your last character. This game also has a very nice soundtrack along with very nice graphics. I remember the first time I tried to go on a scavenge in State of Decay was at night and I was too worried to fight the zombies in case it attracted more. So I was just sneaking from bush to bush, hiding from the zombies, along with the beautiful soundtrack.  But like most games, I do still have my fair froblems with the game. First, you don't really feel any connection to the other members of your community, when another member joins, it just means less space but more help. The only characters I ever really cared for were Marcus (the character you start with), Lilly, Ed (your friend at the beggining) and Maya (another early character you meet). And the game is slightly buggy. It doesn't feel very polished at times, but this is easily passable by the fun gameplay itself.  Overall, if your looking for a zombie survival game that isn't just buggy multiplayer or the slaughter of millions of zombies, I can't reccommend this to you enough. Despite the lack of polish this game has, you will get hours of fun from it. 9/10 Not a masterpiece, but real damn close!",

            "review_text": "Still one of the best of its type out there. *Has base building and people management(you can only control one person at a time). *Resource gathering seem like an adventure in itself. *Unique skills and traits that heroes and sometimes other survivors will have when you acquire them. *Later levels which feature more dangerous zombies like Ferals and Juggernauts are pretty exciting(also they are now more dangerous as compared to the first version of the game).  The campaign seem more of a tutorial on how to play it. The other two modes, Lifeline and Breakdown are the main meat of this game. The campaign is great for the first playthrough. I really like the story. But after that, there is really no point in replaying it other than exploring one or two alternate consequences for your decisions which is nothing major. The main ending will still be the same.  Odd stuff:  *Characters have rpg type elements added to them like shooting skills and melee skills, and also stealth skills. Some of these skills takes a long time to develop and seems out of place for a game where you can't control whether the character will meet their death(causes like depression, sickness, or getting killed by other chars).   *Some bugs like zombies occupying the same space as a fence or a wall(common) and at times can walk through doors(uncommon) have not been fixed since the very first version of this game.  Overall I'd still recommend this game as the good experience I've had with it is far more than the few annoyance with it.",

Seriously, read some of them, they're pretty salty over nothing. As for the complaints about graphics, perhaps they just need to upgrade their hardware, because I've ran into very few stutters as some have claimed. You do see a little flickering on some distant images, but its really not bad at all. This game is absolutely fantastic, ranking well into my top 10 favorite games of all time; and that says a lot considering how many fantastic titles I've played in my lifetime. This game really makes you put in the effort to keep everyone alive and satisfied, without feeling grueling and overbearing. I waited until i put in over 10 hours before deciding to make this review, just in case it was an easily beat, or at the very least quick to beat kind of game. I can say without doubt, i'm not even close to half way though, and that's without touching the DLC yet. So please, give this game a chance, especially if you can while its on sale, you wont regret it. Even if its no longer on sale by the time you come across it, its well worth full price. I recommend this title to anyone into survival games, games similar to The Walking Dead, or just looking for a game to invest time in.   Rating 9/10 (Would me a solid 10 but only a a very rare select few titles get a 10 in my book.)  Cons- Zero. I've yet to find anything about this game to warrant a con. Small things, like a few minor graphics issues are to be expected from a game that's not made by some super development corporation. These people obviously worked their asses off.",

Either I have to shut them myself or they shut automatically but in this game half the time the doors are automatic and half the time they're not. Still I recomend this game because the concept and the basic mechanics are sound. This is one of the most realistic zombie games that I've played and I like that it revolves around a sense of community instead of you being a lone wolf trying to do everything. And while it can get annoying to have been playing for 20 minutes for your survivor to get fatigued and you either have to switch out for someone else or stop playing for a while, I feel like it works with the realisim. No one can do everything all the time as much as we want to.",

This is not a review of indignant entitlement.  This game is NOT Hugely different from the original, there are a few new questlines, some tweaks, characters all have a combat knife so when their melee weapon breaks they don't do repetetive kicks like they did. There are a couple new weapons and the campaigns all share vehicles and weapon drops.  The part that doesn't get talked about much is that the graphics engine is substantially improved, it wasn't just a texture package, the UI, shadows, and geometries were also improved, resolutions run higher and the framerate is actually better.   there are mods on the nexus that can make the original game much better, but they don't approach the visual fidelity that the YOSE version does. I bought this game in part to support devs that built something unique. I both this one and the original on sale, and i don't regret either.   IF you've never played the original this game is EPIC, its on my top 10 all time games list, next to titles like Skyrim, Lego Marvel Superheroes, Bioshock, Tomb Raider, X3TC/AP, and Command and Conquer 3.  if you've played the original and wish to see some improvements, most of them are here, there are also mods to correct the few remaining flaws on this one.",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: I played the original State of Decay, on PC, and loved it despite all its flaws.  So what about SoD:YOSE? Well, it's more of the same minus the most obvious flaws, that's mainly the weirdly behaved renderer, which seemed to render at 720p internally, then upsampled everything to whatever resolution you had chosen, doing so without any sort of filtering. So it looks a lot better now. Still no antialiasing option in the game's menus, but you can always force that from your video-card control panel. The engine still isn't very good at streaming the world geometry in a fluid fashion, so the fps still drops significantly at times, slowing the gameplay down A LOT in the process, but that usually doesn't last for more than a second. Might also be a lot less noticeable on a SSD, I'll have to give that a try... Lastly, the quests' progression will still get stuck when some random zombies forget to get into the quest area and you'll still have to either chase them down or wait for them to despawn in order for the mission continue.  In conclusion, I'd say it's not exactly the facelift I was hoping for. The graphics still look sort of dated, the engine still can't handle the size of the map (I could fit the game 8 times in RAM, but the engine insists on swapping and streaming from the HDD like it's 2008), the zombie AI still gets in the way... But you know what? It's still a great survival/resource management game, probably the best in the zombie flavor: numerous quests, some generic, some unique; nice story; great character management/progression system. Plus you get all the DLCs, which are pretty good. I'd say you get a lot of game for your money... even if some small part of me still wishes it would have been released as a free update for those who already had it, because if you only sort of liked the first iteration, I'm not sure what little changed can justify buying the game a second time. Me, I had a great time with it, and I'm having an even better time with this one.  TLDR: Is it worth a buy? If you like the zombie survival genre and didn't get the original game, yes. Definitely. If you already have State of Decay, you may give it a pass, unless you really liked the game or you feel the horrible upscaling-with-worst-possible-filtering engine prevented you from truely enjoying it.",

It's a game you could easily sit and play for hours on end, it's somewhat addicting and it always has things such as side missions that wants you to not stop playing.

For the vet players who own the original SOD and are debating about buying this one, think about if the new additions are worth the price tag to you. The game itself is basicly the same except with a few tweaks, visual improvements, new characters in breakdown and some of the breakdown challenges changed.  For new players: State of Decay is a sandboxish zombie survival RPG. You switch between different survivors that have their own perks and personalities and try to gather supplies to help your group survive. There are lots of different weapons to use and there is a small RPGlike skill system. For example, if you spec a survivor in using blunt weapons then when that skill levels up enough you can pick 1 of 2 attacks for the survivor to learn. With firearms depending on what type the survivor specs in you can get better firerate, longer distance lockons, etc. The game also features perma-death so if your survivor dies, they are gone for good which adds a bit of tension when your trying to escape a horde or dealing with one of the 'freaks'.  There are 3 modes in the game that you can play and they are:  Storymode: The one you want to start with as it explains how you play the game. You follow the story of 3 survivors and without any spoilers, basicly work on surviving and expanding your base as you help other survivors out and start learning about whats going on in the world.  Breakdown: The main survival part of the game. You start out with a random survivor, pick an enclave group to join, then get to work surviving. The main goal is to find an RV and fix it up. Once you do that you pick which survivors you want to take with you to the next level and repeat. With each level resources become more scarce and zombies become more populated. There are also challenges that when you complete them, unlock hero characters which have their own special perks and bonuses. Theres a small escort quest to bring them to your base and from then on if you restart breakdown you can then choose that hero to start with instead of a random survivor.  Lifeline: This mode is unique because you take on the role of the army inside a city crawling with the infected. Your job is to simply scavenge supplies while extracting key VIP targets and any civilians you find. The key difference in this mode is that after a period of time you have to fight of a siege of the infected which gets steadily more difficult as you move on.  To sum it up, State of Decay ( or SOD ) is one of the best zombie games out there at least in my opinion. If you've never owned the original SOD and were interested in grabbing it, then yes I would reccomend this to you 100%. As for vet players though, I know alot of them are angry about the support being dropped for the original and they do have a right to be. Its purely up to them if they want to buy this version for only a few new features.  For new players this is perfect for you. For the old vets, again just think if spending the money is worth for the extra features that they threw in.",

Zed's move differently, and they changed the unarmed combat. -Cleaner looking interface. -Some of the features in Lifeline have now been added to the main game and Breakdown. -A new mission type, with new special weapons. -Grenade launcher attachement and incendiary shotguns. -More vehicles and some new skins. -One new character is included (if you bought the original game). -You can now play as Hawkes, Kilo, Vince and Sasquatch. (More dialogue was recorded for Breakdown). -More music in game. -Increased number of Zeds.  There are still some problems with the game.

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I'm reviewing this game as its own thing. IMO if you already own State of Decay and its associated DLC this is nothing more than a 1080p graphical update and is not worth the upgrade.   PC Specs (just in case):  AMD FX6300 NVidia GTX760 8GB of RAM  Played on a Microsoft Xbox 360 controller  What can I say about State of Decay other than it is the best zombie survival game in the market. It does a number of things really well:  1) Make every character feel unique  While you will always start with the 3 same characters, the community members you can acquire and how you build your characters can differ tremendously playthrough to playthrough. My first go at this game (in the 720p version) is completely different than my just finished 15 hours of playthough (on the Vanilla campaign). This game rewards smart play, some characters are more suited to melee and some for gunplay and building your characters around these strengths can help greatly or you can take the added risk of building evenly on every character. By the end of the campaign, I had three characters suited for gunplay, three for melee and two all-rounders and tasked each group to specific mission types. Everyone had a backstory and I tried to incorporate this into my decision making as I roleplayed them for what I thought each character would do in real-life. Each character also suffers permadeath and nothing is more heart-breaking than watching a character you build get destroyed by a silly move in a routine scavenging mission although after one or two deaths, you'll usually know when to pick your fights.  2) Simulate a zombie apocalypse.   Resources are scarce and while there are ways to end up not having to worry about resource A or B more often than not you'll run short on Resource C or D (there are five in total Food, Medicine, Ammo, Materials and Fuel). These resources are also consumed as the game is turned off meaning that you'll have to log in to check on the health of your community and to scavenge what you need. Which segues well into my next point. This game requires resource management. While you may be overflowing with food, not having enough medicine to stave off the flu or materials to maintain your defenses can and will spell certain doom. Adding to that is the fact that you can and will run out of resources, so it is a battle against time to stockpile resources and find a way out. Additionally, you will need to balance your time out as well. You will need to decide whether you want to clear the path around you or pursue story or community missions or scavenge for resources. You can roleplay as the hero of the community or the leader of your own isolated community depending on what you choose.  3) Combat is kinda awesome  There is nothing more awesome IMO that kneeing a zombie's skull open, or taking an oar and beating the crap out of multiple zombies. Melee combat in this game is great! You have your attack, dodge or (as I call it) space making moves that allow you to dictate melee fights with zombies. However, get overrun and surrounded and you will die. On the controller the Left Bumper (forgot the keyboard equivalent) allows you to add more power to your attacks, dodge further and finish grounded enemies all with the added cost of more stamina meaning that you can't just spam the attack button all the time.   Gunplay is tight as guns react as you'd expect forcing you to choose the range of engagements depending on the weapon you choose. Pistol's can't one tap enemies from as far as a rifle can, but rifles don't have the rate of fire as pistols do. Assault weapons are a happy medium but ammo for them is scarce and automatic firing will burn through ammo. There are plenty more weapons and I enjoyed using all of them, none of them felt particularly overpowered (though any weapon that can take a silencer should be top priority picks) and filled each niche appropriately.   4) Story  The story was in my opinion strongly average, there are some bits where you have to fill it in with your imagination but the game's narrative is relatively realistic with well-written dialogue. Needlessly to say, this is the most subjective part and I'll leave you to make this decision on your own.   In short, this is in my opinion the best zombie game out there and you should buy it if you are new to the series. Hordes of zombies can be either terrifying or exhilarating to fight against depending on how prepared you are to face them. In between all the fighting there's managing your community, resources and characters. Sprinkled on top of all this is a great melee combat system and great gunplay. The story is what you make of it honestly, I found it adequate to keep my playing and motivated to finish the game but it isn't going to win awards. Some technical stuff below.  Technical stuff  Graphics: Decent looking. I had everything on the Max preset (there's the Ultra preset after Max) and the game looked beautiful at times. What really detracted from the experience was the game slowdowns as you moved from area to area. It almost felt like the game kept reloading assets of the upcoming parts of the map leading to some noticeable stutter.   Sound: I liked how everything in this game sounded. Zombies whether aggressive or not sounded suitably dead and menacing. The guns sounded great, melee weapon effects were also pretty good. The ambiance came together very well for me.",

            "review_text": "There was a bit of debate and some doubt in my mind whether or not to get State of Decay: YOSE after reading a bunch of the reviews and seeing all the thumbs down. I have the older State of Decay and all the DLC for it already and I did enjoy that one greatly.I also had a few mods installed and I feel Yose adds what I already added in mods for the first State of Decay, which is a good thing. Now I don't have to add mods to get the experience I wanted with the first State of Decay. I like what they did with their zombie game, third person, having perma death, having to run a community of survivors the whole lot. I have gladly wasted many many hours. I certainly recommend the first one. If you are on the border about getting or not getting this. just go to youtube and watch a few videos and or reviews, find out with your own opinion about this game by seeing actual gameplay.  After playing this one for a bit I have no problem recommending this one as well. Sure i've seen a few weird zombie glitches, maybe a zombie gets stuck or you hit C to dodge and he grabs you anyways or you swing and somehow he manages to hit you brushing off your hit as wind in his hair, not really game breaking in my opinion, makes your odds less and in my opinion more fun as I welcome the challenge of staying alive. I also noticed the zombies like to spawn pretty fast even though I dispatch a ton and feel the area should be clear they keep on coming in waves appearing from thin air right in front of me. But I don't mind Killing zombies, it's fun and gets your stats up.  Most people say the game has frame drops, that it isn't optimized, the previous game ran smoother and it doesn't look better than the previous State of Decay, or it's not worth $20 for the 'exact' same game. I have not had any of these problems. I don't know what hardware people are using. I am on a modern mid level gaming computer ($600), I have my game settings maxed out. It does run smoother, it looks better, I have no problem with any lighting or shading, everything renders fine, and there is no black border in full screen as I read in one or two reviews, I also saw that people don't like the load screens or the load screens take too long. I have not encountered a load screen that was longer than a few seconds 20 or 30 seconds if even that, at the most, besides those everything is pretty instant in my experience. All I can say about this is make sure your computer meets the requirements.  Onto the $20 is too much. I like what the devs made as a game and I am willing to support them so they will continue to make more for this game, or more games in general, sure you could argue this should be DLC, there's not enough content to resell it at this price etc. I haven't gone through everything in the game and encountered every single bit just yet, but so far I have used the SUV, I have an SKS w/ 40mm grenade launcher, i've used the new melee weapons and the new character which has new animations. I like what I have seen and used so far and I have confidence I will like the rest of the game just as much if not more as I reintroduce myself to State of Decay.  Conclusion: If you don't already have State of Decay and you like zombie games along with slight base and resource management, pick this up. If you want to upgrade and relive your older State of Decay adventures, pick this up.  Review Update: 5/21/2015  I would like to address the people who are 'stuck' in windowed mode and have incorrect mouse coordination in game, simply hit alt+enter to go full screen and fix the mouse. Simple fix. Another thing almost everyone is complaining about the fact they are buying the 'same game' and it's not updated enough to be worth buying again. Why is everyone so surprised when they buy it? Guess what? it IS the same game, it is remastered, aka they added slight improved graphics, textures, more weapons, characters etc. but it is still State of Decay. This is not a new game, it is not State of Decay 2. Just like when they patch an mmo. Same game with a little more than before the patch.  I have not had any game breaking problems with bugs, glitches, or crashes as of yet. I played through the first two levels of breakdown and have not lost any survivors, heroes, vehicles, whatever to any bug or glitch. I have completed all my sieges and have not had any special zombies come through closed doors. No followers get stuck due to bad path finding, or die from bad path finding. I have used the incendiary shotguns and the knife fighting which are both really fun in my opinion. I have also encountered most if not all of the vehicle paint jobs and vehicle variants which I find sort of funny and nice to see at the same time. I like the new variety, but I feel some of the paint jobs are a little much, but still fun.  I am still enjoying the game as I wrote in my first part of the review. and I still recommend the game if you have not owned the original or if you enjoyed the first and are buying it for a second time.",

If you never owned State of Decay or don't have the DLCs before this is a good purchase Yose edition gives you both the DLC with the original game.  If you already owned State of Decay with all DLC I recommend waiting for it to go on sale, you wont be waiting long State of Decay has been on sale on steam over a dozen times at one point the biggest discount was 80% off.    Some of the new features added to the game by YOSE include  A new mission that appears in all 3 game modes where mystery supply drops appear drawing hoards of enemies, that even the most experienced players will have a challenge beating.    A handful of unique skinned cars which perform slightly differently to their original including slightly faster but take more damage.     New fully voiced characters to unlock in the breakdown mode.    One new vehicle type the SUV.     Returning players who decide to purchase Yose will find  More enemies to deal with than before being loud and reckless is much more risky.    Special infected such as the Feral appearing far more frequently and in greater numbers (especially in breakdown)    Ferals are now far more evasive when trying to run them down in a car    Facilities in the original campaign and breakdown now have the features of making snacks and ammo.    New sounds and weapons and voiced dialogue.    The journal/menu is noticeably better looking with sharper images on items.    New combat animations with edged weapons and unarmed combat being particularly brutal.   As i said at the top of my post the game does have its bugs and some can be quite annoying a few close to game breaking.    Bugs worth mentioning  I had to manually set my resolution and screen aspect using the in game menu.    Sometimes when alt tabbing the game goes into a windowed mode.    Zombies occasionally clip through doors    Friendly AI can be slow or unresponsive, especially when they really need to be.    small frame drops when the game loads up the city areas as you drive into them.   My Computer is running Windows 7 64bit Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.5GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 16GB RAM  The game runs at 60 FPS on the in game ultra settings for me almost consistently except for the brief second it takes when loading up the city areas while driving a fast car, but after its loaded its back to a solid 60 fps.  I recommend this game if you haven't played State of Decay before, otherwise wishlist it and wait for a sale.",

Because the truth is, if you've never played this game or you own the original, I'd recommend it nonetheless. Its the only real single-player driven zombie survival experience you're really going to find that delivers on the survival front AND gives you some interaction with the world itself in the form of other NPC survivors.  While I've played 7 Days to Die (and I do recommend that game) and Project Zomboid (another great game but it still has a long way to go) and a few others, I found myself playing this one out of the batch the most. Mostly because the worlds in those games are...well, empty currently, though I intend to revisit them when NPCs survivors are added.  While the world itself is solid and interactions with it are limited (you can board up houses, establish outposts, rescue other survivors but you can't say, build an entirely new building from the ground up) it delivered what I had hoped and that was a zombie experience with some drive beyond, 'I'm going to go on and on and on...' because while survival is fun, it is not inherently interesting if that is all you're doing (in a virtual space, mind you).   Plus, the game gets downright difficult as time progresses; there are some serious heavy weight zombies that you don't even want to run into while you're driving a vehicle. Your insurance won't cover it, trust me.  TL;DR  Day Z (can't blame you, its a long ♥♥♥ deathmatch not a zombie survival game) not your thing but you want a zombie focused survival game? Pick it up.   Already own it? Pick it up on sale because the fix to the draw distance, graphical tuning are good but not worth the full price if you already own the original and all the expansion packs. I agree with the notion that this is how it should have been to begin with but I disagree that the developers should be 'punished' for that, especially since they were primarily focused on a console released way back when.",

If we are to review ONLY the new parts of the game, then it's one thing. But if we are to review this as a whole game, for new and unaware players, then all this criticism are misplaced. Therefore these negative reviews is a shot to the head on a really great game.  If you are new to this game and you like the Zombie/survival genre, then this is (in my opinion) one of (if not THE) the best game there is to date. You get to survive/live in a pretty realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic zombie-virus outbreak. Vehicles, basebuilding, team-management, permadeath and scavaging. Done in a really genial way. Even with some RPG elements!  What needs to be fixed is the framrate/optimization issue. When travelling by car the game does not run very well, a problem I never had with the original. And a very personal opinion of mine, as I understand the hordes (maybe zombie overall) spawnrate has been increased. One of the (by me) strongest sides of SoD compared to other games in the same genre is that there is peaks of intensity. Your not overun 24/7, the world can seem silent and peaceful one minute and then hell breaks loose the next. I really hope it will stay that way.  So. If your into the Zombie/survival genre, for the survival ideas, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game and worth every penny! Can't wait for the sequel!",

Being new to the game, I read the reviews, and despite the negative recommendations because this edition should have been a patch instead of a remastered version, I got it anyways. The indications of poor graphics performance and poor physics were fairly slight in the reviews, while predominant complaints were the former, so I thought, how bad could it be? Let me tell you new comers, it's that bad. Let me break down the problems this game faces.  -sluggish controls; The action you try to perform may or may not be done on the first button press. This leads to over zealous and useless button mashing.  -Zombies literally spawn right in front of you and are attacking you before they are visibly spawned in. This is most notable when the game decides to mess you up, you'll see a few zombies, go whale on them, the music will kick into more serious tones, then you are swarmed with zombies that were nowhere around 2 seconds ago. You'll start seeing them spawn in right behind a zombie you are executing. -team npcs are obviously programmed to be more of a nuciance than a help. They are notorious about standing in doorways, not attacking enemies until the last second. They will NOT help you carry stuff, such as supplies you find, which really makes them pretty useless. You cannot direct them to move, attack or anything otherwise useful. -The camera is not your friend. Half the battle is keeping up with the camera. Especially while driving. Nothing says pain in the @$$ like driving with the WASD scheme and rotating the camera manually. 90% of all car accidents in this game is due to blind spots from the camera nemesis. When fighting, sometimes all you can see is the back side of a zombie or your head. -Aiming can be a real pain in the nether region. Scoped weapons aren't truely scoped, as you only zoom in ever so slightly, but the sight is still over the shoulder, and it leads to frustratingly difficult long shots. Against all survival guide recommendations, spray and pray will end up being the order of the day when you inevitably get swarmed, hopefully you brought enough snacks, painkillers and a backup melee weapon because it's gonna turn into melee when you run out of ammo. -Vehicle physics seem to have been written by a toddler, because the physics are either as stiff as a board or as bouncy as a rubber ball. Run over a zombie, you may dent your hood, or you may take your vehicle for a tour of the solar system, you're at the whim of random physics. On that note, if walking everywhere wasn't a sure recipe for disaster because of materializing zombies, it would be easier to walk. -Walls and doors may or may not stop a zombie attack or the flames from a molotov. -Street curb can be an invisible barrier. Make sure you take a running leap to get up on that sidewalk. -To search containers, you have to position yourself perfectly in front of it, you can't open that cooler lid standing beside it, because that's IMPOSSIBLE, the same goes for entering and exiting vehicles as well as putting items in the storage compartment. -Climbing down a ladder can be a perilous endeavor. Sometimes you'll climb down normally, othertimes you'll swan dive off the platform. Oh, did I mention how the useless NPCs like to stand in front of doors? Yeah, they do that with ladders too. Feel free to push them off, not that you'll teach them any kind of lesson but you'll feel better... -Last but not least; the missions are so repetitive, and absolutely pointless... '&lt;insert name&gt; is in a tough spot.' blah blah blah... The idle NPCs constantly go out, need help, and never bring anything back for the trouble, just a time sink. You can ignore them, but you'll start having morale problems unless you bring back supplies constantly. You also run the risk of losing members, especially before you have all your outposts.  Oh, and, whoever decided how much items weigh really needs to spend some time figuring out how much stuff really weighs. If a person struggles to carry an assault pack filled with a hatchet, 30 rounds of 5.56, a rifle, 3 bottles of asprin, 3 MRE, and 3 grenades, I don't think they would be much use in the military, let alone the apocolypse. And military trained personel who takes 20-30 seconds' to change a magazine? I'm looking at you Lifeline.   The game has promise, but I think between the dev's ADD and the DRM (i.e. lack of any community fixes) it's going to be a broken promise. Graphically and functionally this game is on par with Xbox1 and the PS2 era, though the concept is there for a great modern game. Very sad, and I wanted to like this game so badly. My recommendation, if you absolutely must get it, wait for a sale, but I bet you'll still be disappointed.",

If you own State of Decay, Breakdown, and Lifeline, you have no reason to get this game. The extra mission and character are not worth the $20 price tag. The items it adds are basically the same items that already exist with a different skin making them worthless to the package.  If you don't have the original State of Decay game but were thinking of picking it up, this is a great value and, in that situation, I could recommend the game. Otherwise, if you already own the games, steer clear of this game.",

So, how do I feel after playing the 'beautifully remastered' version of one of my favourite games? Rather disheartened and more than a little disappointed. Even within just over 30 minutes of gameplay I can see that not much has changed and by no means is this remastered.  If you already own the previous version then keep playing that. This so far offers not much in the way of improvement never mind anything new in the way of gameplay.  What I will say is that the trees look so much smoother and lighting is simply amazing compared to the original. Most textures are that bit smoother but where it really starts to fall apart is the people. I don't know if they look worse or if it is because the background looks better that the flaws/faults of their rather... clunky features just seems to shine through. Oh and for those who have played the previous version remember what a delight it was to have zombies clipping halfway through walls/windows and such? Yep. Still happening.  I realise I do not have that much time in this game but as somebody who has put in close to 100 hours into the original game and owns the DLCs for the original after half an hour I just feel rather disappointed and wished to warn those who have the game, do not pick this version of the game! For those of you who do not have the original and want to pick this game up, wait. Wait for half price or some decent patches because this 'remastered' game in its current state is not worth it.",

The combat was one of the clunkiest i had ever seen for a third-person shooter I'd never be able to count the amount of times I had swung my weapon (like a barn door) without connecting with anything only to have the zombie jump on to me. And if the combat wasn't bad enough you would always be graced by some glitch such as entering cars and getting stuck inside and then watching zombies try to pull you out of the car but failing each time. All in all, I think the game had a great idea behind it but next time try and release a complete game. It's because of people not putting the effort in to finish anything, and that's why we're headed for a depression.  (Edit: Buggier than any Bethesda game)",

After awhile and some tweaking I was able to get it all to work fine so at the 2hr nonrefundable point that makes me happy. I recommend getting the Year One edition, go to Nexus Mods, search 'state of decay' and search YOSE under that title and a few mods will come up. Unfortunately many of them don't work anymore, but there are just enough mods there to give the game a good refreshing. So get this if you don't mind having to spend some time fine tuning and even yelling at it a bit. It's worth it. Don't get it if glitches and squirrely gameplay get on your nerves.  Edited 12/8/16: Experiencing the lock-up glitch way too often. I just can't recommend this game until that issue is fixed.",
