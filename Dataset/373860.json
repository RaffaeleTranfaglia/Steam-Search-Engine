            "review_text": "Apothecarium is a passable HOG, though not a great one. Like many other reviewers, I encountered the flicker issue that made the game unplayable, but was able to make it go away by playing in windowed mode. Since windowed mode was still sufficiently large for the style of gameplay, I wasn't too upset by this.  Apothecarium has a few odd features for the genre. Instead of taking you back to replay HO scenes multiple times, you visit each only once in the course of the story, but can then replay them (presumably with a different target list) as much as you like from the main menu. Minigames can be similarly replayed. Most strangely, you can opt out of an HO section (and possibly the minigames) by choosing to play a Match-3 game instead. Also, coins and puzzle boxes are dotted around the screen. Opening puzzle boxes gives you random boosts (such as accelerating the hint timer) or coinage, while coins, in turn, allow you to purchase powerups at the main menu for use in the Match-3 game. Since I had no interest in the Match-3 gameplay (honestly, I bought an HO game  expecting  to hunt hidden objects, so why would I choose to play Match-3 instead?) I didn't make much use of this feature.  These oddities aside, Apothecarium hits all the usual notes of the HO genre. It has a pseudo-historical setting, a creepy antagonist, and the standard assortment of progress barriers with bizarre artifacts serving as keys. In a genre already rife with mediocrity and shovelware, Apothecarium doesn't manage to achieve much more than adequacy, but it  is  adequate, so I grant it the thumbs-up, if not entirely whole-heartedly.",

It is a cool looking game, but I'm spending as much time b*tching at it as I am playing it. The HOGs are having some issues such as: not recognizing the correct item (try clicking several times and around the item), bad naming ('clutch' is apparently a C-clamp), and multiples of a named item in a scene, but only one is correct. Some of the puzzles so far are intuitive. Some, I have no idea WTH I'm suppsed to do. NO instructions on the puzzles, even in Casual mode with tutorials open (because I thought maybe I missed something). I really dislike having to look at a strategy guide, not to SOLVE a puzzle, but just to figure out what you are supposed to do. Also, the having an appropriate tool in your inventory that will work, but it's not the 'right' tool, is irritating. So, I will put it aside for now and play something else. Maybe I'll come back to it. IDK...",
