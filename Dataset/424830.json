            "review_text": "  Bell Ringer is an indie platform figher game in the likes of Smash Bros, but with a much darker tone.  This game use Unreal 4 (game not for low PC)  As with any brawler it takes some time to get the hang of each characters playstyle and find your favorite fighter. All characters are unique enough and have their own weapons and special attacks.  The game offers bots with varied difficulty, and also online multiplayer (but havn't gotten around to try that out yet).  The sound effects are good and the music is very fitting to the games atmosphere.",

            "review_text": "'Bell Ringer is a fast paced arena PvP brawler' Quite honestly I can't see what's fast paced about this game. I beat the singleplayer campaign in 13 minutes, after finishing a single level with a character, and instantly changing afterwards. The animations feel slow, and the combat seems halfassed. If this is the developers first try at making a game then It's not actually too bad, however the game feels unfinished. I won't lie, I haven't tried the multiplayer, which this game is mostly about, but with the outlook of the fighting mechanics, I think I won't anyway. I wouldn't recommend this game, however if you're not too picky with your games and want a quick 5-10 minute game I won't judge. Just don't get your hopes up for staying with this game for long.",
