            "review_text": "Played with Consumer Oculus.  It's a rail shooter with some Zelda-like elements. You ride a boat you can minimally control down canals in a distinct art-styled Mesopotamian city (the learned archaeologist in me smiles). Get items such as shields and bows to defeat traps which you can either pick up or purchase at the shopkeep. Keys, maps, the whole shebang. Limited inventory keeps you on your toes as you fight off crocodiles and starvation. Eat to stay alive! Live vicariously through your fictional self by indulging in Turkish Delight (terrible in real life, would not recommend).  Aim with your head in-game, but controller appears to be required by the main menus (not the gameplay ones). Would be nice if in a future update, the controller was not required to navigate these!  Overall, a great little game. Not too expensive, some challenge to it.  I don't know if I'd recommend the swivel chair like the other guy said, I got wrapped up so bad I had to yell for my roommate to help. Standing is definitely recommended, but the game will definitely keep you on your toes.",
