            "review_text": "I like the puzzles, but the game is so short (less than 3 hours) and the controls are so bad that it's really hard for me to recommend it unless you catch it on sale.  To clarify on the controls, your camera is locked to isometric angles (sometimes your snake is obstructed from all isometric angles, though at least you can still drag its head if you know where it is behind obstructions), and clicking and dragging in 3D space is REALLY awkward. Your snake will often go in unintended directions because the tolerance between them is wonky, and then when you try to back it up it'll go loop around some more.",

            "review_text": "Snake Blocks is a great puzzle game - using the basic concept of Flow and making it 3D. The puzzles begin simple but ramp up in difficulty. Some of the 4 and 5-snake puzzles were really tough to solve and I enjoyed the challenge. The art and music are perfect for this type of game - clean, colorful, and not distracting.   Though I haven't used it much, I imagine that the puzzle creator could easily extend the playtime of this game to several hours.   Overall, I'm pretty happy with Snake Blocks. For a game under $5, it's a nice change of pace.",
