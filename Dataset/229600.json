    "description": "Bientôt l’été is a videogame for two players. Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras.",

            "review_text": "Game developers should be encouraged to challenge the status quo with narrative and mechanics, but I feel that there are certain best practices for game design that Tale of Tales often overlooks for no visible reason or benefit to the game. While Bientôt l'été has the most conventional controls and straightforward instructions of their games to date, it still suffers from the same problem: some strange design decisions have little to nothing to do with, and may even hinder the concept.  Imagine the PS3 game Journey: two players meet at random in a surreal world to make a connection. Except in Bientôt l'été, both players are chat robots stating phrases at random while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine, and playing chess (with a catch: you have to find the pieces first, but one at a time). The highlight of the game should be the multiplayer, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be very populated (a symptom of its avant garde concept, I guess), and the interactions are severely limited.  What should be a virtual date with a stranger in a surreal world becomes tedius, with no real interaction or connection with said stranger. Unlike Journey, which limits your characters' intractability to serve the purpose of the mechanics and design, Bientôt l'été's design stands at odds with its concept, preventing players from creating any kind of meaningful connections.",

In this game you walk around a strange, silent world and can interact with objects to gain chess pieces. You can then use the chess pieces to have a virtual conversation with a stranger. The more chess pieces you have the more options you have as far as things to say. The interesting thing is that you each play the role of lovers and so the conversation has a strange intimacy even though the participants themselves are strangers. The possibility is that you might share a moment of connection with a stranger over these bits and pieces of dialogue and action. However, I have played this game three or four times and have never been paired with a living person. The other choice is to participate in the conversation with a simulation. And in this case, interaction with a simulation is hollow and completely misses the point because there is no chance for that spark of human connection.  ",

Nothing is explained, not even the weird little mini games that comprise the entirety of the gameplay (oh, and walking). Don't go into this expecting any kind of consistent gameplay, story, objectives or characters. There is no narrator speaking sweet words of meaningful poetry like in the trailers. It's just walking, finding incredibly obscure 'clues' to further the castrated fragment of a story, playing chess with AI (since there is no one on multiplayer) and repeating the process again until there's just nothing left to do. I'm pretty sure the aim was for this to be a spiritual or transcendental experience of some depth but it just comes off as dry, pretentious and depressing. This, to me, is the video game equivalent of someone shooting paint out of their bumhole and calling it art.",

            "review_text": "This is an esoteric/walking simulator from France. Games in this genre are often very hit or miss and the good ones marry a deep experience with high quality graphics and art direction and a solid technical implementation. Bad ones don't. Bientôt l'été is unfortunately in the latter category.   At face value the game has you walking around on an empty beach (not a new experience for walking simulators). The twist is that eventually you'll collect a few 'romantic' thought concepts and share them in a cafe with another avatar played by another player.  The gimmick falls very flat and overall it's not very interesting. Esoteric games are very much a personal experience to discover the game which the developer in their quest for 'Art' eschews for the 2 player gimmick. Technical issues also detract from the experience.  Graphics: Thumbs down here because they actually try to charge more for high res textures. Otherwise okay but few options in fine tuning and shoddy 'film grain' makes everything look like mud.  Gameplay: Practically none - the 2 player gimmick is weird and doesn't make up for the lack of single player story. You're walking around on a beach.  Technical: The game works okay in 4K but the graphics engine is fairly weak and lacks fine tuning options like getting rid of the film grain. Worst of all is the game somehow assumes you have a flight sim HOTAS and maps all the buttons that way - and if you do have one, it binds the axes in bizarre and ridiculous ways - and there's no way to disable them, so you end up staggering around the beach like you're drunk. The shoddy 'film grain' effect does enhance the drunken experience.  Overall this game misses the mark by quite a way. If developers want to do 'art' instead of making an actual game, they need to exceed other games technical implementations. Falling behind on gameplay and delivery is a quick way to get a thumbs down.",
