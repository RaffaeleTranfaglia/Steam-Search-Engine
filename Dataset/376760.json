            "review_text": "What is Big Thinkers Kindergarten?  Big Thinkers Kindergarten is a point and click adventure / puzzle game aimed at a younger audience. You control Ben and his sister (?) Becky. Ben has the ability to transform into different animals and shapes, just like Fred Clever (Mort in English) from the Clever &amp; Smart (Mortadelo y Filemón, in English 'Mort &amp; Phil') comics by Francisco Ibáñez Talavera.  The objective of the game is to collect five kinds of stars and then win twice an end challenge that plays like a board game. For that I used around 50-60 stars, so one must collect quite a few to even begin with.  When first playing, one can (with the help of parents probably) enter his name and birthday, the name will be shown at the end of the game after beating the final challenge (although the game itself is seemingly an endless mode, so there is no end afterwards but rather can still play on and on).  The whole game is controlled with the mouse. It consists of a hub world and separate minigames. The hub world is a house and garden, the minigames range from spelling words over finding out what trash can be recycled to painting a face - or any picture. There are several flaws in this game, for example the menus can be brought up only by moving the mouse outside the screen (something that however was normal at the time the game was created, seeing as a similar mechanic was used in Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road). More severe are game-specific flaws. The trash game is difficult if you're a foreigner, but the severe flaws are in painting and the 'hide &amp; seek' game. The painting has an undo option that however seems to undo one action only (or maybe very few). The 'hide &amp; seek' makes it not always possible to solve the game with the given clues. Outdoor, on a dry place, on the left side of the map can by my definition have several possibilities. The other times I played the hints were enough, so maybe I just had bad luck the first time. Another flaw is that in the creative parts (painting, making music) your creativity is interrupted when you get stars.  The end of the game can be reached in an hour or maybe less, but this should not be a turn-off, since it is possible to play on afterwards, and I suppose children will take their time with it and not rush through like I did for review purposes (as such, I also did not play all minigames), so the asked price is fine, although the games by this publisher also go on sale sometimes. Personally I picked up the Humongous Complete Pack when it was 66 or 75 percent off, so if there is time, this is a great option to wait for.  The sound is nothing special, but it is noteworthy that the voice samples of each game repeat often. The graphics are not too good, but not bad either. The style easily allows for creative transformations of Ben. Interestingly, the minigames, especially the one where you read a book and replace words, sometimes have better graphics. They all look like just painted in 2D by a skilled but not master artist.  What remains is a compilation of minigames that might be an interesting learning tool for the intended audience - kindergarten children - with the possibility for them to learn a few basic things - spelling short words, addition up to the number 10, counting to 12 (via the clock game) while also having basic creative tools at their disposal. The characters Ben and the girl as well as the side-characters will surely be lovable at that age.  A positive technical point at the end: The game is emulated via ScummVM. Upon starting it, one can choose between starting normally or without OpenGL.  A word of caution must be said: As Steam is intended to be for age 13 and up, parents are advised to always watch their children when they play something, especially if the community features are enabled. As a protective measure, I suggest turning the Steam Overlay off for this game, that way the play can also go uninterrupted by popup messages / group announcements.  Recommended: For the targeted audience = kindergarten children. Turning Steam Overlay off advised.",

Because Steam does not release the game code one cannot load the game into the Scumm application that it needs to run. Any changes to the found ini files are wiped out be the load from Steam and the result is a 2500x3200 display on a 1920x1080 monitor -  I have a disappointed 5 year old that really would like to be able to use this - and it is not amenable to his use because in most displays essential information is written out of sight. If there is a help available from either Steam or the creators - I have not found it!",
