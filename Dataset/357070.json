            "review_text": "I can happily say that UBERMOSH is one of the most entertaining games I have played in a while. In this game, your objective is to survive in a mosh pit for 1 minute and 30 seconds, using your laser sword to reflect the enemies' bullets back into them, making up for a great defense mechanism, and to eventually pick up their guns and start your own carnage in the pit.  The retro art style is lovely and really matches the game's theme while the soundtrack is amazingly energizing, fueling your space killing-sprees. There are several arenas in which you can fight ( randomly chosen by the game when you start a new run), but the only difference between them is the colour of the environment. Your arsenal is not really big but it is varied and has lots of uses: besides your sword, you can equip up to 5 (aproximate number) guns that are dropped by the endless incoming waves of enemies, each having different fire modes ranging from a shotgun to a single charged shot or a flurry of bullets widespread in a cone of fire.  The game comes with 4 combat modes: the ordinary one, in which you have 3 lives and can use your sword and any gun you pick up; the 'kensai' mode, in which you cannot pick up any firearms, relying only on your sword and starting the run with 6 lives; the 'gunner' mode, in which you have no sword but any gun you pick up fires in a full-auto mode; or 'warlock', in which you start with the best gun in the game and can use your sword, but you get only 2 lives.  If you're looking forward to a greater challenge than what the base game has to offer, hardboiled mode is here to satisfy your needs, representing a much difficult twist on the base game that resets your overall score when you switch to it. You can also get trading cards and easy-to-obtain achievements when playing the game, which adds to the value and makes the price worth it. In my opinion, UBERMOSH will not let you down if you're looking for a good time-killer or just for some good old top down shooting action, and I would strongly suggest buying it.  TL;DR: With a difficulty level that reminisces good old arcade games, UBERMOSH brings some new elements to the retro top down shooter template, and it will get you a decent 2 or 3 hours of fun for a really good price.",

It was at that moment I said 'Sweet Raptor Jebus, there is no pause... yes this is a REAL bullet hell game!!', as a Bullet Hell adict, I spit in the face of easy modes, save features, and such a silly thing like a pause button, there is no pause in the chaos and death known as True Bullet Hell gaming, don't you dare blink or itch your nose muhahah,it becomes a test of your own will and power over your own body and is a realm meant only for the relentless and hardcore. Indstrial metal thumps harder than Quake 2 tunes and drives the NON STOP violence. Life and Death is a supreme black and white factor in game, you survive by franticly avoiding bullet chaos, perfecting timing by repeling bullets, getting a good gun and trying to hold corners while at the same time avoiding picking up a worse one till it becomes too much and you bail. The art style is great as well. Luck, pure punishment, and a test of skill while making your own split second tactics, Yus, this game will give you Bullet Hell Zen, let go of the false self and simply be within the torrents of Bullets and Chaos. 10/10 Art style is epic as goat teeeets, real sweet stuff. Just wish it had a two player mode, or online co-op function.",

            "review_text": "UBERMOSH, an extremely simple, yet balls to the wall hard game with an amazing rocking soundtrack &amp; a top-down view of the action. Story is simple &amp; quick to the point, cyberpunk utopian future colony where violence, crime &amp; poverty is a non-issue but violence is a ‚Äúbasic need‚Äù, so what better way to blow off much needed stress than dropping you in a hostile environment. That is basically it, you are armed with a sword, which you can use to deflect enemy bullets back at them or slice them. Guns are dropped by enemies, simply running over them picks them up. The guns are nothing special, each have their own bullet spread and there is a total of 5 different guns. The game has a simple premise, basically your difficult to survive horde/score attack type of game. You are given 90 seconds &amp; 4 lives on the basic mode of play. There are 4 modes or class mods as the game call them: Kensai, limits you to only use your sword, Gunner only guns &amp; Warlock, which gives you the ‚Äúbest‚Äù gun as well as the being able to use your sword. Your amount of lives varies between each mod. Gunplay is average serving more to thin the numbers rather than being your main method of attack, the sword being your main weapon &amp; ‚Äúshield‚Äù, with its ability to deflect bullets, against the onslaught. Despite the enemy bullets coming in hard &amp; fast, they are brightly neon colored so you have a decent chance of being able to evade/deflect them.  Ubermosh can be played with both a mouse/kb &amp; controller. It does not feature a graphical setting menus or any other menu for that matter. The game is extremely short considering it doesn‚Äôt really have story to tell &amp; consists of nothing more than fighting the horde of enemies for 90 seconds or your death. There was a minor flaw involving the walls, in which having you move next to them it just stops your movement &amp; gets you stuck to them which is an annoyance in such a fast paced game. No leaderboards as well, so you will have to resort to sharing score the old fashioned way. All in all, despite that minor flaw, it is a decent time waster with a pretty cool soundtrack that will have you head banging along to the beat as you slice &amp; dice your way through the horde. ",

            "review_text": "Fast-paced retro arcade bullet-hellesque bullet deflecting goodness.  I initially started out with the controller and eventually moved onto the keyboard+mouse. It's personal preference really as it is very easily playable with either control scheme.  As far as the action goes: it's blindingly fast and crushingly addictive. Different enemies handle different weapons which determine size, speed, and spread of the bullets. To fight them, our means of attack are your gun and sword; the latter can also be used for defense as it can deflect bullets.  With the ability to deflect bullets, there is also the added variation in how bullets are deflected; for example, the large single bullet is deflected into two slower bullets, while the bullets from the game's proclaimed 'best weapon' almost appears to move back at the same number and at the same speed. A nice feature is the ability to control the direction of the deflected projectiles depending on where you have hit them.  There's not too much difference between enemies. There seem to be three total but they really only come in two sizes: humanoid, and large alien size. Despite this all seem to move the same speed. While that may sound boring, I believe it simplifies things and helps add to the twitch-frantic action.  As hard as this game is, you don't ever really feel cheated and are forced to 'git gud'.  As far as visuals go, the masterpiece is the pictured soldier on the menu. The art style and symbols used remind me very much of Tsutomu Nihei - it's good stuff. I also liked the fact that as you survived and progressed and raised your ranking, the soldier's armour would change (both in game and on the menu) and reflect that change in rank; though I wish you could view and choose the different armour variants.  For $4USD, this is a great arcade-style game with an awesome soundtrack too.  PS: The 'Kensai Mastery' is impossible.  28/08/15: Kensai High Score = 114 -_-",

            "review_text": "A fast paced top down shooter and slasher, this game is, in a word, fun. Its addicting, easy to learn, hard to master, and just a great indie game.   The gameplay is you start with a sword and ricochet projectiles at your enemies by reflecting. The reflected projectile kills your foes instantly, and you cut also rush an enemy and cut them instantly too. A dead enemy always drops a gun you can borrow. Each class you play has a varying amount of lives, and can be orientated towards a shooter or a slasher role. The Warlock starts off with the strongest gun in the game, and can reflect bullets, but also only has 2 lives. The no mod class/GREEN(The default class) starts with no gun, 4 lives, and can reflect bullets. Kansai starts off with 6 lives, and a sword, but can't grab guns. Gunner has 2 lives and a fully automactic gun, and can make any weapon, even the strongest weapon automactic.   Only real problem with this game is a lack of content. Theres a Hardboiled mode, and 4 classes with alternate roles, some Steam achievements, and of course Trading Cards. However, the trading cards really have had their value dropped by a ridiuclous amount($0.24 to now $0.07). If this game had local multiplayer, that would be so amazing...*hint hint game developer*  To anyone who enjoys addicting fast paced gameplay, I highly recommend this game. Its speed, pumping electric soundtrack, fast paced action, low price, just mix together to make this one of the best games i've played in a long time.",

It's the same everytime you play, there are around 6 different types of guns each with different fire rates, projectile speeds and projectile types to accompany your sword, which you use to deflect enemy projectiles.I think it's a little annoying that on occaision, an enemy might literally spawn on the ground you are walking to, which will cost you a life every now and again if you aren't quick enough to right click in time. Basically, if you are looking to spend very little money, on an addictive pixelated clusterfest, this might be for you. I like that I can just play a few quick rounds.",

Pro : -Music is really cool, I like how it evolves arround the same instrument -Gameplay overall is really cool and fun -really simple and easy to pick up -cheap -doesn't ACTUALLY need 512 mb of gpu, you can play it on anything pretty much .  Con : -Getting an ennemy spawn and shoot you instantly -melee and ranged weapon takes time to switch (so you will press fire ranged weapon, then melee weapon and it won't work, which sucks because this is a fast paced game, and there shouldn't be a delay between the two) -And as some other people said before the camera could be placed farther away, or better yet, ajustable. -lack of diversity -no way to return to main menu with a controller  Yes, the game is simple, lack game modes and such, plus it only has 4 class mods, but it only costs two dollars, when not 75% off on a steam sale, which makes it 0.50$. For that price, this is an excellent game I would give it a solid 85%.  Note : This game is a score attack obviously, you will die constantly, if you are the kind of person who doesn't enjoy this, don't consider this game, unless you have an extra 0.50% and that you don't know what to do with it, you should just keep it honestly.",

It's fast, bright, and flashy, sure, but it really boils down to running from one end of the map to the other, slicing up the same few randomly spawning enemies.  Some of the mechanics are pretty cool, slicing enemy bullets to launch them back at the enemy is pretty satisfying the first few times you do it, but it's not something to hold an entire game up.  The shooting's a headache. Firing shakes the screen so much that it more often than not disoriented me to the point of losing track of my character and running face-first into my death. I stuck mainly to the sword after that.  Enemies spawn around the map at random. There's no set pattern or waves. Any high-scoring round I played felt to me more like a stroke of luck than an accomplishment.  I paid fifty cents for this game, and I'm still considering a refund.",

It was way to much and created a nauseating difficulty of its own. For that reason alone i call the game unplayable. A games difficulty should be in its gameplay. Not added effects to make it harder for you. The game is hard enough as is. This was an un needed effect. If you dont mind the shakey cam every 2 seconds then enjoy.

The game sounds nice and feels really smooth to play however due to that smoothness I felt like there wasn't any real feedback wich will bring me to my next point.  Although the game is good, and is a must have if you like old school arcade games or bullet hell shooters, the thing that really turns me off is the feedback.  I like to really get into the games I play but here with the slippery movement, and seemingly random deaths I just can't do that. I really hope that this game will see some patches to address the feedback issue about getting hit. Plus the way it just suddenly shows you a game over screen just feels hacky. (Although maybe the intent is to make you rage, so you can get going.)  However I am still going to recommend this game because at this price it's a steal. (CDN$0.49 at the time of purchase.)",
