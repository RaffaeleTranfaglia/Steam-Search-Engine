            "review_text": "I reviewed Sparkle 2 and Sparkle 3, so I may as well review Sparkle, um, 0. I'm not sure if this is meant as a reboot or maybe a tribute to Ringu, but for whatever reason, the new Sparkle game has a lower number. Pedantic musings aside, I really liked Sparkle 2, and reviewed it as the best jellyfish eating simulator available. The Sparkle games have held that title since Pac-Man, even though when asked if the creatures in Pac-Man were jellyfish, Toru Iwatani replied “I’m surprised that you made the reference to a jellyfish. The assumption must be from the transparency in their design and also their characteristics.” You notice that he did not deny that the enemies in Pac-Man were jellyfish, so I'll just stick with that theory.   Anyhoo, Sparkle 0. The game is lovely. Sparkle games always are. This time around I get a sort of cyberspace cyberpunk cyberjellyfisheating vibe from the graphics. It's you against the world, and you gotta bag and tag em chummer. Sorry. All that cyber talk brought out the Shadowrun in me. Yeah, remember when Shadowrun was cool? Hmm, maybe it never was, but I liked it. I used to read the books, back when books were a thing.   So, what was I saying? Right! Sparkle! Back on track! My reviews have been gettings so narrow that maybe like three people will even get the references. I'm starting to feel like Dennis Miller. So it goes.   So the graphics are nice, as always. The gameplay is more like Sparkle 2, very chill, no real danger, just eat jellyfish and pretty much any other creature you meet, with the ultimate goal of evolving your creature to become more bigger and such. This process has been stripped down to the point that there are no longer evolutionary trees, and you just eat and grow without having any input, as if you were Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. This may be a pretty big step backward in the series, but at least you don't have the spikey tunnels that plagued Sparkle 3.   Overall, I still suggest Sparle 2 Evo as the best in the series, and I hope they return to the variety that game had to offer, but Sparkle 0 is still a good game. Just a bit less so than fans of the series might have hoped.",

            "review_text": "This game was a lot of fun. I played for about 2 hours over the past few days. I enjoyed the ambient music that came with the gameplay. It was pretty simple to play, just point and click mostly. I had to look at the game guide to figure out the R button sends you through a portal. I got the game via a 90% off coupon that came with a trade resulting in a 50 cent game for me. Well worth it.",

            "review_text": "I am a fan of the Sparkle Series.  I bought this game on sale for only €1,24.  I really recommend buying this game ONLY when it is on sale, because it is really short and feels rushed / unfinished.  Overall Score: 5.5/10  So yeah, as I fan I am kind of disappointed with this game. After Sparkle 2 Evo the Series just kind of went downwards. I hope the developers read this and start bringing us quality games again.  Pros: - I like that they added a twist to the game that you explore just 1 world instead of several maps / instances. - NO grindy achievements which require you to play the whole game 4 times over (like in Sparkle 3) - Controller support  Cons: - The game is pretty short (1h - 1.5h to get 100% achievements) - No tutorial, can be confusing at first to new Sparkle players - Game gets more and more laggy when you grow / lvl up (my screen went fully white when I reached lvl 50, I don't think that was intentional) - The sound tracks are pretty much the same as in previous Sparkle Games. I wouldn't mind that too much IF they also added some new sound tracks, which they did not.",
