Every match is the same, adjusting your economy makes no real difference, and the technology, assuming it does something other then boost your meaningless economy by a tiny amout, is useless. Maybe this game will get better with time, but for now, its barely a 1 out of 10",

Music increases udovolstie of gameplay. Not bad realized diplomacy and technology. Of the minuses game pauses when you open another window and no sound effect it, the information window is not closed automatically.  Rank 7.5 out of 10.",
