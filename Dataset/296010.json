            "review_text": "Immediately engrossing, NeonXSZ feels like playing a more arcadey interpretation of X3: Terran Conflict on fast forward. You're plopped into the middle of a sandbox of dogfighting, and need to gradually master all six of your degrees of freedom if you want to get anywhere. Customizable difficulty, lots of upgrades and weapons and ships to play with, and fun challenge arenas and procedurally-generated tasks make for a fast-paced, player-driven experience. Nice bright high-contrast visuals pay homage to Tron and are highly customizable, and the low penalty for death (at first) encourages you to keep extending beyond what you think you're capable of, to never play things too safe.   What you'll discover as you get farther is that everything you're doing consumes your main currency, uranium. Whenever you thrust needlessly, or fire weapons without thinking, you're consuming uranium, which is also used to respawn, to purchase upgrades, and to use teleporters. You can gain it by doing tasks and killing enemies, but as you move up along the power curve, you're forced to learn more advanced, more elegant and efficient, techniques. Failing to use your power responsibly, or trying to farm things that are way below your level for too long, could put you in danger of not having enough energy to respawn, should you die. The way the game nudges you gradually toward both this realization and to increasing challenge and player skill is pretty brilliant.",

            "review_text": "When I first loaded up NeonXSZ, I wasn't really sure what was going on. I could have read the help menu in the interface but decided to wing it. I picked my ship from a choice of 3 and off I went, flying around in a station and getting my butt kicked. To be honest, I found it fun... it gave me a feeling that I hadn't felt since the NES when I played games such as Metroid and Solar Jetman which I didn't have the manuals for: exploration. Not only of a level or map, but of the game itself. It didn't take me too long to figure out what the game was about.  You are in some kind of computer system which is represented by a space station with corridors and rooms. In this space station there are 4 different factions. You have the good guys which are the operating system and anti-virus, and the bad guys which are virus and malware. Each factions files or programs are represented by ships. Some carry harmful malware around while others attack programs of the opposing factions. You are caught in the middle of this war but luckily are aligned with the OS/Antivirus to begin with.  The idea of the game is simple: fly around in your ship and kill stuff, pick up their debris which will allow you to research and eventually use the modules and hulls that they are using. Acting on this idea, at least to begin with, is difficult, as you are going to get killed by ships which are higher level than you. A lot. I didn't mind this though... I quickly understood that attacking anything that was more than a level above me would end badly, so I searched for lower level enemies. After getting my ♥♥♥ kicked for a little while, running away from higher level programs that were gunning for me, I found myself being able to fend for myself a bit more. After a while longer, I felt like I could at least give as good as I got, and a little while longer, I was king of that space station and any Virus or Malware stupid enough to cross my path was in deep trouble and I was ready to go to the next tier of space station. That's the thing: there is a massive snowball effect in this game with regards to levelling. After the initial teething problem at the beginning of any tier, you are going to be outgunned for a while, but once you begin to claw your way up, you will be dominating in no time. It's oh so addictive and a lot of fun, if a little repetitive: something which is not really too big a deal for me, I don't mind grinding.  It's a great game but if I had any complaints, it would be that every station feels the same. It's the same central hub with the same corridors and same bases; it would be nice to see some variations in layout - it also seems to me that every time you log into the game, the bases will have switched positions randomly around the map. Not a huge problem but just a bit unnecessary. I'd also like the ability to assault enemy bases and defend my allies' bases. Sure you can take over the central hub but that doesn't really do anything apart from net you some rewards. It's quite obvious to me that this game is perfect for some kind of territorial conquest side to it, but no matter, maybe someday we will see a mod or dlc for that.  In summary, if you like space simulator type games, grinding for new and shiny loot to help you find even newer shinier loot, you will love this game. I do expect that most people would get bored of the repetition before they reach the last space station though, but at least you'll get your money's worth first.",
