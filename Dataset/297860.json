    "description": "Split/Second is an intense action racing game set within a reality TV show. Competitors vie to be the first to the finish line in a set rigged to blow. Players don’t just collide with other vehicles to knock them from the track, but can also trigger devastating events that alter the race dynamics.",

            "review_text": "Split/Second is, hands down, my favorite racing game ever and one of my all-time best games. I bought this game for both the PC and the PS3 even before it came to Steam and I played the hell out of both versions. This is a great game that any racing fan should play at least once and is also a great entry game for those wishing to check out the genre.  The premise of this game is, frankly, not very original but sets up the game nicely. You are a contestant on the new explosive racing show Split/Second. During the course of the 'season' you will have to compete in races to advance to the next 'episode.' Finishing higher in events will get you more points and will allow you to progress further in the season. Each episode is capped off by an Elite Race, a race around the track against Split/Second's best drivers. Beat each episode to win the season championship. Like I said, not very original but it gets the job done.  The gameplay is very simple. You race around a track, drift around the corners and use power-ups to destroy your opponants. However, the center piece of this game is that it doesn't use traditional power-ups like those in Mario Kart or Blur. Instead, you attain energy through drifts, drafts, and air-time. Once you have enough, you can activate power-plays on the track, which usually involve destroying parts of the track to crush your rivals. Filling up your energy all the way will allow you activate the biggest power plays on the track and will also allow you to change the track's route (if the track has a route changer). Racing hard while effectively using your power plays are essential if you want to win the season championship.  In addition to the races, there are also several other types of events. The first one is Elimination. It's similar to the race, but there aren't any set laps. Instead, a there is a timer that counts down. When the timer reaches zero, the last place car is eliminated from the race. Survive all eliminations to win.   The second event is the Air Strike, where a helicopter shoots missles at you and you have to dodge the missle waves in order to gain points. The longer you last, the harder the waves become to dodge. Gain the most points to win the event.  A variant of the Air Strike event is the Air Revenge, which is kind of like a boss fight. Instead of getting points for dodging missles, you get power-play energy in addition to the energy you get from drifts and jumps. You can then use the energy to reflect the missiles back at the helicopter. Down the helicopter in the shortest amount of time to win.  The final event is by far my favorite: Survival. Here, semis are driving around a track while dropping bombs in front of you in order to kill you. As you stay alive and pass these trucks, you gain points. Passing several trucks in a row without dying will increase your score multiplyer. Get the highest score to win the event. I have sunk hours on end trying to beat my own high scores, so I think you'll get alot out of this mode.  On the down side, this game's graphics are pretty standard. It looks okay, but if you're more accustomed to the realistic racing games like Forza then you'll definately notice the difference. There are also some glitches and hitbox issues that, while not game-breaking, can lead to outburts of rage over what the heck just happened. Sometimes, though, the glitches can be entertaining in their own right (like getting killed by an explosion and restarting a hundred feet in the air). These issues, however, are very infrequent and most likely won't dampen you experience.   [EDIT] As for the controls, there isn't a manual shifting option, which I don't mind but some might be a bit miffed that this wasn't included. Also, the initial key set-up is a bit weird. You drive using the arrow keys and use the right control and right shift buttons to activate power plays. I assume this was done so that a second player could use the WASD area of the keyboard when doing split-screen. Thankfully, this is easily remediated since all inputs can be remapped in the Options menu, but it's still a bit jarring when you first start.  So those are the basics of Split/Second. It is very simplistic but very addictive. There's also a bit more to the game than what I mentioned, but I'll leave you to discover those on your own if you wish to pursue this game. Score: 8/10",

            "review_text": "Split/Second is a year 2010 arcade racing game, which goes faster than NFS right from the start, and giving much more king-sized demolition than the Flatout. With that said, it is a mediocre game, which can be fun, but not for long. There are enough of breathtaking sequences, but they satisfy much better from the backseat, on youtube, rather than playing that yourself.  No doubt, it is an engrossing moment, when in the middle of race a transatlantic Boing crushing right on your head. And it is even better when you dodge this flight in the last second. Too bad, but for the most time of gameplay, you'll be the one under the blast and not one around it.  Of course, like almost always, there are non-optimal controls. But, what is more, there are too little field for player to tweak the race for own benefit, but to choose a car to drive. Those cars provides a little of variety in proportions between speed, acceleration, and so on, but, in the most cases, you'll be driving two, maybe four cars through the whole game. All other variants are just 'for show', for 'big numbers', and not for real variety and usability. You can't really tune cars for your style of driving or for certain circumstances, that is the first real downside.  Second big mishap is AI, which will always be one step ahead of you, even after you managed to blow all and everything around you in little pieces. Just the few seconds later, it will be you who'll be ripped apart, without any chance to dodge.  Yeah, about demolitions, dodging and racing in general. The main feeling from racing is the same as with NFS games - you can push from borders without loosing speed, you almost not need to slow down in corners, and yet catching the track just fine. But when it comes to dodging the explosions... It turns out that their physical modelling is very far from natural. For a thousand times you'll be thinking you are ways away from blast, but will be in flames an instant later.  And the fourth nail is the bad optimisation. I have a dvd with that game which works much better than 'always updated' steam version. There are a major problem with missable/breakable save games, which made so many people raged there on steam. Blast the DRM!  With all that said about downsides of the game, I'm still vouching that you may try it. Especially if you buy it with some major discount about 80% of price... I'd say that Blur, the classmate of Split/Second, is much better, and should be picked first, for much more enjoyment... But Steam not selling Blur anymore. So if you are into arcade racing, but get tired of NFS and Flatout series both, get Split/Second! It'll give you some fresh air, if only for two or three nights... It's still better than nothing, right? And what a marvelous explosions you'll taste there! Overall mark - 6.95/10 - best when under 5$ price, even better in some bundle.",

            "review_text": "if time flies when you're having fun, then it says something that every 1 hour session feels like it has been 3-4 hours.  what isn't necessarily a bad idea is unfortunately crippled by poor execution. locked at 30fps and crashing on resolution change, I searched for a fix for my resolution crash, but I mostly found a large amount of people complaining that the game crashes on start for them. there have been no patches released to fix either of these issues. infact, no patches have been released at all! small gripe, but alt tabbing out also crashes the game.  the AI has a -really- bad case of rubberbanding. they're given cars that are generally a tier above what you're currently given and so you have to use the 'powerplay' feature (where you attempt to use the enviornment against the other racers) to try and level the playing field. it's neat, but also annoying when the all-too-common sight of 1-3 cars end up with a 6 second lead ahead of everyone else and your attempts to catch up with them are met with you being ♥♥♥♥ed with by the other racers behind you at every opportunity given to them. if you use a powerplay on someone far away, it'll zoom in to show you their car explode. during this time, you're vulnerable and can't see your car. multiple times now I've destroyed someone and had my car plow into a wall helplessly as the camera zoomed in on someone elses blown up vehicle.  some of the event types really could use some revision, such as the avoiding helicopter missile barrages mode and the time trial mode. a mode where you have to avoid helicopter attacks and get bonuses depending on how long you can continue avoiding missiles is a neat concept, but when you're put on a single lane and the helicopter is firing 4 missiles horizontally across said lane with no way to avoid it, the gamemode quickly loses appeal. one of your 3 lives is gone and your combo is lost because the game gave you no way to avoid what it tossed at you. the time trial mode is brought down by the fact that you have to deal with powerplays being thrown at you during them. it usually gives you either a drifty car or one with poor handling for these events and so getting a good time on them will probably consist of trial and error where you hit a powerplay you couldn't have avoided (unless you knew it was coming, but sometimes it puts you on an entirely new map where you have no way of expecting some of the things it throws at you), exploding, restarting, and seeing how far you get the next time before another powerplay destroys you before your vehicle has a chance to move out of the way.  the sound is depressingly low quality and your graphics options are limited to simply 'low', 'medium', 'high', and 'very high' with no way to customize them beyond that. even on very high, it really shows that the game is a ps3 port as the graphics are very much last generation. all these problems with the game are a damn shame because it really is a game that had a lot of potential. instead, it manages to be considerably worse than even ridge racer unbounded, which I was still able to enjoy despite all of its flaws. split/second? not so much. the flaws are too many and shine too bright for me to enjoy it for any real length of time.  the menus are messy and lacking. for example, if you want to look at the new car you got and change its paintjob or even just exit the game after completing an event, that means restarting the race, pausing, and returning to the main menu because there is no option to just return to the main menu after completing an event. admittedly the load times aren't that bad, but it's just absurd to have to go through such steps to do something so basic.  I'd recommend this game for $10 at the -absolute- most. anything above that is really not worth it. it's frustrating, blatantly unfair at times, outdated looking, and generally unpleasant as a racing game. don't expect multiplayer either if that's your thing as the mp servers have been shut down. your only hope of mp is using a third party program to connect to friends over lan. on the bright side, if the bright lights from explosions are highly amusing to you, then this may very well be worth the price to you.  ps: who even puts unskippable cutscenes in a racing game? yeesh.  UPDATE: aaaaand half way into the game, my save is now corrupted. this feels like the most fitting way this could have ended.",

        {
            "review_text": "Split/Second is a racing game. Or at least that's what it's creators would like you to believe. I affectionately call these titles 'modern' racing games, because they have very little do with racing or playing a game. It's more like watching a movie while you steer a brick of lead with soap wheels through a QTE filled landscape of different shades of brown rubble.  Unlike most other racing games, skill plays almost no part in whether or not you win a race. The AI rubber bands to an incredible degree and seems to only ever target you with Powerplays, meaning opening up the alternate routes while you're in the lead is a terrible idea, since it just gives the AI more ammo to fire at you.  The pace of the game is barely above a crawl, with the difference between the 1-Speed cars and the 5-Speed cars being almost negligible. I never bothered unlocking anything higher. Drifting also serves to slow this down even more, so if you hope to win any races, don't let go of the accelerator ever. Not that you would really need to.  You often have nothing to do with the Power you accumulate while in the lead. You can't activate Powerplays that are behind you or boost. Often just leaving you a sitting duck.  The powerplays themselves range from explosions to bigger explosions. Sometimes you can activate shortcuts but usually the game won't let you. I assume this has to do with this game's overarching theme of punishing you for being too good at it.  You'll often find yourself in first place, sailing 5 seconds ahead of the rest of the pack for them to fly past you at warp speed 300 feet before the finish line to just immediately slow to a crawl. However if you smash into walls the entire race, hang back and draft to activate Powerplays and are sitting in 2nd or 3rd before the finish, you'll usually win. The Air Strike mode also has an amusing tendency to decide you're going 'too slow' around a hairpin corner and just fire a salvo of missiles at you.  The Elite Races are just races where you go up against cars that are much better than yours. While the expectation is that you'll come back to these races later with a faster car, I was often able to beat them on the first or second try. I had enough series points that I was unlocking the next elite race immediately after finishing the last one, which just shows how poor the pacing in this game really is.  Overall, I would say that this game doesn't even manage to make it's own gimmick, literally being that you are playing a stunt driver in a TV show, interesting or engaging. The recurring set pieces and genuinely horrible AI make for an uninteresting and uninspired racing game lacking any substance, but much of the flair we have come to expect from say, a Michael Bay movie or a McDonald's Cheeseburger.  The fact that this game influenced an entire genre to effectively commit suicide by copying it's sluggish gameplay, brown city environments and severe lack of speed is shocking. Thank the Indies that we have games like Drift Stage and 90s Arcade Racer to look forward to.",
