Portuguese:  Se você quer um desafio de verdade, compre qualquer série de Commandos, mas esta é a mais difícil, afinal, esta possui a 'menor' quantidade de meios para matar na séries commandos (se é que da para aplicar esta palavra em um jogo com tantas maneiras de matar), você vai fritar seu cérebro neste jogo incrível!",

With enemies that can see through objects and their field of view that moves way to fast, you'll see the game over screen over a lot. Restarting to the missions would be so bad if you didn't have to see all the pre-mission crap, sure you can press Esc a few to skip all of it, but still takes up time... On the first mission it took me a haft hour to get to land without everyone getting killed, just to find out you CAN'T save or load game. Grr. So, I did what all self-respecting gamers do, I looked up cheat codes. I'd just skip this game.",
