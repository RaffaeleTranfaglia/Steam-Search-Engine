The gameplay each act is to complete the levels fast and collect the required feathers.  At the end of Act 3 there is a boss which changes the gameplay up at just the right time to make me want to play more. Further review is going to come once I complete the game but so far I'm impressed with what is shown.  Me playing the first 3 acts for those interested:         YouTube™ Video:  &nbsp;",
