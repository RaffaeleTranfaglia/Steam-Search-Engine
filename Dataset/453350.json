    "description": "“Vaccine War” is an action adventure game with exploration features. It is set in the tense Europe from the thirties, with the Spanish Civil War (and some fiction stories) as background. Aesthetically, the game combines the pixelart retro style with a 3D environment.",

            "review_text": "Games for Tutti is a Valencia, Spain based development company. Vaccine War is their first game but what is most impressive is that it is also the first game to use their specialized tool that saves time animating pixelart. This tool is called the Magic Pixelator. They claim that with this tool they can create animations of 20 frames in just a few minutes rather than being forced to spending significant time drawing each and every pixel. The characters within the game demonstrate that they were able to create fantastic character animations that feature particle effects such as fire and smoke as well as the game’s environments. This is a great achievement for a small studio that is made up of just four full time employees and a collaborative team of two others.  Their game, War Vaccine is set during the Spanish Civil War but is a completely fictional tale. This is a setting that doesn’t often get portrayed in video games and as such it gave me a reason to be interested in the game before I began as well as checking out their new software tool. I can tell you that although I am yet to complete the game that I am thoroughly impressed with my exposure to the game. It uses the Unity engine but it’s so much more than your standard indie throwaway game made with it. There is solid production value throughout the entirety of what I have experienced thus far and I have yet to run into any bugs. That’s not to say there aren’t weaknesses with the game because there are but rather that I appreciated the game as its whole.  What I will pinpoint as the primary weakness in the game is the combat. The combat system has a lot of potential but it needs work. It’s simply not as precise as what it needed to be. Your attacks will have the appearance that they should be connecting but for some reason they do not. This is generally with the melee weapons but can extend through to guns and range weapons. This makes the cool abilities such as running attacks and jumping attacks very frustrating to use as you’re just never sure if or when the attacks will actually land and play as intended.  I would also dearly like to see the dev team add achievements to the game. It’s a game that would do well with achievements for reaching certain points in the game and maybe arbitrary ones such as number of enemies killed, etc. Trading cards would also make for a nice addition to the game.  But it’s really the artistic flair that shines through here. It’s a perfect prototype game that demonstrates to other studios that their software tool has tremendous value moving forward. I would like to see what the team can develop next and whether or not other developers consider purchasing the right to utilize the Magic Pixelator in order to give their games a big boost in the quality of its animated pixel graphics.
