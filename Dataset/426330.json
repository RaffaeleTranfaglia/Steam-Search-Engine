I've only done one playthrough, so maybe there's things I've yet to discover, but from what I've played, I liked the game, and you get what you paid for, maybe more.  -Good storytelling. The story is solid and the pace at which it's told goes nicely with the gameplay. -Nice management mechanics. -Would've liked a longer game, with a longer/more expanded story -'Romance' didn't feel like I accomplished anything  EDIT: Horrific spelling mistake. BTW, I deleted a comment accidentally. Sorry about that.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game. Typically, I find stories with this format rather unappealing due to the vast scope of the world and its unnatural setting combined with a familiar story (magic/Aliens - CEO of corporation). Which typically make getting immersed in the story difficult because you are given such a narrow view with which to see what’s going on around you and with so much is going on its easy to get confused or hung up on certain details.  However, that is not a problem with this game you very quickly learn its focus and what you are setting out to achieve which lets you focus on the intrigue of the main story and the satisfaction of seeing your metrics improve month on month make you feel like a real super powered CEO with plenty of scope to be the good guy philanthropist or the brutal cut throat businessman.  I love that fact that you get to play a little allocation of resources game month on month as a method of establishing focus and showing the player the consequences of their actions and I hope to see more of this kind of mechanic in future games.  Simply put I cannot recommend this game enough  ",

            "review_text": "Like all other Choice of Games games, this one gives you a non-linear story that will be shaped by your choices, for better or worse. This time out, you're thrust into the role of a CEO of a research company dabbling in making humans metahuman - sort of like superpower capitalism, except instead of being a superhero story, it is a cosmic horror story due to the price you have to pay for the research. Nice twist, that.  Unfortunately, like some Choice of Games games, unless you choose a polarized approach and stick to it 95%, you're not getting a decent ending. This makes your first playthrough, the blind one, essentially poking at the game to see what major milestone mistakes you can make, and then prepare for a 'proper' run to see a specific storyline formed by taking a coherent approach.  On the one side, it's a good thing, since this allows multiple reruns of the same game while seeing tons of new non-repeating content. On the other side, like in imperfect gamebooks, you can clearly see where the tracks cross, like 'here's a dialogue option I would have picked if I picked THAT dialogue option two chapters ago... what I'm more interested in, is why there isn't a follow-up to the option I DID pick?'.  The game suffers a bit from what I like to call the 'Mass Effect Dialogue Issue': sometimes, the options you are offered aren't 100% related to what your player character ultimately ends up doing, although it has a lot less issues with it than, say, Hero Project. It's also highly unclear at times whether a decision result is calculated based on your stats or RNGed, a traditional issue of Choice of Games games that messed up my enjoyment of Mecha Ace greatly.  All in all, yes, it's a nice addition to the collection and a worthy recommendation to anyone, especially since the corporate backstabbing angle is weirdly complemented by the cosmic horror setting, but if you had doubts about these games before, this one will not change your opinion in the slightest.  Also, if you don't mind me saying this, the ending feels somewhat rushed and disjointed due to the need to tell three outcomes as a singular story, since way more focus is given to what your shareholders think of you rather than what state you leave the world in or what your decisions or indecisions did to the various characters. Yes, this will make the next runthrough as a heartless embezzler easier to do, but also sort of undermines any intent to play a person with a stern moral compass, I'm afraid.",

            "review_text": "A bit more linear than I'd hoped, but still, you have good feedback on how good/bad your decisions have been and while the premise of selling superpowers is a bit weird (I'm not sure it works that well) but the whole 'evil corporate overlords that first and foremost care about profits' with sci-tech and magic does work and is fun to have to try to navigate while pursueing whatever personal motivation you might have before being forced to decide how far you'll go and how much you'll risk.  Also, you get to have interesting relationships (not necessarily romantic, though there are multiple such options) with people that work for you, are leaders of rival corporations. While I found the overall plot development less engaging than Choice of Robots (which is, by far, my favorite of these games atm), the people you interact with are written in a more evocative way than the relatively normal people you interact with in Choice of Robots.  And you certainly can't pretend the plot isn't imaginative, even if it does use lots of tropes and some archetypes even.",

            "review_text": "First off, this is a text only choose-your-own-adventure, if anyone was unaware. If you value graphics over story or player decisions, this probably isn't the type of game for you.  This is a pretty fantastic entry, which combines compelling storytelling with interesting mechanics and choice that seem to actually matter. I also enjoyed the game testing my own detective skills at a few points, challenging me to solve a mystery with the game only giving me helpful clues for correct choices instead of the direct answer like so many other games do, making it seem challenging without being unfair or obtuse. I felt genuinely immersed when playing this, which seems odd for a cyberpunk-fantasy choose-your-own-adventure, but it was just a very enjoyable experience that I felt a part of.  My main criticism is that some of the decisions, especially the routine ones which you can adjust regularly throughout the game, should have to be confirmed before they are made permanent, as it is easy to make an error if you misclick or misread the option.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story or enjoys a game where the player's choices actually matter.",

            "review_text": "Damned amazing is what I'll say. The story was superb and I'd love to see a movie made using the plot! It's quite interactive. The choices give enough for you to forsee the outcomes, but there's always a murkiness to it to remind you that the future is not as clear as you think. They don't just throw in some outrageous obstacles or interventions(though certain past actions and good planning will certainly help in the long run, so don't be shy with using your resources up).  I've played a few text-based games, but this certainly grabs the top spot for me. The story was certainly unique, developing further and further into the sci-fi/fantasy genre(magic and science are tied together though there isn't exactly an in-depth discussion regarding this. Rather it just exists as it does. Tools of the overall plot). Then at the end comes the twist, with the final conclusion based on the decisions you take at the last pivotal moment.  I just wish there were ways to have more influence on the behaviors and actions of some the close members of the character. Affect them in certain ways that would determine how they'd contribute towards the end, and perhaps affect how well they do their jobs.  If you enjoy ruthless shareholders, running a shady business to glory(or infamy), time travel, magic, science, and the occassional enigmatic alien making suspicious promises...then this is a game for you. Even in it's text based format, it isn't completely sparse of visual aspects(albeit they're colorful bars representing certain business and personal information) nor is it lacking in entertainment and action.  I'm glad to have bought this game, and seriously hope this takes off to become something greater.",

Miss one opportunity and you get railroaded for better or for worse a couple choices down the line. I played leaning more towards diplomacy yet the only people that applied to were the staff I had immediate contact with. Choices that should have gone in one direction were taken in a complete 180. I 'failed' the story yet it when the 'epilogue' and it's choices come up that barely gets notice, like it was just swept under the rug, I honestly rate the ending I received (and there are definitely multiple to be had) as disappointing as Mass Effect 3 was pre-patch (too disappointed to actually go back and replay to see the differences after it). Overall the game is pretty decent and eats up more time than you realize and it definitely has some stumbling points, if I were to give this a rating out of 100 it would be about a 78, especially right now when it's only $3. Replayability is there though it might feel a bit tedious although you now have knowledge of what kind of enhancements can play certain roles at different areas of the game  Also, just because for whatever reason it helped me enjy it more, try picturing the CEO you replace as that Masrani dude from Jurrasic World, not sure why but his image is the first thing that popped into my head when they talk about him.",

Some of the plot points were a little predictable, but I find that issue with many well written novels and is more of a personal issue with my insight with writing and story telling.  I like the semi present setting for science fantasy, and MetaHuman Inc. does not disappoint. After starting my first story I could not bring myself to walk away from the story, and I can not wait to give it at least one more go and make some diffrent choices to see how things turn out diffrent.  I will say that with no visuals or sound in this game you have to really like to read as this is truly a short book that allows you to make choices as to how the story will go, and in no way would I consider this a game unless you want to count manageing your own powers and the company's assets.",
