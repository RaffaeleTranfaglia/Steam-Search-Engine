            "review_text": " 'Kid just rages for a while'  ~The Stranger    Bastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.  The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.  To Your aid, in a quest to find, and rebuild Bastion, You’ll get a vast arsenal of even the weirdest weapons, each coming with different mechanics and “special skills” which further enhance Your possible combat strategies. Further modifications to Your play-style can be achieved through quite original system of upgradable structures built inside the Bastion, which allow Kid to chose worshiped “gods” in a shrine, or special drinks in a distillery each differently affecting game environment, providing new opportunities or threats.  Despite game mechanics being pretty simple it’s not easy to get bored with ‘Bastion’ even after a few long hours, but what really makes this game stand out is its unique way of telling the story. Most of our actions are commented actively by omniscient narrator, who not only slowly reveals some details behind tragic events that left the whole world in ruins, but also perfectly portraits the Kid and his few friends, allowing us to immerse into the games plot on a level rarely seen in video games.  The last thing worth mentioning about ‘Bastion’ is it’s astonishing soundtrack. Composed by Darren Korb this game’s music fits its dreamy, hand-drawn canvas perfectly, strongly enhancing the impact of the narrative.  Overall, I consider this game to be one of the most amazing feats of storytelling in video games, and definitely one of my favorites. And don’t get scared that the game relying so heavy on its story will get boring after just one completion. NG+ and Score Attack modes, matched which some arena-styled levels will allow You to spend long hours in “Bastion's” captivating world !   Pros:  - One of the most beautiful soundtracks out there. - Light, yet interesting story with uniqe responsive narration. - Vast amount of weapons, special skills and other modifications. - High replayability with NG+ and Score Attack.   Cons:  - To some, controls may feel a little unresponsive (I base on some friends opinions)",

            "review_text": "Full of cryptic one-liners and bluesy-folk music, Bastion almost seems more like an art house project than a game at first glance. Rest assured though, with it’s stylish isometric graphics and stunning presentation, Supergiant Games has created something that not only brings a certain amount of legitimacy to indie titles, but in my honest opinion pushes the established medium of video games forward as whole. I would argue that Bastion is one of the biggest arguments for games as an art form to date.  But how does one review or explain art? Everyone has their own interpretation. It is pretty easy to notice Bastion’s graphics, any screenshot is a testament to how gorgeous the game looks. But Bastion is not just a pretty picture; this is one game where you can not ignore the audio. There is a reactive narrator the explains everything as if he is watching you play. Fall off a cliff and he tells you to watch your step, get a new weapon and he is sure to have a little quip about it. Both the narrator and the game’s haunting music added greatly to the atmosphere and storytelling.  Not content to rest on style alone, Bastion is also a solid action RPG. You assume the role of The Kid, who is never named. You awake to empty space, an existence that has been destroyed by an event known as the Calamity. As you take your first steps into this brave new world, life springs up under your feet and upon arriving to a safe haven dubbed the Bastion, you learn that it is your destiny to rebuild. Cores brought from the Wilds beyond the safety of the walls allow you to construct buildings: a forge for upgrading weapons, a shrine for paying patronage to the gods, or even a distillery for mixing your own drinks.  Without giving too much away, the Kid comes to find out what caused the Calamity; the story is not entirely complex but rather poetic and touching. There are multiple different endings and a score attack mode to keep you playing long after the credits roll. And since the new game plus allows you to keep levels and weapons, I found it worth it to play through a few times in order to see everything. In short, I would say Bastion is pretty much perfection.",

            "review_text": "Narration, graphics and soundtrack. These are the main terms used when people talk about this game. What will strike your mind when you first start this game is the harmonic voice of the narrator. Better get used to it because he will bombard you with endless commentary about the schizophrenic postapocalyptic surroundings, lore and travails of our silent protagonist. The narration is rugged, dramatic and quite serious. I mean, just look at the place, it is torn asunder. The game itself provides mainly action-filled gameplay with a bit of RPG-ing with collecting weapons, resources and lore items. You can use the resources to upgrade your weapons in endless variations. The playthrough is not very difficult and you can finish the game with your favourite weapons, but the difficulty raises significantly in the Proving Grounds and in the free DLC challenge mode where most builds don't work very well. What I liked most about this game has to be the soundtrack. When the narrator gets a bit annoying near the end (mainly because the story doesn't stand up much to the other factors of the game), the soundtrack never ceases to surprise you. It combines many styles and some tracks became one of my all-time favourites. 7.5/10",

If there was, like, a rating system, maybe one to one hundred, this game would be a solid 100/100. I'd boot Bastion up and play it every day all day if I could.  This game is just incredibly good for an indie game. Most games you see with, like, a soundtrack, you might go 'ohh some guy thinks his music is good, ha ha' no, this guy, Darren Korb, did something ridiculously cool with Bastion. The soundtrack is just so good. Every step of the way you'll be like oh my god I am so digging this music, even while platforms fall from the sky, or fall from under you.  As indie games go, I don't usually say they are ever worth anything over $10. Bastion is the exception that proves me wrong. The, what, seven or so people who worked on Bastion have more than earned their chips (or whatever).  It's better than Diablo III.  It's so good.  Get it, today.",

            "review_text": "A nice narrative-driven action RPG with very beautiful and colourful visuals. Bastion has you visit different stages in a quest for collectible items to help you restore the hub area (called The Bastion), which is a small flying fortress.  The gameplay is similar to most other isometric action RPGs with hack and slash elements. There is a variety of enemies, weapons, and special skills. The game offers a nice hub area management, so you get to see it improving with each mission you. You raise important buildings, such as the forge, distillery, etc, which allow you to upgrade your weapons, buy stuff, accomplish memorial challenges, and even activate shrines of peculiar deities that make enemies stronger in exchange for earning you more of the game's currency with each kill.   In addition to regular missions, there are also proving grounds associated with each weapon you find. These proving grounds provide you with unique challenges, and depending on how well you do, you get a prize. Each weapon's challenge is different. For example, the hammer's challenge requires you to smash 100 objects as fast as possible, whereas bow's challenges requires you to destroy all targets in as few shots as possible, and so on.  I liked the variety of weapons the game had. It diversified the gameplay and allowed you to choose your preferred playstyle since each weapon acts differently and is useful in different situations (I personally enjoyed destroying things with a Galleon Mortar).   For an action hack and slash game, it has a fairly good story. Don't expect something super tense and immersive, but you can be sure that you won't just be going from area to area with no goal. The narrator who speaks whilst you're out adventuring is also fun to listen to (and in my opinion way better than in Supergiant Games' other title Transistor).  Overall it's been a fun game to get through. The presence of a couple of story choices in the final mission seemed a bit strange, since the rest of the game didn't have those, so this addition seemed a bit off, and some parts of the game could feel a tad repetitive, but otherwise there's nothing much to complain about.",

            "review_text": "I listened to Bastion's soundtrack way before I sat down and played through the game itself. I'm glad that the game is just as enchanting as its music. Bastion is one big errand mission as you travel through the skies to find the essential pieces needed to rebuild the Bastion--the hub world you escaped to when the world was nearly destroyed by a 'calamity.' I don't mean to tear down Bastion, as it's a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only unfortunate thing about such a straightforward task is that it can't go on too long before it gets old, which the developers must have realized as they kept the game at a perfect length.   Bastion offers several weapons that you can hold in any combination. You can also upgrade them with abilities that strengthen their unique attributes--meaning most people are going to have different setups by the time they reach the climax of the game. I had a lot of fun messing around with different combinations to see which weapons best fit my playstyle. To top it off, you can also use different 'tonics' to give yourself a boost via an assortment of perks. Once you're finished with your customization the gameplay is solid. Blocking, attacking and rolling all feel great and you feel like a pro after a few minutes messing with the controls.   The story is intriguing, but I'm going to leave it at that since I could easily give something of the plt away. If you're hoping for a deep, fulfilling story, you'll certainly find it here. I can say that the narration of 'the stranger' is one of my favorite parts of the game. I thought I would grow tired of his constant talking as I fought through and explored the world, but it's well done and never overbearing. Overall, you should definitely pick this one up if you want a fun adventure with a great story and stellar soundtrack.",

While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad. You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically. Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.  You play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards. This is where the great visuals are shown off. They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off. The music is also fantastic.   The biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests. The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties. It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.  What I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him. It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say 'Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!'. The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.  Overall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN. The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical.   I have awarded Bastion a rating of '5/5 top notch godlike'.

Had a hard time whether or not I should mute the narration, but at the same time I also needed the narrator to learn the story. Sure, I can just use subtitles to learn the story... but I still can't just read as I fight the enemies, plus the high needs to watch where I stand else I fall to death. Quite a dilemma right there for me.  Struggled with the control a little at the beginning of the game. The character's movement was a bit clunky.   Nevertheless, it's a very well-made game. Choices of upgradable weapons as you find them along the way enables you to try different approach to fight the enemies. The game also has the feature to buff the enemies to increase difficulty. Combats feel fresh with those changes. Challenges/trials are given for you to master your favorite weapons. There's no need to grind through the game to level up, or even completing the story. Difficulty level is just right.  Not to forget the great soundtrack!  If you are interested in Supergiant Games' creations, I recommend to play starting from Bastion. I played Transistor first so I couldn't help comparing the two and struggled a little in Bastion... but definitely can see how much Supergiant Games has improved!

In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so.

Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a 'small team made it against all odds in their own garage'.   I would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own.

[Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion] Intro: Its controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy.  Bastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of 'The Calamity', which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least]. The upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked. The story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.  Pros: Nice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.  Cons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.  Pseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.  Conclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.  ",

You play as 'The Kid', and head to Bastion to meet 'The Stranger', who narrates your story to build the Bastion and give hope to the new world.

Additionally, the system of leveling up was unique and further added to the styles of play, and the difficulty of the game scales well, with additional options to offer a greater challenge. Regardless of the engaging gameplay, Bastion excelled in its storytelling. Told through amazing narration, you experience the story of the world of the Bastion. The environment is defined by the artstyle and the soundtrack (which is definitely worth a listen). What stood out most to me concerning the story, however, was its ability to invoke an emotional response from me. As someone who usually plays games for just their gameplay, the whole story (and particularly the conclusion) I was surprised at how much I actually cared about the kid and the characters he meets.

He looks at me, and I nod in approval to let him continue talking while he types what's intresting about the ''active narrating' doo-hickey. He says how 'cool' it is to hear a person say what you're doing in a game and actively comments; and that it immerses the player into the world. I don't understand a word of it, but I continue nodding.  He then starts recounting about the times he played the game, about the 'Calamity'. He talks about waking up, floating in the sky in the middle of nowhere. Then something about a hammer. He starts listing all the types of weapons you get as you play, a machete. Rifle, Mortar, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, a Bow and Arrow. Even a flamethrower. He then lists all the monsters. Gasbags, Slimes, Crows, something about a Queen. All pretty interesting, but to a different man.  +Kid talks about the 'active narrating' again, saying how good it is +Then he says the controls are easy to learn, +'People with different playstyles will love it', he says +From what I've heard from the kid, the game's story is the best he's ever done  Watchin' his smile fade to a frown, he starts to complain -'Too easy', says the kid. Well if you wanted it harder, all you gotta do is ♥♥♥♥ off a god, I say -He goes on to say that althought it's a great story, it's mighty predictable. Hmmph. -Kid becomes a lunatic, shouting something about Birds and Spikeweeds. Don't care much for that language he uses with it.  He pretends to be judge now, as he coughs and stacks a pile of cards, with the numbers 1 to 10 on 'em. Wait for it...  He holds up a 9, good golly. That's gotta make some'uns day.",

Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.

            "review_text": "I @#$%ING LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! I finally bought it when it was on sale for $2.24, which was a STEAL! That's less than a Starbucks frappucino, guys.  Summary: Beautiful music and art but can't zoom in; story not extremely original but well done; floating maps are interesting but easy to fall off of; customizable controls, gameplay styles, and loadouts; minigames and side missions for loot and money; using idols changes play difficulty.   ------  1) Art. Basically what first drew me into the game. Even though the drawing style is 'kiddish' with brightly colored maps and big-headed characters (I think it's easier to animate and stay visible on the map), the art is digitally painted SO beautifully. In fact, I wishlisted this game immediately upon browsing the selection of profile wallpapers available from crafting the steam badge. The isometric map design imposes permanent bird's eye view which cannot be rotated. It's a real shame that the you cannot zoom the camera in and out of maps besides the Bastion, but you get used to it.   2) Music. Amazing soundtrack which greatly enhances the atmosphere of the game and your immersion into its world. When Zia's theme first played, I was taken aback by how perfect the moment was that I stopped walking around and simply listened.   3) Story. Looking back at the concept of the 'Calamity,' you realized that it's not particularly innovative or original, but it is successful in the way that the backstory is slowly revealed and keeps you wondering for more information. That also opens itself to fitting with the fantasy steampunk theme. At the end, there are choices that you make based on opposing moral values. That said, there are also serious themes in the story which contrast with the bright colors and cute art style. There's death and the loss of loved ones, but the biggest overarching question is whether the ends justify the means: How comfortable are you, The Kid, with sacrificing the lives of others in order to secure your own survival?   3a) Rucks narrates the game while you play as The Kid in a deep voice that's as smooth as BUTTER. He provides much of the backstory to the game and its characters. It's actually helpful sometimes because he alerts you to incoming enemies or a part in the map that will kill you.   3b) So many little quirky details made me smile. Most notably, The Kid always soars through the air and invariably lands on his face. Rucks also says the darndest things. The first time I died, he said something like, 'And then The Kid falls to his death. Nah I'm just foolin'.' You hear 'Kid just rages for a while' if you destroy objects in the beginning. When Rucks tells you about The Kid's tutor: She 'taught Kid some good manners. “Never used 'em though.'  4) Gameplay. You travel between your home, the Bastion, and other areas of the globe via Skyway. Your goal is to collect items to restore the Bastion, but exploration of the map is encouraged in order to get loot, fulfill a particular side mission, collect upgrades for weapons, and domesticate pets for an achievement. On each map, the pathway is built out as you walk near the end of it. Maps are designed to float in the air, which is a blessing and a curse: It's easy to fall off, but you can push enemies into the abyss.   4a) Controls are simple and easily reconfigurable. There is an option to move using keyboard (WASD), mouse (kind of like playing League of Legends), or controller. Controller support is xbox only, but using a 3rd party program on PC to get my PS3 controller recognized as such did the trick. Playing with the analog stick felt more intuitive for me.  4b) Fighting style is hack and slash. You can rambo, defend, camp, hide in a corner and snipe; whatever your play style is. Countering is rewarding in reflecting damage, but not necessary.  4d) Various weapons, skills, and alcohols, which give passive bonuses, make for a myriad of loadout combinations. Upgrading weapons is easy if you loot alot, and it also allows for customization because there are two choices on the left and right per tier unlocked.  4c) There are different types of side missions. You can go to Proving Grounds, where you use a specific weapon to complete a goal under certain conditions and are rewarded with upgrade materials. Other challenges, which you earn money from completing, are like mini-achievements. Battling waves of enemies in the 3 'Who Knows Where' maps, also known as The Kid's Dream, The Singer's Dream, and The Survivor's Dream, nets you money. (P.S.: I found the context for getting to these Dreams hilarious--The Kid basically gets high in the first one and food comas for the second. P.P.S This is where you learn character backstories.)   4d) Idols can be invoked in order to increase the difficulty of the game since they buff enemies. Each idol invoked adds +5% to experience and money earned.",

Not bad, just average. Two weapons slots and a special move, block and dodge, and that's it. But yet, its a fantastic game. I think what really makes it is the narrator. The game is only above average, and probably wouldn't have held my attention past the 3 or 4th level, but the narrator keeps this running dialogue going the entire time that fills you in on the main characters backstory, thoughts, and feelings. And it actually interacts with your characters actions in real time. Like when I was first starting, I just started bashing stuff with a hammer, and the narrator said, 'and then the kid decided to just rage for a while,' and I lost it.   This is one of those games that is more than the sum of its parts. I totally recommend it, and have totally enjoyed every minute of it.",

Just hearing the feedback on combat and the bits of information about the world without having to thumb through pages of in game text makes the whole thing a smooth experience.

The game itself is an isometric 2D action game with some very simple RPG elements. You can equip 2 weapons at anytime (each weapon can be upgraded 5 times and each time you can choose between two impromvements) from a growing arsenal of very different weapons. 2 melee weapons? 2 ranged weapons? A shotgun and a hammer? A bow and a machete? That's all up to you! Each weapon plays completely different and adds a lot of variety. Additionally you can equip a special skill for one of your 2 weapons or a weapon independent skill. You got also a shield to block and counter (with good timing) enemy attacks, a dodge roll and a button to drink heal tonics. So the basic mechanics are very simple but always spot on.   So while inexperienced gamers will probably enjoy this game (there is even an easy mode if you basically just want to enjoy the story), there are also a lot of challenges for hardcore gamers. For each weapon there is a location with a certain challenge and depending on how you perform you can unlock upgrade materials and skills for this weapon. While acing each challenge can be quite difficult (and rewarding) all this is completely optional. So if you don't like a weapon, there is no need in doing these. You can also invoke so called idols, basically deities, that each will add a certain challenge to the game. Enemies may just get tougher, drop bombs at death, deflect your attacks, and so on. But each invoked idol also increases the gained ingame currency and experience gained. So you can nicely tailor the difficulty to your likes.  But the main reason, why you should play this game: The narrator. He will narrate and comment almost everything you do with such an awesome voice, it will get stuck in your head. For each weapon combination you equip, for each level you have to redo, because you failed the first time, he got a comment for you and the way he narrates the story is just beautiful. The story itself is also quite touching but is really supported by the way (and voice) of narration. The art style is also amazing and fits perfectly into the game and the story told.  The first playthrough took me about 7 hours (with almost everything done) but I just started with NewGame+ that unlocks additional idols and let's you keep you all your upgrades. It's also nice how NewGame+ fits in with one of the 2 possible endings (you can choose between them in the end).  The only thing I can actually critizise about this game is that restarting the weapon challenges takes a bit too much time if you already know that you can get the high score anymore. But that's also just a few seconds. And that you cannot replay levels that you've finished (you may have missed certain items) but that makes sense within the story. Yeah...this game is awesome!

I've played through Bastion twice now and it's still very enjoyable. One can't really say enough about the great job Supergiant did with building an interesting and slightly mysterious world, and crammed it with atmosphere and character. Everything from the music, the narration, the detailed and beautiful art, and interesting plot all add up to a world you like seeing and experiencing.   The music and voicework really deserve their own mention, winning many awards (not that those mean much nowadays) for both the composer and Logan Cunningham for his portrayal as the Narrator. The best way I can describe the soundtrack is like...acoustic frontier western folk music mixed with electronica. It's great and can easily be listened to on it's own.   The games combat mechanics are the one thing that doesn't shine quite as bright as the rest. What is there is very solid and controls just fine, but it tends to be a bit dull and not very challenging, especially in the first half or so of the game. It gets a bit button mashy. Later on, more enemies and more varied weapons and projectiles pick up the pace and things feel much better. I just wish I had the same level of enjoyment in combat throughout all of it. There are some city building and weapon upgrade features, which are welcome, but don't have much substance. With more time and money in the budget, I'd love to see what Supergiant can do with a more fleshed out sequel.  It's the atmosphere and aesthetics that take this good game and elevate it to something special.",

Game play wise, Bastion doesn’t bring many new cards to the table, but what it does, it does well. This is a mechanically strong hack and slash RPG with a few nice touches such as good selection or varied weapons, all of which are upgradeable, the ability to pick your own difficultly by “worshiping” certain gods, a home base which can be upgraded throughout the course of the game, and a spirit (the beverage) based system which lets you tailer the your character to your own tastes.  The game itself is focused almost completely on fighting your through levels, upgrade your weapons and fight your way through more level, which this might come across and bland, to some, the constant stream of upgrades keeps it fresh as you unlock new weapons and abilities which often keeps you wondering what reward will you encounter next.  All levels appear to be hand painted affairs, which rival the art in games such as Braid and Capsized, they consist of parts of a once prosperous, but now shattered floating city, the parts of which literally fall into place as you explore the landscape, an effect which doesn’t seem to get too old. As you explore the levels, the narrator, voiced by the seductively smooth Logan Cunningham explains what you are seeing and how the world used to be, occasionally commenting upon your own actions which bring you into the game, often purposely steering from the task at hand and even throwing yourself off a platform to see how he would respond.  The music is brilliant in its own right, comprising of a generally “wild west” theme mixed with more contemporary beats and the occasional South Asian flavour, offering some stand-out tracks which are pleasant and also relevant to the characters and their stories.  The story itself was diverse enough to make one invest in their character and the world, with enough subtle twists that one would find it genuinely interesting and caring about how the characters would be affected as the story unfolds.  Although the 3D models of the characters were adequate, they do stand out against the beautiful 2D hand-painted backdrops of the broken world, a not to forget the ease at which one could fall off the platforms in some situations.   Where this game shines is the presentation, everything from the outstanding narrative, to the story, art and music which are all of a high quality and to experience more of it is what really drive this game forward.

That being said, after about 30-40 minutes of play you likely either don't notice anymore or don't care. There are some games you get for the story and the art moreso than the gameplay; Bastion is certainly one of those games, but the gameplay doesn't really let you down either.  There is a fine selection of weapons, power-ups, and challenge arenas. If you just want to run through the story, enjoy the fine voice-acted narration, and then call it a day you can. Or you can bust your butt and try to unlock everything, but at no point did it feel to me like doing busy work; I always felt adequately rewarded for my time. It's the coffee table reading equivalent of a game in that you can play it in 20 minute intervals and always feel like you're getting somewhere, which for me is an invaluable game to have on hand at all times. Yes, I like the long quests, but sometimes I just wanna sip some coffee and game a bit before getting to work on something.  New Game+ grants you the ability to build on previous progress, but this is a story that when it ended I really wanted to know what would happen next. And that's almost a perfect ending. You get a host of weapons, liquor-based powerups, relics, cultures, history, gods, challenge modes, and then at the end really all you want more of is the storyline; not because the story provided was poor but because it was so good that you hate giving those characters up to the void of what we cannot know (unless they release a sequel).",

I saw this game on sale, and I heard good things about it, so I decided to spend my hard earned 2 dollars on it. The game is not hard to run, it never crashed, the framerate did not decrease and it still manages to look very nice. Gameplaywise, the game is quite simple. You walk with the w, a, s and d, dodge with space, block with shift, which also locks on targets and aim and attack with the mouse. You can carry two weapons at once. There is a set of melee weapons and ranged weapons, which you unlock through the game. You can equip two melee weapons or two ranged weapons, but I mostly stick with one melee and one ranged. You attack with your primary weapon with left mouse button and secondary weapon with the right mouse button, and you attack in the direction you point with the cursor, unless you are targeting an enemy. But the targeting system seriously bugged me. I thought that pointing at the enemies was a little dumb, so I tried to target the enemies, but the targeting system seems to target enemies randomly, maybe it targets the enemy closest to the cursor, but I am not really sure. Anyway, back to the weapons. My favorites are the machete, hammer, pike, pistols and shotgun, but I hate the rifle and mortar, but the worst thing about this is that in some levels, you get a new weapon, and the game feels that you just have to try it out and half of the level is just a weapon tutorial, which I thought was kinda dumb. But you get the option to switch your weapons about halfway through, which is neat. Throughout the game, a narrator tells the story, and he has an awesome voice, but most of the time I cannot hear him, due to all the noises in the game, but you can mute the sound and turn the voice volume up, which helps. And the story is awesome, listen to it. The game takes about 5 hours to beat, not counting the optional weapon challenges, where you can win materials to further upgrade your weapons. There are also survival modes if you're in that kind of stuff. Anyway, I think Bastion was a pretty fun game, and it's cheap, too. I would say it's worth the money, even though it's kinda short and the game isn't perfect. And the soundtrack is for sale, too.",

Also there are shrines you can activate to make the gane harder and spirits you can equip to gain some passive abilities. By spirits I mean drinks, not ghost things.  The story is a little on the short side if you just want to run through the game but if you listen to all of it and go after the challenge levels the game becomes pretty long for its price. There's hundreds of other more detailed reviews which all seem pretty good and there probably doesn't need to be another so this is all I have to say about this game. 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Bastion is overall a solid action RPG (with touches of beat 'em up gameplay) wrapped in a wonderfully crafted world. This game has a complete and unique story and a beautiful enivronment with its art style and music standing out and being different from other games. As an action RPG, Bastion consists of running around levels destroying enemies and gaining money and experience from them. Weapons consist of various melee weapons like in most fantasy games, while expanding to firearms and explosives for a more technologically advanced loadout. In addition to the variety of weapons, special abilities, upgrades, and passive abilities are addedd to allow progression as the game goes on. The game isn't terribly difficult, but there are some surprise parts that may cause some deaths first time around. Other sources of difficult parts can be remedied by using a better strategy or weapon and skill loadout, and then it doesn't become very hard anymore. With a good amount of options along with a not too difficult except in some parts difficulty, the gameplay is mostly relaxing and fun while not going too deep in gameplay mechanics. The art and music in this game are simply gorgeous. Each screen is adorned with painted objects in each level, ranging from the destroyed ruins to forests and mines. Sometimes the level pieces literally fall into place, which is a nice touch. The characters and other NPCs themselves are also designed nicely and look great in the game's environment. As the high quality of the art is good, so is the well composed music. The music, like the game, is a bit different than most games, in that it carries a sort of apocalyptic fantasy with traditional instruments backed with some modern electronic styling. The vocal music in the game also carries well into the story, which is a strong part of the game. When you first start Bastion, you will be a bit disoriented and confused at the start of its story. Gradually however, the game opens itself up by telling backstory of what happened from the ever popular Narrator, who also goes by The Stranger and Rucks. Just hearing his voice and commentary for almost every action you do is pleasing and is the person who does the most story explanation. Once the backstory is mostly told, a series of events start to happen at the middle of the game, which shifts the game from a mostly cheery place to a more serious set of matters. The characters are more complex than at first, giving a good story. The short lines from Rucks can be funny and also be more dramatic as serious events unfold. The story in Bastion is very interesting and can be sad at parts once the game decides to pick up. Bastion is a well designed action RPG that offers a good amount of fighting and strategy to players. The luscious world with the rich art and music along with a unique story are more powerful points that make for a great game experience. The gameplay is fairly straightforward, but the art, music, and story are very pleasing and one of a kind in Bastion.",

The details and colors are awfully pleasing to look at, the voice acting never gets old &amp; does an amazing job of getting you into the story and, most of all, the soundtrack is breathtaking. It has been a long while since the last time I wanted to buy a soundtrack so badly.   The story is well paced and makes the most of small cast of endearing characters. The twists, although mostly easy to predict, are paced in a way that keeps the story compelling and interesting. I could not help but get attached. There is also some replayability to the game as it has multiple endings. Finishing the game once means that you have the option to start over and keep all the weapons etc. that you got the first time around.  The game in itself is not too hard and offers you a nice system to up the challenge should you desire it. As you play the first time around, you collect various idols, each bearing its own difficulty, that you can activate to pepper things up. The achievements are also quite fun to get.

Seriously, you can't go wrong.   Pros: -   Soundtrack.   One of the best, if not my favourite, soundtracks to any game I have played to date. I often come back to listen to it while playing other games, studying or just relaxing (I may or may not be listening to it as I type this). -   Story.   A very unique and amazing storytelling experience. Something you will remember for quite a time after playing.    Choosing to save Zulf and having 'Setting Sail, Coming Home' playing in the background. The feels get me every time.    -   Gameplay.   A variety of weapons, weapon uprgades, skills, tonics (perks) allowing you to play in many different ways. -   Graphics.   Pleasing artstyle that suits the game well.  Neutral: -   Length.   Only a 5-6 hour story. Though it doesn't feel dragged out or too short. It's a good length for what it is, though it may leave some wanting more. -   Replayability.   There's pretty much only the main story and a few side challenges you can do. You can't go back to story areas after completing them. Though, there is a new game+ and score attack mode to keep things a little fresh after completing the game once and idols to modify the difficulty of the game if you want a challenge.  Cons: - What is it bad for?   Absolutely nothing!   SAY IT AGAIN.",

The Kid (that's his name, so don't expect a plot or story that makes sense) walks around killing monsters while platforms raise up around him, creating a beautiful and engaging fantasy world. Then there's the narrator, who's in the completely wrong game. He describes everything you do in excruciating detail and in a manner that sounds like he belongs in a historical western. It's mismatched and distracting, so I muted it while I played.  You get a limited arsenal of weapons with upgrades, which controls the difficulty in an interesting way. You can complete goals with each weapon or add to the monster difficulty by activating different items you find. The fighting is limited to a few buttons, though, which gets a bit repetitive. It's enough complexity to keep me interested for a few hours but not enough to keep me engaged for days on end.",

The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game.

In closing, this is a beautiful, moving meditation on fate, loss, and culture, with a soundtrack that will claw its way into your heart and lay eggs and addicting action gameplay that lets each player choose their own style.

            "review_text": "Hello, all. It's been a long time since I've played Bastion, but I think I can remember it well enough to post a review. Let's get started, eh?  ***************************************** *Name: Bastion *Developer: Supergiant Games *Publisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment *Year:2011 *Platforms:Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Xbox 360, iOS, Playstation 4, Playstation Veta. *****************************************  +Pros +Well, first thing that comes to mind when I think of Bastion is the music. It was delightful to listen to while slaying enemies, and while doing most tasks. I still listen to it regularly today, even though I played the game in, around early 2015. +The Narrorator. His voice is very nice, to say the least. I enjoyed the storytelling through him and not so much the main character, as I tend to in most of the media that I consume. +The weapon variation. I can't remember exactly how many weapons were in the game, but each one had its own style of play, and you can carry two weapons with you going out into your missions. The ones that come to the top of my head are the hammer, rifle, and the bow. Another thing that spices up the customization of the game is the abilities. You can pick up black potions (the in-game name escapes me at the moment), to use a secondary ability, such as summoning squirts, or other such things that I won't spoil. +The Visuals. I heavily enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, the paths building themselves as you walk onto them. Very pretty indeed. +It has New Game+, which is always a good thing  -Cons -Well, it's hard for me to think of cons for Bastion, if I'm honest. I'm sure they're there, but it's been so long since I've played Bastion that I can't really remember anything that truely annoyed me. So yes, I would recommend this game.",

You basically button mash melee to beat up enemies and occasionally hold the (B) button to do ranged shots. You can do special attacks (such as spin-around attack for 3 seconds) one per bottle of Black Tonic you find.  The game is presented in isometric perspective, with the game world floating in space. As you walk around the floor tiles fly up from nowhere and form the floor you walk on. This is and interesting presentation effect for the first 3 seconds, then it gets to be real tedious watching the level fly around. After an hour it's just sickening to watch. Furthermore, you don't know where you can walk in an area until the path has flown together. I bashed endlessly into dead ends trying to see where I should go next and whether a new path would fly up. Monotonous and a bad game design choice.  Then the narrator. Ooooohhhh the narrator. It narrates most actions you take in the game from walking into a new room to breaking boxes for currency. Neat concept again, interesting for the first minute or two, but absolutely maddening thereafter with no way to shut it off. To make it worse the narrator is done in 'Dismissive American Vigilante' accent, and no disrespect to the voice artist but for me it just did not work as it came off as totally inauthentic, and jarringly inappropriate for the rest of the game's theme. The cringe-y writing didn't help either.  I put in my hour waiting for something to happen and nope, just no more time will be wasted. Strip away the flashy presentation and you have a lame button-masher beat-em-up that wouldn't be worth $0.25 on sale.",

Each weapon fills a unique niche with highly modular upgrade trees that don't just boost arbitrary stats, but instead change how a weapon plays. I'd describe the combat system as being somewhere between the Batman Arkham series, and a bullet-hell SHMUP. Each enemy has a unique pattern and isn't particularly difficult individually. Instead the challenge comes from having multiple enemies with varying patterns and behavior thrown at you at once, and constantly having to change tactics, prioritize targets, and pick the right weaponry for the job. Every single weapon combination in the game has a voice-acted clip to go along with it. 'Perks' are modular 'brews' that give you unique abilities such as being able to leach health from damage, in return for healing less from your healing potions. The game itself has fantastically deep lore, a rich and fully realized world, and a genuinely grim and disturbing tone. It is an experience well worth playing, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. There are $60 games on Steam with half the length, depth, and replayability as Bastion, so I think it's worth $15, or $2.99 as of the time of this review.",

You end up with an impressive array of varied weapons to choose from, and they are all upgradable, but you can only chose two before you enter a (floating) dungeon with no idea what you will be fighting. You can also buy permanent buffs, but you can only have a few active at any time.  You have an inventory, but it is minimal and based purely on furthering the game.

I was too concerned with getting from point A to point B without falling (while wondering what was off the screen shooting at me) to ever really *care* what the protagonists problem was or what NPC's wanted me to do for them and why. For me, it ended up all about getting to the end of the dungeon with little joy getting there. I did not finish the game.  Pros: Truly gorgeous to look at Varied upgradable weapons A choice of upgradable buffs The narrator  Cons: Being forced to walk diagonally on floating platforms, or fall off Choosing weapons blindly Mobs and gauntlet running (on the diagonal) This game is playable on a PC, but definitely wasn't made for PC",

It's actually a typical, linear action/RPG-esque game with a slightly retro feel, some good but repetitive music and a story that hasn't really impressed me.  Bastion is a good game, but I didn't understand why it was hyped and, despite my numerous attempts, I was simply never able to finish it and got bored about halfway through. I just found the gameplay very repetitive : you basically click on everything that moves until it dies in a typical action-RPG fashion, except you don't have the loot, gold or rewards that make these games so addicting. Combat just wasn't satisfying and was often a matter of mashing Mouse1 and blocking once every five seconds before repeating until the monster/boss was down. Challenge levels are more frustrating than they are challenging and the special gear you find in these levels isn't very useful or fun to use because it often simply gives you more ways to kill enemies you could already easily kill with your hammer by left-clicking them to death.  It's unique in its visual presentation, but in my opinion, the game's originality ends there, and it does not compensate for its lackluster gameplay.",

            "review_text": " Overview   Bastion is a colorful action RPG, similar to Dust: An Elysian Tail or Muramasa: Rebirth, but in an isometric view. The game presents its themes through narration, which occurs in cutscenes and during gameplay. The narrator (The Stranger) will offer commentary on your actions, such as falling from platforms, taking damage, or defeating foes effortlessly. These observations are not so frequent that they feel shoehorned in either; in fact, many of them occur within or in place of the default voiceover. This bolsters the feeling that the player is driving the story. The narrator reminds one of Ron Perlman's Fallout performance in cadence and tone.    Audio and Visuals   The art style bleeds with rich color, and no two levels seem alike, though they share some themes. The character design is somewhat cartoonish, but blends in well with the storybook scenery. The soundtrack is enjoyable, though it sinks quickly into the background. There is, however, a very nice (if haunting) theme song that catches very well.   Gameplay   The controls are pretty smooth, but you may have some trouble doing manual aiming. Luckily, most attacks are auto-aimed. The block-and-counter system is a fun part of the advanced gameplay, though sometimes enemies seem to get past your bulwark when they shouldn't--so keep a tonic handy. While the gameplay is fluid, there are not many things that veterans would find too challenging. The Score Attack mode offers advanced players a way to set their own goals and challenge themselves, instead.   Perhaps the most interesting feature of the game is the choice you get in weapons, skills, and upgrades that are FULLY modifiable, once earned, between stages. There are attribute-enhancing character upgrades that sometimes have drawbacks than you can mitigate with other bonuses or adapting your playstyle. Each weapon has ten upgrades, of which you may choose between two on each of five tiers. One skill can be equipped, most of which require a specific weapon be equipped so they usually complement their strategy.  Though nothing changes with additional playthroughs, the story will move very fast in New Game+. What's more, the score attack mode (which requires you to play through from level 1, regardless of previous saves) hosts an online leaderboard (linked to Steam) to test your skill and strategy against friends and strangers.   Summary   This game is a good addition to any action RPG fan's library, particularly if you are new to the genre.",

            "review_text": "Bastion sets a high standard for all other indie games. I purchased it over a year ago and finally decided to write a review on it because it is one of my favorite games of all time and I just started playing Transistor, Supergiant's second title.  Combat: 8/10 The combat is fluid and enjoyable, and it feels unique despite the inherent similarity it has to other action RPGs. However, it is not without its flaws. It is possible in many situations to exploit certain weapons (esp. the mortar) to avoid fights entirely. Additionally, the enemies lack a lot of variety. Despite these shortcomings the combat is very involved and the controls are tight. Never do you die in this game without knowing exactly what you did wrong.   Soundtrack: 10/10 Bastion simply has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a game. Darren Korb does not phone it in on any tracks. It is one of the few soundtracks I still come back to for recreational listening. The soundtrack plays a large part in making Bastion greatly immersive.  Environment: 9/10 As I mentioned above, Bastion is very immersive. The environments are beautiful and the art style is very easy on the eyes. Not much to say other than its serves as a good example of how art can function in games and the game itself can become a piece of art to look upon.  Story: 9/10 Supergiant, as I have discovered from Transistor, has a certain way of telling stories in games. Very few characters actually speak in game which adds a degree of mystery to the plot/lore and allows for the gamer to fill in the blanks. I support this choice. It keeps the quality of the voice cast high while not taking away from the story. The immediate story is right in front of you the entire time and there is a relatively clear end goal. The complete story, however, is told through the descriptions of items, the side comments and observations made by the narrator, the soundtrack, and the actions of NPCs. It is rare in game plots to find much ambiguity but Bastion does a wonderful job of crafting a world in which that ambiguity allowed me to create a vast world in my imagination.  Additional Features/Things I Didn't Want to Put in Other Categories: 7/10 This is where the game has some of its greatest shortcomings but there are some very bright spots still. I'll start with the bad. The 'Memorial' operates as a sort of challenge board, which is a nice idea, but I don't think it was very well implemented. It just seemed tacked on as an extra upgrade to the Bastion that was needed. Additionally, many of the weapons are just not that good. Not what you start with either. Some weapons acquired halfway through the game are noticeably less powerful than the starting ones. However, all of the weapons feel unique so that's a definite plus and perhaps there was some strategy to them that I missed.  On to the Bastion. Being able to upgrade the Bastion in whatever order you want is a nice touch and I really enjoyed being able to get the features I wanted when I wanted them. It added additional satisfaction to advancing through the game because I got to find out just what that new upgrade was! The leveling system was interesting and I'm not going to go too in-depth because this review is becoming a novel but it allows you to choose potions with given effects (some good and some bad) each level. You can respec whenever. Now my favorite unique part of the Bastion. The Idol system. Idols are the statues of the old gods of the world that the player acquires by advancing through the game. Each Idol confers an experience bonus to the player while buffing the enemies in some way. This is a great way to increase the difficulty while not making it feel artificial with arbitrary health and damage buffs to enemies that make the game impossible. They just make the game more fun because its more challenging.   I think that sums up my review nicely and is a pretty succinct way to show why I enjoy the game so much. Aside from the excellent story, soundtrack, and visual environment, Bastion is simply fun because it is challenging. That's good for a game. That's how a game should be.",

The story is very emotional and might hit you in the feels kinda hard if you are like me. The soundtrack is beautiful, and fits the game so well. The only downside I found too this game is that the first story mode playthrough doesn't take much time. I was able to finish my first story playthrough in under a day. I am going to do a plus game another time so I can enjoy this crazy game all over again. If you do not have Bastion, Buy It =) You will not regret it",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer - This is being written just after the finishing the campaign.  Bastion is an excellent game, and I have no idea what took me so long to jump on this train and play it! Gameplay is excellent, tight responsive combat with exceptional diversity in player weapons and attacks being tossed against a wildly unique plethora of enemies. This freedom allows for great player choice in playstyle, and no matter how weak certain weapons may feel when you first get them, the upgrade system greatly assists and closing any stat disparities by the end of the game, though some (lookin' at you, Carbine) because borderline overpowered by virtue of their upgrades.  The story is excellent - your character, The Kid, is a post-apocalyptic janitor, trying to restore his people's safehold, the Bastion, while encountering the remainder of the world doing the best they can to stop him. Philosophical posturing is the flavor of the over-arching story, and the excellent narration of The Old Man breathes live into gameplay elements in a wildly unique way - I found myself disappointed whenever I accidentally cut the narrator short when jumping from one place to another, causing me to wait those extra ten or fifteen seconds to snap up every second of dialogue before taking the portals to the next sounds.  Of course everyone has spoken about the art style for Bastion, but it really is top-notch. Consistent color palettes and tediously hand-crafted tile sets give nearly every zone a unique flavor. The judicious use of color filtering during 'cut-scenes,' (if you can call them that), starkly emphasize, rather than detract, the mood and tone.  On top of the art is the music and sound direction for the game - again, thematically consistent and spectacularly accurate at helping to convey the message the game is presenting at any given time. Fast-paced and flowing music during combat really help to get the blood flowing, while the haunting melodies during introspective and questioning scenes draw your attention into the game in top form.   Truly, the thematic style of Bastion, both artistically and musically, create an environment that gently coaxes the player, rather than forcing or asking, into full suspension of disbelief. I found myself losing track of time, and truly, a sense of physical reality, as I fell further and further into the world of Bastion.  While secondary content is available after beating the game, it exists on the level of replaying missions for score points on a global leaderboard, or trying to complete more difficult challenges. To the best of my knowledge, completing the game once reveals its main content, and while playability still exists after beating the main story campaign, it is simply a repitition of the story with greater challenge.   My only misgiving's with Bastion are the tile based maps - while fresh and interesting, I sometimes found myself relying a bit too heavily on the rising tiles to direct my movement through the map - I found that the tiles implicitly discouraged exploring the maps because of invisible boundaries. It seemed inconsistent whether one path or another would yield progress in the level, and only by comitting one way for a few minutes could you really be sure where you were going, which always left me wondering whether I had missed any side paths. All in all, a very minor complaint.  Final Verdict - 9/10. If you have the means, I highly recommend playing it. Watching it on youtube or reading a review can only provide a transparent facsimile of what makes Bastion special - its the experience that the game provides via your choices in game that really leave a lasting impact.",

The length of the game seems right too and the fact that you can techinally play it twice to get both ending is a great move by the developers. Even the music... oh man, the music. I can't fault it.

The only downside to me was that it was easy for me to fall off the map with the mouse and keyboard controls (preset scheme 1). This is not due to the poor design of the maps or the artwork, more like a quirk of trying to align correctly with where I wanted to roll/jump to. Haven't played it with a gamepad, so I'm not sure if that would make things easier. It could also be that I'm not a good mouse and keyboard player and I'm playing on a laptop, so take this downside with a grain of salt.

The environments are lush and full of life (both metaphorical and literal), the music is gorgeous (it's rare for me to really want a video game soundtrack, but I want this one like a desert wants a rainstorm), and the combat is engaging. There's enough of a variety of weapons and skills to prevent stagnation, and no setup is inherently superior to any other, which is a nice change from... well, pretty much every other game out there. I found my niche with a highly precise style using the pike and carbine, while my boyfriend prefers the raw damage output of the hammer and dueling pistols. Neither style is the 'right' one by any standards but our own. The way the upgrade system functions provides even more flexibility -- rather than having to unlock each upgrade individually, the player can purchase a tier with two upgrades and switch between them at no additional cost.  My only complaint is that there are very few venues for experimentation. The proving grounds are fun as tests of skill with individual weapons, but once cleared, they close for the remainder of the playthrough. The various iterations of 'Who Knows Where' are explicitly stated in-game to be testing grounds for loadouts, but playing through them multiple times can be a bit of a grind... and the narration doesn't change, so the exposition does begin to lose its punch. Admittedly, I have yet to test out the 'Score Attack' mode, which, if I understand correctly, allows multiple replays of individual levels. This may prove to be what I'm looking for.  This one very minor (at least for me) gripe aside, Bastion has earned a place among my all-time favorite games.

This game is so beatiful, have a great music and most amazing thing - narration, one kind of voice that you will never forget. Yet, Bastion is a one big disappointment. There is one reason for that and it's that game is getting boring quite fast. The story also is not bad but somehow, even with all these things combined together, I just couldn't spent in Bastion more than 30min-1hour per sitting. And so after many months I did it. I beat the game. To be honest, it was a hell ride for me. Was it gameplay? Dunno. I understand this many positive reviews and I really would want to give Bastion one myself but I can't. Even with this many great elements Bastion wasn't a fun game to play for me.",

It's really the only voice you hear the whole game but that's just fine. Weird decision though especially for a Warner Brother's Game. Speaking of sound: The music is fantastic at some points and underlines some magic moments. The art style is also very special and unique.  After all that said you might think I am really in love with this game but this is not the case. After ~4 hours it somehow started to annoy me and it was kind of a struggle to complete it. I can't put my finger on what I disliked. Maybe it went too fast from beeing too easy to beeing too hard. Or maybe it's that you can although speedrun through the levels without fighting any enemies.

Then there is the narrator and the story itself, it's really cool, the way the narrator describes the enviroment and what you do when you are playing! The story about this boy who suddenly wakes up one day on a flying island and the whole universe is shattered to pieces is amazing (I don't want to spoil anything, you have to figure it out youself). [The story really touched me and the smooth narrator voice i thought were awesome (10/10)]  The fighting mechanics could be better, but they are still really awesome! There is loads of weapons, skills and upgrades, which makes the game even more exciting.   The design of the game/visuals are breathtaking! First of all how when you walk around on the flying islands they start becoming bigger as you walk towards the edge. Second, the watercolouring'ish ways the landscape is coloured, is just beautiful.  The only bad thing really is the lenght of the game. If you expect this game to last for +100 hours of fun, you should probably look elsewhere.

I really enjoyed this game and loved the music and controls, it was easy to pick up and at start was quite easy. I especially enjoyed the narration as the voice was great and fit the character well, although this was one of the only ways to learn about what the Calamity is, how it happened and what the Bastion is. Despite this unique way of storytelling, it was done really well.   This game has at two points, different paths you could take one of them dramatically effecting the ending, the other, I'm not so sure about. The map desgin was certainly unique as the ground would appear the closer you moved towards it potentially opening into secret paths with hidden loot. Although this may seem like a cool feature, it can also be quite annoying as you're rolling along and either fall off from the gaps in the floor or from mobs hitting you off, which can be quite frustrating especially if you've set the difficulty up really high. Although unlike some games, you will not get killed from falling (unless you've got really low health). You'll end up falling onto the mpa again losing a small amount of health. This isn't that bad but whenever you land from falling, you'll fall face flat on the ground needing a second or two to stand up again. This happens every time even when you spawn in the world.  The combat in this game is awesome and quite easy to find a strategy, this all falls to pieces when you change from easy difficulty and add these things called idols which give you extra xp and money. This adds extra things like defelction of arrows and bullets on the rare occasion or mob health regeneration and can make your plans crumble before you as one mob just won't go down. There are multiple weapons in this game (my favourite being the Army Carbine and Breaker's Bow), these weapons range from splash damage weapons to melee to ranged weapon, all serving their own purpose in-game. With each of these weapons though you can upgrade them to become more powerful which is a must with the idols.  Overall the gameplay is great with unique maps, the storyline is amazing as well with a great voice actor. The enemies as well are nicely created and the main character is both shrouded with mystery as you don't learn his name as well as having a sad backstory (in fact they all have sad backstorys). The ending is amazing and I really enjoyed this game. It is well worth it's price so if you have a spare fifteen dollars floating around, I reccommend you purchase this game.",

Narrator gives it something of an 'old-West' feel, very gritty and leathery... somehow this works (in a strange way) with the cell-shading anime style.

The game forces you to try new guns and abilities and after a while you can change back to previous gun if you found it more useful or fun than the new one. Supposed you found a arsenal before going back to bastion.    And those moral choices in the end made the game touching, I almost shed a tear. I recommend this game to people who like to play games with good story and like to try indie games. I even recommend this game to players who don't usually play indie games, and if you get bored while playing Bastion(which I highly doubt) you can go through the story in just four hours (I spent 6, my friend 4).

Sometimes it's humorous too. I ran off the edge of the homeworld once, and he said, 'Been meaning to put up some guard rails.' I laughed out loud. Sometimes the narrator gives you helpful tips and information as if they were part of the story. It works well. There's some variety in the game in choosing weapons, perks, and bonuses. The artwork is rich, and colorful, and done in a beautiful style. I enjoyed how the homeworld was a little different each time I visited it. (Sometimes it was raining, othertimes it was evening, etc.) The music fits the mood perfectly, and the narration is scripted and read by a gruff voice that communicates the harsh realities of your world very effectively. Some of the time I've logged, I was AFK, but I did play it through twice because the game was designed to be replayed. Apart from a minor drug reference (you have to smoke a pipe in order to enter a specific level or world that uncovers your 'past') this game is pretty harmless. There's also a small easter egg involving a turret you may recognize. (I won't spoil it.)",

I think the gameplay basically didn't do it for me and I wasn't all that interested in the story. To me, after a few hours it became tedious to play and I found myself just rushing to complete it. The end 'fighting style' bored me tremendously and it felt anti-climactic.   I enjoyed certain parts and the narrator is very funny at times. It's also different and refreshing in the style of having a narrator which was cool. Nice to see a game that takes a step out of bounds like this.  In short though, I can recommend this game mainly because I can see how a lot of people would enjoy it and it isn't a bad game.

Easily one of the best written stories I have seen in a game for a along time, the depth of character development including design traits and back story allows the player to have a wide variety of imagination to fill in the gaps of these characters lives. The interesting game mechanic in which the land forms around you as you wander the cataclysm proved to be a fun and tense way to increase combat difficulty without having to make the enemies just take more damage and hit harder. The music in the game adds a level of serenity to the game despite the state of the world which also helps contrast the rustic art style of the game.

I was surprised, once I got to finished the game how much it changes after the demo section ends. The story is surprisingly deep and wonderfully bleak and the whole tone of the game especially the character backstories and music makes you really feel like you are one of the few remaining survivors. Speaking of the music it was great, one song in particular called Build that Wall (Singer's theme) stuck out as its lyrics are one of the very few voiced lines in the game voiced by someone other than the narrator which gave the portions it was played during a chilling effect. Despite not normally listening or even caring about video game music I've been hooked on this simple track since. The gameplay is fairly skill based it has a dependance on ether the shield or roll keys but it is still very fun and not too difficult to master. One final thing is they do milk the narrator's voice for every line and it started to get repetitive for me, although this is most likely just me. Definitely a great game for the price.",

Cons:  Once you upgrade two of your weapons you tend to just keep on using them instead of trying out other ones which is a shame because i found them to be very different from eachother once upgraded It's not as long as I would of hoped for the amount you pay, I beat the game with both endings in around 10 hours, however there still are challenges and such to do if you're into that stuff  Overall amazing game in every aspect , just a shame it was not any longer  10/10",

The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon.  With lots of weapons, skills and customization, Bastion has tons of replayability. I've heard about other modes too, but not sure what they actually are yet but will update this when I find out. The only bad thing about Bastion is the combat system, which is tricky to control at times..",

And, further, once you've upgraded the top weapons fully the game starts to become downright easy. I even started a newgame+ for a bit more challenge which kept my old weapon and I'm more likely to kill myself with my rocket launcher than actually be harmed by the enemies.

Gameplay length isn't too long, I compeleted the story in 4 hours but it's pretty cheap in price and you could get more time but playing the weapon side missions. A big part of the way the story is presented is the map changing live and a narrator. This was nice for the first part of the game but honestly I found it to get a tad annoying near the end. Trying to focus on combat and gameplay while the map queues up certain voice clips made things a little confusing, and I kind of wished for the 'cinematic/level/cinematic/level' template at times to just play at my own pace.",

This helps keep the story and game move at a very refreshing pace that will keep you interested til the end. Combat is played out in your typical action hack and slash where you attack with one of 3 weapons and dodge attacks. While there is a decent weapon selection I sticked to the 3 that I found the earliest on as they worked pretty well in all situations. The game is quite easy with initial setting, but later on you can add modifiers that significantly make it much much harder. My only complaints would be that the game is quite short at only around 5 hours,which makes it difficult to stomach at full price.

Bastion also offers a wide number of options to tweak the difficulty through a systom of 'idols' that can be activated or deactivated to gvie your enemies various bonuses. It's the storytelling and sound design that really made Bastion shine for me. The strange old-west style narration sold me in the very first level and provides a great impetus to keep making progress through the game. The story itself lags a bit in the middle, with minor characters having very little efffect beyond providing plot points, but the way it is told is great.

            "review_text": "Bastion is one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The above statement will probably adorn the majority of the reviews of this game, and for good reason; it really is that good! For starters; the gameplay and weapons, Bastion is essentially a story driven action RPG. It offers a large variety of different weapons whith which to disptach the mariad of foes who will opposes you. Each type of weapon offers a very different esperience when it comes to combat; for example you have the Cael Hammer, a hefty hard hitting meele weapon, and on the opposite side of the meele spectrum you have the Hunter's Machete, a quick and agile blade that when the attack butto is held for a short amont of time can be thrown at your oppnents. Now afterthat dont go thinking that Bastion is a close quarters only affair, as the game quickly introduces weapons whith long range capabilities like the Breaker's Bow, a strong bow with a fairly slow draw time, also, my personal favorite ranged weapon is the Scrap Musket, a shotgun like weapon that is incredibly effective at short range, and features a wide spread shot.  Next up is possibly the best thing Bastion has going for it; the presentation. Bastions artwork is done in a pseudo-watercolour style that looks absolultly beautiful. Each and every one of the environments are painstakeinly detailed down to the most minute details. The levels range from psychotropic jungles to old abandoned scrapyards, and as I mentioned they are all exquisite! The next bit of presentation that should not be forgotten is the phenomenal soundtrack composed by the wonderful Darren Korb. Every single trak inthe game is wonderful and memorable, I even caught myself bobbing my head and humming along to the catchy as heck battle theme. Bastion's soundtrack is the first OST that I simply HAD to buy,an dit was a purchase that I know I will not regret.  Finally I want to touch upon the story, which is (big surprise) top notch! The entire game it narrated by a gravelly voiced old man named Rusk, voiced by Logan Cunningham. One of the coollest things about it is that the narratiion is dynamic, as in the fine people at Supergiant Games had Mr. Cunningham record thousands of lines of dialogue to fit into nearly every context. I'd rather not discuss the story in too much depth as I would hat to ruin it for anybody, but here's a basic rundown: you play as a nameless young man referred to only as 'The Kid' who wakes up in the ruins of a destroyed wall and makes his way towards the Bastion, 'Where everybody agreed to go incase of Calamity'. After collecting a Core he makes he arrives at the Bastion and Rusk informs him that he must collect more Cores in order to restore Caelondia to it's former glory.  Overall I recommend this game to anybody who has working fingers and/or eyeballs. Of course I'm ancxiously awaiting the 2014 release of Supergiant's opcoming Transistor (featuring the talents of Logan Cunningham and Darren Korb!!)",

The emotional arc of the game is downright staggering; I ran into a theory some time ago that Bastion is actually about the aftermath of a bad breakup, and it really, really fits. Bastion has the same weight of emotional impact as Hotline Miami, Papers Please or Spec Ops: The Line - but the scope of those games is limited to the ugly and brutal, while Bastion is beautiful and uplifting.   I ran into a theory some time ago that Bastion is actually about a breakup - I strongly recommend looking at it through that lens as you play, as it really fits and adds an entire dimension to an already deep game.  The gameplay is probably the weakest component, in that it's just really good; combat flows nicely, the controls are clear and reactive, and while they haven't made any staggering revisions to the existing formula, it's a good formula and they implement it well.",

Various other mini challenges are also available which rewards players with weapon upgrades.  Downsides, the movement speed of the main character felt too slow for my tastes as i find myself rolling all over the place hoping to get to places faster.  Some weapons are also no fun to use (like the army carbine where you have to wait too long to line up a shot). I only use the machete (for fast melee) and scrap musket (for range and spread effect)  Overall Rating: 7.5 / 10 Its a good first time effort from this indie studio.

The narration of this game plays dynamically depending on what actions the player takes. The story is told from the all-seeing, all-hearing narrator telling someone the story of your tale as the Kid. His silky smooth voice is a pleasure to listen to as you're beating up bad guys and unfolds the story in a very natural yet immersive way. The fact that he comments on your actions in the game gives you a sense of place that you are actually in this world, exploring and fighting your way through this brilliant apocalypse. The ending is an emotional rollercoaster and it will leave you thinking for long after the game is finished.  Of course, the gameplay is solid too! It is an isometric brawler at heart, with some rpg elements thrown in for extra customization to your own unique play style. After you unlock the shrine, you get to choose how difficult the game will be. Activate more shrines and the game will be harder in different ways, but you will receive a greater payoff. This works really well and is a fun way to handle difficulty. That being said the combat IS probably the weakest part of the game, but it is more than enough to keep you playing through the (about) 12 hour long storyline.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

The narrator also narrates certain actions you do. Once I got the first weapon, I broke a bunch of objects and the narrator added that to the story; I laughed pretty hard. One scene in particular is very touching.  The mechanics are solid and easy to understand. You can hold two weapons for the two mosue buttons, you get one special attack of your choice, and you can do a dodge roll. There are 5 melee weapons and 5 ranged weapons, and each plays differently, so you can choose from many different styles. I had a lot of fun with it.  Bastion is definitely worth buying.

First I would just like to say, the last Two Hours of this Game were probably the best Moments I've ever had in a Video Game.    The Combat.-  Typical Diablo-Styled Action RPG Combat except you really only get Three Attacks and no Hotkeys. You click M1 to Attack with your Primary, M2 for Secondary, and M3/Q for your Special. While this type of Combat may seem a little primitive compared to Diablo's, the amount of Weapons and Specials you get sure makes up for it. You also have the ability to Dodgeroll with Space and Block/Deflect enemy attacks with Shift. I found the Combat quite enjoyable overall.   The Music-  Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. The sound design is phenomenal. I honestly have no complaints.   The Story-  Short but Amazing. I'm not going to give anything away, though I suspect most of you already know the Story of the Game. I just wanted to say that while the Story was amazing, it would only be half as good without the Narrator. Whoever did the Voice for the Narrator deserves a Cookie.   Closing Thoughts-  So, yeah. Those are my thoughts on the Game. I recomend you get it if you're looking for a Good Story Game, A Game with a Good Soundtrack, a Game with Fun Diablo-Styled Combat, or just a Good Game in General.",

Gave the game a lot of style and really draws you into the world.  The story takes place in the post-apocalyptic remains of the world after the event of The Calamity. You are recruited by the Narrator himself to assist him in restoring The Bastion; a safe haven for the survivors. Each area you go to has some interesting backstory and some fantastic artwork. The visual design of the game is quite striking and is always a joy to look at.  Gameplay is your standard isometric hack-and-slash but feels very solid and rewarding. Being quick with dodge-rolls and blocks allows you to handle many enemies at once without ever feeling like a chore. The further you get in the game, the more weapons and upgrades you unlock so the combat never feels too monotonous as it continues to evolve as you play.  Overall, from the visuals and music to the combat and pacing, the game is a rock-solid experience.

He comments on everything: how the world used to be, the actions you take, and some hope for the future. Actually, one of the strongest themes of this game is that of hope. No matter how much we screw up, no matter how much we destroy, we can always rebuild. No matter your checkered past, there's always the future.

            "review_text": "This game is great! It took a little time to get into, but afterwards I really started to enjoy it. It isn't a long game, but it has a very nicely done story, challenging gameplay, fun battle system, and amazing artwork. The narrator does a great job throughout the game, and I can appreciate the hidden 'extras' that are integrated into the game. (Going on a spree of destroying the environment cues the narrator to say 'Kid just rages for a bit.'). Below is my review for Bastion which I have given a 9/10.     Story - The story is basically about an event that happened called 'The Calamity', and pits you in the role of a survivor trying to learn more about what happened, all the while restoring a grand ship called 'The Bastion' whose significance you don't learn about until later. The story is told through the narrator's narration of your actions as you work your way through the game. It is mainly a giant fetch quest, ('We need X of these to restore the Bastion'). But the allure of this game is that you have no idea what the story is at the beginning, and your only way of learning more is by completing levels to learn more from the narrator as you work through the level and eventually return from the mission.     Gameplay - The overall gameplay is fun, fast paced, and challenging. The game was very well balanced and I really enjoyed it. The developers put a lot of work into this game to ensure an awesome experience and they did a wonderful job.     Graphics - The graphics are amazing, hand-drawn and well-animated. There aren't too many spots in this action RPG where you can stop and enjoy the scenery but you have to stop occasionally and admire the gorgeous hand drawn graphics, and slick animations. You will also find that many portions of the environment are destructible, meaning you can attack walls and eventually fall off the level, or hide behind hedges which enemies will have to destroy to get to you. You are also occasionally treated with gorgeous still shots or character portraits.     Battle System - The battle system in Bastion is very unique. This is an Action RPG with a unique variety of weapons that let you choose how you want to play. You can choose ranged weapons or melee weapons or many of the hybrid weapons in between. Some battles require strategy and some just ask you to destroy everything that moves.     Additional Systems - There are also many additional systems in this game, you can craft upgrades for your weapons which add various bonuses or change the way the weapon works altogether. If you find the game to easy, you can also craft items that will make the enemies more powerful or handicap your character. Similarly, if you find the game too difficult, you can craft items that will provide passive bonuses to your character. You can also craft quest items that you can provide to the NPCs to hear tiny snippets that provide insight into the characters' past, or to flesh out parts of the overarching narrative.     Audio - The music in this game is excellent, and some of the most memorable 'tunes' I've heard in a game in a long time. Shortly through the game you will unlock a jukebox of sorts that lets you replay various music which is the point when you realize how good the music really is.     Replayability - The game is pretty linear throughout, but in the end, you are faced with two great choices which affect your final ending. I wouldn't say there is a lot of replayability once the story is over, unless you are a collectionist who wants every item, every upgrade, every skill, complete every level, etc. However, if you enjoyed the gameplay like me, that's your main attraction, and you don't care if you are trudging through the same story again. There is a New Game + function that lets you retain various perks and start a new game.     Value - I definitely got my money's worth with this game. Although the story was pretty short, I had a lot of fun and I passed by a few collectables that would have stretched out the story a bit more. I also go Bastion on sale from the Steam Summer Sale which was nice, but after having played it I would have paid full price for this game, it is definitely worth it.   Overall, I give Bastion a 9/10. It's an action packed adventure through a mysterious fantasy world that keeps you begging for more. Telling the story through the perspective of the narrator is a unique spin on the traditional outspoken action hero that makes the game feel fresh and different. The gorgeous artwork will leave you drooling and collectionists will enjoy the many extras this game has to offer. Get this one, you won't regret it. And let's all hope for a Bastion 2.",

Never have I regretted that choice more. Here's the breakdown:  Graphics: Everything looks to be meticulously detailed and painted with loving care. The colors are appropriately bright in some areas, whereas others induce feelings of despair and melancholy. The characters', when viewed from the general view, aren't extremely detailed (being rather small), but do get various painted panels, which are really nice to see, Overall, the medium used to present this game is wonderfully atmospheric, and makes Bastion one of the prettiest games I've seen in a while.  Soundtrack: It's fantastic. I really, really recommend buying the game with he soundtrack. Lots of emotional tracks, all of which seem to fit the game very nicely. I have no problem having these stuck in my head for the rest of the night.  Gameplay: It's fairly straightforward, though I would highly recommend playing with an xbox controller if at possible. Lots of the timed challenges will be much easier with those controls. I enjoyed how you could select any weapon combination you wanted, as well as how many ways you could customize each. A fun touch was the narrator commenting on whatever combination you selected. That's actually a really nice tough overall, how involved the narrator seems to be with your decisions. Another aspect of combat that was interesting was how most of the fights were very fast and exciting. I say most, because there were a few where you could win simply by shielding and lettings the enemy ricochet off you until it died. But for the most part, fast-paced and fun.   Story: This is what makes you marathon this game. Everything above complements the story and the way it's presented. The characters are sympathetic, though mysterious, and the story of the Calamity even more so. I very much felt like I had personal stakes in the outcome.   If the above is too much to read, just know it's worth buying and playing right away.",

When he starts talking, you're compelled to hang on to every word he says. His voice breathes life into the journey, puts the 'story' into history. He tells tales the way tales were meant to be told - the way that keeps you coming back for more.  Bastion is a piece of art. The character / stage / enemy design, battle animations, the voiceacting, and the music. Oh my god the music. Easily the most captivating part of the game. Zia's theme, Zulf's theme, and their subsequent mash up Setting Sail, Coming Home are influential musical landmarks for me.   There are a variety of weapons in Bastion, each requiring their own distinct style of play. You get to pick two weapons at a time to run through the game with, and I believe the many combinations that exist are all potential game-winning ones. Playing with the increased difficulty NG+ and beyond (activating all Pantheon Gods for example) ramps up the challenge level significantly - that's when certain weapons begin to shine more than others.  A very solidly grounded hack-and-slash-esque indie title which expands the traditional definition of the concept of a game. Enjoyed every minute of it.   Besides, very few things have since surpassed the shocked elation I experienced when I heard Zia speak for the first time.",

Under the right circumstances and by that I mean the it was heavily discounted during one of the steam sales and I managed to acquire it. I had checked some of the reviews before hand and deemed it 'check-it-out worthy'. Having recently finished it I must admit that I have mixed feelings.  In summary, when I first launched the game I admired the visual style of the game. The audio was excellent to and by that I mean the soundtrack explicitly. The sound effects are fairly average. During my playthrough; mostly between start and finish, the game is pretty repetitive. The story does progress but in terms of gameplay you are not expected to do cartwheels and summersaults while juggling swords on fire. Mostly I found it really boring and couldn't wait to get to the end of the game. The end of the game was nothing fancy either. I mean a fairly expected conclusion to a decent story. The directors of the game let you play while there is a narrator with an odd wild west accent usually saying out loud what you have already done or are probably about to do.  The story itself is ok at best. Apart from the unusual setting there is nothing else note worthy about it. You have to do &lt;insert&gt; to restore some &lt;insert&gt; to achieve &lt;insert&gt;.  The visual style is amazing and I must say that is one of the 2 things about the game that is worth looking at. Although, having said that, It can sometimes be confusing how the map is laid out. In some cases you'd walk on air where wou'd expect to fall and in other cases you'll slip an edge where you expected to be able to walk just fine.  The audio is probably the best feature of the game and the soundtrack is amazing. I loved the songs in the game and more precisely the timing of those songs and their cue in the story.  In conclusion, I would say that this game is worth a shot but only if you can get it for really cheap. I am thankful that I was able to pick this up at the low cost that I did during one of the steam sales as I would've regretted buying it ats full list price as it was originally release. So do try it if you can but if you didn't then you are not missing out on much. Don't believe the hype!",

From the get-go you are introduced to the most compelling aspect of the game imho: its near-constant narration that's delivered with gravitas and is the primary method through which the story is told. I found myself completely drawn in and absorbed by the excellent voice acting and was made to feel like I was being read a story by a gifted grandfatherly figure. Speaking of the story, while many have criticized it for its lack of originality I loved it as you gradually learn of the shocking cause of the calamity that has befallen the world and how that knowledge affects its few remaining survivors. Not every game story has to have multiple twists and turns, it's totally fine for them to be simple but well-crafted. Further enhancing the story-book feel of the game are its lush and beautifully-drawn stages that are stunning to behold despite the fact that this is a 2D game. Next, the combat: another point of contention among some, it's been criticized as being too simple and lauded as having a deceptive depth to it. I myself am of a mind with the latter camp as I found the many combat options to be quite diverse and open to experimentation that allow you to customize your combat according to your playstyle. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention its fantastic musical score and song, 'Build That Wall' (written and composed by Darren Korb): my head kept bobbing to the excellent tunes and it's so good that I've since added the entire soundtrack (minus a song or 2) to my Spotify playlist and you very likely will to once you play this great game :)  9.5/10",

What I really didn't like about the story was the way it was told. Maybe if it was told differently, I would have appreciated it more. The narrator often speaks while you are controling your character, and I found it hard to concentrate on what he was saying while I was busy with fighting enemies and moving around.  For example, the main character doesn't speak. His backstory is told by the narrator, and there is a section of the game where the narrator tells the story while you are fighting rounds of hordes of enemies. It was hard to follow, and I played the section multiple times because of it.  I still recommend this game despite my issues with it. I think it's worth it for Zia's song alone.

TL;DR - Definitely worth the pricetag! Very fun game with an interesting story!",

Please forgive any writting mess as I'm not English-speaking/writting native.  Usually I'm not a plataformer game player (I usually mess when jumping and end dying a lot - and sure thing, I died a lot here)  Bastion is an interesting game where all the game talking is done by Rucks, an old man (who acts as the game narrative, he also makes some funny remarks) you (as the Kid, a silent protagonist) find in the Bastion, a place somehow safe from the Cataclysm, an event that broke (most of) the world. Said Bastion is the central base for Kid and need the Cores to be useful (they open shops and other useful structures), and after it is heavily damaged after an event, you need Shards to repair it. Some items also add interesting features, and open maps you can redo - these give some indeep info about Zulf and Zia, the two other characters you will find: Zulf and Zia. Zulf was an ambassador from Ura (a neighbour subterranean country which was in war with Kid's Caelondia years ago), Zia is a girl of Ura origin but born in Caelondia.  Equippables: You can use two weapons and a skill (linked with a wepon or having another useful feature). For weapons I chose to use both melee and ranged weapons (some mobs can and will munch you from distance). The weapons can be upgraded or switched in Bastion (you also find some Arsenals to change weapons on the maps, but thet are rare).  Two interesting features is the Spirits, drinks you can equip on slots you get one per level - they give some good bonuses (some also give disadvantages too); the other are the Gods; those give bonuses on XP and Scraps, but they also cam make the game much harder if you select more than one.  The game is quite linear, except for two situations near the game end where you decide what to do (I chose both right-side choices, won't spoil it here). Ending the game open the NewGame+ mode, where you start with all levels, gear, items and scraps (the $ here) from the 1st play, and you get new features on the new gameplay.  The music is incredible, when I heard Zia's song I was delighted to see that the singer on Transistor game is also here - I don't have Bastion soundtrack yet, will get it on a future sales.  Bastion is not a new game, and have a TON of positive reviews - if you never played it, get the demo (it's free) and try a bit - you won't be disappointed.",

You break a lot of crates? the narrarator mentions that you broke a lot of crates, you get a new weapon? He mentions your new weapon. It's fantastic.  Now, on to the visual appeal. The world builds itself around you as you walk in an elegant, smooth way. With water color like sceneries and a bright world, I couldn't get enough.  The battle mechanics are somewhat average, nothing very special and can get boring over time, but the game stays challenging with diiferent weapons, modifications, and specials that work better with different levels.  Over all, I love the game, and I love the story. If you're a fan of fantasy and a the same comedic narraration of 'The Stanely Parable' you will love this all the more.",

The combat by itself is nothing special, but the different weapon combinations along with the variety of special skills you can use make it a lot of fun! Only in Basion can you waltz around with a flamethrower and a bow while having a few grenades on-hand.  The story can be easily swept aside if you don't allow yourself to be immersed. If you do, though, you just might find yourself in tears at the end (I know I did....). It's EXTREMELY powerful, made even better by a few last-minute choices that literally change the entire game!  Lastly, the music. Oh dear mother of sweet and sour baby jesus, the MUSIC! I have honestly never heard a better soundtrack to any game in my life (yes, it even beats Ocarina of Time). The music alone can make or break the atmosphere in a game, and with Bastion....oh, it makes it alright!

The map 'unfolds' as the player walks through.  The player keeps two weapons in his inventory (melee / ranged), a shield for defense, and one AoE spell. He also has a dodge / dash ability.  Inventory can be upgraded with items collected via the Armory.  Passive buffs and abilities can be added with each level via the Distillery.  The player progresses by collecting 'Cores' from each area and returning them to HQ. Cores allow the player to place buildings (like the Armory and Distillery) on the Bastion.",

Anyone who has watched gameplay or played the demo will probably be immediately struck by the way the game world establishes itself in front of the Kid. It helps cement the game's style as unique and also provides additional storytelling opportunities. Additionally there's a beautiful gravelly narration provided by an in game character that also adds to the game's character.   The combat has a variety of usable weapons and upgrades/modifiers akin to a light RPG and it works well. There's also various skill rooms that really test your mettle both overall and with specific weapons. Without spooling anything most people will probably want to at least replay the game once as well.

I had it n my wishlist for ages and since i didn't buy no man's sky, I thought I should maybe buy some other games haha.  pros: 1) great enviroment (the art and the music)  2) very fun combat  3) great storyline (but CAN be a bit vague at some times. this is personal opinion, some might disagree).  4) very short loading screens \\o/.    cons: 1) the upgrade tree should be a little bit bigger, so that you can do more in multiple runs.  2) to short.  3) misses a prequel/sequel (or DLC/expansion), this is also linked to number 2. I won't spoiler the game, but when I finished the normal storyline i felt like something was missing and i felt like as if the story wasn't finished yet. I really hope the developers would make a prequel/sequel.  4) the old man's voice (yes that one from the trailer. hes talking 24/7 in the game) will get really annoying after a while.    So, Bastion is a great game. Very atmospheric, with fun 'hack 'n slash'/3rd person shooter combat. but it might be a bit to short for the €15,- pricetag. If you have loads of money and like these kind of games, I would definitely recommend it. Otherwise add it to your wishlist and buy it on sale for much cheaper like me :P.   notes:  I bought this game on sale for €3,75. This was my first review. Did not lag on my crappy computer. If you buy it, don't forget to set the old man's voice volume a bit lower. (narration volume? correct me if i'm wrong)",

That's something I haven't seen before. Some of the backstory is told when you're very busy killing monsters, so it's a shame you can't replay it when you're actually able to listen.

            "review_text": "Oh wow.. Where to begin with the review for Bastion. There's much I would like to touch on, however the list would continually sprawl onwards for eternity, or at least until you lose interest, so, I'll keep it short. Bastion is a narrative-driven game narrated by an old man by the name of 'Rucks'. You traverse through the world with the narration of Rucks as you explore the areas known as The Wilds, on a quest to find a way to repair the safehaven for all known as 'The Bastion'.   I can honestly recommend this game to everyone, especially those with a hunger for an Action-RPG.  Pros: - The soundtrack is immaculate. There are moments where I'm sitting home playing other games and I will listen to it over the games native soundtrack.  - Combat is fluid and fair, never making it so you feel as though you are overpowered.   - A weapon upgrade system that is just the right amount of frustrating in terms of finding required materials, and the perfect amount of rewarding when your weapon is entirely upgraded.  - Ease of changing equipment within the hub world of 'The Bastion'. Allowing for multiple combinations of weaponry and skills.  - Unique Landscape Design, which may sound.. Odd to list here, however the ground beneath you forms as you traverse it, keeping you on edge as you explore for the next enemy which may be just around the corner.  - New Game+ Has ridiculous attention to detail, going so far as to have the narrator add audio cues which were not within the original runthrough of the game, as well as a new challenge mode.  - Extremely rewarding story and gameplay length. It took me a tad over 10 hours to complete my first playthrough of the game. The stories ending is extremely satisfying, with both choices having their own narrative and consequences.    Cons: - Skills became useless about a fourth of the way through the game. Whilst they may be interesting, there is no necessity or need for them within the game after you've learned how to clear a swath through your enemies with your main weaponry.  - Not having the ability to traverse back to lands which you have previously explored. Whilst this may fit within the storyline as an explanation, it is a tad weird for such an exploration emphasized game to falsely limit such.  - Spirits, while useful, not being required in any way, shape, or form. Spirits are upgrades you can apply onto your character for specific bonuses, however there are only about a handful of them worth using in any capacity past artifically imposing difficulty upon yourself, as some of their detirments outweigh their bonuses.  - Artificially imposed continuation of the game. Essentially in the form of leveling up. If you're someone who wants to do absolutely everything, you're looking at a game timespan of an upwards of at least 30 hours or more to achieve the highest level possible for the Spirits.  Overall, I absolutely adore this game, even with the few quirks I've mentioned above. I recommend it to anyone. If you're looking for a game which is cheap but don't want to purchase the game at its overall price of $15, wait until one of the sales periods and pick it up for $2 to $5. It is entirely worthwhile at that price point.",

The game offers insane variety of weapons, skills and abilities. Also along the way you level up your character. You build different buildings - enchanter, smithing statoin, god temple, library and many more which are part of your settlement and serve a different purpose helping you fix and upgrade your character and weapons. The level of difficulty can get extremely chalanging at times and you really have to implement strategic aproach in order to win. Absolute masterpiece. The soundtrack is freaking awesome and the songs that move the story forward are very personal and are going to melt your heart. The art design is so beautiful!

Narrative:  The Good - Bastion has an interesting start of beginning during the immediate moments following a global cataclysm known as the Calamity, wiping out most of civilization. You take on the persona of 'The Kid', a teen who is on a mission to restore the world. The game opens itself up in an incredibly abrupt manner, but I feel like that's fitting. The story is focused and doesn't become sidetracked by unnecessary subplots. It's not the weirdest or the most unique story of all time, but it's well paced, for the most part, and seems perfect for the game. The game also, early on, introduces the narrator to the story, an old man with a mysterious past. The writing is cheesy enough to keep the game from becoming gloomy, however serious enough to not make me start laughing. There is also a ton of lore that is explained as the player progresses through levels and it seems really natural. The whole game feels extremely surreal and weird and the endings have an odd mixture of happy ending combined with a depressing aspect.  The Bad - This game's flaw is the characters. The game does a horrible job of making me sympathize with the characters. There are three levels where the narrator attempts to quickly make the characters relatable and people you should care for. Needless to say, it doesn't succeed. The narrator, on the other hand, has a lot of potential to be fleshed out and very interesting and he ends up getting shafted. So when I came to the decision of which ending should be chosen, the game thought I would feel bad for one of the other characters and reconsider saving civilization. That didn't work.   Score - 7.5/10  Graphics:  The Good - Bastion is beautiful. It runs at a smooth framerate, has some well flowing animations, and has not only one of the most well designed and detailed worlds out there, but one of the most vibrant color palettes that manages to be eye-catching, not eye-♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The Bad - The Kid's animation is stiff. Really stiff.  Score - 9/10  Sound:  The Good - There is a wide array of different musical types from calm serene flute music, to incredibly suiting action, western music, to southern, banjo music for swamps. It's fantastic. There are some incredibly catchy tracks in this one. the narrator is also awesome. At first, I was unsure about him but I ended up really enjoying his voice on my journey. The sound effects are also done very well and sound crisp, clear, and perfect.  The Bad - No problems.  Score - 10/10",

The weapons are complex and lead to interesting combinations when equipped together, and the combat is fluid and intuitive yet challenging.    However, this all pales in comparison to the rest of the game. The atmosphere is beautiful, the artstyle breathtaking, and the music... God, the music is probably my favorite soundtrack of all time. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret created something absolutely amazing.   The narration is spot on, the story is great, and though you get little agency along the way, the choices you do get are deep. Plot and backstory is told through dream scenes and snippets of memory, and is woven seamlessly into the narrative without taking away from forward plot progression.   Now I'm just rambling, because honestly there's just so much good to talk about. Buy this game. You will not regret it.",

WHAT I LIKED  The graphics are amazing; I can only describe the scenes as a watercolor painting with stained glass influences. The sound immersed me in the game. The combat was also great. The weapon and enemy variation kept me wanting to play and it never got repetitive for me. The narrator entertained me as he announced what I was doing and why it mattered, but his sultry tones also kept me company. Bastion's a single-player game, but the narrator was my companion through thick and thin. Toss in some fantastic music and sound effects, and Bastion is a blast to experience. The best thing Bastion has going for it is that I was always surprised by what came next.   WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE  The ground in the level would apear as you walked along it and this would cause me to fall off the map sometimes if i walked too fast for it.  The curser and the arrows pointing for ranged weapons didnt line up so it was sometimes hard to make a shot.  The truth is that i didn't really dislike much. It did almost everything i wanted  FINAL VERDICT  If i had to give this a rating it would easily be a 9/10. This game was truly amazing and you dont get these types of games often. If you don't already own this i would extremely reccomend it to anyone. I got this game on sale for $2 and i can say that it was some of the best $2 i've spent in my life. I love this game.",

Not meaning to yell that, just want you guys to see it load and clear, because THE GAME IS AWESOME but completely broken when using another controller other than a Xbox controller, PS4 controller only has ‘up, down, triangle and square’ that works and no was to map the controller in game! please help guys, again love the game its a gem but could you map the PS4 controller like you did with Transistor (another truely amazing game) PLEASE! looking forward to your next project.",
