    "description": "Infinity is a simple game. It has simple objectives, and a simple goal. The game features progressively harder levels. Each level builds upon the previous. However, what sets Infinity apart from other platformers, is the lack of checkpoints. Infinity does not feature saves, checkpoints or level selection.",
