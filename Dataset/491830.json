            "review_text": "It's better than Holy Cows, but it would have benefited from more time in Early Access! - Gameplay is fun and original but gets boring pretty quick: I got to level 4 and still only fought spiders. Devs need to mix it up earlier to keep players interested. - Keybindings are unchangeable (!) I never used the alt-fire because i was unable to reach the key.  Unfortunately, there is no 'undecided' on steam. Buy only if you see the potential and trust developers to improve (like early access). If you expect a finished/polished game, and 5 bucks is a lot of money for you: stay away!",
