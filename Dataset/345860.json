            "review_text": "Summary: Vertical bullet hell with lots of ships Multiplayer: No Completion: 1 hr Cards: Yes Cloud: No  Super Galaxy Squadron is a very standard vertical bullet hell shoot 'em up. It won't win any awards for its concept, but it does offer a surprising number of unique ships that play somewhat differently from each other. The result is a rather replayable shooter, if only to test the functions of each ship, which I found enjoyable.   Gameplay is a standard shmup. Shoot anything that moves, avoid bullets, grab items. The items dropped by enemies are mostly random; it is thus possible to have a bunch of missiles before you ever get a laser upgrade. The game lacks a 'focus' mode, where you can slow down your ship to maneuver tight spaces. Thus I found faster ships, which often have less armor, work against me.  There are 14 ships to choose from in this game. Surprisingly most ships have a good balance about them, though a few stood out as being much better or much worse than the others. The majority of my time spent on this game was comparing each and every ship by fully upgrading them, and finding out which ones I liked best. Every ship possesses a unique 'limit break' of sorts. As you grab points, your bar fills up and you can unleash a powerful attack or defensive ability that is based on your current ship. These occur often enough that your ship's special power is worth taking into consideration, especially on endless mode.  There's a rudimentary plot about a cold war between humans and aliens, and every ship has a bit of backstory, which is cool. Beyond that, the game largely throws story out the window, much like the entire genre does, which is a shame because it seemed like a promising story.  Unlike most bullet hells, SGS has a health system that allows you to withstand more than one hit. On top of that, enemies occasionally drop health items to replenish your life. You can even heal yourself by getting grazed by enemy bullets. Also surprising, the invulnerability period after getting hit is relatively generous. It's a refreshing system that provides some amount of tanking ability, and is thus friendlier to new players to the genre. When you get hit, your ship will drop one of its power-ups, but it's easily reacquired by simply flying over it and grabbing it again. Hardcore mode exists for those who prefer the one-hit death style of gameplay. There seems to be no additional reward for playing on hardcore.  Most of the game is easy enough. There's six stages in total, each one lasting maybe 3-5 minutes. If you die, the game generously lets you continue on the last stage you were on. The bosses are great, being hulking machines (mostly) with collapsible parts, wide bullet patterns and just as large health pools. The last boss is such a large leap in difficulty that I'm not sure I could ever beat it with certain ship designs. It's a long enough battle that it might as well be considered a stage in of itself.  Graphics are good. It's entirely pixel-art, and well-animated, particularly explosions. I like that every upgrade you acquire is a noticeable improvement, typically giving you additional shots, and sometimes even a graphical change. I have not experienced any slowdown despite the large number of moving things, even on endless, so that gets good marks. Music is chip-tunish, and somewhat upbeat but also kind of on the forgettable side.  I recommend playing the game with a gamepad, though keyboard actually works well enough. The game did not recognize my USB gamepad; if the same occurs to you I recommend Joy2Key which often solves this problem on similar games.  While I wouldn't recommend it at full price, it's not bad at a discount. All proceeds go to the Child's Play charity, so even if you don't enjoy the game, someone else may benefit. For the game to be created by largely one person, this is a pretty commenable effort. I give Super Galaxy Squadron a 7/10. It's super short, but because of that, you can replay it in short bursts with many different ships, so it works out in the end. SGS satisfies that urge to just jump into a game and start shooting stuff without rhyme or reason.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Haven't played the new EX version yet, this review was based on the original.  Super Galaxy Squadron is a great little 'flow' shmup: you fall into a pattern of sweeping the screen left to right and back, blowing stuff up and picking up power ups. It's a _little_ repetitive and the enemy attack patterns/level design don't vary enough to seriously knock you out of your zone, but this serves to create a pleasant state of zen-like focus and flow while playing. (Note: I'm a long-time player of shmups, so your state of zen, boredom, or extreme panic may vary depending on your experience with the genre and taste for difficulty...)  There's a simple combo/multiplier system, but it doesn't force me play the game strategically because the level design and enemy waves don't seem distinct enough to make strategies for maintaining your combo apparent to me.  The key source of variety comes from strong collection of different kinds of ships. I haven't had a chance to try them all yet, but each requires a slightly different play style to pilot successfully. The ships seem to range from standard shmup tropes to more creative and unique attack types. The different ships provide a good source of replay value, outside of leaderboard climbing.  Graphics and audio are excellent, couldn't ask for more from a retro-inspired shmup!  The game's normal mode is pretty forgiving (a shmup beginner might not think so), and hardcore is of course hardcore. (one hit you're dead)  All in all a pretty good, well executed shmup at a good price! Veterans might not find much meat on the bone, but this would be a good start for beginners to learn the basic skills required for the genre.",

            "review_text": "This is a review for the EX version of Super Galaxy Squadron, unlike many of the reviews posted prior to Feb 18, 2016. I have only played EX, and not the original version of the game.  I recommend this game, but with a few caveats. First, the good: The pixel art of the graphics is very well done. Every ship, enemy, background, and attack looks good. The music is amazing. You could play this game just to listen to the music and it would probably be worth it. There are 14 ships to choose from, and that is a huge plus. Each has its own pilot with a couple-sentence long story that adds some flavor to the game. I appreciated this touch. The Endless mode is another plus for this game; it makes a fun little diversion when you are low on time but really want to just shoot stuff up.  Now, for the negative...backgrounds and enemies do get repetitive. Many levels have the same enemies and while each level has a unique background, some have no transitions and those that do have only 1 or 2. This can make the levels, especially the first 4 or so, kind of boring and repetitive. If you play on Hell difficulty you may not notice the lack of variety so much, but you will definitely get used to the same enemies and attack patterns. Speaking of attack patterns, this game bills itself as not really a bullet hell, and that is mostly true on the stages. There are alot of patterns that aren't necessarily dense but require fast dodging, kind of like what might be seen in a Raiden game. Then, on the bosses, there are some patterns similar to those 'fast dodging' games, but also other patterns straight outta Touhou. This game definitely treads on bullet hell territory on the bosses, which makes for a somewhat jarring experience. Another issue I had in terms of difficulty, is the second attack pattern on the next to last boss on Veteran and Hell difficulties. I got to the final stage and first boss pretty easily on veteran, but I cannot fathom how to dodge this pattern. It was like all of a sudden the game jumped in difficulty tremendously. I am fine with hard games, especially in a shmup but the very sudden spike really frustrates me (I still can't beat this boss). I figured I would try the game on Hell for a different kind of challenge....and I still reached the boss, granted, not as quickly as on Veteran, but I didn't have any major troubles either. Even on Hell, the difficulty spikes so high on that second attack pattern. To make this even more frustrating, the official video on youtube for this game which demonstrates the sixth stage is actually missing this attack pattern for some reason, which really confuses me. On novice, it can be cleared fairly easily, so I was at least able to see the ending. And speaking of the ending...it had no cutscene, a super short conclusion, and no voiced content (whereas stage transitions did have these), so it felt very anticlimatic. It really feels like the very end game needs a little more work.  Overall this game is worth the money, just don't be expecting a masterpiece. Do expect a great soundtrack and good times to be had playing 14 different ships!",

I feel its a tad unbalanced; i can complete the 6 stages of the game on veteran on my first life... up until the final boss which for the life of me i cannot kill. I'm only a casual shmup'er though so this is prob my lack of skills in the genre. The final boss is pretty dam tough on casual to but it was do-able for me. Worth the money i found the experience fun :-) a big thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "Well... this started out very good. Nice pixel art and great variety of ships, every one very different from others. The gameplay is smooth and nice. I already went thumbs up for this game. But... then I reached the final boss...  I am not a total greenhorn when it comes to shumps, I played my share of them and I consider myself to be quite fond of them, but not a shmup maniac (I'm not masochist).   But even so... the final boss is a total misunderstanding, I played the game on casual difficulty and all went quite good, I had to repeat some levels couple of times but overall it was challenging and fun. Then came the final boss which sprays a f*ckload of projectiles.... I mean total bukake of projectiles. . I tried defeating him... I tried, I cannot even count how many times I approached the game to defeat him... it wasnt fun it wasnt challenging. It is pure frustration. Avoiding his shoots is sth impossible. You have a pattern there but then at one point along with the pattern he starts spraying extra projectiles in places that you have to escape his pattern shots and then you get hit, loose your powerups, and it all goes to ♥♥♥♥ as you try to regain them.   I recommend the game only to shmup masochists. To casual shmup enthusiasts this final boss is dealbreaker. Totaly fu*ks the game. Shame really as like I said, until that final boss moment, the game was great",
