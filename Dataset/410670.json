I couldn't even wait to finish my video review before posting my recommendation here. (Edit: Review is now up, see vid below if interested!)  It's quirky, hilarious, and waaaaaay longer than I ever thought a $0.99 game would be. You have quests to do, items to buy/sell, party members, turn-based fights, secrets to uncover, and loads of plants to talk to. What more could you possibly want in a game?  Buy it. Buy it.

            "review_text": "The biggest drawback to this game, in my opinion, is the combat system. I'm a fan of turn-based combat in general, but this was terribly monotonous. This was mostly because it rarely seemed good to actually use your skills. The main character's regular attack quickly started doing about as much damage as his lowest cost offensive skill, and fights were generally over by the time I'd saved up enough TP for higher leveled ones. The first supporting character came with skills to attack all enemies at once, but the vast majority of the time I was fighting single opponents. Buffs and debuffs also felt to me like a waste of a turn in this game, although I might have just not had the right strategy. Most of the time, this wasn't too bad, but it made any area with random encounters feel like a pain just to slog through.  The story is interesting enough to keep me engaged regardless of the combat. I'd say the writing can often be heavyhanded. There were times I got the impression that it was trying to hard to explain the joke/satire, which often ruined it. That said, there were also moments that worked really well and made me laugh, and also monsters that were unique. I'd recommend fans of RPGMaker-style games give it a shot.",

The story could have been fleshed out more, but the humour of the game is its redeeming quality. Suits: A Business RPG has references to many different people, things and ideas. For example, you have to rescue a rapper named 62 cents. You fight Bustin Jiebers, battle staplers, coffe mugs, ghosts, faeces, soylent meat people, Chief Ramsey. This game is just that funny.   Gameplay is similar to Pokemon's turn based battle system. If battling enemies or bosses becomes too difficult, the player has a option to literally pay the enemies to lose.   Suits: A Business RPG is definitely a game worth the full price.",

OFF had a much better battle theme, and more pleasant backgrounds, and what felt like a more avant garde tone.   I wish it could've had a deeper meaning, I spent the last half of the game speeding through trying to find meaning behind what was happening, and came up with nothing concrete.  In the game there are no women, I can't recall anyone being defined as a man either, but everyone is the same suited person, much like the famous anonymous avatar.   Suits with it's references feels more like commentary on internet culture than it does on buisness/corporations.   The controls are slippery, interacting with objects is often iffy, in the combat most moves are completly useless, building up TP is near impossible, even at the final boss with the best gear I couldn't build up the TP to ever use the ultimate move. Combat never felt like a challenge, I had one KO of a party member and it was a one hit kill move.   It's worth playing, if it's not a strain on your eyes, for a dollar on sale it's worth it. I don't think I'd pay more than a dollar for a sequel.",

I was disappointed that Suits: A Business RPG wasn't a satire on corporate America. I was expecting a fuller commentary on United States capitalism. Instead, Suits treats the corporation, capitalism, the judiciary, the bank, and infrastructure as ways to present a curious story. The fact that the main character graduates from business school is only relevant to the plot in that he is on the way to becoming the CEO (who is not really a CEO).  Despite my mistake in expectation, Suits is quirky with some great allegorical content; certain parts of this game will definitely make you raise an eyebrow.",

            "review_text": "Where to start with this game? I wanted to like this game, the artstyle and surreal atmosphere/setting drew me in, having thoroughly enjoyed titles such as undertale and LISA, I imaged I was in for a similar ride. Unfortunately this was not so, this game was generally not very enjoyable, simply due to how it was executed. I'll start off with what I liked first though.  If you don't want to read a wall of text, skip to the conclusion at the bottom  The artstyle is, very very interesting, it is something that has drawn alot of people in, it gives the game a unique feel, and enemy sprites were generally interesting to look at, surreal, pen drawn abominations in suits and political cartoons. Secondly, the music is another striking feature of this game. Like the art style, it is very atmospheric, and just fits very well with the setting of the game. There isn't loads of music, but there isn't a lack of it either. Another 'strong' point of the game is the humour. I have mixed feelings about the humour, I did chuckle at the various references to modern politics and some puns did make me laugh, but at times the humour felt very forced, or just, didn't make any sense. Lastly, there is Jerome. Jerome is good.  Now, onto the negative aspects, the first main issue is combat. Combat is extremely simplistic, you only ever have two party members (apparently there is a third somewhere?) with an incredibly simplistic and limited range of abilities. Fights mainly consist of stocking up on sandwichs, and just attacking enemies in a war of endurance. Sandwichs get you through this game, not any strategy. Random encounters are also extremely common and frequent. Secondly, there is plot, the game's plot is apparently a business man's descent into corruption.  Well, not really, you complete a couple tasks for your capitalist overlords, and then, police attack you for some reason, and you somehow windup leading a revolution through a series of events that don't make sense. At the end of the game, the last boss decides to drop about 5 bombshells on you with no warning  . Everything about the plot is dull, forced and just badly executed. Another strong negative point is the writing in general, again, everything is just forced. Some jokes, as stated did make me laugh, but there's alot of dialogue that, seemed to be a joke, but just wasn't funny. The last thing, is that, it just doesn't feel like there's any point to the game, it's wasted potential. This game is very quirky in some ways, with it's artstyle, curious setting and the fact that all plants have female names. There is potential here to make a really damn good and unique RPG. But this game fails to say anything about politics other than 'Corporations are bad!' or really make you feel anything. The plot is just a series of events that happen.  Oh, one very last point, Jerome should say more, you don't hear a peep from him after he becomes a party member, he could've been a great comic relief character.  In conclusion   Pros  Great artstyle Unique music Interesting setting Jerome Humour covers a diverse range of topics, seems to be based more on personal tastes Extremely cheap   Cons  Extremely Monotonous gameplay Humour and writing seems forced at times Plot doesn't make any sense, just a sequence of events Poor execution in general, wasted potential Not enough Jerome  As a final point, other people seemed to have liked this game alot more, so it is quite possible you'll enjoy it more than me, plus the price is extremely low.",
