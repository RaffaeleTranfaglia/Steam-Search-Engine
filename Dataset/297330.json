Until about 3 hours go by, and you realize that there are no more upgrades for anything and you have to spend literally 100% of your time just holding the space bar to empty coins from machines. I kept playing, waiting for a larger space/arcade to unlock, something. I actually came to the forums to see what I was doing wrong because nothing was progressing- but then I found out that it's just how the game is.   It feels very incomplete. If the game simply progressed to unlock a bigger space (and therefore more machines, which you can only have 30 of) it would be a big thumbs up but still feel lacking. As is, this feels like about 1/4th of a game. It's sad, because the 1/4th that's there is REALLY good.  This is a difficult thumbs down, but...",

Its fast, frantic and fun....but  I would like to see an add on for this game or a sequel maybe and I would like it to include:  choice of buildings Different sized buildings, didnt like having to sell off old machines (im bit of a hoarder). Different types of arcade machines, ie fruit machines, penny pushers, grabbers, air hockey seasonal items buy just once could include easter.  I dont want that to seem like the games lacking, it isnt, but that would improve on the original game and keep the longevity of the game. I have completed it once and im not sure what would make me want to play it again other than an add on or sequel.  Its definitely worth getting in sale, although full price it might be a bit lacking for some players.",

            "review_text": "1/4 thumbs up  It's too difficult to build up capital in the early stages of the game. I've never made it past the two year mark (or whenever the loan repayment is due) because you need to spend all of your profits buying new games because people stop playing old games after a few months. In that regard, it's difficult to build up a large amount of cash on hand, so you end up forced to sell off a bunch of games to pay off the loan, after which the games you have left aren't making enough money to allow you to build back up and you go bankrupt. On top of that, the games break, or are broken, occasionally and need repairs, so the games aren't very profitable in the long run.  I'm sure there's a way to figure it out and make it work, but i bought this for a casual game of mind-numbing fun, not a tedious game of intricate book-keeping.  If you're looking for a fun build-a-company style game, I prefer Game Dev Tycoon. If you want a build-a-company style game with a little RPG adventure thrown in, get Racettear.",

Still, I would recommend it. Pick it up on sale and have some mindless fun with it for a while. It's some pretty good fun if you were born in the 80s like me and actually remember arcades before they were dead things full of over-sized iPhone games. I just wish they had fleshed it out a bit more. There is only one employee to hire and pretty much no way to automate some things to concentrate on others.",

            "review_text": "This is a good game and can be quite addictive. What I liked about it was being able to design your own arcade with a variety of games you can choose from. It's cool being able to set up the arcade to maximize profits. It reminds me a lot of those old sim games, like sim-hospital, where you kinda have to think ahead in design and utilization of space in order to succeed.   As I mentioned, the game can get very addictive. You constantly have to keep up a stream of cash flow to pay the rent and to keep your arcade up-to-date. It's not easy and games lose their appeal to customers quickly. You're often forced to resort to selling older, less popular games in order to keep up with the trends. As you progress, you can change the design of the arcade and even move into different locations.   Surprisingly, there's more to do than to just place arcade cabinets and collect money. For example, you may have to eject an unruly customer, repair machines, keep vending machines stocked, clear coin jams, and constantly empty coin banks to keep the machines running.   I didn't have a problem with the price considering that this was a finished, full game and I did not encounter any bugs or problems playing it.",

The problem is that once you've played it through once and gotten the achievements, the only replay value is trying to beat your high score (in terms of cash).  What would really improve this game:  1. An endless mode - where the game doesn't feel like it needs to be bound to real video game history, and you can keep running your arcade for as long as you want, maybe even eventually making the transition to a modern Nickel Arcade or mixed establishment a la Dave &amp; Busters.  2. Steam Workshop support - so real games can be modded in and MORE games (real and slighly changed names) modded in.  3. Expandability of arcade past 30 games.  Recommended, but as is, wait for a sale. Could be a lot better.",
