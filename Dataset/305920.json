    "description": "Another Perspective is a puzzle platformer following the very confusing adventure of someone looking for something. Swap minds to see the world in different ways! Where one mind sees a bottomless pit, another might not. Where one sees a locked door, another sees a key. To change perspective is to change reality!",

            "review_text": "I love games that make me sit for hours staring at the screen trying to figure out how to solve a certain puzzle. This was not one of those games. The solution to almost all the puzzles can be figured out pretty easily and the game as a whole is pretty darn easy. And pretty darn short as well.  As for the aesthetics, the game looks pretty decent and the character somewhat resembles the character from Braid. That is where the similarities end between the two games. Gameplay wise, it's smooth and easy. The achievements are really good and those can be hard to get. 6.5/10",

            "review_text": "This is quite a charming game. I've known the developer's work for a while but I didn't imagine he would use such a basic concept to make a puzzle game. Besides movement you just switch characters and needs keys, however level design teaches you to use that in several different ways that from your perspective you wouldn't imagine being done.  If you like puzzles, this is a must have. Also, the game has the annoying habit of making you care a lot for the characters, and it leaves you wanting to see more of them, although the game stops in the right moment. Worth buying at full price.  PS: If you like this kind of game, but wants something more quickly paced, I suggest you play Pause Ahead.",

A definitely purchase for any puzzle/platformer fans!  Puzzles are challenging but not so hard you want to give up. A nice easy reset method allows you to start again and try a different plan for the room or if you are like me try the same plan over and over with slightly different positioning. Then realize the most obvious way after multiple failed attempts!  Great game and would recommend!",

I'm not a fan of angsty-emolike 'game as art' sorts of games, so the nonstop banter wth the player to him or herself about the existential nature of the universe or whatever is completely lost on me. However, that does not really detract from the puzzle solving aspect, which is pretty good although not overly challenging (for the levels that I got to see).  Overall I like the game, but since I gave it an initial test drive for about an hour and a half and came back to it a couple of days later to find that no progress whatsoever had been saved, I'm gving this a thumbs down for pretty much that reason. If it was still 1980 in the days before battery backed game cartridges for my NES or if the game had an Early Access tag, I would not have an issue wth that.  However, that not being the case, I won't be playing this again because I am not a fan of games that require you to play them in one session and my trust has been lost.",

The normal game is really just a prep for a much harder mystery mode which will take much longer than 1h. Game is very minimalistic but that doesn't detract from the game or what it tries to be.  Go get it if you like brain twisters... Oh and also, KEYS!",

Easy controls made this easy for me to play, although I used a controller. The puzzles aren't overly difficult but they do get harder as you progress. And there is an extra mode just for more puzzles!  Overall, this is a nice little game that does not take too long to beat. And the puzzle aspect is different enough to stand out. So if you want a short time waster puzzle game, with a small but interesting story, this is right up your alley.",

The history is the base of the game without it the game is dead, it can't be more longer cause it will be bored, simple like this. The darkness with the lightness and the way that the developer use the reverse psychology during all the game is just perfect, finally he get what he want, we play the game. PD: I'm sad cause can't make screenshots on steam (F12) think that's the gamemaker full screen.   -Wannabe.",
