            "review_text": "Armada 2526, is a fairly old game. There's alot of the UI where that shows, such as ending turns in multiplayer games, ending your turn completely and being unable to act.   Unit diversity could be a touch better as well in early game.  That all aside, the game is deep...shockingly deep. There is a whole lot to fiddle with, and experiment here, from varying techs, planet and star system setups, even setting up migrations of population from one star system to another. Somewhere in the 50th turn I realized I was completely hooked, and my fledling 9 world empire (this is TINY compared to the total number of stars available, even in a 'medium' sized map.) was just now barley starting to come out of the red and into the black.  The sheer distance between stars, also makes you feel the sheer vastness of your empire, even when you have 9 inhabited systems (you end up with far far far more) it takes a very long time to get to your new planets. In early game, when your colonizable planets are far flung, you are gambling. it's inevitable really. Do you go so far out that reinforcements will be a LONG time in coming? Or do you take the risk for higher inhabited worlds to come up quicker, and be self sufficient before another empire decides to take them?  There is depth in a great many facets of the game on initial impression, and the sheer scale involved is daunting. Highly recommend, especially as this game is more often than not onsale, 50 to 75 percent off.",

Of course MOO would just pat it on the head and put it to bed but it was a great attempt with plenty of unique ideas and concepts. Only real issue is the battle system is one of the worst I have ever dealt with. Getting hit over the head with a cinderblock would be less painful than manually controlling battles.   All in all a great game though some things could have been designed better (Space battles)",
