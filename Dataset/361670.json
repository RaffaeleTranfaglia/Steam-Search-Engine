You have access to all the iconic ships in the SW universe and a few you might not have seen before, but were canon before the Disney deal. nothing feels cooler than taking out an Imperial Star Destroyer with a single X-Wing and six proton torpedoes. Totally woth it.",

Simply put, the most immersive Star Wars experience I have ever had, arguably the most immersive game I have ever played full stop.  Combat is rich, detailed and full of nuance. The massive story campaign can be genuinly challenging if played on the hardest difficulty, and the tactical nature of managing your wingmen, controlling where to begin engagments spatially and target prioritizing in between managing the subsystems of your ship, and flying around is both gripping and cereberal.  The universe is richly detailed, dirty freighters haul cargo between systems, hyperspacing along busy shipping lanes, massive Star Destroyers interdict shipments for inspection, pirates attack peaceful mining operations, and you are caught up in the middle of everything. This all comes with a cutom mission editor, allowing you to create battles full of anything from super star destroyers, calamari cruisers, tie fighters, x-wings to old freighters and storage containers. Buy this game if you want real immersion, great combat, an expansive single player experience and a rich detailed universe.",

            "review_text": "One of the best of the X-wing series. I loved this series way back in the day when I was a very young man in high school. Alliance completes the arc and gives a phenomal end to the series. The controls are great, the graphics hold okay for today and despite needing to alter the .cfg to configure modern graphics.   I do think Tie Fighter got some things done better. It felt more smooth and I think a bit more efficient. Alliance played well to the campaign story for its epic climax but still delivered a great multiplayer expereince.   I highly recommend this game to any Star Wars fan or space sim fan. It was a great step in the genre and the only game of the time to rival Freespace 2 at the time.  p.s.   If u like space sims Freespace 2 was the pinnacle of that genre until recently. Highly recommend that.",

But, the necessary tweaks are easy to do, and this game also works excellently with an Xbox 360/One game pad if you have one of those lying around. If you're a Star Wars fan like me, buying this game is a no-brainer.",

It holds up well, and with mods like Darksaber's craft pack that bring it graphically a little more up to date, it's even better. I wish with all my heart we'd get a new X-Wing/TIE Fighter game with the level of fidelity these always had. Sadly, in the day of cookie cutter arcade style shooters and 'sims' we'll never see it. If we do, it'll be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized half port of Battelfront or something. The 90's were truly the golden era of games, in no small part thanks to what the original X-Wing and TIE Fighter sims launched. If EA/Disney ever get their ♥♥♥♥ together and make a new one with a story this good, content this deep and the selection of ships this large, I'll be over the moon. Since that will literally never happen though, thank you Steam/Lucasarts for making this available to us. Great memories. Anyone on the fence, buy the whole X-Wing/TIE fighter series. You won't be disappointed even today. If you need a graphical boost, check out Darksaber's craft pack for XWA.",

If anything, I would recommend using a flight stick over a controller. And since the game was designed to use it, no you can't use the mouse. All in all, a very fun game. But yes. Invest in a decent flight stick. A nice one can run you maybe $30. So not bad.",
