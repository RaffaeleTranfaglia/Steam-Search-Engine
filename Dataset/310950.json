            "review_text": "Review from a new player:  I'm a total beginner at fighting games but after watching EVO this year I decided it was time to give them a shot. I decided on Street Fighter over other fighting games simply because it was the main event at EVO and seemed the most popular. I was a little skeptical after all the negative reviews but I'm glad I still decided to purchase the game. At the time of this review I've logged around 20 hours, purchased a used fight stick, and plan to continue playing which is more then most $60 games keep my attention for.  Pros- -Nice demonstrations explaining how the game works and terms new players might not be familiar with. -Character guides that help describe how you should use each character. Its nice for those not familiar with the Street Fighter franchise. -Story mode was enjoyable. Sometimes the screenplays were a little long but overall I enjoyed it. It started off super easy and became more difficult towards the end. I still haven’t been able to beat it on hard mode but provides a nice challenge and something to work towards. I also liked how it allowed you to play DLC characters to see how you liked them before purchasing. -Trials are fun and challenging. They provide more content to do for the person who is a completionist like myself. -Online replays are easy to find and watch. I enjoy watching the top tier players go at it. -Training mode is easy to use. -You earn a lot of fight money right away for completing single player features in the game. It is nice to be able to get a DLC character or two that you liked from the story mode for free. -Both my fight stick and xbox 360 controller worked with no problems. Reconfiguring buttons was very easy.  Natural- -Character story fell a little short. I like their attempt to further explain each characters story but each one is only 3-4 matches and way to easy, even for a complete beginner like myself. -Survival mode is redundant. I still find it fun but I just feel like its missing something.  Bad- -No VS. CPU mode or arcade mode. You can technically do this in training mode but being a fighting game you just expect this to be in the game. My guess is it'll be patched in eventually. -After the initial wave of fight money you get from single player, the fight money progression is extremely slow. I understand that Capcom needs to make money somewhere but its almost insulting at how little FM you earn after the initial wave. Personally, I'm at a point in my life where I can spend a little extra money on a character I want, but not everyone can do this (especially for a $60 title).  Thoughts on online play- -I've only logged about 30 or so matches but I find the match making to be pretty good. I realize I am going to be beat a lot online but I do feel like it matches me with people who I can feel like I at least have a shot against. It is pretty simple, you earn points if you win and lose points if you lose. It tries to pair you with someone that has similar amount of points as you. It would be pretty heart breaking if it just paired me against “pros” all the time so I'm glad the game does not do that. Out of my matches, I have only had 1 match that was so laggy it was unplayable and maybe 1 that had periods of slight lag. One compliant is the amount of time it takes to search for an opponent. Sometimes I feel like I am waiting forever. I do think the fact that it auto uses your favorite character pretty annoying. For someone new like me that doesn’t have a main character, it forces me to log out of battle network to switch my favorite character every time I want to play someone new.  Overall I really enjoy the game and think it is a great fighter for someone looking to get into the genre. I would rate it a 9/10. All it is missing is VS CPU mode and arcade mode and I would think of the game as perfect.",

            "review_text": "Let's get into it.  My first review was an obvious kneejerk reaction, as I liked the game a lot.  It released without a story mode. Said mode is coming very soon. Still, I would never, ever recommend a Street Fighter title at its release pricepoint of 60 dollars solely for the story mode, even if it released with one that provided 800 hours of content. Because it would be a convoluted, incomprehensible mess.  Let's be honest. The reason you're pondering whether or not to buy this game is so you can play Street Fighter with friends and/or people around the world.  Should you buy it if you're into that? It's a tough answer. The fighting is great, the combos are nice and simple but the game still has great depth. It looks pretty, it has crossplay with the PS4, Juri and Urien are gonna be in it, smug Asian-European waifu is playable, and the online can be a wonderful experience.  But it can also be so, soooo bad. If you're patient enough to deal with teleporting Rashids, if you want to train for tournaments, or if you have someone you really want to play it with, then yes, by all means buy it.  The problem is that SFV sells itself on its more basic roots, it tries to appeal to a more casual audience. If you are one of those casuals who's never played a fighter before, I would much rather recommend something like Brawlhalla or Killer Instinct, which offer much more content for a far less ridiculous asking price. KI has a singleplayer mode and the best training mode in any game besides Skullgirls (another game to recommend!).  These games give you vs. AI Single Fight modes. They give you attainable goals, they ask for much less in order to purchase the full gameplay experience. They give good netcode, in-game chat systems, and quick matches. These are all things SFV is severely lacking.  There is another type of casual, though. If you're the type of guy that tried to get into Ultra but found it too complicated, has played Mortal Kombat a few times, and has a copy of UMVC3 he plays with friends from time to time, this may be the game that gets you into Fighting Games for good, so long as you discover your inner Dhalsim and control the salt that arises from the game's many issues  Do I recommend it? I wish there was a maybe option. I like it, but it's crystal clear to me why others absolutely despise it. For now, it's recommended with some huge caveats.",

            "review_text": "+++ What's good +++  GAMEPLAY ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ SFV caters to both newcomers and veterans. The core mechanics of the game promotes learning fundamentals and honing reads as opposed to godlike execution. As such, the entry barrier seem much lower than SFIV. But SFV still has crazy and long combos (I'm looking at you, Ibuki).  Characters are very diverse. Every character has their unique play style and each character can be played differently in the hands of different players. and the roster keeps growing every month approx!  MULTIPLAYER ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Despite what some may say, I had no problems with the online functionalities. Tho I understand this may be a subjective experience seeing as not everybody has the same ISP. I have personally not encountered any connectivity problems besides on launch week. I don't have a godlike internet, mine's just decent and I have no problems getting smooth matches every 15 seconds or so. and playing against PS4 users is perfectly fine as well. I might have had some few ticks every 5 rounds or so but the lag usually lasts a couple seconds.  FREE CONTENT ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Not exactly free, but SFV introduced a currency system called Fight Money (FM). You gain FM by playing the game and you can use it to buy several things such as characters, costumes, stages and whatnot. Most of the content are DLCs, which means you can basically get the DLCs for free. Altho some items are considered premium, which can only be bought with real currency. Of course, every extra content can also be bought with real money in case you want to avoid grinding for FM.  CONSTANTLY EVOLVING ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Capcom stated that they will continuously maintain and improve on this game to ensure it will keep growing. This includes additional characters, costumes, stages and a balance patch every year (or so they say) Thus far, it's seems that they are successfully delivering their promise. Their scheduling may need some work seeing as they've had a bit of communication issues with the fanbase. Nevertheless, it's always nice for a company to stay active on the development of a game.   --- What's bad ---  STORY ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ It's Street Fighter. The franchise never had AAA level story. The newly released Cinematic Story Mode is decent because you get to see your favourite characters fleshed out in cutscenes that are very well animated (to my surprise). But lore-wise, it's a pretty generic 'evil dude tries to conquer the world and the good guys tries to stop him'. No character development or plot-twist or anything impressive. Don't expect anything Blazblue level. (Cutscenes are eye candy tho, very pretty)  GRAPHICS CLIPPING ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Lots of characters have some form of clipping in their models, especially the hair. It's not even subtle, you can clearly see Ken's hair going through his shoulder or Birdie's chain going through his necklace. Nothing really drastic but it's uncommon to leave so many graphics eye sore in our current gen standard.  SURVIVAL ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ A game mode that gives you FM and character colors, but it's annoying to play because AI are either braindead stupid or they legit read your inputs and counter everything you do. Very tedious experience and annoying as well.  FM GRINDING ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ You only get 50 FM per online VICTORY (doesn't include Battle Lounge, which is the friendly lobbies you create between friends and whatnot) To put things in perspective, a character costs 100 000 FM, a costume 40 000 FM, a new stage 70 000 FM. Basically everything is in the thousands. Their are other ways of getting FM such as completing character trials and story mode, but those are one time things. Afterwards, FM are pretty hard to come by.   Capcom did say they were gonna include a system called Daily Challenges that would reward players with FM if they perform certain requirements, altho we have no infos about what are the requirements or the amount of the rewards.   Ok I got lazy, I could've probably squeezed in a few more points in the What's Bad section but honestly, this game is worth it. Many people have complained about the game being unfinished and that's understandable. But this isn't one of those games that feels incomplete and is going to stay this way. SFV is constantly being improved and we've seen this happen with the slew of new content and updates. That's why I am recommending this game. It'll be worth it in the long run.",

            "review_text": "New account, had to get this on Steam. Says 6 hrs of play, that's going to change quick. I have sunk more hours into this game then Skyrim, BL2, Fallout4, Witcher 3, or Dark Souls 1&amp;2 ( 3 blows donkey balls [4 games deep FromSoft still doesn't understand player latency]) and I've laughed, I've cried, I've taunted, I've teabagged, I've been stunned, I've been cheated of victory, I've ate a full Chun-li CA, I've gone to the bar during Devour-our, I've slipped on some banana peels, I've been utterly humiliated by a Dirty Dhal, I've eaten more SHORYUKENS!!!! from online Kens than you could wave a stick at, I've had some great meaties and been mixed up by some of the best set-ups. All in all, I hate to love this game. This game, fighting games in general, I suppose, has a certain rage inducing vomit build up in your goiter and trust me, the first time you play against a Mika--YOU'LL KNOW what I mean. The best part about it is I have no one to blame but myself. Sure, you get those laggy match-ups sometimes where the character is on the other side of the screen and next thing you know you're eating a full jump-in combo, but after that--it's up to you. Do you want to be the best, like no one ever was? Then you have to train, not only your body, but your spirit and mind to withstand the onslaught of failures that will come. I have always been afraid to really get into fighting games because I thought I would never be good. That truth still holds today. Now, I can pull off an anti-air here and there and still get cannon spiked in the FACE when they land. That is exactly why I love this game though. Sure you could moan and say, 'Oh but a 3-frame invincible move isn't FAIR!' Well guess what? Life's not fair, get over it, hold back AND CRUSH COUNTER THAT SKRUB!!!!!",

            "review_text": "The greatest 1v1 PVP experience out there by far. The game is fun, balanced, simple in the execution of tecnique yet endlessly deep in interaction between players. Street Fighter has gotten more streamlined with every iteration and Street fighter 5 continues this trend. Whether your playing with friends or online theres always fun to be had, and something new to learn about your opponents.  I want to address 2 of the common criticisms of the game and how the game is actually comparitively robust in these 2 areas. The DLC model and the Single Player content.   The game has pretty much adopted letter for letter the same model as League of Legends, all gameplay related content can be purchased with in game currency earned over time. Looking at League of Legends average match time of 37 minutes and 100 IP (its ingame currency) earned in that time it would take 2,886 minutes to earn enough currency for 1 Champion. In street fighter at an average of 45 seconds per round, 2 rounds per game, and 50 points per win it would take 3000 minutes. That doesnt account for the bonus xp earned from weekly quests ( land a throw 10 times or some such thing) for 500 - 1000 points a piece, bonus points for account and character rank ups, and the 100k+ to be earned per completion of each of the sigle player modes in each difficulty. Long story short its more than a fair time sink compared to other games that give you the option to purchase new content or unlock it.  Single Player compared to any PVP focused game gives you plenty to do theres 2 versions of story mode one of which has 2 difficulties and a survival which has 5 difficulties. Story took me about 2 days to complete, I havent run through survival yet but i wager that will take longer than the 2 story modes combined. That being said Not Paladins, not Overwatch, not League of Legends, Not Dota 2, or most other PvP based games have any single player of any sort and are judged solely on the depth and fun offered in their gameplay.   I'm 100% satisfied with what I got from this game and look forward to what season 2 has to offer.",

            "review_text": "Street Fighter V had a rough start. Released back in february 2016, the game shipped in a bare state (To put it mildly). The reason for this was the Capcom Pro Tour, which was going to start just a couple of weeks after the game's initial release. The Capcom Pro Tour is a set of tournaments that is being held throughout the year, where players around the world get to earn points for their placings in these tournaments. The Pro Tour culminates in the Capcom Cup which is set to take place at the end of the year, this is where the top ranking players from Pro Tour dukes it out to crown the champion. This ended up hurting sales alot, but the tournament participation was blooming. Whether Capcom was doing the right thing by releasing the game in an unfinished state in favor of the Pro Tour is a debate of it's own.  The past is in the past, and what matters is what you get today. Over the year, the game's content has expanded immensely. The game's current state, is what it should have been shipped with. The game's roster consists of 16 characters, with 4 of them being newcomers to the series. An additional 6 characters can be bought either by the game's in-game currency (Fight Money) or with real money. There might be less characters in the roster than previous titles offer, but the characters feels more unique than ever before with the introduction of V-skill and V-trigger (moves and abilities unique to each character), which you'll get to know more about in the game's tutorial.  There is plenty of single-player content available to this otherwise multi-player focused game. There is a tutorial where you get to learn the basics of the game's mechanics. There is a story mode, which consists of bite-sized backstories for each character. And a more fleshed out main story, with in-game cutscenes and a ridiculous plot (Which shouldn't surprise anyone, it is a fighting game after all). If you want to learn the ropes with a specific character, the trials has returned, with 10 of them for each character. There is also the mandatory training mode, with recording and playback, which allows you to experiment with different scenarios and setups. Capcom has also introduced daily and weekly challenges, which earns you fight money. The challenges feels lazy for the most part, but earns you a quick buck in terms of fight money. There is also the horrible survival mode, which unfortunately is good source of earning Fight Money and colors for each character within the game, the latter is optional though since the colors has been made available lately via the shop aswell.  When it comes to netplay, Street Fighter V shines. It relies on a rollback netcode, which grants a lot less input latency when playing online. This can however result in your opponent teleporting around the screen if the connection is poor. But overall, this is a great improvement. There is ranked play where players can earn or lose points to compete on the leaderboards, and also a casual mode which functions just like ranked play but without the stress of losing/earning points. Players can also create private or public fight lobbies, for up to 8 players. Street Fighter V also supports cross-platform play, which enables you to face off against players on the Playstation 4 aswell. Cross-platform is a great thing, because it expands the player pool by a great deal, especially for the PC-players since the vast majority of players reside on the Playstation 4-version of Street Fighter V (1.2m total sales at this point, where roughly 200k of those are the PC-version).  Street Fighter V is great for newcomers to the series and fighting games in general. The bar for executing combos is alot lower than the previous titles. While this enables most players to dish out plenty of damage when the opportunity arises, it also takes away a bit from the fullfillment of actually performing the combos. As the combos get's easier, the game relies more on mastering movement and spacing.  Since I have spent the majority of my time with the game on PS4 (About 600~700 hours) and only just recently bought the game for PC, I can allready say that the PC-version is technically superior in many ways (As one should expect). The game is still locked at 60fps, which for competetive reasons makes sense. But the PS4 version tends to dip on certain stages, which just doesn't occur on the PC-version assuming you have a capable computer. Both versions have a small amount of input-lag (the time it takes for your actions to register on the screen), which can be reduced on PC by turning off VSYNC. However, most players will not notice anyways and as the tournament standard is still the PS4-version, you re probably better off leaving it on.  There is also a very healthy mod-community for Street Fighter V, with a lot of custom skins and models to download for each character. If you want Reinhardt to perform a Double Lariat on Tracer, the world is your oyster.  Back in february, Street Fighter V was a hard sell - but now it is quite the opposite. And with rumours of a new season of characters to be announced at the upcoming Capcom Cup, there has never been a better time to buy in.",

This is gonna turn away casuals for sure.  The price of this game to me is too much, £44 is a bit steep if your just gonna be learning for 100+ hours to beat them   Thats all I can do for cons.

Only other complaint is, that some of the alternate costumes are 3.99 each, even if you've bought the season pass, keep that in mind, even though it doesn't really affect the game.   Overall, it is one of the better fighting games. Would recommend!",

As we all know, this game is not complete and is quite expensive for an Early-Access-online only game. The Net-code is horrible and will randomly disconnect you from the server (there are no rewards in offline play). Currently, the game offers poor optimization, and story mode is currently underwhelming . This game seems rushed and I doubt it will be completely fixed by the end of the year. If you're a hardcore SF fan, this will be fun in short bursts. If you're not a hardcore fan, this won't be the SF to win you over unfortunately. When this game is finally complete I wonder how much all the dlc will cost? I am aware that fight money is supposed to allow you to buy all furture DLC characters, but, I don't know. I smell a foul smell coming from that shop...",

The single player content is sorely lacking, the character story mode is a joke when it comes to the actual fighting part. You get one round fights that my toddler can beat simply by button mashing. The biggest let down to me is no arcade mode like the previous games. Vs mode can only be played locally against another player.  The online part of this game is very good and addicting though. Playing with a stick the gameplay is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the current roster of fighters, or how some of the orginal fighters have been changed, but I'm sure that will be improved in the coming years as this game grows.   As it stand if your looking for a good fighting game to play online this game is great, if your expecting that great experience to also include the content for single player stick with ultra 4.

            "review_text": "Now that all the crucial components promised are already out, this is the HONEST review.  GRAPHICS +1 light rendering, as is expected from Unreal Engine 4, currently the best techniques in the industry +1 character models +1 high quality textures +1 interface is easy to use -1 hair and clothes meshes often clip -1 some stages have low texture quality -1 some background NPCs animate in lower FPS than   SOUND +1 less focus on electronic/synthesized music and more actual instruments used +1 more variety and uniqueness while still staying true to character(ie. Guile's prog-rock/jazz arrange) +1 music pumps people up, from intro, to menu, to character themes +1 Japanese dub has more hits than misses -1 certain stage-specific themes are trash tier -1 English dub has more misses than hits. Too much improv by VAs when compared to Japanese  BASE GAMEPLAY SYSTEM +1 quite balanced for a game that skipped arcade release +1 each character has more distinct playstyles to one another, compared to previous games(Ryu and Ken is now truly night and day) +1 more lenient execution frametime and focus on footsies allow for fights on a more fundamental level while reducing physical restraints, although mastering the system is still not easy. +1 FADC system has been replaced by V-trigger system, making excessive offense less safe.  -1 game has seemingly dev-implemented minus-8 frames of lag, which makes certain characters frustrating to use(ie. Zangief)  NETWORK PLAY *needs mentioning* game deals with lag not by increasing time between input and on-screen execution(SFIV), but by warping the situation back to when it was executed. Some prefer it, some are indifferent, others hated it. If your connection is good, chances are you won't see it. Too neutral to be given or deduced points for.  +1 it works, to an extent +1 Ranking system starts easy, but requires more points to reach higher leagues, and losing as higher league against lower league makes you lose a lot of point. Keeping rankings legit with less frauds and one-trick ponies while giving less room for boosters to breeze their way up... if there isn't another way to cheat it. -1 overall server functions are still flawed as of this writing. Errors often occur after matches end; most of the time, your points will be correctly added or deducted later, but sometimes it doesn't register.   even basic connectivity is still compromised during long survival modes, as many people still struggle to finish Survival mode without disconnecting and having to restart(this is important because Survival mode needs to be played while online to obtain in-game money for unlocks)  lastly, the statistics only half works. You need to depend on external sites like vleague.pro for extra data crunching, which is a shame.  -1 match filtering options are too small, and some of them do not even work. 5 bar connections may sometimes feel like 3, depending on your location and ISP.  -1 Rage Quitting, or the act of quitting the game/disconnecting/unplugging the Ethernet cable shortly after 'KO' is announced to prevent the game from properly registering your loss and deducting your points, is still rampant. The current punishment system implemented failed to prevent this trend as it is still too lenient and certain regions are filled with people who do this on instinct.  OTHERS +1 essential game components such as characters and stages are all unlockable by in-game money alone, which can be obtained by finishing the single-player contents or fulfilling certain requirements. The only content locked with real money so far are 'premium' costumes for each character. Just be careful not to spend your Fight Money too much on colors and titles  +1 Training mode is the most in-depth it has ever been in a Street Fighter game. Plenty of options to customize your training setup needs and one-button position resets. You can tell that the professional players had a lot of input in this one.   +2 arcade mode doesn't exist, but they are now streamlined into 'Survival mode', 'Character Story' and 'General Story'. You will fight a bunch of CPU characters in all of these modes, although Survival focuses solely on fighting, and the story modes only give 1-round matches while unveiling the drama. These in themselves are good things, however...  -1 Survival mode is very grind heavy. While common CPU difficulty spikes are usual stuff for fighting games, they get ridiculously cheap in later stages on Normal and above. You will not learn anything useful for fighting human opponents as defeating them requires you to be cheap as well.  And while completing Survival mode unlocks new alternate colors for free, you will have to do this for EVERY costume set(DEFAULT, STORY and PREMIUM), including the costumes you paid with real money.  -1 character stories and general story are poorly written. The Shadow Falls story had its moments, but it clashed with too many plotlines established by previous games. Some things also do not make sense, even considering SF's comical nature. Expect upsets if you want to see longtime characters getting their shining moment here.  -1 stage transitions; which shows your characters transitioning from one stage to another, or crushing into background objects after a round defeat, is still limited to the China stage. They promised us this, yet fail to deliver them all despite development screenshots and data minings showed they had all this set up for other stages too, yet still nothing after over 4 months.  TECHNICALITIES +1 game is optimized well enough to be played either with a cheap laptop sporting modern integrated Intel GPU to the big boys using high end stuff -1 high amount of animation and richer movements demand more CPU power. You may need CPUs that are better than 2-core/4-thread low-end CPUs for Network play. -1 certain issues with resolution may cause minimal stutter and lag at resolutions lower than 1080p on certain systems. -1 after more than 4 months, still no Direct Input support, requiring you to use third party software to use anything other than the X Box controller -1 keyboard controls are still not fully customizable  SCORE SUM = 18/34 (&gt;50%, RECOMMENDED, with caution)  Summary: The game has good stuff, and some of its bad stuff can be fixed using external means, but those coming from SFIV series and wanted more of THAT, those expecting deeper storylines, or people that have very low patience for online play issues may want to avoid this.   Regardless, when the game drops below 30 US dollars, its unconditionally recommended for all of you.",

It still needs some love in one area, which is connectivity, but i think it might be my net. Ive got good ping in most games but i think this game just requires minimal packet loss and good bitrate to function right online.  Overall, the gameplay itself is great. The game focuses heavily on mind games, player focus, frame traps, footsies (sometimes) and anti airs, and execution has been reduced from SF4. I can play the entire cast, and probably a fifth of them reliably, which is much better than what i could say about SF4, although some argue the easier execution makes the game worse, i disagree. there is still enough complication and complexity to make it fun and engaging. Character cast is good and plays diversely different, stages look nice, and the game has a lot of 'momentum' to its play. Great new stuff is also featured, such as vskills, vtriggers, crush counters and the rest. This is all terminology, and I suggest reading up on what these are on a wiki or a guide or something going in. Youll want to know things like that and others, such as 'frame advantage.'  Other than the previously mentioned connection problems I face, some people think the DLC policy is pretty bad, and it is, but it is possible to unlock the important things fairly easily just by playing, every matchmaking game you win you get 50 'fight money,' every time you level up a character you get 1000 FM, you can get 6000-10,000 FM weekly doing challenges, winning survival on each difficulty for the first time on each character also grants you fairly large chunks of FM. Basically, play everything the game has to offer and characters suddenly seem easy enough to just unlock, with some patience.  I reccomend if you want a good fighting game to play against others with.",

            "review_text": "Good old Street Fighter... The franchise that made fighting games into what they are today. After a really rocky launch, Street Fighter V is shaping up to be pretty good in the long run. It still has its fair share of problems though.  The core gameplay of the game is great. It very much feels like a slower, slightly watered down Third Strike, yet faster at times than 4. Smart play is rewarded, such as good reads, out thinking your opponent, applying pressure, mix-ups, and other various shenanigans to victory. Defensive play is still a viable tactic, it's just a bit harder to do with how offense heavy the game is.  Online play is a bit hit and miss. Matches can range from feeling like fast fluid offline versus, to totally annoying teleporting laggy crap. Luckily, the lag can be avoided for the most part. Searching for 4-5 bar connection opponents and forwarding the proper ports can minimize the lag as much as possible. Also, play wired, do not play on wi-fi. For new players, I suggest starting with casual instead of playing ranked right away. Helps to get a feel of how to play against people.  Performance might not be perfect for everyone. Your mileage might vary in that regard, much like many games. The game generally runs fine with almost no frame drops. For me personally, I had some driver crashing and frame drop issues right away. Turns out the game hated the overclock on my graphics card and the driver version. Rolled back on the driver and toned down the clocks a bit, now there's no issues and it runs smooth as butter.  As for the DLC practices... it's not bad, but I wouldn't say it's overly great either. You can buy DLC with in-game money, known as Fight Money. Characters cost 100,000 Fight Money, story costumes for 40,000, stages from 40,000-70,000, and colours 11 and up for 2000-10,000. Premium costumes cost $4 each (a little expensive for a skin basiccaly, I know) and to pay for a character would be $6. The season pass is available, which nets you all 6 of the DLC characters and their premium costumes at a discount (perfect for folks that don't want to grind all money and have everything). That is only for season one however. The first 400,000 Fight Money is earned relatively quickly and easy, if you are decent at learning combos and have some patience to sit through easy survival with the entire cast.   On the topic of survival... here comes the ugly parts of the game. If you want colours 3-10 for your character and/or costume, you need to do survival! Over and over and over again. Easy is trivial, but nets you some fight money and a whopping one colour. Normal nets you more fight money, colours, but can be long, repetitive and boring, especially when the AI decides to go crazy on you then you have to restart. From the beginning, do it all over again! Colour bundles are now available to buy with fight money.  On to my final gripe. If you want to play on controller or arcade stick, you either have to use one that is xinput compatable or use an xinput wrapper that will cause button lag. As far as I know, dinput has yet to be supported. This is a non-issue for people that play using xbox controllers/sticks, keyboard, or PS3/4 controllers (running DS4windows, SCP, or the like).   All in all, I recommend the game. Especially for fighting game fans such as myself. There's no arcade mode as of yet, a story mode was added recently, and the online is mostly the meat of the game. So that might deter some people. For the casual fans and players, I also recommend it if you want to get into fighters and get better. Pick it up while it's on sale, unless you must have it right now.",

And please make sure to read more reviews before deciding whether to buy this! Use this as a second opinion!  This game is not feature complete. There is no real story mode; no real singleplayer. There are no lobbies (there is something called a battle lounge, but its 1 on 1). There is no challenge system and while I have not played survival, its pretty quick and lame from what I have read. All this stuff is coming in the free March update. The games mandatory tutorial does not tell you much aside from that your fists can punch, you can throw out a fireball if you are Ryu, your legs can move and kick, and you can block stuff. The tutorial, however, fails to mention more crucial things: did you know you can quick recover from a knockdown into a roll by double tapping left when you hit the ground? You can also quick rise by double tapping down. They acknowledge throw breaks, but don't tell you how to do them, which might seem like its common sense to most people but someone brand new to the series wouldn't get it. The tutorial overall is just very vague for a game that is trying to bring new blood into a niche genre.  As a fighting game, I'm enjoying this. I think right now its a solid experience if you want to hop in, train, and fight live players. I play them pretty casually, so I'm no expert at the systems present, but it does change quite a bit from the last title I spent time with (SFIV). The new Variable Gauge system creates more identity to the characters, as activating your V-Trigger will alter your moveset, giving them new properties or creating new moves entirely. Every character now has a V-Reversal while allows them to escape pressure through a knockdown as well as a V-Skill that alows characters to dissipate projectiles or other perks unique to the character. The Variable Gauge system changes a lot from the last system, but people who have played the Alpha series or Third Strike might feel right at home with it.  Links and execution in this game also feels much easier than 4, making it a breeze to get in and start practicing your bread and butters until your thumb or wrist hurts. This also means this game is very accessible to new fighting game players, so long as they take the neccessary steps to get outside information, have a proper mindset, and a willingness to learn from their mistakes.  Overall, I think Street Fighter V can only get better from here on. At $60, its a very tough decision for a lot of people. If you wanted a feature complete game, you should wait until March or maybe April at the latest before jumping into the fray. If you know all this, and don't care, you have a fighting game that is very solid when the servers aren't acting funny. Here is hoping Capcom keeps it up and makes this game fantastic, because it has the potential to survive for a really long time if they play their cards right.",

If you are interested in single player game modes then I would suggest holding off on purchasing this game until that content arrives, but if you are mostly interested in online then you would find a lot of enjoyment with this game. With that said, there are still some things to consider.  The biggest issue in my opinion is that this game (A PC and PS4 exclusive) lacks Direct input support on PC. This means that all of your PS4 arcade sticks won't work on this version of the game, you will need a stick that has X input (360 stick) or use third party software to get your direct input stick to work. Doesn't sound like a huge issue, but I have experienced noticeable input lag with using anything but Joytokey. Maybe your system will work better with the some software over others, I don't know, there are several of these sofwares but Direct input support has been promised on launch day by a Capcom representative and they haven't mentioned it since. For all the players who like to play 2D Fighters on keyboard, there is no key mapping, so you're stuck with the default mapping.  The next issue I'd like to mention is Ragequitting. Capcom's solution to ragequitting is laughable at best. These types of games will always have ragequitters and many games have implemented very capable systems to handle the issue, but Capcom's solution has taken too long to be implemented and has the posibility of locking out people who genuinely disconnect from the servers for up to two hours.  Again, the gameplay is solid, but if Capcom would just do a better job communicating with the community about the issues in the game and when we can expect certain things to be fixed instead of constantly giving us the silent treatment I think the game would be doing a lot better.",

If you are interested in single player game modes then I would suggest holding off on purchasing this game until that content arrives, but if you are mostly interested in online then you would find a lot of enjoyment with this game. With that said, there are still some things to consider.  The biggest issue in my opinion is that this game (A PC and PS4 exclusive) lacks Direct input support on PC. This means that all of your PS4 arcade sticks won't work on this version of the game, you will need a stick that has X input (360 stick) or use third party software to get your direct input stick to work. Doesn't sound like a huge issue, but I have experienced noticeable input lag with using anything but Joytokey. Maybe your system will work better with the some software over others, I don't know, there are several of these sofwares but Direct input support has been promised on launch day by a Capcom representative and they haven't mentioned it since.

Any devices utilizing direct input (PS3/PS4 sticks and controllers) are NOT detected by the game. This too is being patched in down the road at no additional cost. This is an an inconvenience for sure, but there are programs that will allow you to map your direct input devices in the meantime.

The combat is so damn resposive, and smooth. I personaly feel its the most refind fighting game to date...  unfortinatly thats it.... Thats all the good things i can say about it.  You start with 16 fighters however, all the fighters you want are paid DLC. as of righting now, there is no plan for Blanka, Akuma, Cody, Viper, E Honda. yes they can be future paid dlc, however the game feels half complete without some of these esscental people. there is no Arcade mode, its almost strickly online, each additional DLC fighter is about $10.  They recently released a story mode and spoiler!!!...... it sucks....  In conclusion, this game is not a bad fighting game, however it falls short in content and is almost exclusively online.

The premise of SFV is simple, you take the established Street Fighter gameplay and simplify it in a way that only makes the game more enjoyable for new and old players alike. You take the old capcom fighting game business model of 'release a new edition every 2 years' and you throw it out the window because everybody hated it, replacing it instead with a one box one purchase product with DLC that can be unlocked for free by playing the game, honestly one of the most commendable and customer friendly decisions ever made by a video game company.  Issues arise when you outsource development to incompetent people in order to rush the game out ahead of schedule causing the netcode to be unreliable and choppy and full of client desync, matchmaking to be slow, and the lobby system to be borderline unusable. Compounded by failure to add directinput controller support for over nine months, dinput meaning literally anything that doesn't run on xbox software, a platform this game isn't even available on. Insult added to injury when they release a 'security update' which installs what can only be described as a rootkit virus on your pc in order to detect people unlocking things in the game they shouldn't have access to, which was later rolled back after public outrage.  Capcom have shot themselves in the foot with such aggressive frequency that it's starting to look like they're following up on purpose in order to pass off the first incident as intentional. It's a real shame, because technical issues aside, Street Fighter V is the best game in its genre.

If this were SFxT or MVC3 you would be able to point to obviously shady practices but in this case Capom is selling a online-based fighter with extra content to come at a later date and has not presented it as anything more than that.

            "review_text": "(Updated 12.7.2016)  Flowchart Ken's school of tl;dr recommendation:  -Single player is extremely lackluster even by genre's standards. The cinematic story mode is silly, if amusing joke at best, and random nonsense at worst. Rubbish for single player alone.  -Multiplayer and general gameplay works as intended. Definitely recommended.  -Still quite rough around the edges, such as lack of official dinput support and whatnot.  Compared to previous titles and the franchises reputation, Street Fighter V introduces several rather radical changes to movesets and approach to balance as technical layers have been beheaded one by one, favouring good old fundamental babysteps over technical, extravagant and flamboyant balls. Everyone has only one clear set of normal moves as opposed to normals and close normals - the latter only working at essentially point blank range as the name suggests, almost everyone in the cast has an ability dedicated to bypassing or neutralising projectiles outside jumping, many characters' moveset has been drastically changed compared to their previous appearances, heavy attacks can inflict 'crush counter' which opens up even more damaging combo opportunities for mistimed buttons or missing reversals up close, execution barrier has been reduced a lot that even someone who has never played a video game before can in theory dish out decent damage with little training, and the jump from understanding basics to being able to use said basics is far less pronounced than before. It does not mean anyone can learn the game in 10 minutes and level up to sponsored tournament player, simply even that 10 minute training can force even little bit of respect even against competent player by sheer damage output potential from mistakes. It hardly makes up for lack of knowledge or experience in other areas. After all, no amount of simplification can beat experience and good understanding of principles and execution.  Speaking of mechanics, each character has their unique V-Skill, V-Reversal and V-Trigger which uses the new V bar, which is gained by taking damage or using V-Skills. V-Skills range from eliminating damage with the right timing to moves which can bypass projectiles (and doubles as attacks) to 'armoured' moves or extra mobility. V-Reversals use the same V bar and activated by pressing forward during block and three punches (or kicks depending on the character) at the same time. These serve as a way to halt or escape pressure. When V bar is full, V-Trigger is available and its activation varies from countdown timer with new special moves, enhanced special moves, or even single-use special move by itself. To give an example, Ryu's V-Skill improves his projectile speed, damage and stun, adds charge property and at max charge breaks defence. Zangief's V-Skill allows him to essentially suck an opponent closer from afar, allowing him several potential applications to close in the distance and deal some nasty damage. It slightly resembles the FADC combo extender Street Fighter IV functionally without drastically lopsiding use of bar for mere combo extenders to most of the cast, as V bar is always reset inbetween rounds.  Several months in and SFV is pretty well balanced as each character has all the necessary tools to win. The cast has also good focus on quality, each character has their own gameplay vibe and strenghts even if some archetypes overlap. Initial 16 character roster has been expanded to 20, and another 2 are on their way. So far only gameplay aspect veering heavily into on\\off territory is its preference for offensive approach and (somewhat) restrictive technical setplay dictated by frame data, as right now it does favour a little bit too much of hitting buttons in random order for victory especially against people who are not as experienced. For those struggling to deal with nonstop pressure, block and V-Reversal is your friend. Looking beyond infancy gimmicks, online specials and bar brawls, match dynamics and causality are pretty clear.  Crossplay deservers wonderful mention too. PC and PS4 users can play together, tossing platform split down the drain. Casual matches have been added alongside ranked matches and searching matches is fairly effortless, if random when it comes to finding an opponent.  But now we get to the fun part everyone has been awaiting and snarking beyond ridicule since the game was released. For every force there is equal but opposite force, for ying must come yang, for every attempt to sound smart on the Internet must come the awful truth nobody really cares.  Above the solid diamondmine of gameplay and mechanics lies huge pile of ♥♥♥♥ and landslide's worth of mud to sludge through. Forget quickly fixed launch server issues. For a major release from a major publisher funded by major company, the game is hollow as termites' favourite vacation spot. Capcom Pro Tour explains it a bit but considering how often poor if not even outright broken releases are (rightfully) crucified and burned on whim... eh. SFV was far from broken but simply hollow. I do not care much for single player content in fighting games, but even on the genre's nonexistent SP standards SFV anchored its own foot somewhere in the Atlantic. The (character) story is essentially ~15 minute slugfest against AI as competent as squirrel on drugs trying to fly jet at mach 3, which leaves us survival mode and training with dummy set to AI as only way to play the game without involving human opponent. The cinematic story fares even worse, resembling official fan fiction aiming for Adam West Batman campyness only to climb up a tree posterior-wards. Even the infamous 90s Street Fighter cartoon makes more sense with better entertainment value.  The game forces you play a very quick tutorial once you start it. Not a bad idea but it too much to ask to extend tutoring to training mode? And allow viewing frame data in-game? Under challenges and demonstrations one can find some pointers on par with pro tips to defeat Cyberdemon. Googling information in this day and age is really, really easy, but is proper manual and better guides too much to be asked?  Lobbies have predetermined chat messages which while serve their purpose, is very limited and just plain weird decision since Guilty Gear Xrd came out on PC a while back which allows actual chat in lobbies, matches + supports 4x matches at the same time. Between matches the hangtime worse than on the moon. Imagine someone padded War and Peace on top of War and Peace and maybe Anna Karenina while at it. Character selection feels like someone on the developement team was very fond of screen transitions and animations and stretching out like expanding universe. Capcom Fighters Network does not allow any kind of communication (outside lobbies) either.  There is bizarre irony at work that a game released for both PS4 and PC at the same time lacks direct input support... while PS4 natively supports it. While easy problem to solve with 3rd party software, there are no words. What kind of creative degenerate decided early on in developement to not add dinput? Why not make default keyboard binds as unintuitive as possible and dr— oh, right. That also happens to be a problem. I'm tempted to guess the person in charge of PC developement had a grudge against raw, basic functions which allows a game to be played in the first place.  As much as the game release went through stereotypical evil overlord game publisher checklist of missing good release station by few counties, multiplayer and gameplay is still 100 carat diamond. With some frustrating caveats and minefields to consider too.",

I love offline competitive play and training mode. For me, the game is a lot of fun.   I realize I'm in the minority. The negative reviews are warranted and Capcom screwed up big time. BUT. This awful launch will pass, content will come, and the fighting will still be excellent. SFV will (eventually) be a game that everyone can enjoy.  EVO. Pro Tour. I get it. But seriously, Capcom. This launch was a disaster.  TL;DR Single player content is a joke, servers are (were?) a mess. When it works, the gameplay is amazing. The balance is fantastic, the game is tournament ready.

If you care about getting online and fighting, training and discovering combos in training mode, and working to build the foundation of the community. Grab it now and play your heart out.  If you're looking for more single player content and data, more feature rich online multiplayer and other offerings that, for example, Ultra Street Fighter IV, offered, then keep your eye on this title for a future buy.

The mechanics are brilliant, the netcode is much improved over USF4 (if I search RANKED with 3+ bars only, it's as if I'm playing with people in my living room), the RANKED queue search time could be better but it's rare that you wait longer than 2-3 mins for a match and it's full compatible with my 360 pad for Windows and my Q4RAF fightstick.   The button config is also much improved and is the easiest iteration so far in terms of being able to remap buttons on your gamepad / stick. Have to fiddle with the modes on the fightstick a little to get it to register but I think that's down to Windows only recognising it in a certain mode rather than the game.  Overall, if you like fighting games with simple to learn but hard to master mechanics and online play, I would recommend the game to you.  If you want to play Arcade mode and have a good storydriven fighting game experience (in the vein of Mortal Kombat XL which has just been updated for PC or the old skool Soul Caliber games) then look elsewhere because the storymode on offer here is threadbare and comes across as if it was written by a team of 5 year olds who just watched Dragonball Z for the first time.   8/10",

Having very little street fighter experience and jumping right in was daunting but it has been a rewarding journey throughout.  The animations for each individual character are very detailed and a joy to look at. I found myself picking random characters to look at their idle animations because it was that good. the visuals really contribute to the stages and their backgrounds (Hillside Plaza is beast!)  Training mode is robust and much can be learned from going to the lab and practicing a few combos. Practice various scenarios, mix-ups etc.   The original soundtrack for this game is also epic and I get hyped listening to the stage/character select music.  Characters currently available and to come all look unique and amazing to play. The introduction of the V trigger system really makes for fun play, making comebacks possible.  If you enjoy the aspect of testing your metal online against more and more challenging people online this is the game for you. Winning a close match is one of the most rewarding parts of this game, it's not easy but through a robust training mode you can level up and face all the world warriors.   ",

            "review_text": "Fighting games are about mechanics mastery. Street Fighter has always been about mastering the fight system of each iteration and using your mastery to compete with other humans. The reason that people buy fighting games is the same reason people play MOBAs, to 'git gud' at them and become able to beat other players. I bought Street Fighter V for this reason.   Many are concerned about the lack of singleplayer modes. I can sympathize with this, but I must mention that if your goal is to gain mastery of the fight system in order to beat better and better players, your time is better spent fighting other humans rather than AIs. As it stands, if your goal is mechanics mastery, the game has what you need it to have in it right now. If you're choosing not to buy this game because it lacks singleplayer content, you probably weren't going to play it for more than a month. I presume that those who are declining purchasing the game because it lacks singleplayer content are those who already don't see the value, don't see the depth in what the game already has to offer in its multiplayer mode. If you don't see the value in that, then I assume you want to play Street Fighter V because it's the Next Big Game coming out. It's something to occupy your time for a short while before the Next Big Game after it comes out. This is a mistake. Fighting games, like MOBAs, are not about occupying you for a short amount of time. If you want to get any meaning out of this game, it is not such a game that you play for two hours after work before you go to sleep for the next day, forgetting about it once Dark Souls 3 comes out. It is a game that you must not forget about if you wish to gain the fullest amount of value from it. It is a game that will take many hundreds of hours to gain a respectable level of skill for. It is a game that requires a time commitment that is daunting compared to many other video game genres. If you do not have the patience to put the time in to get good, I do not think this game will be worth 60 dollars to you. And assuming you are waiting on the game already until it has its singleplayer modes patched in, you will get about 8 hours or so of playtime out of that. Then you might try online and get absolutely wrecked. You might spend two or so weeks trying to get good at online play, and then you'll quit because you're unwilling to put in the amount of time you will realize is necessary to beat these players. This is not meant to be a put down, or to be dismissive. This is just the experience of a vast majority of people when they first play fighting games. It was my experience. It will likely be yours as well. Most Steam users are at least familiar with DoTA, so I'll use it as a similar case. Street Fighter is a game that asks even more time of the player than DoTA does in order to get the most out of it. Please consider this fact before you make your purchase.  In summary: This game is not for you if you're not interested in player versus player and are unwilling to put in the time required to harden muscle memory/gain general knowledge of the fighting system. I am, so that's why I'm recommending this game. This game is likely not for you if you only want to play singleplayer modes. I may be wrong on this point. You may find 60 dollars of enjoyment in the singleplayer modes the game will patch in within a few months that will likely only last 6-8 hours. If you feel that's the case, of course spend 60 dollars on the game, but if you find yourself wanting, don't say I didn't tell you so. ;)",

            "review_text": "I wanted to hold off on reviewing Street Fighter V until more content was released, since Capcom themselves admitted that the game was incomplete at launch. Nonetheless, I immediately bought the game as soon as it came out because I wanted to jump straight into the online multiplayer mode. Since then, I have been regularly playing it every now and then, and it still hasn't gotten old yet to this day. Furthermore, there are still plans to release additional content in the future. Now that the story mode has been released, I feel like I can give the game a fair review at this point.  The biggest attraction of Street Fighter V remains the online multiplayer mode. The battle system has more depth to it than any previous iteration of Street Fighter, and there are plenty of opportunities to make a comeback against an opponent who is overwhelming you. Your character's V-gauge will fill up as you take damage, allowing you to perform special techniques that could potentially reverse the direction the match is heading in. At the same time, your character's special gauge will also be filling up both as you give and receive damage, so it is still rewarding to go on the offensive. The developers also did a great job at ensuring that the characters in this game are all balanced (well, maybe except for Zangief), and that the play style for each character is a unique challenge to tackle and become accustomed to. Personally, I was satisfied by this game's multiplayer mode alone, but I understand that this might not be the case for everyone else.  Thankfully, Capcom has added enough single player content to keep many players satisfied by this point. Sure, they still haven't added Arcade Mode yet, but the amount of single-player content currently available was enough to satiate my needs of fighting against the game's AIs. This is just my personal taste, but I found that I didn't need Arcade Mode considering everything else the game had to offer. Survival Mode helped test any foolproof strageties I'd thought up against hordes of AI opponents, and Challenge Mode helped me practice vital combos to the characters I wanted to become familiar with. The long-anticipated Story Mode was well worth the wait (in my opinion) and definitely has the most fully fleshed-out plot in any Street Fighter game to date. It also pays homage to many of the earlier Street Fighter games in ways that might surprise some people.  The only real complaint I have about this game is that there still aren't too many characters on the roster just yet, although I am aware that this will change in future updates. Plus, the amount of variance between the playstyles of the different characters is enough to keep me entertained for now. Despite a difficult launch, I still have very high hopes for Street Fighter V, and I believe the amount of depth the game possesses is enough to keep most hardcore players hooked - therefore, I would certainly recommend it to fans of the series.",

They did release it before it was 100% and could have avoided the backlash if they put more emphasis on that fact that they released it for the tournament. Right now it is definitely more competitive/multiplayer focused. The real single player will be out in a couple months. The only real complaint I have is that the Arcade Mode is missing, but capcom is working on it.   It is so clean and crisp. They had some launch problems with the online, but majority of games do have problems at launch. This game needs a fair chance. Do research on what you are buying. I knew what I was getting into buying early on. I payed $45 for SFV and I'm completely satisfied. The slow release of content over the next couple months will just make the game even better.   If you want single player and aren't in for the multiplayer just wait a few months. If you love being competitive then definitely purchase now. Street Fighter has been one of my favorite game series since birth and this entry did not disappoint me. I actually like it more than SFIV.   Capcom said this is an evolving platform. They will continue to improve and add things to the game. Voice your concerns with Capcom on the Capcom Forums if you want the game to improve.",

            "review_text": "So, it's time I updated my review to 'recommended' With this latest update, this is the game that they should have released from the start.   Gameplay 10/10  Much in the same way that other studios fail to duplicate the polish of Nontendo's Mario platformers. Same can be said for 'fighter' studios trying to duplicate SF's polish. The gameplay is super smooth and really handles perfectly. There is no other fighter on the market that outshines SF in this category and it is the most important category.  Graphics 10/10 This boils down to taste. I love the way this game looks. Unreal Engine delivers cartoon style graphics with outstanding color, shadows and aniumations. Top shelf work.  Bugs 6/10 Although a lot of the bugs have been fixed, the amount of problems players have been having is unacceptable for an expensive AAA title. They should have called their release 'Early Access' because that was the level of polish. It plays much better now but there is still a chance that new players will run into problems on PC.  Roster 7/10 What is there is awesome.. it's just there's not much there. This will change as Capcom slowly releases content (stages, alt stages, characters, costumes, etc.) it's all slowly dropping.  Pay Model 5/10 The game costs $60 and you don't get much for that. Each additional character costs $6 a pop along with new stages, costumes and all costing a few bucks. You can buy almost everything with FM (fight money) but Capcom makes sure you have to grind your tailbone off to get it. Plus, all the costumes you really want are not available to purchase with FM. Real $ only for those.  Story Mode 7/10 I read a lot of bad things about story mode. When I played it it wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe. Injustice had the best story mode. MKX was like playing through a really bad B movie with cool fight scenes, and it was fun in that way. SFV story mode is like a corny, silly, comic book come to life. It's at its best when it is being stupid funny. It's at its worst when it's trying to be taken serious. I enjoy sitting through the story. The thing that really hurts story mode is this. No difficulty selection. You have to play the first run through on easy, so you can close your eyes and button mash to the end. Second playthrough is on hard which feels more appropriate. You can earn double the FM for beating both modes so that's nice but there should be an option for difficulty from the beggining.  Online 8/10 I'm not an expert in online mode yet. Haven't put in a ton of hours. Still, I have always found matches easily, relatively lag free play, not many rage quitters left and cross play has worked great. If there were some sort of VOIP I'd give this an even higher score. If I run into more issues online I'll adjust the score later.  Overall 8/10 I know the scores average out to 7.5/10 but the roster score will go up as the list expands and the bug squashing has been better as of late so I'll round up. If you have been on the fence, now is a good time to jump in!",

So...are you a real fighter???? All other fighting games are videogames. SFV is about the players....this is crafted to feel like a real fight between 2 minds instead of a technical contest. It's an infinite learning process but once you get good and fight an equal lvl opponent (the only way to enjoy the game), you will feel why sfv is special.    11/10 for me.",

Negatives. - Lack of options at launch, like, no arcade modes challenge modes etc, meaning if you want to play solo you literaly have zero good modes. - Story mode available at launch is a total joke. - Survival mode is the worst mode ever in fighting games, and this one hides colors for costume behind stupid requirements. - Game decided to minimize charge characters ( for whatever reason Vega is no longer a charge character, **** you Capcom ) - Micro transaction scheme that could go both ways once more modes are released in march, stay tuned.   All in all, i keep the game and have no regrets, i recomend it. It is really our only awesome fighting game. Don't trust the negative steam reviews. ( though the complaints about current lack of single player modes are justified. If you must have them and don't care about online, hold on until they get released as your only current use for the game will be to get massacred online )",

The story mode takes a grand total of 2 hrs MAXIMUM if you sit through all of th cut scenes, otherwise each character gets like 2-3 fights and then they are done and the fights are super easy. The servers are constantly iffy. First day I had no problem getting on the servers then today (Which is 2/17/2016) I logged in, got on the server, did a little training mode, got booted from the server, spent 5 minutes getting back on, got on again, then promptly got booted.   Gameplay-wise its up there with the best of the franchise. Each character is unique and has their own feel to them. Series staples like Ken, Ryu, and Chun-Li feel new because of the V-Trigger system. New characters kind of fit in, but overall I was not pleased with some of their designs and stories.  Basically:  Gameplay-wise 8/10: Its solid, runs fine, no major issues. Characters are fun. Its a solid street fighter game. Gamemode-wise 5/10: Online is buggy, story mode won't keep you on the game long (See my game time which includes some training mode time). No way to spend your fight money earned in story mode yet, so you'll be sitting till March to use it.  Bottom line: If you really like the series, get it and pray the servers get fixed. If you are somewhat of a fan or you want to get into the series but aren't sure, come back in march and check how stuff is.  ",

That being said it follows the history of Capcom Street Fighter releases so here is a short summary of what you are going to get.  The Good  - The Fighting: No seriously this is easily one of the best Street fighters released. The actual fighting is fast and fun and extremely well-polished. If you are a fan of the SF series you will feel right at home and if you’re new it one of the easiest and cleanest Street Fighters to start with.   -The Characters: Every character is unique, interesting and pretty well balanced. They have a great and unique cast this time around bringing a lot of veterans back, some fresh faces, and some fun surprises. The small cast is also great for learning match ups, and experimenting with playstyles, and learning the game.   -How it Runs: 60FPS, 0 Sound glitches, Beautiful graphics. This one is simple, it runs and it runs damn well. Can't ask for much more there.  -Training Mode: In short, it’s what you've always wanted in training mode. Lab time has never been more rewarding.   The Bad  - There isn't much there: This is many peoples biggest complaint right now for good reason. 12 characters, 4 Modes, and a lack of costumes and colors is all you are really getting with your money. Treat it like early access, 60 bucks for more stuff down the road. Story mode is short, a few easy fights and some voice acted cutscenes. No Alts or colors for really anyone. It really is bare bones.   - Controller Support: There is no native controller or fightistick support. You cannot customize your controller settings either. That being said there are 3rd party apps that are very easily to download and use in order to connect with your fightstick. After using one I can now launch the game and have no problems using my stick.   The Ugly  -Server Issues: Servers are unstable at the time of writing this. Online matches are hard to connect to and can be very laggy and unusable. On top of that fight money to unlock the characters coming in the coming months are un-earnable right now due to the online connection problems. Hopefully this will get fixed soon.  In Summary  Regardless of its problems this is easily one of the best technical fighting games and one of the best Street Fighters Capcom has released. From the pure fighting aspect this game will not disappoint you. Its launch has been sketchy but hey it’s better that vanilla SF4.",

Each character is well balanced and only a few match-ups are strongly oneside (Zangief vs Dhalsim) which is a hallmark of a great fighting game. The new v mechanics are well designed and help make each character feel truly unique. The execution skills required are very friendly to new comers compared to past entries.  The netcode is mostly fantastic with a few occasional issues with rollback. Match making during the early stages of a game always lead to occasional skill mismatches but from what I can see that shouldn't be the case once more of the good players continue to ascend the ranks and the many different leagues become more evenly populated.  The character background stories are fine, nothing special. Short, easy matches to help give you the background of the character you're interested in and unlock a story oriented costume (you'll still have to buy this costume in the store, once the store is open). Survival is beatable, there were issues early in the release because of the server issues which have been largely eliminated. Survival could be alot better, the need to use each costume for each character to unlock all possible color options is frustrating. Survival also has entirely too many matches of disparate skill levels.  With free updates coming (new characters, new story and challenge modes) I can't help but be excited. If you're new to fighting games and have a desire to play multiplayer (not playing multiplayer is like playing a CoD game just for the story, the multiplayer is the real meat of the game) I strongly recommend this game.",

Game looks nice  Plays Well: If you played USF4 then you kinda know what your getting into. Game on the surface feels similar but the more you play the more the difference come out.   Lots of promise: Capcom is looking to support this game long term and there are 6 characters promised. No matter how you feel about the pay/grind gate, this game looks like its going to have a lot of characters and be supported for a while, and hey, that costs money guys.  The game shows hope now but still needs time. Its a fun play but...  Cons:   Long loading time for online play: Once you find an oppenent the game will essentailly freeze for about 20 -30 seconds sometimes a bit longer before launching you into online match.   Matching can(rarely for me) be a bit laggy: Honestly not a huge problem for me but occasionally you will come against someone who seems to have bad internet and they'll lag. Seems better then SF4 though.  Online Lobbys 2 Man until March: Probably for server stability or otherwise haven't built out all the features yet but online lobbies are limited to 2 people. There is not spectator option. Only really a problem if you have a bunch of friends you want to play with.  Limited Single Player Options: The story is not yet fully completed will take about 2 hours to complete all the missions for all 16 characters. After that your left with survival and training. Survival is just match after match and is used to unlock bonus colors, and training is training.   Over all I think the game shows some promise. Given a few months the game will be filled out and it most if not all my complaints will be address. I'll try and remember to update this review in march.",

Now this would be forgivable if there wasnt so much else missing from this game. There are only a handful of stages, theres no AI versus mode. The only way to battle AI is in the training mode. In order to play versus mode you MUST have a second controller. 1P controller, and 2P keyboard isnt even an option. Theres no cinematic storymode. It will be added for no extra charge later however, but thats not until June. The shop hasnt opened in game either. There is also no arcade mode. As far as online goes there is supposed to be 8 player lobbies, but they are not available yet. Extra costumes still have yet to be available as well. Of course the larger lobbies, extra costumes, and shop will all be opened sometime in March.

That's not to say there are no single player modes in the game but compared to other fighters available, it does seem a bit lacking. There is a story mode which is enjoyable enough as long as you don't take it too seriously and then there is Vs CPU and survival mode. There are rumours of an arcade mode possibly being added in the future but who knows if it will actually happen. I do think that Capcom will continue to add new characters, stages and costumes to the game each year similar to what they have done during 2016 and will do this for the lifespan of Street Fighter V.  Ultimately with Street Fighter it comes down to whether you enjoy playing against other people. If you do and you like the characters in the Street Fighter universe then this game will certainly last a long time.",

            "review_text": "If you actually like playing fighting games competitively, Street Fighter 5 has fixed a huge number of the issues with 4's gameplay. The V skill and V trigger systems enforce a level of uniquity for each character in a similar way to the Drive mechanic in Blazblue. Unintended mechanics that became overwhelmingly prolific in SF4 such as crouch tech are removed, and the game has a hard priority system which tie breaks when moves would normally trade in SF4, encouraging the use of normals other than lights. Light normals also confirm into less. There is a 3 frame buffer that makes impractical links a thing of the past, and the crush counter system ensures you are aptly rewarded for respecting your opponent's DP or going for the risky counter hit. The new characters are all interesting and fun to play (extra special shoutouts to Fang, a character with an extremely unique keepaway playstyle revolving around poison that clears if you successfully attack him, and Rashid, who breaks a number of the series' established rules, having multiple ways to change trajectory in the air and a dash with no fixed distance from which he can attack), and the game is graphically a lot more pleasing than 4, if still a little behind most AAA games. Don't let poor steam reviews decieve you, it's captivated the genre's fans, and has already broken the record for most sign ups at the biggest fighting game tournament of all, Evo. Rollback netcode has done wonders for the game, and while those on poor connections might have a bad experience in neutral, lag will no longer fear with your combos or wakeup game (unless you're connected to the internet by carrier pigeon).  However, if you find competitive fighting games difficult to penetrate or don't want to put down the large amount of time required to learn them, there's little for you here. That's not me trying to be insulting, there's factually no worthwhile learning tools for concepts beyond basic controls, or anything to appeal to audiences that aren't experienced with the genre. Lacking proper single player options or even a decent tutorial (with the promise that these are coming later), this game was clearly rushed out for the existing fighting game community to be ready for the Capcom tournament season. Story mode is a rushed demo of the full story which won't be in the game until June, and survival mode is an uninteresting grind.  Recommended for stellar multiplayer experience (in terms of both gameplay and online infrastructure) and a fresh and inspired take on a beloved franchise, but if that alone isn't worth £45 to you, you should skip.",

            "review_text": "While this new installment of Street Fighter did not come with all the standard content that the previous games did on release day, the core gameplay itself is very solid. However, at the time of writing this, they have added quite a bit of content and continue to do so. There is a fully fledged story mode which takes a 1~2 hours to complete (provided you don't skip any cutscenes). They've added challenges/missions to help players to gain in-game currency a little faster. There are 6 more characters added to the original roster and will continue to add more over time. There new stages and also added the promised stage transitions for each stage. I don't believe there are currently any balance changes at the moment as they seem to be focused on adding content, but I'm sure they will shift that focus to balance changes once they feel there is substantial content.  I have mixed feelings about how the game handles network play. Unlike the USF4, it uses roll back. While roll back does not greatly interrupt the input of your commands/combos, the downside is that you may see some 'teleporting' if you do not have a very good connection with your opponent. If you do have a good connection with your opponent, then for the most part, it's very playable with either little to no 'lag/teleporting'. Technology has come a long way and has allowed games that emphasize lag-free play to play with others around the world. While it's not currently perfect, I think it's a great achievement thus far and eventually will improve over time as we discover better ways to code the networking. Don't expect to be lag-free if you're playing against someone from the other side of the world. We're just not there yet.  I only recommend this game if you are a fan of fighting games as it really does not appeal to casuals. In most cases, casuals are probably looking to play the story mode/AI and play with their friends only. That's not to say that they shouldn't purchase the game, but they probably won't appreciate/enjoy the game as much as hardcore fighting game fans would. If you like competitive gaming and want a challenge, this is probably for you as this has a high skill cap and a steep learning curve.",

If they fix the complete waste of time that is survival mode I would reccomend this game. It being hard is not my complaint. It is that it wastes your time.   Example: In normal survival mode, fights 1-25 are easy, but you hit 25-30 and the difficulty ramps up hugely. So fights 1-25 just feel like a waste of time. If you lose on fight 29, you have to start all over again because its survival. Seriously, balance out the difficulty. I shouldn't be able to win fights 1-25 with crouching heavy kick. Then lose in some fight between 25-30 because the computer suddenly blocks, counters, punishes, and combos. It is the most jarring and frustrating part of survival mode.   Not to mention the fact that you have to be connected to the server while playing it or it doesn't count. Imagine getting to level 48 in hard survival mode, and disconnecting from the server. That is a lot of time wasted.",

            "review_text": "The core game is good (this is Street Fighter after all), however this release is so barebones (and the few modes featured in the game so poorly implemented) that I would not recommend purchasing it for at least a few months until Capcom has hopefully gotten their ♥♥♥♥ together and fixed everything.  One of the features in the launch version of the game is an extremely short story mode with costumes that you 'unlock' but can only use in story mode until a future update, at which point you will have to purchase them using in game currency. There's also a survival mode where you battle computer controlled opponents for a set number of matches in order to unlock colors for the character you complete the mode with. This is a poor substitute for arcade mode as it takes muuuuuuuuuch longer to get through. This is the first fighting game that has required grinding.  The online was barely functional at launch, and, though a little better now, is still horribly implemented. For example, there is no punishment for ragequitting. There was a sweet spot of about a week between when they fixed the unplayable launch servers and when people started realizing it was punishment free to disconnect. As of now I get rage disconnects on about 30-50% of matches I am about to win.  There is a Battle Lounge which you can use to invite friends or other players to battle. This would be where I spent the majority of my time if it weren't for the fact that the netcode in this game is horrible so my friends and I all experience constant rollback and framedrops when playing with eachother. I've spent more time troubleshooting this than should be necessary as I have fantastic ping in every other game I play with them.  Aside from the above mentioned modes, there's also a basic training mode.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I am reviewing this game after the release of the September update. I didn't buy this game during it's release, because I heard a lot of criticisms of this game including: lacking contents, no Arcade Mode, and awful online multiplayer. I bought this game in the summer sales on Steam at June 2016. Anyway, on to the review.  The Good: + Street Fighter 5's roster is not large but quite fantastic it has some playable characters that didn't make it in Street Fighter 4 including: Karin, R.Mika, Alex, and Urien returning in this game as playable characters. + This game's gameplay is great with simple mechanics, easy combos, and it's not hard to pick up for beginner. The V-Trigger is awesome; it grants a character's powerups, unique abilities, etc. for a period of time. + The General Story Mode called, 'A Shadow Falls' is not a bad story mode; it's passable. The cutscenes' animation is used from this game's graphics instead of SF4's terrible anime animation; they look good. This is story mode is a FREE DLC.  The Bad: - The Arcade Mode (the most common mode in any fighting games) is still not in this game as of today. - The Character Story Mode sucks; It's where you play through every playable character's story. They're very short with rushed writing and a few matches to win in order advance the story and the art looks either decent or bad.  The Worst: ~ Juri's SF5 theme is one of the WORST soundtracks I have ever heard in any video games period. It's absolutely garbage compared to her SSF4 theme. ~ On the September update, Capcom released a malware on the PC version called, 'rootkit' (or Capcom.sys). This was Capcom's biggest screw up.  Randomness: This game's online multiplayer is just random; some matches can run good but some can run bad. Even if you battle against your opponent online who has a good 5-Bar signal, the chances are it could run bad. If it runs bad you may run into some slow-downs, skipped frames, and sometimes brief game freeze. I wish Capcom will add the GGPO netcode for this game so that it will make online matches playable. Mortal Kombat XL has GGPO and I heard that it runs very good. Oh, this game also has cross-play feature allowing PC and PS4 owners battle each other online. Nice feature.  Comment(s): I want to criticize this game for not featuring Direct Input and the game has messed up keyboard settings. But fortunately, I downloaded and installed a software called, 'TocaEdit X360 Controller Emulator' that allows Direct Input for any PC games; especially Street Fighter 5. It works great with my old PS3 arcade stick. After you downloaded and installed this game, please get this software immediately. 'Vs. CPU' is finally added in the 'Versus Mode' allowing you to battle against a CPU opponent with selectable difficulty. Thank God.  Verdict: I like Street Fighter 5; it has nice roster and great gameplay. However, I can only recommend Street Fighter 5 for those who play fighting games competitively. So, this game is not for everybody. I'm leaving this review as, 'Not Recommended' for now, since this is Season 1. When Season 2 is released, I don't mind going back to re-review this game again.  Thanks for reading!",

Ranked mode is a disaster of epic proportions with gold tier ♥♥♥♥ lords disconnecting so they can maintain their points.  I also need to add that while the in game shop system was ready to set up to buy things with actual money, they made characters free starting with alex in march, but now that it is being added with the June story mode update, they are now taking those characters away that were free for the duration and putting them behind a paywall, so you heard that right, now everyone who got this reduced content of a fighting game can now pay for those characters that have been free to play since march or grind survival mode to get the fight money needed to unlock them, how's that for spending $60 or $40 or whatever the hell capcom feels is a fair price, you get content that should just be in the game at this point and they lock it behind a paywall until you cough up the digital or real dough.

If you really want to play Street Fighter, it's a franchise best left to consoles due to engineering alone.

So let's move on to the multiplayer.  Multiplayer: Having a television or book close by is a must have, for you'll be spending much time on waiting. By the time of writing this I've played the game 30,2 hrs, and I must have spend atleast 20 hrs of that time on waiting only. It can take anything from 5 to 20 minutes to get a match, if not longer.  Someone might argue that there are not enough new players, So ofcourse there is much waiting, and that it get's easier on higher ranks. By the time of writing this I've reached silver rank ingame, and waiting is still essential part of the multiplayer experience.  Also it would seem to me, that atleast 20% of the ranked game players are lag switchers and / or those people who ragequit to save their league points. Ofcourse that can hardly be blamed on Capcom.   In general:  The fighting mechanics and graphics &amp; music in this game are the only ones that are up to the standard. Unfortunately it does not redeem the other flaws of the game mentioned earlier.   In short: The usual tirade about 'I wanted to like this game, but...'

NO ARCADE MODE !! wait what? NO ARCADE MODE!!!!! - SF is all about the Arcade mode! choosing a character vs a character from another country - seeing this cool animation of the region of the character you're playing against.. that's basically the essence of SF ! weird move by Capcom.  2. Lazy story mode - I'm a fan of manga - but the comics in the story mode are very cheap. not interesting. no deep background of the characters - looks like a temp mode.  3, Online was better on Beta - now that's weird with no need elaborate.   4, Challenge Mode - also .. should have been in the game since day 1 ( which is today) ...   What I do like? Is the new system, feels more friendly ! I wish I could use my PS4 controller with the game but as for now it's not supported so I'm using my XBONE controller.  the graphics are really amazing - great job!!  othet than that I need more to keep me in game longer than an hour, but that's just me,  ",

While Capcom managed to add a large amount of Paid DLC and a security threat - it's unfortunate to say that the game is still plagued by many of the same issues apparent during it's launch. There is still no support for customizing your bindings using a keyboard.  The game breaking stability problem during Online matches is still there. Many matches are unenjoyable due to the models glitching around constantly. The connection filter seem utterly sporadic. Even when set to '5 only' - I still found myself being paired with people on other continents. This raises a few eyebrows since I tested queueing for a ranked match alongside a local friend and the game failed to pair us despite a relatively close LP rating.  They do get some bonus points for actually providing free content like Story Mode, and maybe even Arcade Mode one day.  The vertict still stands: It's a Street Fighter with fewer mechanics and a smaller roster than its predecessor, though it will grow over time. They made it easier for beginners to perform combos due to the removal of 1-frame links. You have to rely on Third-party software to customize bindings if you use a keyboard which isn't that much of a hassle - but it shouldn't be necessary for a AAA-title.  The biggest flaw is the online play. Currently PC players are facing a major issue reportedly caused by either player minimzing out of the game which inflicts a desync that results in models teleporting all over the place. There are also a lot of server downtime, and disconnects are not uncommon.  There's still a lot of content missing, which is scheduled to be released at a later time, but it keeps on being delayed.  It's absolutely not worth its current price unless you're a huge Street Fighter fan.",

I understand, Capcom tried to bring normal (casuals) players to street fighter universe but what they displayed in street fighter 5 is absolutely unjustifiable.   There is no challenging mode or trial, that would teach you basics and advanced stuff. If you want to learn another character you need to stick to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu and training mode.  What they actually did, is that you can faceroll your controller and throw amazing,super,mega combos. Just like in tekken. Or soul calibur.  This is just my opinion, but if you wanted to throw flashy/higher damaging combos in previous street fighter titles, you needed to spent your portion of time. Not anymore. Here comes the new call of fighter 12.   There are numerous other things, like holding neutral ground, poking, footsies etc.. It seems like nobody was thinking about these mechanics too much. Or maybe the actual character rooster is too small to see any kind of exicting stuff. Compated to previous titles it just seems.. boring.    Im not going to mention the utterly broken, unfinished stuff like rage quitting without being penalized. Was is so hard to implement automatic lose to player who will leave in middle of the match? Just like every other multiplayer game has it?   The most funny thing on this is how capcom are trying to throw responsibilty on their playerbase. What a great idea. Street fighter 5 playerbase fall into category of infamous league of legends community.   TLDR: if you are tired of Street fighter 4, then with SF5 you can have a little bit of fun. Especially at home, with some friends, just chilling and beating each other. Is it worth 60 euros? Hell, no.  + solid, fitting soundtrack (especially some stages!) + Crossplay   - dumbed mechanics of game - zero singleplayer content (survival is not game mode, its a time consuming trap for innocent players) - Capcom being Capcom - everything else ",

While this may seem like a bargain, I didn't realize that at least 4 characters and fight stage arenas are hidden behind a paywall. I don't want to buy this game at a discount just to end up spending more money trying to get the rest of the content. I feel like Capcom should have done more to make things right with regular consumers like myself. I understand that the focus of this game was at 'tournament' players from the onset - but Capcom never advertised it that way. Almost a 1/2 year later, and I still feel like it makes more sense to just save your money and watch this on Twitch.   For those of you who don't care about spending money, the game actually feels pretty damn good on PC despite the limited content. I was able to pick up and use my Elite controller without issue and I even won a few matches before requesting the refund. The netcode is pretty good - I didn't notice continous problems like I thought I would. The cross play between PS4 and PC players is interesting and ensures you will be able to find a match online (or at least while EVO is being broadcast). Turning this up to 1440p resolution is an absolute visual treat - the artwork in this game definitely deserves praise.   In conclusion, buy this game if you are a fan of the series and want to kick someone's ♥♥♥ online after a long day of working in your cubicle for less money than you are worth. However, understand that Capcom is not doing you a favor - you still have to pay extra for all the characters and Lord only knows where you can download extra character costumes. With enough points, you can also earn characters through playing the game for free; however, realistically that ♥♥♥♥ takes forever. If someone did manage to earn enough points to buy the DLC characters for free, please let the world know how you exercised that amount of patience!",

Especially 4 was a long time favorite for about 5 years, and i had great experiences with that brilliant game. Unlike Street Fighter V, it was a complete game for me.   Crapcom wanted to bring 'THE' Fighting Game, which was considered to be a long timer like Street Fighter IV was.  By its current state, I think that even a game like Shaq Fu would do better.  Lets start off by mentioning the 'Story' mode.  The story mode is one of the perfect examples of crampcom being lazy as ♥♥♥♥.  There are 3 enemys for each character, and some pictures related to their story. I mean Capcom, I know you focused on the Game itself and not on the Story, but atleast show that you tried.  For anyone who enjoyed playing Arcade in SFIV, you wont be enjoying this.  The worst of the game is the 'Survival' mode. I mean, this mode is just pure cancer. You have to put a ton of time into playing against the AI opponent you can crush easily, and get colours for each character that depend on the difficulty you play. If you want to know more about this crazy fun mode read some other reviews, I am not in the mood to describe this mode. Its just a punch to the face to any Street Fighter Fan.   Instead of allowing the Ranked Match Lobbys like in SFIV, you now have to configure your 'Battle Settings' with your favorite Character, Stage and so on. I mean Capcom wtf. Who of you guys came up with this great idea of leaving the Lobbys behind us and replace them for this ♥♥♥♥ system?   Gotta say i had no laggs though. BUT about 5 times of playing 15 games, the Server wont send any results of my matches and I didnt get any points whatsoever..   Lets go on with the bad things, for me personally I think the combos are way to flat and boring. Comparing it to the Combo System in SFIV is a joke, I mean i understand that it was made to get new players to play the game better but seriously, I feel like every character has like 2-3 Combos. The V-Trigger combos  aren't interesting for me at all. You arent even able to link a cr. lp to a cr. mp, which has been completely normal in SFIV but in SFV you can't. I dont see the logic here. FADC Combos in SFIV really showed off your skill, and made the Game quite interesting. That is not the case here.  All in all, dont buy this game at its current state thank you crampcom for messing up a long awaited game everyone was absolutely hyped about.",

Now that I've approached it in a different way, I can recommend it but only to a specific group of people.  ONLY get this game if you can get it cheap (physical copies go for £20-£30, I managed to get it for £25) and/or only get it if your style of play is solely multiplayer. If you got this for single player, you will be extremely disappointed.  I like fighting games but I'm usually pretty bad at them and never try to learn them... ever so I don't tend to go online and always stick to local or single player. Street Fighter V changed that in a way for me as I just wanted to get the most out of the game and the fact that I can't afford the season pass for characters so I depend solely on fight money. Online is fun and it honestly has gotten better. I still get the awful match now and again but that's more down to the connection between both players. The netcode has improved since my last review and I am getting games a lot faster. If you're still getting bad games, you could always use the lobby system. You don't get fight money but you're assured of a good connection. The matchmaking, however, is garbage. I played today at Bronze rank and fought super bronze which is okay but I did so terribly, I went down to Rookie and I still was getting Super Bronze, some with triple my LP. This seriously needs to be fixed. I also wish there was a character select screen for ranked and casual rather than changing your 'favourite character' on your profile every time you wanna play someone different but I guess it isn't an issue if you don't have any secondaries.  Other than that, the graphics are fine, the mechanics are solid (Balance is sort of an issue. Expect to see a thousand Nashes and Karins online) and Capcom are listening to their fans... slowly but surely. There's still barely anything regarding single player content (the main story mode they brought out a month or so ago can be beaten in about 3 hours and has a dreadful story) but again, only buy this if it's on the cheap or if you think you will really get into the meta game... or you know, you could buy Street Fighter IV.

I'm just going to focus on the online because otherwise listing all the ♥♥♥♥ wrong with this game would take too long.   This game's online is a complete disaster. The matchmaking takes 5-10 minutes to find an opponent, and when you're starting out you can expect them to be several leagues higher than you. The skill of your opponent typically doesn't matter, because even if you filter matchmaking to only accept 5 bar connections, they will usually end up lagging anyway.  The netcode is absolutely atrocious. They saw the success of GGPO and tried to imitate with their own rollback netcode, but the execution failed horribly. You can try to hit confirm then get counter hit because the game rolled back the first hit. My favorite was when I got hit with an uppercut in the middle of a throw animation.  Even if you get a stable match, the inherent problems with the gameplay are still present. The game has 8 frames of input lag so 'offline will feel the same as online', but this is 8 frames of always-present input lag in addition to whatever input lag you get from being online. You literally cannot block some things on reaction. This leaves the game feeling sluggish, and reacting to moves or punishing is almost impossible. You will constantly input moves that will either come out late, resulting in a counter hit, or won't come out at all. Also get used to learning new meaty timings every single game, because they will be completely different depending on your opponent.  If you like fighting games then just wait, Capcom will fix this game eventually, Third Strike and Ultra are two of the greatest fighting games ever, but right now V is a complete ♥♥♥♥ show.  Also, this game was made in 2016 and doesn't have a borderless option. If you attempt to launch it with borderless through steam it will most likely crash frequently.",

Only Xinput controllers work (For anyone who doesn't know, this means that only Xbox 360 controllers will work. PC controllers, PS4 Controllers, or any other kind of gamepad are not supported. This isn't an issue for me, but it's absolutley unbelievable). - Keyboard controls can't be rebound. - Keyboard is permenantly registered as 'Player 1', meaning that you can't play locally together with one person on keyboard and one person on controller. - The game runs BEST at your screen's native resolution. Anything less and the game lags (what???). - The game lags in windowed mode for seemingly no reason (I've got a R9 390, this is NOT a hardware issue). - Alt-Tab breaks the game view when you return and puts bars all over your screen. - The above three issues mean you can't do anything else on your system EXCEPT play the game.

If your controller is not X360/XOne you'll have to work around with joy2key and binding buttons to keyboard keys - No Steam UI support (cannot invite or join game, very clunky and slow to navigate ingame menus have to be used instead) - Menus/load screens (such as characters facing off before match) may drop to 30 fps even if your rig can run the match at stable 60.

            "review_text": "The launch of Street Fighter V was an unmitigated disaster. With my arcade stick hooked up and ready to go, I faced my first challenge on my road to becoming a world champion: getting past the User Agreement screen. The game would not respond to my joystick inputs, so figuring I had to pass the screen to get into an options menu and enable it, I tried using my keyboard to get past the legalese threshold guardian. The arrow keys worked, but hitting 'Enter' would not advance the game. I'm lucky enough to have a second arcade stick, so I plugged that in. No dice. The mouse fared no better, so I fell back on years of gaming experience and proceeded to press every key on the keyboard. Finally, I was making progress. Protip: it's 'B'.   This was the first stumbling block in a comedy of errors. Turns out neither fight stick I own is supported even though Windows certainly recognizes them as functional. Bold move for a fighting game. Then I got to witness the joys of launch day server problems: they didn't work, either. Granted this is unfortunately common, but Street Fighter V is a game with next to no fallback plan for when the online portion is out of commission. There are a few (very few) single player options, but if you're not connected to Capcom's servers you're not earning “fight money”, the game's currency for buying future DLC characters and costumes. I say “future” because right now the Store option is blacked out, promising to open at a later date. So what that fight money is actually worth... who knows? The game isn't interested in telling you. It's not interested in telling you many things, actually...   So, despite not racking up Capcom funny money, I decided to dive into the few options available to me, starting with the Story mode. You could easily confuse this to mean Arcade mode, but don't get your hopes up. What's on offer is almost hilariously awful. Almost. I've played enough fighting game stories at this point to appreciate some cheese, but Street Fighter V's Story Mode is offensively bad to the point I had to skip most of the “cutscenes”. And by “cutscenes”, I mean static, hand drawn illustrations that appear to drawn by a middle grade student who checked out a “How to Draw Anime” book from the library. It's bad, and the story and dialogue aren't much better. Each fighter is tasked to complete roughly three one round fights, starting with full meters, in what has to be the easiest of Easy difficulty settings with no option to tweak any settings. This mode lasted all of an hour.   What caught my eye next was a Training mode that promised numerous different options to hone your skills. I adored the training mode in Street Fighter IV, so I was looking forward to hopping in and challenging myself to some combos. Nope. It's just a dummy AI mode where you can set the CPU to different states. No combo lists or actual training of any kind. There's not even a VS CPU mode, so all that was left on my plate was Survival, which is easily the strongest of the offline offerings. Here you fight through a set number of CPU opponents depending on your difficulty setting, and spend the points you earn through winning matches on “supplements” which range from health gains to offense, defense, and meter boosts. If you're trying to practice anything else besides health boosts kind of screw up the game, but it's better than nothing.   Days later, the servers seem to be somewhat functional so I've been playing Survival mode with Fight Requests turned on... because there's not a whole lot else to do in the game. Every now and then I even get to fight online, and sometimes it's playable. For a test I set aside an hour to gauge my success: Ranked requests on, all platforms, regions, skill levels. In that hour, I had a whopping one match come up against a fine fighter named PoopyPoopFarts. To the game's credit the match was very smooth. After that hour, another fight popped, but it was laggy to the point of unplayability and got disconnected after about thirty seconds. Going into straight Ranked matchmaking is painful, staring at a spinning wheel for three to ten minutes on average, and about two thirds of those games ran very poorly as well.   The core mechanics of Street Fighter V seem okay. I find them simple, but I'm not a hardcore fighting fanatic so any depth beyond generic strategies and spamming specials is lost on me, and it's too much to ask the game to actually teach you anything in-game, apparently. There are promises of a true Arcade mode, challenges, and loads of “free” content coming to Street Fighter V in the future, and who knows? Maybe this game will be a complete package someday down the line. As it is now, it feels rushed, unfinished, and outright broken in many cases. The problem with waiting for these updates is the game was released as a full priced product, and by the time those updates roll out there will be better, more complete games already released (there are already plenty), so I don't know who this game is for. Not me, anyway.",

(this is just sheer laziness on the part of Capcom, with nothing to do with hardware capability.) With PC titles, there seems to be no such thing as lazy inefficient codes, just underpowered systems.  Speaking of laziness, the free-hand sketchbook cartoon style from the storyboard art just screams rush job and even then Capcom couldn't give us a complete arcade mode experience upon release, and it seems that we may be forced to buy what should have been integrated into the title as DLCs. At this point, aside from the graphical and online server bugs, the so called game is so stripped down that it should be called a demo.

This game feels like Early Access.  TL;DR - Wait until it's on sale and/or been patched more. I want to like this game but Capcom are making it difficult.",

PC community has always been big on modding, and of course they restricted it. I can understand why, but how they executed it is just awful. The best way to do implement it is to implement it the exact same way Techland did for Dying Light. There should be an option for modding. Where modders will only be able to play with modders, and not with PS4 and Vanilla Users. Sadly they don't see that. Instead they try releasing a Rootkit (which at most time is considered a backdoor for viruses.) Apparently they took it off to avoid legal trouble but the damage has already been done.   Now am I saying its a bad game? No. In fact, I love the game and still prefer it over other mainstream fighting games (Except for tekken and guilty gear). And it's helluva lot better than Mortal Kombat. But I can't say I recommend it. Or at least for full price. I would say this. It's a great game to start fighting games, but do yourself a favor. Just wait for a better rerelease of the game.   At that time, like always, the game would be fixed, everything would be present and you get your money's worth.",

There is no arcade mode, survival mode doesn't have any real feel of progress to it like arcade mode, it just feels like something to do.  In versus mode, you cannot fight a CPU, only another human player. The story mode is more of a “prologue” mode and there's no way to increase the difficulty since it is too easy, and that's coming from a novice. I haven't really tried the online mode because I know I'll get my butt kicked, but from what I read and heard, online performance is poor.

The more people play it the more money they make therefore they have totally simplified the gameplay to widen the player base and basically stuck two fingers up at the loyal fanbase who didn't mind investing time and effort into perfecting moves and combos and were prepared embark on a steep learning curve (or what i call a journey) to become technically proficent. Thats where the real reward is and where Ultra SFIV really excelled.  This is a game made for 4year old and upwards and all the bugbrains who couldn't do the moves or combos in the previous game.  This game is pathetic and is plagued by technical issues.  This game is a joke and is an early Access game This game is laughable and is ridiculously overpriced This game is the worst unfinished game ever and has about 17 Characters This game is the worst Street Fighter game ever This game is cartoonish nonsense and is made for people who watch Nickolodeon/ CBeebies This game is an insult to all real hardcore Street Fighter fans because the gameplay is just not there!  Capcom i'm sure have a truckload of DLC ready to be released bit by bit for this game and are planning to drag it out for as long as possible to keep the money roilling in for themselves but i will certainly not be wasting another penny on it.

I preordered the game, and as an avid fan of fighting games, I really wanted to love it.  1. NO XINPUT SUPPORT. I need to use joy2key to play with my controller, by mapping my stick to the keyboard controls. The keyboard controls which I cannot change. This means that I cannot play with my friend, who typically play on keyboard, or have PS4 controllers, which also do not work natively. (Reminder, Skullgirls, a fighting game which you can get on sale for $1, instantly recognized my stick, as well as any other controller we threw at it.)  2. NO PUNISHING RAGE QUITTING. People can and will disconnect from you all the time, to avoid a loss. This is because Capcom has no way to tell who actually disonnected, due to their horrible netcode.  3. DLC IS A SCAM. We were very excited when this game was announced, as Capcom said they would be implementing a store in which you can buy DLC characters with in game currency, instead of forking over $20-$40 for a new edition. However, basically the only way to get enough of this in game currency to buy anything is by completing their extremely broken and boring 'survival mode' which takes the place of a proper arcade mode. Fortunately, PC users can cheat to complete survival, something which Capcom is helpless to prevent. Anyway, most of the DLC is only available for purchase with real money, so its almost a moot point.  Maybe check back in a year to see if Capcom has figured their game out, but this is an incredible waste of money, even on sale to be honest.",

I love fighting games and I have played most modern fighters (Street Fighter, Tekken, Smash 4, etc) in an effort to become well-trained and to, as the community so eloquently puts it, 'git gud.'   All of this being said, I cannot, just  cannot  recommend this game to anyone who is a casual player.   Street Fighter V, upon its initial release, lacked little to no content for roping in a new casual playerbase. That's strange considering that that was one of their main goals with SFV. Capcom wanted to bring in new players, competitive or not, to produce mass sales for the game and also perhaps expose the general public to fighting game tournaments as well. Those who weren't really interested in the competitive scene could slowly be introduced to Capcom Pro Tour (CPT) and perhaps even be molded to be competitive players. Capcom failed to do this, however, by not even giving the simplest of features such as CPU versus or even the classic arcade mode.   Every other aspect that recognizes the competitiveness of the game is completely fine and actually very well-made. The netplay can be a little wonky here and there, but other than that returning cast members have been reimagined in unique and exciting ways while some stayed pretty much the same. New original characters are fun and not too overbearing. And with future DLC characters, the roster is ever-expanding for at least the next few years.  All of this being said, I can't bring my heart to recommend this game to anyone who isn't looking to be competitive no matter how much time I put into it. The release was a mess and Capcom, almost 5 months later, are just now getting around to adding some solo modes to the game, including the story mode. There's also the lack of communication on their end (and in their defense they have gotten better at it), but I don't really blame them for that. That's more of a part of Japanese culture when it comes to video games, it seems.   Overall, for competitive players, the game is probably a solid 8/10. For casual players, I can't even really give it a score. All I can say is to stay away and give it a proper year or so to develop, maybe even just look for it when there's a price drop or a sale. If you're looking for some type of casual fighting game on PC, I'd recommend  Rivals or Aether,  a very fun Super Smash Bros. style game.",

The story mode took me about 25 minutes to fully complete with EVERY character. The art content within that story mode looks like it was drawn by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. It only has a two person lobby so if I had other friends who wanted to spectate and learn new moves in a 4 person lobby, that won't be happening... why would we need that in the game? The character roster is extremely underwhelming, survival mode to unlock color swaps is boring and you can't even VS a cpu in a standard match?! WHAT?! The games just rushed, it's still in beta mode and everybody I slaughter in ranked just disconnects and I gain zero progress. Once again this game is currently garbage. It might get better down the line but for a 60 dollar title it is not worth it. I am thankful I got it on sale or else this review would consist of far more derogatory lingo.",

And I decide to give it a 'Not Recemmend' for this reason. I mean, Capcom should have done better at such details. I'm devoted willing to explore this brand new system and gameplay if it's not the hinder of input. However, Capcom just kills passion. I will come back and give 10 'Recommend's once the input issue has been solved. Before that, let's just watch. PS. the invitation feature is totally incompatible with steam's friend system.

Keep in mind, Capcom is the same company that put on-disc DLC for SFxTekken to milk you for all your money, and now they are doing it again charging you $60 for an alpha-build that requires additional purchases of DLC characters and stages that should already be in the game in the first place. That's right, you are actually paying for STAGES now too, and people still defend this company.   Ranked matchmaking is just unacceptable... takes way too long to find a match and it usually connects you with people halfway across the world in an unplayable teleporting lagfest. You also don't lose points for ragequitting in a ranked match, which is beyond pathetic and completely nullifies the point of a ranked system and leaderboard. Imagine a competitive game where you can just quit a match right before you lose and not be penalized, yeah it just doesn't happen... only in this cheap unfinished product masquerading under the charade of being an e-sports game. The actual gameplay is decent, but it is also lackluster because the hard one-frame combos, vortexes, setups, and mixups from USF4 were completely pruned from the game to make it more accessible to new players.   If you find this game for anywhere between $1-$10, buy it and try it out.

Pros: -One of the most solid fighting games in terms of mechanics on the market. It's a bit of a departure from 4 but depending on what you want from the game that can be a good or a bad thing. -Decent character roster. With the exception of F.A.N.G. who seems to have a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ moveset (demonstrated by the fact that in 6 hours I have not fought one single person using him online) the rest of the characters old and new are fun and varied. -The optimisation on my PC at least seems excellent. The game can hold 60fps with no noticable dips with all settings maxed on my i5 and GTX670. -Being able to unlock future characters which would otherwise be DLC through in game currency.  Cons: -Fight Money is not called Bison Dollars. -There is no store currently available for me to spend my 200,000 Fight Moneys in. -The story modes available for each character are frankly pathetic. When it was anounced to be a mode comparable to MK9/10's story modes which were a good few hours long each with nice in-engine cutscenes and all the fancy trimmings I got excited. What you actually get when you begin a 'Story' is a well drawn still image for a minute or so while one of the voice actors says a few lines, then another still image for another minute or two with some more lines, then another, repeat ad nauseum for every single 'cutscene' for every character. I got bored after the first two and just skipped them all for every single character which left me with 2-3 fights for each character taking me a total of 48 minutes to complete the story mode. Before you say that doesn't count because I skipped cutscenes, I say a collection of 30 still images is not what was advertised. -The netcode while better, is still not great. Even having restricted my search options to only the most compatible connections available I still get matches with opponents teleporting around me, random slowdown mid-match and depending on the time of day wait times up to several minutes to even find a game. -The servers flat out were not working on launch. This is unacceptable for a AAA game and even though it is the norm it leaves a bitter taste.  -PC version is not compatible with any PS3/4/non-xbox sticks. This was a huge disappointment when I plugged in my Qanba Q1 and it simply didn't function. There are programs you can use to fix it such as x360ce but with probably the biggest and most historic fighting game franchise in the world you simply shouldn't have to! -The game is generally lacking in other game modes. While to my knowledge SF games generally have at least a few different options for minigames and different things to do, in SFV there is no challenge mode, no minigames, you are limited to versus, story and a 30 match endurance/time attack mode.  Basically the whole game feels like they put time into the actual fighting, but everything else is pretty terrible and feels very cheap.",

Pls be ware of the Capcom.sys in your System32 folder :D  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Please consider this is only my opinion :) If you are a fan of Street Fighter buy it and built your own mind. Actually the gameplay isnt that bad at all. Oke it is not a very defensive based street fighter but it makes fun if you get used to it. But all the major issues with all around the gameplay doesnt let you have any fun.  Thankx for reading and sorry if there are some mistakes :)",

Without season pass the amount of grind you have to do to buy the characters is considerable.  They now added the cinematic story mode which is about 2-3 hours of entertainment. it is fun. Worth $10-15 of the price (it is free). It is a step in the good direction for Capcom.  You will have to buy costumes with fight money or real money. You cannot buy ALL costumes with fight money (some are premium and currently only purchasable with real money -- and this is bad!). Very few stages, (8 maybe) and they have released a couple more -- one of them a daylight version of an existing one -- that you will need to spend currency on to get.  And all their 3D models clip :( but that's a minor annoyance.  If you don't care about that, then feel free to buy the game - it IS fun and mechanics are ok. Otherwise it seems rather expensive to have to pay extra for 'premium skins' considering the amount of money you dumped initially, even if you decide to not buy the season pass.",

But once i went for multiplayer, speed of the game became much faster and it became very hard to start any move, even i took the time to get used to the speed.  After consultinh 'Dr. Google' i learnt that there is a kind of frameskip happening in multiplayer to keep the speed up, which makes it kind of impossble to get any move right.  I mean my rig (i7 /8gb /gtx880) can handle witcher 3 and other newer games in good quality, so i am surprised it can handle this game even in low.

SFV lacks classic arcade mode, what means the only option while you wait for a an human opponent is to play survival mode, which isn´t great fun.  Gameplay completely favours offensive play, so hundreds of players who enjoy defensive play will not get any enjoyment. Blocking is punished really hard with a system that will transform all blocked damage into effective damage once you get hit once. Just look online for some videos of pros playing it, you see this clearly. Defensive players get smashed by offensive players even with a big skill gap between them.  I think this is what Capcom meant with the 'that both beginners and veterans can enjoy' in the description. Button mashing is, for the first time, effective in a SF game.  I wanted to enjoy it. I grew up playing this series, but simply can´t find enjoyment in SFV.",

They can claim all they want that everything can be unlocked for free, but the system in place makes that an impossibility without grinding for thousands of hours.  The actual fighting system is a major step backwards. Everyone can agree Focus Attack was a mistake (and a shoddy knockoff of GG's Roman Cancel), but now there is a grand total of two defensive options that have any amount of reliability whatsoever. What is to be done when there is no counterplay once put on the defense? Nothing, apparently.  The graphics are nothing special.  The balancing is sort of there, at least, in the same way that Smash can be sort of considered balanced.  I guess if you like spamming throws and having only maybe 3 to 4 useful moves per character, this is the game for you. It also heavily favors 50/50s, 33/33/33s, and even 25/25/25/25s, so even the most unskilled players can crush people as long as they make their opponents guess wrong.   If you want to play something GOOD instead, play Guilty Gear Xrd.  2/10 for at least trying to be 3rd Strike without any of the fun.",

            "review_text": "While I have never wrote a bad review for a game, this will be my first. I am looking back at street fighter 4. A game that had lots of Offline content you could play by yourself and an excellent online environment.  THE GOOD   So lets start with the good in this game. Fighting wise everything seems really tight and refined. There is quite a bit of depth and a long road to mastery for the characters. I like all of them, they all look absolutely awesome. Basically at it's foundation it's a rock solid fighting game. Visual effects are very nice, Hit boxes seem to be fair. Inputs are precise, although take getting used to from other fighting games. Moves in them selves are easy to do. It gets much harder when you string them together, which is part of where the depth comes from.  The characters seem quite varied and so far balanced. I really have no complaints for the actual 'fighting' in the game.   THE BAD   The servers are just horrible. They have crashed quite a bit. Which you may say, that's fine, I'll just play offline instead. Well here is where things begin to suck. So first off any offline activity that rewards Exp/fight money ie Story/Survival. Will no longer help you progress your account as all rewards gains of such nature are disabled. Considering what I've heard that some costumes (story mode ones) cost 40,000 fight money and new characters cost 100,000 each. I'd say you are missing out on a lot.  It gets EVEN better. Say you are playing survival mode right? You are just killin it and you are just about to beat it. Well lol guess what the servers just went down. So that means it will rip you out of that mode and made everything you just did all for not. I found that to be extremely frustrating especially as a relatively new player. I never got into street fighter 4 simply because I had that soul calibur addiction. That said the abysmall amount of single player content just sucks.  I like to be competitive but at the same time I'd like more bang for my buck. Most games have story mode. Street fighter's story mode is a joke. 2-4 rounds at max. By that I mean say you pick ryu. You fight chun li ONE round, you win, then you fight ken or something 1 round. You win, end of story. It's that stupid. Why even add it?   The tutorial is garbage. If you haven't ever played street fighter it is going to give you part of the basics. It doesn't tell you how to use EX version of moves, there is no explanation for the effects of certain moves, nothing. So it's not very beginner friendly. I get that it's street fighter 5 (or whatever number in the series) That said there are still new comers and it's quite nice to have a good tutorial or guide somewhere within the game. Even if it is all written with some screen caps. It'd be nice.   The shop is close until march meaning you can't buy anything. No skins, no titles, nothing. That would be cool and all if maybe we got something other than some alternative colors or were allowed to buy the skins from the story mode which already exist and can be seen in the game.  If you don't have a friend in the physical realm who comes over and plays games with you/ a solid internet connection. Don't even bother with this game. There is barely anything for offline play. You can't even play versus against a bot. You are only limited to another person or by playing bots in survival mode. Survival mode is fun... but it's not going to be 2 weeks fun let alone a month. Challenge mode is also not available til march   So let's get to the online portion  Matchmaking takes forever. I mean a long long long time. Battle lounge.... seems like why is there an option to join when every option is either FULL, No longer exists, Disconnected It'd be so much nicer if you could have casual match ups just feed you matches with the option for another round if you want to. That way you are out there experiencing many different playstyles and getting more matches.   As it is now. I'd call this game unfinished. I'd give it a 20$ value for what it is now. I'll change my review if/when it improves in the future. Til now I'm quite salty over my 60$ purchase for what I see as an incomplete game.  If I were to look at games I enjoyed playing (fighters) It'd of been the soul calibur series, blazblue, and tekken. At least I could get a lot of matches quickly and the online was good enough I had fun (blazblue having flawless online in my experience)",

I used the one round survival mod simply to attain fighter colours that were impossible to attain, going through their freaking ridiculous survival mode. of course, as part of their 'essential' update, they've penalized all users like me, by taking away all our fight money, leaving us with no other way of getting them back. meanwhile, other essential game features and bugs are yet to be added/fixed.

The problem is some good ideas are being executed poorly and i'm afraid devs will look at sfv sales and think sticking to the old ways of paid versions of the same game is the safe route that gamers want.  Overall it's still a decent fighting game even if it does feel barebones. Although they really need to give characters more tools. Not even just v mechanics I mean just more special moves in general. This game is the most boring Ryu has ever been, ibuki was ♥♥♥♥♥ of her specials, Juri lost a bunch tools and gets a bootleg chun flip kick. Poor Gief doesn't even have a green hand.  I won't bore you to go through it's other problems, you can find rants about them anywhere on the fourms or other reviews.    Should you buy SFV?    Sure if you're a big fan of Street Fighter and really wanna play this, but to everyone else no unless you've played and got sick of every other fighting game. SFV is not a bad game but I feel other fighters are putting in more effort than capcom.   I'm not mad at you capcom for pawning off my t.v for a quick buck, just disappointed and I know you're better than this. I'm sure sfv's headed in the right direction but until I know your bad habits are gone for good i'm not trusting you around the kids.",

            "review_text": "Content has gotten better after a gazillion patches, but unless you are hopelessly addicted to this game and playing online 25 hours a day, you're gonna have to pay for every single thing that should have been there at launch, after you already paid 60 freaking bucks for the game.  The fighting mechanics feel great, but there aren't many (simple attacks, short combos and very few additional mechanics) and the game is so freaking fast that anticipation and reaction are far more difficult than rushing down like a madman. The pace of this game makes it play more like the turbo modes of previous Street Fighters cranked way up, and I vastly prefer the more restrained pace of Super SF2, USFIV or Alpha 3 in normal speed.  The way it is now, it feels like an airdash gatling fighter but without the long and flashy combos (or the means to break out of them). The end result is a game in which things happen too fast and then they are also over far too fast. It feels chaotic, like there is very little rhyme or reason outside of executing very short combos and varying strategies semi-randomly at breakneck speed.  If I want fast, I'll play something like Marvel VS Capcom. Street Fighter to me is at its best when its slower and much more cerebral, and that's not what you're gonna get here.",
