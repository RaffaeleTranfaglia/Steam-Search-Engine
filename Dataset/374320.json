            "review_text": "===== This review was last updated on July 6, 2016 =====  This game could be one of the best Dark Souls games. Really it could. But there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by DkS community DkS2.  I've tried to do my best at condencing this review and updating it.  Weapon movesets. After DkS2 you would expect to see cool, diverse and unique weapon movesets. Wrong! Welcome to next-gen DkS game, where all weapon classes have 2 movesets at best for all the weapons. Boss Soul weapons? Nope, same boring and sometimes even bad movesets. Same goes for weapon AR values: most weapons can be just infused for quality and use that way, that leads to another problem - complete lack of build and weapon diversity.  One could argue that 'there are different builds!'. Yes there are mage builds for example. Could just as well cound fashion souls build too, or cosplays! Majority of players pick quality build, and for a good reason - it is the most effective and universal one. Ofc there are caster builds or dex/str builds but they are much more rare and compared to quality - simply suboptimal.  Weapon arts - while some are OKish. some are just disgustingly bad. Scythe weapon art in particular - about same windup as fully charged heavy attack, but way less damage and requires FP. Landing 'headshot' adds a little more damage, but it still does way less than charged heavy, having same windup and readability. Greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly (so ye, same weapon art for 2 weapon types). I would any day pick DkS2 parry on Greatsword L2 over the awful weapon art.  Weapons balance - a lot of weapons are just plain better than others. Same goes for some weapon classes. Ofc it is souls game so you can play with any weapon and win, but why play with sword 'A' over sword 'B' if latter is only different from the other in stat scaling and has completely identical moveset?  Poise. There was a lot of drama about it, but I will keep it short. As of right now poise is extremely situational, and one could say that wearing heavy armor is heavily punished in this game by making player sacrifice stat point into completely useless otherwise Vitality (that requires ridiculous investment compared to previous games). Fact that some NPC enemyes have properly working poise only serves as more salt on injury. Poise in DkS2 was working almost perfect after all the tuning done, and now we have this.  A big step back from previous game in itemization. In past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game, with extremely few exceptions. In DkS3 there are quite a number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get, some of them were just cut and are still present in game data.  Absolutely same NG+ and on. One of few things DkS2 did right was NG+. It added not just dull 'more hp, more damage' difficulty, but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics. Here it's just +X rings that you can loot.  Covenants feel really shallow and oversimplified. There are 2 covenants that autoinvade to kill players, and if you forget about phantom color and 'currency' name they are essentially exactly same. 2 Blue covenants that are almost exactly the same except a gimmick difference which doesn't really make much difference (oh, and blue eye orbs gone, so prepare to enjoy sitting for hours waiting to get summoned). Red and purple covenants are pretty much the same as well if they invade with minor difference of purples having a bit more options on how to complete invasion.  Regional matchmaking - absolutely useless. On PC game has 2 regions - Japan and not-Japan. So pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out Japaneese players (which is actually yet to be confirmed) if you happen to have it on. Other than that - Australian players will get matched with European players or NA players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region.  Patchnotes quality - average patchnotes for DkS3 look like this: 'We did some tweaking to Axes, changed Swords a bit, and did some other stuff we do. Also some adjustments were made to Rapiers. Go ahead and guess what we actually did.'  Overall I'm really disappointed in how DkS3 turned out to be, sure it is great single player(ish) experience for 1 time, but it betrays what Dark Souls was in so many ways by completely discoraging invasions (because in majority of invasions you will be facing 2 or 3 or even 4 man ganks) and should you die you will also leave your souls on the spot you got killed as invader! There are no arenas, no interesting tech in PvP, really boring weapons and bland armor, and rather weak underlying game mechanics.  My advice: if you want Dark Souls PvP - play Dark Souls 2: SotFS. If you want to experience another chapter of Dark Souls - sure, this game sure does deliver at least on that, but once you're done with it - you're done with game. It is so unlike previous games in longevity, but it is what it is.  My rating for this game as Dark Souls fan is: As another chapter of world story/lore - 8/10 As a Souls series game with multiplayer - 2/10  I would recommend waiting for FROM to finally decide what they want to do with game and fix at least some of these issues and buy it once it will come with all DLC and some GOTY version. Untill then - Dark Souls 2 is better Souls game.",

            "review_text": "Im going to start off by saying this is a review of the games PvP/PvE aspect and the feedback the community has gotten from Fromsoft. If you are only playing this game for the story and are not interested in any of the semantics than I whole heartedly recommend this game to you.  Going to start off with a series of pros and cons.  -PROS- -Gameplay is very fast paced and fluid, I have never had a problem with my movement being stunted or interrupted at all -Weapons are very diverse and there are alot of choices this time around, albeit a bit less than Dark Souls 2 -Every weapon has a very satisfying moveset that really feels like the hits impact and connect -Enemies are very memorable and so is every bossfight -The levels are very diverse and the final boss was the best boss I have probably ever fought in a videogame.  Now here comes the cons.  -CONS- -Incredibly vague patch notes that literally say nothing in terms of information, ie 'Performance adjustment for Greatsword' what did you ♥♥♥♥ing adjust??? -Magic requires a huge stat investment to even consider being viable, Im talking 40-60+ Int/Faith to even START doing any type of damage, and even then the spell 'Farron Dart' doesnt even 1 shot the starting enemies, it takes TWO. And not to mention that anyone with half a brain can dodge a spell in PvP. -Straightswords are literally the best weapons in the game, there is no point in even using anything else because anything other than a rapier or a straightsword is a complete waste of time and effort because unless you are incredibly consistent at parrying you will ALWAYS get R1 spammed down. -Invasions are also a complete waste of time considering that Estus is virtually unpunishable unless you keep CONSTANT pressure, the host has 30% more hp and TWICE the Estus flasks and literally infinite phantoms (Coop players) to summon and just wittle you down until you finally die, and at that point if you do somehow manage to kill all of them, the host will just disconnect. Not to mention that you can't even use the games enemies to your advantage because Seeds of a Giant Tree (Items that turn enemies hostile to invaders, they normally are not) are so ♥♥♥♥ing easy to get. -Poise is completely non existant, allowing someone who is wearing a greatshield and the heaviest armor in the ♥♥♥♥ing game to get staggered by an enemy with a ♥♥♥♥ing dagger, when Fromsoft was asked about this, all they had to say was, “The poise stat is working as intended and is not ‘turned off’ as some fans have theorized,” a spokesperson for Bandai Namco told me. “The stat works differently than in past games and is more situational, which seems to be the reason for the confusion.” Even though the stat is literally DISABLED in the games code. -Straightswords have literally twice the hitbox than the visual length, and can hit you from what seems like 10 feet away when they are clearly swinging at the air. And no, Im not talking about phantom range, Im literally talking about the hitbox. Outranging even some Ultra Greatswords in length.  In short, fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game FromSoft.",

Dark Souls 3 could be the very best yet, but it isn't. Due to a single, but overwhelmingly obvious oversight, this game is not currently worth the time it takes to play. I praised the previous games in the series for giving the player the choice on how to play, how to build their soul slaying hero.  Dark Souls 3 forces the player into specializing their offensive capabilites but gives them no choice on defense. Blocking, and wearing heavy armor, no longer serve a purpose. The only viable options for defense are to roll out of the way or parry.   Some people will read this rant and say 'git gud' but believe me... I am good. I'm pretty awesome at this game, but I felt like my choices were stripped from me as I was forced to adapt to the Iframes given during rolls and the activation frames of various parrys. In previous games you could choose to simply invest in equipment load and build yourself a heavy armored tank, this is no longer an option as the weakest enemies in the game will stagger you in 1 shot, and a dagger wielding invader can stunlock you to death.  Poise Poise is what is missing in Dark Souls 3 Poise is a vital part of the series to date. Poise is the only reason I am not recommending this game. If Poise isn't important to you or if you were planning on making a light armor, ninja esque styled character or a mage in robes then you probably won't notice or care. But, for those who want a bad A$$ in Havels armor strutting around, brushing off attacks without a care in the world... go play dark souls 1 or 2, they're great games still, and they have poise.

On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways.   Let's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3: +The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date.  +The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -&gt; Iron Keep situation.  +It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)  Now let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3: -My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point.  -There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortion ♥♥♥♥, but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this -Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly.  -This is the THIRD game on PC that still has ♥♥♥♥ing Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1.   Maybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much.   I would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game. As it stands it's an okay game, with some really glaring issues.",

Pyromancy and Miracles have the same exact issue. I recently reinstalled because I had heard there would be DLC, and I'm hoping the DLC will add in balance changes that fx how awful the PvP is. I've fought maybe 6 people since reinstalling, all of them R1 spamming goons. The two hit stunlock limitation simply made it so that they hit you twice, roll out, roll in, hit you twice again, rinse and repeat. This game lost what made souls pvp fun. Creativity is no longer viable in PvP. It's barely viable in PvE. The game feels unfinished, and the director himself has apologized for it. The armor system is almost entirely pointless, after running some tests I found that the difference between a starting armor set and a late game heavy set was literally 14 points of damage. Honestly, lore wise it doesnt make all that much sense or add a tremendous amount on the series. It's very pretty though. All in all I would not recommend it.

            "review_text": "Dark III is complete garbage and I do not even plan on finishing the game any time soon.   And here is why:  1. POISE - Every Enemie in the game has poise. Some have more, some have less and some you can even stagger if you roll against them. This is totally fine and is indeed a good mechanic, there is just minor oversight to it that ruins the whole gameplay. You have none. No matter what the game tells you and tries to make you believe poise would be a thing for player characters, it is not. You get staggerd by every minor hit and get comboed to death.  2. COMBOS - Enemies have attack patterns and when you learn them you eventually 'git gud' at this game. There is again just one minor problem. Seemingly endless combos. I have counted and came across quiet a few enemies who did quiet fair damage and were able to perform a combo of 6! This is ridiculous. You do not even have to be caught in one of those it is just the fact that enemies seem to have endless stamina when it comes to attacks, just as they would not use any of their stamina to perform them. Still you can cause a guardbreak to them through attacking their shields (if they have any).  3. SHIELDS - They are not good for blocking anything, because of above mentioned endless combos. If you are not good at parrying or plan on becoming so, or do not plan on using a greatshild, do not bother to throw them all away.  4. PARRYING - I seriously do not know what is wrong with this mechanic in DARK III, but it feels very broken. I often get partial parries and take all the penalties of that (partial health and higher stamina loss), but still parry the enemie and can perform a counterattack. And this ca. 50% of my parries. the rest are actual parries or I miss them. Maybe I am just off, but then again, why get a partial and the parry at the same time?  5. ARMOR - Armor is worthless. It makes nearly no difference in regards of defense nor in poise (due to its abscence). the only serious difference is if you wear armor, or not. It just does not matter which kind, how heavy, how much poise or how much defense it says it gives to you. Thus, making the stats of any armor almost useless, it all breaks down to fashion souls. take what you like and do not give a ♥♥♥♥ about defenses.  6. ENEMIES - Well, there are enemies, that are quiet difficult to defeat, but only if you are not dealing high enough poise damage to them, or get staggerd because you have no poise. There are no 'special' enemies, just annoying ones that are hard to defeat because of their artificial difficulty. For example, there is a enemie type that drains your health in an enormous tempo, just by looking at you. And they not only take the health out of your healthbar, they take the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. So there is no chance for you to heal and keep going. You HAVE TO wait for your healthbar to return, until you can continue fighting or you WILL die if you are not fast enough. This mechanic is sick and shows us where Dark Souls has come to - complete garbage -.  7. BOSS ENEMIES - Nothing much to say about them. They are not necessarily uninspired, but very plain. No real intense fights with them, nor any big challenges. If one is hard to defeat, call a summon and get done. You will not miss any spectacular bossfight.  8. COVENANTS - You can change your covenant at any given time, due to the fact that there are now items that symbolize the bond to your covenant. There are no real good rewards and as far as known, only two covenant tiers for every covenant. One tier for turning in ten and a second for turning in 30 covenant items at the shrine, or leader. The only real interesting covenant is the one (not saying any names here, because of spoilers) where you can decide to be a good or a bad phantom.  Absolutely dumb is also the mechanic, that you now get the item related to your actual covenant, if you invade as a red phantom and kill the host. This is just a poor excuse for not giving you any, specialy valuable and strictly strained reward for ranking up in the individual covenants.  9. NPCs - They have at least questlines. Some are quiet interesting to pursue and some are not. But I did not experience any major twists.  10. Weapons - Mostly copy pasted from previous Dark games. Just a few exceptions and not really worth mentioning here.  11. Magic - Never used and never plan to do so. Until now it seems to be pretty useless.  12. PVP - Quick weapons outplay almost everything, because you can be staggered by everything and ganking is still what people love the most.   In the end I do not recommend this game to anyone. Atleast not for that much money. If you want to take part in the Dark series, stick with DS I, still by fare the best of the series, sadly.   I do not speak english as my native language so do not hate on that.",

The reason I mention this is because I have been scared to play the game anymore.   The reason why is because of the rampant hacking problem that has been plaguing this game since launch. Ever since I have heard of what hackers could do and how they could get you banned and character deleted even though you didn't do anything is a atrocity to this brilliant game. And if you don't go online, one, you are missing a huge part of the game, and two, this is the fault of From SoftWare/ Bandai Namco's refusal to do anything to fix it. Why should we have to worry about all of our hard earned progress being lost because some guy felt like being a ♥♥♥♥. What doesn't help is also the fact that the actual hackers and cheaters here are not punished at all. Some guy literally streamed himself hacking the game and ruining peoples characters by getting them banned and nothing was done to him. He is still playing the game and his character has not been deleted. From SoftWare/Bandai Namco, this is ruining your game and is making people leave. It is also reducing the amount of sales you could possibly can get since people are scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of their character getting deleted and getting banned cause hackers are running rampant. Please do something about it. Since I won't be playing this game anymore, I will not be buying the DLC that will inevitably come out. I suggest you do the same in till this problem has been solved.

            "review_text": "This is my very first souls game, bought on release. I did my entire first playthrough all by myself, with nothing but a 2 Handed Lothric Knight Long Spear (basically the only viable pike-class weapon in the game). More than 2/3rds of my play time, almost 300 hours at the writing of this review, has been literally *JUST* SL 120 1v1 red soapstone duels at pontiff. In the past two weeks before writing this review, this has basically been the equivalent of a part time job for me (~20 hrs/wk). Even after all of this time, I still love it, and I've just been using different weapons with my Quality build. I haven't even gotten around to going to NG+ so I can make a backup save and try out different builds like pyromancy, sorcery, faith, etc.  What more of a recommendation do you need?  The PvE experience is great, but I highly HIGHLY recommend you play it through by yourself the first time, blind (no spoilers/walkthroughs/etc). You'll have a lot more fun that way. Dying is fun, the more you die, the more frustrated you'll get. You'll go back and think of what you did wrong, how you can improve, etc. You'll experiment with different things. Finally, you'll win, and because it was such a struggle, it will feel amazing. You can't get that if you just try to cheese it by summoning people to beat bosses and levels for you, and it's a feeling unique to the souls series that you really, seriously, shouldn't deprive yourself of. A huge buildup of tension and frustration followed by a great release, if you know what I mean.  PvP is going to be the major time sink in this game though. Invasions are pretty unbalanced at the moment, heavily HEAVILY in favor of hosts who can just run around and summon phantoms over and over while also having more health and twice the estus (healing potions basically). This leads to the only consistently invading strategy being one-shot builds, most commonly parry-ripostes with hornet ring, parrying with a caestus and swapping to a huge damage weapon to kill people in one hit. That said, invasions can still mostly be fun at around half meta level (SL50-60 instead of SL100-120), or lower, even. Where you can catch people actually trying to play the game naturally instead of just ganking.  That said, like I mentioned earlier, duels are still really fun and mainly what I do. 1v1 fights with no chugging (drinking healing estus, though mana estus is fine). No mobs, no running away, relatively equal level, a fair fight. Pretty much everything is viable here as long as you're skilled enough, allowing for a lot of variety. This is the main thing I'd suggest people do for PvP, imo.  My final advice would be to watch some Twitch streams, specifically those that do PvP (both duels and invasions. iSkys is a good person to watch if you want to see what it takes to do invasions are done successfully and consistently). Ask questions and learn from the pros, then practice on your own, that's the only way to get better. Even after all of this time I've spent playing, I still don't know everything, I never bother to parry for example. I've only just started trying to incorporate more advanced techniques like ravioli stepping into my repetoire. At the higher levels of PvP there is a lot of depth with a lot of very different weapons and builds, giving the game a ton of replay value. There is also a pretty strong community of speed runners if that's your thing, too.",

It's Dark Souls, what more can you ask for? It's a HUGE improvement from Dark Souls 2, which had problems, but wasn't terrible anyway. There are complains, that DS3 feels similar to the first Dark Souls, resulting in people comparing the two. Being a Souls fan, I myself felt the similarity. But nonetheless, that is what actually makes it good. The original director of the Souls game, Hidetaka Miyazaki, returned to direct this third installment to the series, and he knew what made the first one so good. So there are bound to be similarities, although it is too much similar at certain places.   The game is still different in certain places as well, especially the combat system. It's much faster than the first one, and they introduced 'Weapon Arts'. This makes the gameplay better, but may be a turnoff for some.  Multiplayer has been improved tremendously, with the introduction of password matchmaking. Password matchmaking also removes level restriction, but still balances your teammate's level to yours. Which is good. The game also added more  Covenants ingame, which can result up to 8 player chaotic PvP invasion. Whole lotta fun.  Enemies design-wise, tons of new ones are introduced, while still having some similar mob enemies. The bosses, are a blessing and a curse, unlike DS2, which is only a curse. In DS2, most of the bosses are just 'Big dudes in big armor'. Lazy design, and not so smart attack patterns, which made them easy to handle. In DS3, it is a blessing because their design is terrific and varies throughout the whole game. It is also both a curse and a blessing, because their difficulty has been amped up, but also provides a challenge.   DAMN YOU NAMELESS KING!!!    The soundtrack is terrific, suiting the gothic theme and fantasy theme, albeit the soundtrack only plays during boss fights.  Overall, great game. It has problems, especially HACKERS. That has been resolved, maybe. I don't know. And there are tons of weapons that are unbalanced or is utterly useless. Also bugs, of course there are bugs. But they are releasing updates fixing those problems quite often.  Here's hoping the DLC to be a good one.",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: I have not finished the game yet, I have two more required bosses and a few optional bosses to go. That being said, I feel as if I'm far enough into the game to where my opinion won't change by much, if at all.  I previously made a joke review indicating that this game was a poor man's Bloodborne, but now I'm starting to think that really is the case. Coming into this game with Bloodborne fresh in my mind, I can't help but think Bloodborne was the more interesting game. I'm not saying Bloodborne is a flawless gem, it has quite a few problems itself (Blood Vials, linear for a little too long, limited multiplayer design, etc) but in the long run BB was a much more satisfying game.  In terms of world design, the game is alright. It's very consistent, although that's probably due to the game railroading you down a certain path up until you reach Road of Sacrifice. The game is incredibly linear, but not DaSII levels of linear. It opens up forks, however there's nothing quite as open and expansive as the first DaS, or the choices you had in DeS with the hub location. It tries to mix the two and it's not bad, but it could definitely be better. Something that ruins the experience of DaS3 is the awful enemy placement. Every single other encounter feels like some cheap (but manageable) ambush, and it stopped being fun pretty quickly as you were expecting it.   Enemy design is pretty good, some shoddy hitboxes with some of the bigger beast enemies, but overall solid. Nice to have more than just oversized humanoids in giant packs that aggro together.  In terms of bosses, the game starts out okay with the first boss and then it drops in quality afterwards up until about Farron's Keep, from then it's hit/miss until the first three lords are reclaimed. Everything so far after that moment seems solid, and I hear good things about every upcoming boss save for one last gimmick fight. DLC may bring in some actual good boss fights as well, as per usual. But the earlier boss fights in this game are pretty dull gimmicky encounters.  The stats are completely ♥♥♥♥ed in Dark Souls III. Apparently poise in it's current form is actually a bug, but removing health from Vitality and splitting equip load from Endurance, why? Who thought this would be a good idea? Why are swords even more viable than UGS or any weapon that tends to be slower and consume more stamina?  PvP seems to be better, although that's something that tends to depend on the community. And knowing the community the Dark series harbors, no thanks. Good efforts though, as BB was pretty questionable with it's latency and hit detection. This is more of a personal vendetta against the community rather than the devs. I'm sure From put lots of work into it, no matter how imbalanced this series will be.  There are more points that I kind of glossed over, but these are the bigger parts of the series in my opinion. While there are some really well done moments in this game, the series feels as though it should be a sum of it's parts. Having all good bosses while the rest of the game was a bore wouldn't have saved it honestly. Everything in this game feels mediocre. Especially when compared to Bloodborne's fine tuning, this felt somewhat rushed out. About on par with the original Dark Souls since that game seems to go downhill past the halfway mark. Maybe the DLC will save the game, it's always been the best part of each game. Maybe my overall opinion will change once it releases and I've finished the game.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls III is currently the latest game in the Dark Souls series. If this is your first Dark Souls game, you need to know that Dark Souls is well-known for its extremely hard difficulty, frustrating deaths, and slow grinding progress (because you'll lose everything if you fail to retrieve your dropped souls - or 'money'). In short, it's just completely merciless to the player. If you're a hardcore gamer that loves challenges, I heavily recommend this for you. Dark Souls is the type of game where the difficulty overwhelms the fun, so if you're a casual gamer looking to rekt some AIs easily and be a hero that saves the universe - don't buy this game. Know that your character will die a lot in this game. I mean, A LOT. So if you're the type of person that crushes things around you when you're frustrated, I also don't recommend this game for you to save your stuff.   Gameplay  You'll start with creating your character and choosing a class. And then, the slaughtering will start. Arguably overpowered enemies - usually in the form of monsters - will start popping out as you progress through the map and you'll gain 'souls' when you defeat them. You can spend your collected souls as soon as you find some kind of a 'checkpoint', usually in the form of a large area that consists of a blacksmith, a store, a bonfire (respawn point), and an NPC to upgrade your stats. You'll get to purchase weapons, armors, power-ups, stats, etc. in these checkpoints to give you a better fighting chance against the enemies. Each time you die, you'll drop ALL of your collected souls and you'll have to retrieve it the next time you respawn. If you die again, then you'll not be able to retrieve the souls you collected the first time you died. Only the last pack of souls will be dropped and retrievable. When you successfully dominates an 'area', you'll have to beat a boss fight to gain access to the next 'area'. Usually, the bosses are extremely overpowered and it'll take more than 10 retries to beat them. This is basically what you'll do the whole game. Walk - kill enemies - die - grind souls - die - purchase stuff - fight bosses - die - repeat.   Advantages  Graphics are way better than Dark Souls II. It's really nice to look at and overall, it's great. The main advantage of the game is the difficulty. Some of you, like me, may think 'What? Who finds getting killed over and over again, getting frustrated, punching stuff around you, or even throwing your CPU out of the window because you are p*ssed off as 'fun'?'. Well, people have different ideas of 'fun'. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of players that loves the Dark Souls franchise. The overwhelming difficulty is what makes Dark Souls unique. Its PS4-only cousin, Bloodborne, also gained huge attention from gamers due to similar gameplay style. I personally don't find getting killed over and over again or fighting against overpowered enemies as 'fun' but I find the game greatly trains my mentality - it desensitized me from failure, which will be important in my pursue of success. But know this: this game is not all about death and failures. You'll learn how to fight with your brain instead of blindly slashing everywhere. Yes, Dark Souls is skill-based. You'll have to get used on using the roll, heavy slash, light slash, shields, bows, utiliteies, etc. if you want to be able to progress through the game. They are not easy at all to master.   Disadvantages  Storyline is confusing. It's best not to put your hope on the story-driven part. The game lacks explanation about the previous installment stories. You can always look at YouTube to catch up with the stories but IMHO, it's not a nicely written story. It's short, lacks details, lacks plot twists, and it's just way too 'mainstream and predictable'. As for the soundtrack, it's empty as usual. I expected epic songs for these kinds of games but apparently, they still think almost-no-soundtracks is good. The overwhelming difficulty itself is NOT a disdvantage - it is purely based on your gaming style preference. The second noticable disadvantage is the lack of new weapons in the shops. I may not have progressed far but when I meet a 'checkpoint', I couldn't find anything useful in there. I might have to enchant weapons and all but I haven't quite understood the mechanism. Should it be a disadvantage? I don't know. I might be too stupid to understand the whole mechanism in 5 hours or maybe the game itself lacks tutorials for new players that are not familiar with Dark Souls.   Final Verdict  It all depends on your gaming preference. Some people enjoy Dark Souls, some people don't. Make sure you look at the gameplay first on YouTube or whatever before purchasing this game just to make sure you won't waste your money. I personally like this game and recommend it for everyone regardless of your gaming preference because everyone needs to be desensitized from failures. But you might think it's not necessary because you already have a super safe life and a tremendous amount of parent's money. Just make sure you watch the gameplay first before purchasing it.",

UPDATE 2: Here are some ways to ''''''fix'''''' the game. 1) Set lighting setting down to low. 2) Unequip your shield when near a bonfire. Just completely remove it until you are out of sight from the bonfire.  Granted, it's ridiculous that you need to do something like this just to stop the game from crashing, but it is what it is.",

This game isn't hard, it's harsh.  I've died plenty of times while playing and not a single one was because 'I'm not good enough'. Every time, there was a bad decision I made, a fight I picked badly or shouldn't have picked, a trap I handled badly, or a giant skeleton king I fought while emotionally compromised from work. Skill is a factor, skill is rewarded, but this is a game anyone can play and that anyone can conquer. This game has a lot of depth, lore, challenges and intrigue that make it a work of art in itself and in that regard it's nothing short of incredible.

            "review_text": "The Game is a solid [8/10]: Must have to any fan in the series, Also I highly recommend the game to players looking for challenge:  Story (7/10):  - It's not your traditional story... not much is there Ashen one.   - Also this game requires digging to find out the quest threads, I have finished NG and I did not do any quests yet.  Gameplay (8/10):   [Boss Fights]   - I think that the Bosses of DS1/DS2 are much better than that in DS3. More variaty &amp; interesting...  - DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series.   [Enemies]  - In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies.  - I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches.  - DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version.  - DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar... DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well... DS3 did not have much on that front.   [NG+ and so on]  - In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game.  - Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1... and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes... this is putting off.   [World]  - In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life.  - I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad.  - DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between.  - DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1.  - Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp).  - DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series.  - Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry.   [Death]  - The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome.   - In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.   [Multiplayer]  - Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system.  - You can summen people to help you and you can help others.  - You could get invaded (part of the challenge).  - You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded.  - The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes...  - Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you...  Control (9.5/10)  - This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid &amp; precise controls.  - I did not play this with a keyboard &amp; mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that.  - Added   Camera Control (8/10):  - In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games.  - Overall it's still good.  Graphics, Overall: (8.5/10):  - Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style.  - Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p  - Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.  Sound, Overall 6.5/10:  - The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit.  - Boss Music fights is good though.  ... There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself.",

MY DARK SOULS JOURNEY   'As flame rises, so does it fade. Such is the way of things.'   'Seeker of fire, conquerer of Dark. I too sought fire, once.  With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse.'   'One day fire will fade, and dark will become a curse.  Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally.'   '...And now only embers remain'   We go thought countless of ancient kingdoms only to see the remnants.  We are no longer 'the chosen undead' who should link the fire.  We are now the 'The chosen one' to get those before us who linked the fire to return to their thrones.  What happened to the first chosen undead? Did he ever find rest by linking the fire, or is he also one of the Lords of Cinder.  Gwyn was the first Lord of Cinder and the one who brought this curse to us. but should we blame him? He did it by fear, to protect his beloved kingdom. He clinged to what he hold dear but what he did not realize is that all he did was spreading a terrible curse.   Gwyn links the First flame because he trembled at the Dark, he clung to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans, and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature. By sacrificing himself to link the fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans so that the Age of Fire may be perpetuated. Gwyn did this only after all other options had been exhausted, after the Witch of Izalith failed to recreate a new First Flame using her soul.   Gwyn made what we call the first sin, and the first chosen undead took his place by either relinking the fire or letting it fade.   In a future we get the first look of Drangleic. A kingdom made great by a great king, but remnants of the past seeks their return.   The Iron king who got the Old king soul, which connects to Gwyn's soul.  The Rotten which connects to Gravelord Neto.  The Chaos trying to rise again from the depths.  And Queens which are remnants of the Father of the Abyss.   The story once again repeats itself, but not with the king sacrificing himself. instead he runs from his purpose, and when you arrive, nothing but a hollow is walking around.   Now we are in Lothric the Curse is back and we meet many broken souls.   This journey is quite the trip down the memories.  We found Mushroom people, thus dead but still to be found. we find old characters that reminds us of those we seeked to help but lost non the less.  The black knights of Gwyn still wander around without purpose, forever cursed.   One Battle took my feelings by storm though.  The battle with the abyss walker. a broken yet willing to fight man.  when i fought this man he fought like he was a remnant of knight Artorias.  The wolf covenant is a remnant of Sif in my mind.  Even a stray demon can be found and it's soul made to Havel's ring.   Even though my journey is not fully ended, i will try to find all those small objects that brings us back to where it all started.  With the first four souls.   Good bye then.   Be safe, friend.

            "review_text": "Much like the first Dark Souls, this game is difficult and requires a lot of patience to down the epic and challenging bosses and the, sometimes, much stronger enemies. The fact that Dark Souls III returns to the roots of Dark Souls (and Demon's Souls to a lesser extent) is incredibly exciting and I had an awesome time playing this installment. As someone who struggles to stay interested in a game for longer than a couple of hours, I've got 100+ hours clocked into DS3 and I still want to play more.  A lot of my opinion on the game is based on PvE and PvE Coop (both matchmaking and password, which is a godsend), as the majority of the PvP I've done is either a pretty good matchmaking experience or I've used a password to be summoned by friends for a friendly duel. I have not experienced any issues with the online thus far, apart from a few summons being timed out, however this usually only happens once.  As with DS1, the hack 'n' slash action-RPG style gameplay is what entices me the most and allows plenty of replayability using different builds and equipment. The leveling system is the key to wielding higher-tier weapons and it feels so satisfying to come back to difficult enemies in the earlier areas to slaughter them in revenge.  Dark Souls III is easily one of my favourite games so far of 2016 and I'm highly anticipating the upcoming DLC.   In regards to my game time and saying I have '100+ hours clocked', I spent about 80-90 hours on a pirated copy before I was able to afford the game. I have no regrets buying the game as I believe FROM has done an outstanding job and they deserve my money as I've enjoyed this game quite a lot. I just thought I'd write this for anyone who cares.

Lets start with the pros: -Miyazaki came back and it shows, every single map of the game is detailed, it's not boring to look at, even in places where you would be about to vomit (and there are some pretty squicky places in this game) the beauty of this world still shows. -The music is outstanding, there's no song in this game that disappoints, that's REALLY hard, Yuka Kamitani is this time the main composer and it was a really good idea, I do think her style is better for this game. -The bosses are amazing, even the ones that are 'boring' make for an interesting challenge and the climax is one of the best I've ever seen. -Weapon arts are a really good implementation in this game, unfortunately not dual wield like in 2, but there are dual weapons that suffice that area.  Cons: -Balance, a LOT, 90% of the problems of this game is balance, which one didn't have those at launch however? I'd say this is only a temporary problem as patches come and go. -NG+ devoid of change WHAT WERE YOU THINKING FROM?! Let's be honest, in 2 those changes were neat, but rather underwhelming most of the time, the extra boss soul weapons were the best change, those were really Neato... *I'm sorry* -Poise, what do I have to give to Pickle Pee-Pump a Rum to get poise?  -Linear, I don't mean Final Halway XIII, the areas are filled with secrets and there are many shortcuts but the map is less... circular unlike the first, that had a lot of areas up and down and almost every place you could go would have a way to get to the beginning.  All in all, solid game, my favorite, the game feels a little linear (ok very linear) but every area has a TON to explore and many places to go, although 1 had really the best shortcuts. And most if not all of the problems can be fixed in future patches (even NG+ changes... what? In 2 they added a whole new ending/questline in a patch lol) I SPECIALLY want to see poise back 'cause what we have now is a mixture of '2 hits and out' and 'ultimate stunlock combo', it's... it's really weird FROM POISE PLZ. I recommend it, but if you are afraid those problems may ♥♥♥♥ your experience fine, wait till the DLCs and patches are out and then try it, but even as of now with those broken Dark Swords and Estocs and useless Dark Hands there's fun to be had (just stay away of those weapons, don't even use them lol).",

            "review_text": "Marketing has always been a problem for the Souls series. I remember being supremely disappointed in Demon's Souls, a game lauded back in 2009 as this new, revolutionary RPG experience with innovative multiplayer features. I played it, died a bunch, killed the first boss - a thoroughly unimpressive black blob - and thought: 'Is this it?'. The game seemed to be lacking almost all aspects I consider critical to a good RPG, such as story, player choice and an immersive world. Best foot forward this was not.  Nevertheless, the Souls series marched onwards, becoming a worldwide multiplatform phenomenon. Marketing shifted its focus to emphasize the extreme difficulty. 'Prepare to Die!', barked the banners and billboards in anticipation of Dark Souls 1. I still didn't see the appeal. From the outside looking in, it seemed like the game was merely difficult for the sake of being difficult. Plus the PC port was initially abysmal.  In retrospect, it's a crying shame that the true strengths of the series were so rarely mentioned in any materials: The all-encompassing sense of discovery, wonderfully glum Dark Fantasy atmosphere and the scale &amp; feel of a grand adventure. I propose that only by letting go of your preconceptions can you start truly enjoying the Dark Souls experience - a reason why 'blind' playthroughs are a big thing among DS fans. Now that I've finally completed my first Souls game, I realize it's all about the journey, not the destination.  Not knowing what lies ahead creates a powerful framework of both tension and awe. The game delivers on its rich environmental details: Emerging topside after a grueling jaunt in some underground ruins is always rewarded with a new, spectacular vista - a promise of more discoveries to come. Treading lightly is also rewarded, since you need to be acutely aware about the fact that the game is just waiting for you to drop your guard for a second to plunge a knife in your back.  Observation and determination are required in equal amounts. Dark Souls 3 is definitely a difficult game, but eventually overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds can result in rare 'MMO Raid Boss' -style highs that are seldomly reached in single-player games. The combat system is cruel but rewarding - Probably my favorite close-quarters brawling system in any game.  I only wish the game did a better job of explaining its underlying mechanics. I absolutely enjoy exploring totally foreign, sprawling areas and meticulously studying enemy attack patterns, but some crucial under-the-hood stuff is just plain not communicated well or at all. It took me ages to figure out you actually cannot be hit during parts of your roll, or that the roll gets progressively worse even while you're below the maximum load threshold. I still can't claim to completely understand the parry system. The game just goes a bit too far with its obfuscation in places.  Story is another aspect I cannot really be fully satisfied with. While Dark Souls lore is undeniably rich and you can sense the coherency in its worldbuilding, the story could use some more flesh around its bones. The intro movie seems more like a boss highlight reel than a yarn being spun into motion. I can appreciate what the lack of story is going for, but even if it's all an exercise in futility, I feel the tale could be told more effectively.  Overall, after finishing Dark Souls 3 I can't help but to feel the need to kick myself for letting this series slip through the cracks. It's amazing that a game this good could be created today using design tenets mostly from the eighties, but there it is. I don't have to agree with or even like all the design decisions at play here; What I do have to recognize is the whole - A game that feels tremendously right, stubbornly clinging to its age-old ways, knowing there's still some spark left in them.  I'm not sure I can say Dark Souls 3 is for everyone. I know that I initially anticipated completely wrong things from the series. But what I can say is that the less you expect from it, the more you will end up getting.",

The jump from Demon's Souls to here is basically better polish/production.

It's something that I seriously wonder because in almost everyone's opinion, Dark Souls was perfect at DS1, all they had to do was polish it up and fix some of the bugs! Instead they wanted to make the game more 'casual freindly' by ruining it for both hardcore and casual fans. I honestly compare this game most to BloodBorne. The combat feels almost ripped straight from it. This is a game that has made it clear that it doesn't matter how hard you hit, all that matters is that you hit first. Almost any hit by any enemy will stagger you, causing you to have to restart your attack animation. Basically, 95% of weapons that aren't broadswords or rapiers are complete trash, because by the time you can actually get an attack off with your greatsword, an enemy will have bitten off almost half of your health. And when you do get that attack off, congrats, you took away a fifth of it's health. The worst part I'd say in my opinion is enemies no longer use tactics. In DS1 enemies would try to flank you, they would time their attacks for when it's assumed that your guard is down the most. In this game, they just follow the strategy of keep attacking until you run out of stamina and are forced to take a hit. The only way to properly beat an enemy is to just keep stunlocking them and PRAY you don't run out of stamina. Meanwhile enemies can attack for years before they start to break a sweat. I was fighting a knight in the Cathedral of the Deep with a greatsword, and this guy, no joke, constantly swung his sword for a minute while I kept dodging and chipping away at his tank of a health bar. What I was trying to do was roll around him and get a cheeky backstab, but because the game's tracking is so good it's bad, that's near impossible. He just kept swinging away without a care in the world.  The big problem with this is it creates a disbalance in the game. In DS1, enemies had a limitation similar to you. They were limited by stamina. They may be able to go for a while, but at some point they'll run out of energy and have to stop for a Gatorade and a Powerbar. That creates a game that is always balanced. This is what people talked about when they said that Dark Souls is hard but fair. Your enemies are limited in the same way you are. That goes out the window in this game though! As I said, they already had the game perfect at Dark Souls 1. All they had to do was polish it up and fix some bugs, maybe a few balancing tweeks here and there, get some good servers, and that was it. Instead they tried to make BloodBorne 2.5 and failed at it because they forgot what made Dark Souls great.",

It has provided a sense of accomplishment unlike any other game I have ever played, primarily because of its difficulty. At one point I was playing this game all day, every day for about 2 whole weeks, I just couldn't get away from it. So now on to the pro's and con's.     Pro's",

            "review_text": "Gonna start by saying I only played about 1/4 of Dark Souls 1 and maybe 2/3 of Dark Souls 2, so this review is mostly for people who are entirely new to the series.  This game is definitely not for everybody. I'm not entirely sure of its difficulty in comparison to the first two games but it sure is a challenge, unless you're Gandhi himself chances are you're gonna get mad over and over again until whatever you were stuck on clicks, and then you'll be creaming your pants because the joy and relief is so incredible and unique you wont be able to control it. It may feel unfair at times but all you gotta do is take it slow, one step at a time, and really try to keep your wits about you. No two enemies have the same moveset (as far as I'm aware) and as soon as you know how they move and fight you've got em with their pants down.   One of the things I enjoyed the most about Dark Souls 3 was the environment design, it does an absolutely incredible job of portraying bitter hopelessness and despair while retaining SO much colour, which is something I really value in a video game. That being said the starting area got a bit stale for me after a while but it wasn't long until I moved onto the next area and I was met by a completely knew environment and design. They've done a pretty good job at balancing out the man-made areas and more primal places like caves and caverns etc, although there are a butt ton of cathedrals. Fortunately for me I love cathedrals and churches so it wasn't really a problem, but I understand how some people might get bored of it after a while.  Another aspect I busted a nut over was the music. Yuka Kitamura did a few pieces for Dark Souls 2 alongside Motoi Sakuraba who was the primary composer, and she did an absolutely wonderful job in Dark Souls 3. She shows incredible versatility in the soundtrack, creating haunting and nerve-wracking tracks when it's needed and then polarising it with some of the most grand and exciting music I've ever heard in a video game.  There's also one thing I just wanna splurge about because it absolutely blew me away, so don't read this if you don't wanna get spoiled:   HOLY MOSES I LOVE THE LOTHRIC/LORIAN FIGHT SO MUCH. I don't think I can properly put into words how much I absolutely loved that fight. My god. There's not a single thing I don't get rock hard over about the whole thing. The teleport mechanic and two-stage fight was excecuted, in my opinion, absolutely perfectly. I can't find a single flaw about it. The whole fight keeps you on your toes 100% of the time and every time I died I felt like I was learning more and more about how to progress and finally beat them, and when I did I experienced the most euphoria I've ever felt while playing a video game. All I did for about an hour afterwards was just sit in my chair and go over the whole thing again and again completely baffled by how well excecuted every aspect of that boss was. I really wish it would've been the last boss because while I definitely enjoyed the last boss it felt about the same in terms of difficulty and it didn't have quite the impact the Lorian/Lothric fight did. Also the music RULES. This is without a doubt my favourite piece of video game music of all time, I can't think of anything I've ever heard that's filled me with so much emotion and fit so perfectly with whatever part of the game it was made for. My hands are trembling in excitement just thinking about the whole thing god dammit I loved it so much. Without a doubt my favourite ever moment in any video game I've ever played. Holy christ.    With that out of the way I'll conclude my review by saying once again, this game is not for everyone. But if you play it and find it IS for you, you're gonna have an absolute blast. This game was an absolute treat for me, I wanted something new and challenging and awe inspiring and I got it. I can't say I enjoyed Dark Souls 1 and 2 that much, but this game has taken a spot in my top 10 and it's gonna be there for a long long time. I had an absolutely amazing experience and I feel like I got far more than I payed for, I can't wait for the DLC to come along because I am honestly so desperate for more. What a game.",

            "review_text": "My first time being summoned as a Mound Maker was like a Greek tragedy.  I'm a sunbro at heart. Always have been, always will be. But I just joined the Mound Makers and thought I'd put down my purple sign to see if anyone would be crazy enough to summon me.  Someone summons me immediately and I prepare for a duel or possibly just to get ganked. What actually happens is I get summoned in and the guy just waves at me. I can't seem to figure out how to emote so I just kind of watch him. We stare at each other for the most awkward tenish seconds ever.  Do I hit him? He didn't try to hit me. So while I'm thinking this over he starts going forward through the Undead Settlement and I follow him. He starts fighting things. And then I think to myself 'Okay, he seemingly trusts me. So when he's low health I'll finish him off for easy pickings!'  Three times my partner ends up low health. And in one situation he ends up standing on the edge of a tall cliff where I could have easily shoved him off. And I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Every time I was tempted to kill him I looked at the number of souls we had amassed together. 2k, 4k, 6k...  And then other purple phantom shows up. Here's my chance! I'll...err...hum. What should I do? I throw myself between the invader and the host with my shield raised, doing my best to keep the other purple at bay. I begin to realize how difficult it is to not accidentally hit my host while fighting an aggressive enemy. Enemy phantom defeated. We continue onwards. What the hell am I doing? I could have killed the host no problem right there.  I know I can't enter a boss door with my host as a Mound Maker, as much as I would like to. We eventually do end up at the boss door. This is it. If I want my covenant item that I came here for I have to be a ♥♥♥♥ and attack this guy that I've now earned like 9k souls alongside. I decide to just let him go.  He summons a sunbro to take in to the boss fight. Sunbro shows up, notices me, and then charges at me the moment he sees a Mound Maker. I run. And so this ridiculous chase ensues where I'm trying to flee and dodge the sunbro's attacks and host is chasing after Sunbro, spamming emotes like crazy trying to get his attention. I won't swing. I have to prove that I'm a good guy. But sunbro will not stop. The host player is now trying to get between sunbro and myself and is still emoting like crazy trying to get sunbro to stop the assault. Sunbro will not stop. Sunbro lives only to kill me.  I misjudge timing and flub a dodge roll. Sunbro hits me 2 or 3 times. I decide screw this, I'm way more of a bro than this gold aggro jerk. I'm not going to lay down and die without a fight. Me and sunbro square off and start laying into each other. Roll, block, swing, roll more. I see an opening. I attack. I hit. Twice, three times, four times. Sunbro is on the ropes. You will not defeat me!  And then I see my host out of the corner of my eye. He's running straight at a cliff. I stop. Sunbro stops. We both watch our host leap to his death. Sunbro is dismissed, his mission to help the host has failed. I am dismissed and I am awarded an item because my host died.  Host killed himself to stop our fight. I go back to the shrine, level up, and stop to reflect on everything that happened.  I earned a bunch of souls, got my covenant item, and killed my host (kind of)...but I feel like a terrible person. No wonder the Mound Makers are crazy. This ♥♥♥♥ is intense.",

Having some framerate issues which was fixed when I turned down the Lighting and Shadow settings. Apparently majority of issues for most people are from the Lighting.   Pros: - Story - Character questlines are back! Although you will more than likely miss a ton of them your first time through the game unless you are reading up on a guide.  - Amazing Music - Seriously download the soundtrack if you can it's really really good(Warning: Don't do so if you haven't beaten the game as it may spoil bosses unless you don't care) - Game Locations - Small but packed with tons of objects and a fair amount of enemies unlike Dark Souls II where the areas were huge but seemingly empty - Graphics - Astounding, but still not optimized properly - Game 'Action Speed' - A nice midpoint between the other Dark Souls games and Bloodbourne - Combat - Unbelievably crisp and solid in comparison to the previous games, some builds are broken still and should be balanced soon - Bosses - Some gimmicky bosses, however, that doesn't change the fact that there are many enjoyable ones. - Optional Bosses have really cool zones and one of them particularly took me more tries to solo than all the bosses in the game. - Online gameplay - Netcode seems to be decent similiar to Dark Souls II maybe; haven't had much of a problem with PvP or Coop - References to the previous games (Some may not enjoy this as there are a lot of references to the first Dark Souls and Demon Souls) - Tons of Dank Memes  Cons: - Bosses sometimes become invincible when summoning other players (Is it really a con? Just git gud and play solo) - Bosses seem to be not balanced around coop - Bosses hp still seems too low in early game - If you hit an illusory wall while running you may fall underneath the map which may lead to an amazing adventure - No Windowed Borderless Screen Option (mainly just a con for me) - Currently there are some issues with specific covenants where you will be summoned into a world to complete a specific task and then are immediately done with your task upon just entering the hosts world - Motion Blur - who actually plays with it on? - Bandai Namco - DLC isn't out yet....  Do I recommend this? YES YES YES! Even if you haven't touched the Dark Souls series you can hop right in on this one. I'd highly recommend going solo your first run through since bosses are not balanced around coop yet. Don't like the PvE portion of the game? You can start PvP right after the first tutorial area if you desire to do so.",

            "review_text": "I actually held out a lot of hope for this game since Miyazaki was returning as one of the Game Directors, but I've never been so disappointed. For reference, I have played Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, and Bloodborne prior to this. I did not play Demon Souls or Scholar of the First Sin or any of the DkS2 DLC. This game is great in so many ways and improves on a lot of the features of previous Souls titles from crafting to unlocking spells, weapons, and other purchasables, and even brings the player back to a Dark Souls feel for combat and character control compared to Dark Souls 2, including the i-frames on dodge rolls not being nearly as few as they were in Dark Souls 2.  All the praises I could give to Dark Souls 3 are unfortunately thrown out the window due to some critical flaws in the game's design. Let's start with some of your first experiences in the game...  Minor Spoilers for the first boss fight, nothing story-related, but you've been warned.  First boss, Iundex Gundyr - Pretty easy and very enjoyable first phase, really gives you hope for what the rest of the game offers. Second phase? Explodes into a giant black mess of goop that covers your entire screen and is near-impossible to read. I actually managed to beat him on my first try, but it required all estus flasks and I had a sliver of health left. This was a warning for how the game design policy had evolved, which I flatly ignored. I feel like I got pretty lucky getting away from that fight unscathed. It also helped that I started as a Warrior, so I had a decent health pool and good starting damage. My gf chose Deprived and struggled significantly more with the boss than I did.  Early-Game Estus Flasks So, they decided to carry over the DkS2 style of Estus Flasks, where you start the game with very few estus flasks, and it takes a while to build that amount up and certainly to, beyond that, make them effective with bone shards. I don't even want to imagine what it must be like as anyone who relies on FP because you also have to allot your estus flasks. Sounds like a great idea for late-game and PvP absolutely, but you're going to be very frustrated as many early zones feel like a game of attrition as you're trying to explore and collect all the items so you don't have to come back later after you're well past that area in the game to grab a few things that were probably more useful earlier in your playthrough. Especially with how much more damage enemies have started to do in DkS2 and DkS3, and many other BS things they added, your main concern should really be whether or not you can survive individual engagements or coordinated encouters such as ambushes, rather than worrying about your estus flask management in early zones. You will probably find yourself using homeward bones at least once in the first three zone before finding your next bonfire for the fear of losing all your soul progression.  Enemy BS in a variety of forms Lots of enemies have been designed to make the game unfair for you. While most people have a misconception about Dark Souls games, I recall Dark Souls 1 to be a refreshingly challenging experience. It was hard not because it was designed to be unfair, but because that kind of challenge was new to me. You're an undead fighting Kings, Dragons, and borderline Gods, you're supposed to hurt, but as my 5th grade teacher properly dichotimized the terms of 'hard' and 'challenging,' whenever someone would complain that something in the class was hard; Something that's 'challenging' is by no means insurmountable, and something that is 'hard' is not made to be broken, it's made to withstand every blow it takes. So, the first instance of some serious BS in the game is the black goop enemies you fight in the first zone, and occasionally further on in the game. Much like Iundex Gundyr, they take up your entire screen, but they also have massively wide arcs in their attacks and are near-impossible to read. Now, you can certainly kill these enemies before they explode into black gore and personified frustration, it was not something I was ever favorable enough to do, and some starting classes may have more difficulty than even I did in accomplishing this. Enemy Tracking is another great piece of BS they decided to exarcerbate in this iteration of the Dark Souls universe. Some bosses will share this trait as well, which is very disconcerting, but you'll notice a lot of enemies whose attacks will track your character during the entirety of the attack animation. This makes it very difficult to dodge or position yourself with dodge rolls or normal movement and is nothing less than artificial difficulty that will leave you tightening the grip on your controller every time you die to an enemy that will spin 180 degrees around towards the end of his attack animation to catch you after your dodge roll finished because you thought, as with every other Souls game, dodging early to gain a positional advantage and allowing yourself for a large enough window to punish enemies was the smart thing to do. Not in this game. You are forced to dodge roll as they complete their attacks, especially if you want to dodge the follow-ups which will also track you, and this makes your punish windows much smaller in this game for no logical reason other than to try and market the 'challenge' of Dark Souls. Too Much Poise! A lot of zones will have some signature enemies that are made memorable for their challenge or unique mechanics. However, this neat concept is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized by making powerful or cool enemies, especially those with fast attacks and very little down-time between those attacks, have incredibly high poise. Even as an UltraGS user, I had difficulty poise-breaking a lot of enemies. One of the greatest examples of this are the Goat Monkey Fire Sorcerers in Demon Ruins. They can take a fully-charged R2 from the Profaned Greatsword and still retaliate without flinching.  No Input-Queueing Yup, no input-queueing. That's great, right? A step in the right direction for DkS3...except...it's not. Input-Queueing was actually insanely useful in previous Souls games. You just had to stop spamming and know that your character will do what you want it to. The importance of input-queueing actually exists in the reaction time it offers. Life or Death comes down to fractions of a second in Souls games, and input-queueing makes it so your input will activate at the next possible opportunity. As long as you know the game and trust your inputs and don't button-mash, you will be better than okay. In Dark Souls 3, removing input-queueing means you have to button-mash in order to react on the first possible frame. You know how you have to button-mash to get the roll or backstep at the bottom of a long fall to avoid the momentary stagger? Imagine doing that all the time on all bosses or enemies that combo you or poise-break you or knock you down, or...anything! It's very uncomfortable and, in my opinion and people may disagree, less skillful. Ironically, the only semblance of input-queueing is in dodgerolls. This was definitely one of the biggest peeves in Dark Souls 1, no pun intended, of anyone who played was the random dodgeroll. It's not quite as bad in this game, but if you try to dodgeroll an attack but get hit before the dodgeroll executes and are poise-broken, often times on boss fights, you stagger and then dodgeroll after the poise-break ends. This becomes a very huge problem because a lot of bosses in DkS3 are designed so that they combo in specific intervals to counter people who spam evade. The follow-ups last just long enough that they hit you after your dodgerolls ends if you dodge reflexively to being hit once. That is really smart and enjoyable gameplay, but when your dodge is queued after eating the first hit and you are forced into a 'reflexive dodge' you didn't intend to perform, the boss gets 2 free hits of damage onto you, and then you could very well be dead.",

The animations are from DS1 for some reason; I don't know why they didn't just use the better looking stances and animations from DS2.  Weapon-arts are barely used and when they are it comes from dual-wielding weapons that have riduculous locking spins that are hard to escape from.  PVE is still easy, most enemies can be backstabbed or cheesed by running around them constantly, and the amount of enemies or RIGs that have been copied and pasted is riduculous.  Also people ♥♥♥♥ on DS2 for its boss fights but this game is no better, and for greater insult, Miyazaki copies stuff from DS2 and he barely worked on it and most of the DS community ♥♥♥♥♥ on DS2 as being the worst.

This happend in 3 bonfire areas (One being the DLC Area) How I went aroud this is I just ran to a differant bonfire or loaded the one before it which made the game last a little longer! Apart from this game was perfect ran smoothly and it was fine.      New Game Is to easy?!    Since i have played all the souls games I was worried when I started name game+ I was going to get my butt handed to me since i have before but honestly the game doesnt challange you as much in new game this time around which upset me in many ways.    PVP    The PVP is fantastic and fun. I play full pyromancer in PVP and will forever love it since Dark Souls 1. The only slight problems is with some weapons hitboxes are a tiny bit off but that is all everything is fine as I have found out so far nothing else apart from a bit of lag but thats just me.    Verdict    This game is good and you should enjoy most of your time in the game. The game is full of bonfires making the game easier for new people and newbies. The game is only super annoying when you have the bonfire start up glitched. (Message me if you have problems with this glitch and ill try my best to help you out). The story in the game was alright i didnt listen to most of it and skipped threw alot of it but main points seem to be a good reason to kill all these poor creatures. Anyway i would give this game a go and im stilll playing it alot more and more the more free time i have. I would buy this game and play the hell out of it if i was newbie.

They should've continued that in the Bloodbourne IP, and kept the system that made this title what it is. It almost seems disingenuous to suddenly change the combat in the final game of the franchise, and replace it with a combat system from a different franchise. I understand that in order to evolve the IP, and make each entry feel like it isn't just a copy-paste of the previous one, the dev had to change some things and upgrade various aspects of the game, but anyone would tell you that changing the fundamentals is a big no-no. Good game if you rate it on its own, but if you take its predecessors into consideration, it's quite lackluster and has this - I don't know how to properly describe it - cheap plasticy feel to it.",

Pro's:  -Music is great and only used in moments where it needs to be.  -Graphics are amazing, for some reason I had kind of bad performance at medium to low settings, but after changing the settings to ultra (except blur and the like ofc) it ran better xD. Don't ask how, I don't know.  -Gameplay is way faster then ds1, but is still really good. Another bit that might hopefully get changed, not all classes are created equal, I played as a melee class and as a sorcerer, and I can tell you that where I could finish the game + all optional bosses solo when playing melee. When playing as a sorcerer I just couldn't pull some bosses of, even when over leveled.  -Incredible enemy + moveset variety.  -Movement is really good.  -I enjoy the pvp, which I never did in ds1.  Cons:  -It is a bit more linear then ds1, boss kill order is not as free as ds1 but still pretty free. Mostly I liked how ds1 was connected through shortcuts instead of ds3's bonfire spam. (yet there are still loads shortcuts ofcourse.)  -Not all covenants were created equal, while the Watchdogs of Farron, the Sunbro's and the Aldritch faithfull are absolutely great covenants.   The Blue Sentinels and the Darkmoon covenant fall flat on it's ♥♥♥♥, they're 90% the exact same covenant, they get summoned when a host has been invaded by a dark spirit, but not when a host gets invaded by a Watchdog of Farron or Aldritch Faithfull or when summoning an invader with a red summon stone.   This makes that 99% of the active PvP is excluded from the Way of the Blue and Darkmoon covenant. But even if the rare thing happens where you get summoned, there's a large chance that the host is dead on arrival, or a connection error ocurred or similar.   -Netcode is kind of rubbish.  Conclusion. -Once they fix the cons and get their anti cheat system up to par this will be the greatest rpg in the world.",

The Boss Fight is very easy relatively but only in the early game, the closer you push to the end the harder bosses become, Is very reasonable design. Some old fans maybe think this is too friendly to the player as a Dark Souls game to say, but I think this brand is popular now, so is necessary to be a bit 'Normal'.  The graphic is great and beautiful, but not revolutionly, I still think DS's environment designed is better ----more beyond my imagination. and a very important point is----this game is completed! not those kind of fuXX game than sell half and make the rest be DLC. Dark Souls 3 not even is a completed game and have hided level, and the price is cheaper than most AAA game.  If you want to know some disadvantage of this game, I can only say the online playing is still laggy as usual, but we all used to it. and From Software pulish this game in JP early after then is popular Youtubers... and finally to all player in the world! I can say this is a bad move.  In conclusion, this game is 8.5/10, one of the best you can buy on Steam. but still could be better on Online System or maybe the story can be more touch to the deep of the heart, about hope and hopeless.",

            "review_text": "my old review I left below for reference, but the many patches have fixed a lot of the game's issues and I am now quite happy with it, although I still think Dark Souls 2 was better for PVP. Dark Souls has always been about being hard but fair, Dark Souls 3 mostly stays within those bounds. Stunlock is a big part of the game now as poise does not function the same way it used to, they should have named it something else. As a result you can be stun-locked to death unable to move or retaliate at all by groups of enemies, so timing and group management is more important than ever. The new weapon skills and twin weapons are really cool, but power stancing is gone. Magic has been patched to be much more viable in PVP, but is still less powerful than Dark Souls 2 (although that is probably not a bad thing). Ganking is still a problem in PVP as the password ability had made friends grouping up quite easy and not everyone is honorable or skilled enough to want to go it alone. I prefer to goi it alone myself, you get much more of a feeling of accomplishment when you can take a group of 3 on by yourself. Fromsoft is working hard to balance the stats on everything better for PVP and end the cancerous estoc problem (dark sword isn't really a problem IMO). The boss design is not as creative as in the past on the whole, but is still really cool and some enemies like Aldritch are really neat ideas from a lore perspective. The story is much better than that of Dark Souls 2 and they now have 4 different endings which is a nice addition. I would now reccomend this game after the patches. 8/10  only buy Dark Souls 3 if you want a PVE experience, the PVP is currently massively unbalanced as of this review (more than a month and a half after release and multiple patches). magic is useless (lmagic is somewhat viable now) in pvp atm and melee is the only way to go, greatshields are way OP (particularly havels shield), poise works correctly but is useless now (so stupid), and the estoc is once again OP as heck too. A big disappointment compared to Dark Souls 2's pvp experience. The PVE is pretty good, but I still think DS 2 was better. another big problem is seriously laggy pvp, getting hit by a blow that missed you by 10 feet is very obnoxious.  sooooooo many more patches needed.",

All of the effects look really good, textures don't seem muddy or blurry (even when your not maxing out the settings). It should be stated that the game is really well optimized for those with less powerful PC's. (An example of a poorly optimized game: The Evil Within).   A lot of people are saying that this is the easiest of the Souls games. I think I disagree. We, as members of the Dark Souls following, have played tons of hours in this still blooming genre of games. We have conditioned ourselves. We are just better at the games now. I would expect to see much more challenging areas in the forthcoming DLC. And if you need more of a challenge out of DS3, hop into any of the NG+'s. This mainly adds more challenge to the bosses (late game specifically). NG+'s can get really brutal.   If you are looking for a better Souls game than DS2... If you are looking for a little more of what DS1 had to offer... You have come to the right place. It might fall behind DS1 in a couple of ways, but it is right up there with it.  I think that the game will only get better with more updates for balance and such and DLC to add more challenge.",

Cuckolding is something more than just humans do sometimes, it originates from Cuckoo, a bird that looks like another bird when it's a baby, lays it's eggs in the best of another bird, and when the chick hatches, it pushes the other eggs out of the nest to get there most attention from the parent birds. In the time of Shakespeare calling someone a Cuckold was saying you're taking care of another man's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is the sexual fetish of a man watching another guy have sex with his SO. Sometimes while dressed as superman. Cool, then there is the modern meaning which if someone who gives up their backbone politically to be 'on the safe side' of society. Edgy. So using any of those descriptions how does one 'cuck' a future wife? Is that in reference to his girlfriend? Do they have kids? My assumption is it refers to a woman he hasn't met yet because he's busy stacking coins rather than meeting a woman. I know of a story that might clear things up for you 'According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!

We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! 'What's the difference?' How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!

I hadn't touched DSIII in a while, and I finally had the financial courage to spend $25 (some of us are poor lol) on the season pass to get the DLC. I began the new DLC by just trying to figure out how to access the content.  After giving up in just a few short minutes, Google was my friend to point me in the right direction. I accessed the DLC and what do you know? I died. I immediately felt right at home again, havning not played the game for about two months. I spent about six hours running through the DLC on my day off, and completed about 98% of it (there's a couple of corners that I haven't hit and I know items I missed, but the gist of it is done.)   I thought the content was fantastic, and the main boss battle was rough. It was definately a challenge trying to complete it, even with multiple players to assist me. Even with all my building, leveling, and upgrading, I was still very hard pressed to ensure I wasn't messing up, and if I ever did, the game didn't let up, and took the time to make it very clear that it wasn't going to care if I had the best stats and gear a player could muster against it. Even mobs were destroying me with ease, and it felt great to stand up to the challenge the developers took the time to ensure I had.  The main thing that urged me to play again though was the PVP. I was big on playing PVP in the game, and loved spending hours just messing around with building, fighting, modifying, fighting, and then just scrapping the whole build for a new one. I ran through matches and loved the competative nature of it all, and enjoyed kicking someone's face in, even though I was likely going to get stabbed in the back from someone else.   It really gives a new feeling to a very oversatured multiplayer market online. There isn't anything that feels like DSIII, and that's, in my opinion, what makes it great.   Conclusion: If you are weary of spending the $25 on the Season Pass, don't fret, Ashen One. Let the Flames guide thee.   ===Original Review===  10/10 I died so many times and loved every second of it it.   1. Invested 63 hours in just my first playthrough with dedicated PVP time. I never encountered a hacker through the entirety of it. HOWEVER, I do think that the current punishment system is broken and should be fixed.   2. This was my first game from From Software. I hadn't even heard of any of their titles but this game makes me seriously consider going back and playing them, atleast all the Souls games.   3. Even new to the series, it was fun to tackle the learning curve, and eventually overcome it and gaining technique to continue fighting and eventually beat the game.  4. The PVP system is unique to any game I've played, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite getting my face smashed in by a few invaders.   5. This game is an emotional rollercoaster, and I'm not talking about the story. The gameplay alone is enough to make you scream, cry, break stuff, and celebrate, jump for joy, and drink yourself into a coma. I've never played a game where I had become so mentally and emotionally involved in just beating it because it was such a challenge.   6. The story may not make too much of sense to those new to the series, but I spent a long while digging through the lore and it was amazing how much effort they put into creating new stories, forging alone the current one, and tieing up old stories. Going into the lore, I realized all the backstory I was missing by going through the game as a new player.  7. In my opinion, this is the best game I've played in a very, very long time. I'm glad I invested into it, and I am ready to another playthrough.   8. You will die with a large sum of souls (points and currency in this game), and you will lose all of them trying to retrieve them. It is merely a fact. I've lost hundreds of thousands of souls in this game, but learning to keep going is important in a game like this.  9. The messages on the ground will be just trololing 2/5 times.   Conculsion: This game was worth the investment, and encourages several playthroughs for different story chains and endings. While the PVP punishment system is broken, the overall PVP system is very fun and competative. Running through this game will be extremely challenging on your own, for both new and old players to the series, and while running with a friend or two helps, boss fights scale to multiplayer, so be warned. I think it's worth the trade, though. You will enjoy a beautiful game that was very well designed and looks great. You will get an occassional invisible wall (I think some of them were placed on purpose). If you see a structure out in the distance, its likely you will eventually end up there somehow.   Overall, if you buy this game, get ready for an awesome experience. I promise, you will never love dying so much.",

An unforgiving and unforgettable game experience in the depths of learning and personal achievement. The game starts by an incredibly hard trial after few minutes to tell you its message : you deserve to play It but before that the game deserves your commitment. And it's a matter of trust between the game and you : you will face incredibly hard trials and die hundreds of times, but each failure is just a lesson to set you on the tracks of perfection.  As time passes and you progress into the game, you become enlightened : you can read the enemy's movement and adapt to the situation. Their movements become predictable, and you can dance with them unharmed, before striking a lethal blow.  And you become more confident, at least until the next empty great hall, mist curtain or dungeon entrance. You thus proceed with caution, and your confidence now turns to prudence, and as you proceed through the unknown you wonder what kind of fiends awaits further down.  The game feels a long rough path along an incredibly sloping difficulty curve, balanced by extremely rewarding moments of victory, contemplation of the massive architectures, deadly creatures and titanous adversaries. A journey through the lands of the dead, ancient gods and abyssal creatures : from ancient castles to the depths of the abyss, through fallen cities of the past, and up to the skward palaces of the gods.  Do not expect a game where you will passively observe your character in all his might, but expect be given all this might and learn to unleash the power by yourself. ",

            "review_text": "The game is top quality, as you would expect from From. Although, in comparisson to past titles, it lacks in two major points: 1- The world: in Dark Souls 1, you were tossed into this place where you had to progress even though you had no idea where to go. You would explore, open shortcuts and realize you went back to where you were a few minutes ago, but had a new, easy way to progress. That meant the whole world was connected, and it was really what made that game so loved by its fans. Sadly, in Dark Souls 3 you just warp to the next obvious checkpoint, making going back to past areas really pointless. 2- Poise: I know this is seen as an argument from a salty fan but the poise removal really affects the way the game feels. This should be Dark Souls, not Bloodborne. In Dark Souls, you were supposed to be able to choose to be a tanky character that trades hits instead of dodging attacks, and hits hard when you land one yourself. Without poise, you don't have that option. Any fast attack cancels your own. This is bad, especially in PVP. With that said, I still think it is a GREAT game with great atmosphere (even darker than the ones before it) and great replayability. Buy it, maybe they will patch poise :)",

I HIGHLY recommend this game. I have played every souls game (minus Bloodborne but I watched ENB play through that) and this was probably the most accessible. Now, souls vets might not like this, but I do as it means that more people can get into this amazing series. Miyazaki designs games beautifully, souls games are known for their difficulty. But what you have to understand is this game isn't a 'run in, slash everything in front of me, pick up all the lootz, ????? = profit'. You have to learn every enemy; their weaknesses, their behaviour, their strengths. EVERY enemy can mess you up if you're careless.  Another thing that is great is the story. I don't mean just the cutscenes. I encourage you to read every item description, speak to every NPC, go back to old areas even when you're 5 bosses past it. The world changes as you progress and I can't even begin to worry about New Game Plus until I've bought every armor piece, found every last morsel of loot, killed every enemy until I have their set and leveled up my favourite weapons.  TLDR; Just have patience with every enemy, read the item descriptions, speak to everyone, visit earlier areas well into late-game, I really like this game.",

And it plays out very well, yes it has some flaws but more on them later. Since there is a lot to cover i am going to split this review in to three categories - Gameplay, Single player and Online play.     Gameplay   Lets start with gameplay. If you played any other souls game you will be familiary with controls and yes there are some tweaks from previous game but its small changes you are going to learn pretty quick. Most noticable difference is that the game is more fast paced thanks to Bloodborne. Another addition to gameplay is weapon art and FP bar (mana). FP bar determines how many spells you can use and it determines how much you can use your weapon art. Weapon art is uniqe skill for every weapon. It differs from backstep with dagger to buffing your sword with fire for a period of time.    Single player   One of the strongest part of this game is its lore. Thing with Souls game is that most of the lore is hidden in item description so you should read them if you are interested in it. And best thing about this game is probably its bosses. Every souls game had great bosses but i am pretty confident to say that Dark Souls III has some of the most amazing bosses in ever.     Online play   As usual there is a co-op and PvP. Both of them stayed pretty much the same. Which works for co-op but not for PvP. Since the game is fast paced like Bloodborne magic is utterly useless and same goes for miracles and pyromancy (only exeptions are buffs) and that essentialy removes all of those elements from PvP. Another thing that is kinda annoying is a fact you can use estus as invader. Probably the worst part is that there are no PvP arenas. And don't get me wrong i like PvP in this game its just gets repetitive after a while.     Overall rating   To summarize things up Dark Souls III is amazing game with few flaws. Yes the PvP gets repetitive after a while and magic is useless but i don't regret single penny spent on this game. For me its 8/10",

DSIII is meant to be played on a controller, do not bother buying if you only have a KB&amp;M as you will only be disappointed.  DSIII is all about patience and patterns through trial and error. I died atleast 100 times before the first boss, but never in any game have I had so much fun dieing.   I highly recommend this game, the online co-op/pvp has a lot of depth and the game environments itself are absolutely stunning.

            "review_text": "As a big fan of Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II, I am greatly pleased with Dark Souls III. The gameplay is closer to DS2 than DS1. The game mechanics are great. I love the idea of using focus to cast spells instead of having a certain amount of casts like in the previous games. Magic is a valuable playstyle.   I found the bosses' design more creative than those from DS2, although there weren't as much bosses. There weren't any cheap copies like there were in the previous two games (like asylum demon/demon firesage, Dragonslayèer knights, Ornstein/old dragonslayer) and the boss fights was interesting and diverse. There were very difficult bosses and easy bosses as well.  Enemies keep respawning (like DS1, unlike DS2). The poison mechanic is also changed in that it works wat slower than the previous games, making it less dangerous. Items are easier to use and the interface in general is great.   There are a lot of callbacks to Dark Souls 1, which you might or might not find a good thing. There aren't as many DS2 callbacks, if I remember. Story wise, it's the same as DS1 &amp; DS2 in that there's no clear story, but the story is hidden instead.   The combat system is great, but there're some instances that were very annoying and just seemed unfair. There have been countless times when my attacks were deflected by the wall or a pillar, but there weapons sometimes hit you straight through a solid wall.  There are some other negative points about this game, though. First of all, the game's map isn't as intertwined as DS1's. Also, at the beginning, the game might feel a bit linear, although that changes after the first couple of area's. In the different area's, there are a lot of shortcuts that can be opened (by opening a door or kicking a ladder). When it comes to the world, one other problem I have is the amount of swamp-like/watery area's, which are very annoying cause they slow you down and might poison you. There are at least 5 area's that I can think of (I won't spoil which ones).   Another problem there is are online covenant-related issues. There are some covenants that appear not to work (Blue Sentinels, Darkmoon, ... ). These covenants are supposed to send you to other players when they're attacked by invading players, yet you never get summoned. Cause some of these covenants don't work as they should, farming the items required to deepen your relation with the covenant becomes a big hassle because their drop rates are extremely small (I'm looking at the Proof of a concord Kept item).  The camera sometimes screws you over when tracking an enemy (I'm looking at the Nameless King). I have played this game with my controller, so I can't say anything about the pc (mouse/keyboard) controls.   There're a lot of other positive and negative elements in this game that I haven't mentioned yet because I currently can't think of them. Also, I might have mentioned more negative points (and went in more depth with them) than positive points, but don't let that mislead you about the quality and greatness of the game.   Overall, I loved this game and if you enjoyed the previous Dark Souls games, I advise you to purchase this game as well.",

As someone who is considered a gamer this is the perfect addition to any gamer's library. Dark Souls 3 blends all the challenge and style that the first and second games (which i am playing now) had, but with a new coat of paint and the best mechanics. Game play is very similar to the other Souls games, with the strategic hack and slash combat as tight and responsive as ever. Enemies swing their weapons with ferocity and a perfectly timed dodge leaves them open for attack. The newest addition to game play I noticed was the ability to drink your Estus flask while walking. Which is a nice small improvement. Dark Souls 3 also presents the best graphics in the series, as it should. The lighting and particle affects are nice when running on all ultra settings. Textures and shadows look good, and the artistic design is on par with all the Souls games. Meaning its dreary and spectacular at the same time. From skeleton infested catacombs, or a snowy valley city, Dark Souls 3 Graphics are great.   I believe this game is best played without any sort of walk through to maximize thorough exploration. Enjoy the challenge presented in combat, and enjoy scouring the land of Lodran for mysterious enemies and rewards. This game is the perfect starting point for new players in the Souls series.

There are changes I doesn't like comparing to the previous one, but i still a great improvement. However the technical issues are so big that I can't recommend buy it to anyone. Even if you'll be able to fix that crashes near bonfires by lowering light or wearing heavy armor, the connection is still so bad. It's not that bad as in the first game's port on the PC. But still there are tons of lags, glitches with animation, and if you plan to play with friends, just forget it. Now it can take like 15 mins to connect to each other, and that's not a limit at all. Comparing to this, DS 2 was nearly perfect in terms of connection and Internet play. That's why I recommend you to wait for a while, maybe there will be patches. But seeing how From Software ignored problems with PC ports of DS1 and DS2, I'm a bit pessimistic about that. ---------------------------------------------- Updated. Not sure why, but after the latest patch game stopped crashing on the bonfires even on max settings - before I had to set light quality to minimum or where a full helmet. Also coop signs started to appear in like 15 seconds (with password and when placing away from the the bonfire). Blue sentinels are joining usually in 30 seconds after invaders. The only problem I have, is that I still can't join any other game as Blue sentinel myself, but I can live with that. That's bringing the question.

The game world is coherent, we can see remote locations from different areas and it never feels like a mess, it really makes the game world feel more immersive and cinematic. My only complain about this game is that our character's attack animations are too slow compared to the mobs (they attack WAY faster, it often gets unfair when we get cornered by 3 ennemies or more). The same thing applies for bosses, they attack way too frequently and it's hard to hit them more than once (or twice, depending on your weapon) without getting hit.   The optimization is good, my game didn't crash once in roughly 70 hours of play but I guess it really depends on your GPU and such.   7.5/10. I highly recommend it. IMO It may not be as good as Dark Souls 1 in terms of lore, atmosphere and bosses, but it's still WAYYY better than Dark Souls II. I'll definitely give the DLCs a go once they get released.",

It is a journey of a game, and it has plenty of places to explore, a large variety of enemies, characters with distinct personalities and motives, and abilities you can use to your liking creating a playstyle that truly fits you.  If you are looking for multiplayer experience then you will have the opportunity to help other players, or invade them or simultaneously both at the same time. There are various in-game groups that will give you motivation via a simple reward system (per assist or per kill, depending on the group) that will give you a currency item, and you will be able to exchange it for something as you level up with that group by offering the currency to it.  I feel that it has the best online community right now, as people are not aggressive in-game, rarely you get to hear someone being angry, frustrated, and generally being an idiot with an attitude. Some players with a microphone (it is optional to enable as a feature) and the subreddit, and wiki on fextralife are full of information, and discussion about the game, from the mechanics to the lore and features.   On the subreddit specifically there's also presence of Namco's community manager, so you can get to know things almost directly from the developers through the community manager. This is a huge plus for me, since I've been a fan of Bungie for a while, since their Halo days where they kept a close tie with their community.  This game will offer you an experience; it will be a challenge in many places, and in others it will be easy fully depending on your playstyle, and ability to adapt quickly to the variety of location and enemies.",

The Bosses were all challenging in there own way but once you understood their moves it was like finishing a puzzle and the great rewarding feeling was definately felt at the end as usual. The only issue i would say ive had is the pvp. The idea of Dark Souls pvp has always been great but throughout the series they've never fixed laggy pvp. I love pvp and have learnt to compinsate for lag as im sure everyone has but as this game relies on pvp so strongly for covenents its a bit odd that this has been kinda shunted by Namco so hard. Havent experienced any hackers yet although like every game i know there out there but from the looks of other reviews it looks like it about a 1 in 30 people champ.

Idk what happened with magic i took ridiculous amount of buffs(3 rings, best staff, helmet, offhand dagger) and found out im as effective with css as 2 hits from my straight sword in quality build. Idk what happened with greatswords, my favorite weapon class for 2 previous games now seems weak, straight swords even after nerfs are still my go to weapon for pve, swing fast, cost little stamina and their dmg is barely lower than greatsword. Idk what happened with boss weapons, i dont think ive found one which would be truly amazing like curved dragon greatsword or lifehunt scythe.  But these are minor concerns  I know though what happened with poise despite pr ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they try to feed us... fix it already, if modders can do it you should be able too...

This review is for PvE since I van not played PvP and thus have no opinion on that subject.   TL:DR, skip to the end! List of Pros and Cons will be at the end too!    This game is a very good succesor of the other souls games, thus including Bloodborne and Demon Souls, in my opinion since they did not lose track of what was good and bad in the previous games. They combined the older Souls games' indepth (but easy to understand) leveling system and combined it with the faster paced gameplay of Bloodborne which made the game a lot easier imo, but also made it a lot more streamlined. The faster pacing you can get with this game also makes it more strategic imo since you have more ways too fight your enemy now. Weapon Skills also help, but at least I myself dont use the weapon skills on most weapons since they either take up precious FP or the skill isn't any good to me, but even though I don't really use them I still really like the fact that they're there.  But this game isn't just a good succesor, it's also a great game for new players since you still have to start somewhere and why not at this one. The backstory from the other games isn't needed for the most part since this one has it's own story plus references. The only reason I wouldn't want to start at this one is because you will probably have a hard time adapting to the slower paced older games, but this depends on the player ofcourse.  Gameplay wise I really don't have any complaints about the game, not even in comparison to the older games or other games like this, thus let's look at all the stuff aroiund gameplay like story, character building, little stuff, etc.  I myself am not much of a person for story and like to actually play more than listen to some old guy explaining stuff about the world and that's why I really like the Souls' aproach where most of the (back)story comes from items and other little things that you pick up whilst playing the game. For instance: Spoiler alert! The final boss actually uses a very familliar moveset at one of the fases of the bossfight. This ties this game to another game in the series.  Since I'm not really all that much of a story guy I really like it when you can create your own character and I love the little things they used in Bloodborne like saving templates and stuff that have moved over to this game and I'm also really happy they actually used the same classes as in Demon Souls which gave a little more variation and replayability.  Last but not least the fact that you can actually play in Offline mode is a blessing for PvE'ers like myself since I don't have to cheat the system to get this done anymore.   And for the one thing I didn't like about the game was that it was pretty short imo, only 60 + Hours with farming for Sunlight Medals, but this can also be contributed to the fact that I really think this is the second easiest Souls game, Bloodborne being the only one I think is easier. To be honest the short lifespan of this game isn't really all that bad since you needto go through the game at least three times to get all the items unles you ask someone to give you some of the exlusive NG+, NG++ and NG+++ stuff.    List of Pros and Cons (and I've added Neutrals which are more like noteworthy stuff that isn't really a Pro or a Con):  PROS:  - Awesome new weapons skills. - Huge aray of weapons with their own movesets. - Cool character customization plus builds (Skills). - A lot of (back)story with references to the other Dark Souls games' lore. - Offline mode for the PvE'ers among us. - Able to fight most enemies (if not all) in your own style. - Fashion Souls/Roleplaying. - Replayability. - There are more, but I can't think of any at the moment.  NEUTRALS:  - Way easier than the other Dark Souls games and Demon Souls, but this may be attributed to the fact that I had already played the other Souls games.  - Some builds are pretty lackluster to begin with, but get pretty awesome neer the second halve or even endgame. - I wish they had implemented some kind of trick weapon in the game since that was what most intrigued me in Bloodborne. - There may be more, but I can't think of any at the moment.  CON: - Too short (Hopefully the DLCs make up for this) 60 Hours with a lot of grinding/farming for items like Sunlightmedals.  - There may be more, but I can't think of any at the moment.   Overall a great game with awesome new features, but a little bit on the short side, for Souls veterans, but also a game that you can step into if you like these kinds of games. I believe the game is still worth the full price because of the replayability, but like I said this is all my opinion and I'm indeed a big fan of Fromsoftware's work.  If you've read everything, I would like to say I'm sorry for having you put up with all my typos and grammatical errors. Hopefully this review was helpful.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic addition and (supposed) conclusion of the Dark Souls series. The Greatest Hits collection of all 'Souls' games, which has it's cons, but makes a incredibly fun to play game. If there're things to have some nitpicks about, it's the combat build balancing and the fact, that the story feels too reliant on the first game. First thing is about the fact, that Souls went from ability to play shielded knight in Demon's without much issue to Souls 3, where your guard will be broken way too often to not be more reliant on dodges. While it's not an issue for my styles of play, it can annoy those, who liked to be more on the defensive as even simplest enemies will easily stagger them. Second thing is about the fact, that DkS III feels like a very unexpected direct sequel to the first game after a much more vague 'set in the same world and maybe even same place but many centuries later' second game. It feels like Silent Hill 3 after 2 decided to do 'it's own thing', except Dark Souls 3 doesn't tell us everything and ruin the mystique of the world. There's still magic in it's vagueness, but it often feels like the developers felt the need to close the story they told in the first game in the most definite way possible by making you re-live some of the old moments and even revisit some old places almost as you remember them. The game, in general, feels very much like a 'Greatest Hits re-recorded by a band many years later, with more experience and still a lot of passion' thing. And as with music records of this kind, sometimes the more experienced new arrangements of old songs lose some of their raw flawed beauty. Game never feels like it was done 'by the book'. It still surprises in many unexpected ways with bosses, twists to usual mechanics and such, moreso than other Souls games. It feels, again, more of a rich adventure with RPG, platforming, action, clever tricks and amazing levels, rather than a very good action RPG, Dark Souls 2 was. Which also means, that some of the nuances from 2 are also gone here. And some people won't like it. Some people won't also like that it's 'easier' than previous Souls games. Things are still deadly and dangerous and full of STUFF that helps or kills you, but you will rarely get truly stuck on some part. There are few unfun sections and not particularly good bosses, but the game this time around feels more generous towards the player. Punishing the mistakes, but in a less harsh way than especially Dark Souls 1 did. There are rarely ever occasions to farm for souls or upgrade materials, if you're thorough in exploration, it rarely feels like you're hitting a wall when you go forward - it feels like an hill you need to climb, but it's fun and rewarding, more than ever before. It feels like this is the balance they always strived for but couldn't really do right before Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. And PC version is very good, but with some issues. At the time of writing some people are having severe issues, though no one I know. But it's something to be aware of - PC configurations are very different, after all, and for some people there might be huge issues. For me, the main issue was strangely inconsistant, but high, framerate which sometimes screwed up dodge/attack timings by a lot. Hopefully, this will be adressed in patches. For now, I'm sadly putting this away and await for hopefully great DLCs. Don't dissapoint, From, the hopes are very high.:)",

It doesn't have the wonderfully crafted and beautifiully interconnected world of the original. It also abandoned many of the progressive elements of the sequal, such as the huge scope in how you built your character and the viability of many difffent builds, and the epic power fest that was dual wielding. It also doesn't bring much new to the table aside from the weapon arts. There is also a fair amount of recycled assests from 1 and 2...  However, that said, Dark Souls 3 is still my fav game of 2016 and I've sunk ridiculous amount of hours into it. The combat in the game is faster, more fluid, and wholey addicting. The world, monsters and armour designs are stunning, intricate and detailed. Co op remains jolly good fun, and for the first time in the series I've done a lot off pvp, which can be annoying when people cheese the fun out of it, but overall i had a blast. The bosses were a bit hit an miss, but some of the best in the series are here, like the Abyss Watchers, Nameless King, Yhorm and the Dancer. I also enjoyed the lore and characters of this one, especially our old friend the onion knight.  while there is a lot of salt on the message boards about DS3 (waah poise! waah invasions! waaah ganking phantoms) surrounding PVP, I've really enjoyed it, although without a dueling covenant it can become a bit stale after a while. Dueling and fight clubs are really fun, and although invading is not really my thing, I do like finding creative ways to troll people (like posing as an NPC and then doing something hilarious) coz I'm not nasty enough to kill someone most of the time. Invading can be fun when you have 3 on 3 battles though. Although lag and glitches will give you a headache, and there's still too much potential for ultra cheese builds to take the fun out of things ( fighting a one shot build using tears of denial = you lose every time or how that silly hornet ring that gives pretty much insta-kill on a parry), i went in with the mind set to just have a laugh, and laugh i did.   I've loved (almost) every hour with the game, despite its flaws and can't wait for the DLC. It really is a love letter to fans, and the new faster combat really did it for me.  Update 1 - First DLC Ashes of Ariandal is an ok diversion. It's gorgeous, and has some interesting lore implications which harken back to the original, but overal it is lacking in content. It'll only take 2or 3 hours, only has 2 (although spectacular) boss fights. The PVP stuff is pretty cool though, and it does have some interesting new items. hopefully the next DLC is much better.",

Unfortunately, their story always ends. Just like the anti-climax after completing a great book. It’s a certain sadness over such a loss, but also an emptiness because of what used to give you entertainment no longer does. It was just a story you got told or told yourself, and when it is done, it’s DONE.   This is where Dark Souls III differs. It is not just one story, it’s many, and how many and how they end is up to you. It incorporates an ambiguous story with a dark and adrenaline pumping, nerve wrecking, angst for what you are going to face around the next corner. All the while the feeling that you must avoid dying because of what you might lose. Now here comes what makes Dark Souls III REALLY unique. You can do all this while sharing it with friends and foes that join you or you join, or that invade you, or maybe you are the one invading, hunting down others for their precious embers?  Whatever path you choose, you will end up with many stories and a strong sense of accomplishment. Some stories will be made while alone, others can be shared with strangers and maybe with friends communicated only via a few gestures that cover the most basic emotions. You will affect other people and other people will affect as you travel across this strange and brutal land. You will die, and if you stick around you will learn to deal with it, most likely grow on a more personal level.  For myself, I needed this game. It got everything I didn’t even know I wanted.

Dark Souls III does try to stand out however, bringing faster combat, faster enemies and bosses to the table, while still maintaining a strong emphasis on patience and situational awareness the original Dark Souls had, albeit with a more linear world.  You once again begin the game with a short cutscene, with a little more to go on then in previous installments. The Lords of Cinder have left their thrones, and presumably you’re the one destined to fetch them like a kindergarden teacher gathering children for naptime. You quickly find your way to the Firelink Shrine to meet the new/old cast of characters, who greet you with the usual creepy cackling. Firelink Shrine feels a little more welcoming and safe than previous games, sharing similarities with the Nexus from Demon Souls as it’s almost entirely disconnected from the rest of the gameworld. Although it still carries the themes of Dark Souls unlike Majula from Dark Souls II, this new Firelink Shrine doesn’t really compare to the previous one in my opinion, I much prefered when the hub-area was actually in the centre of the world I was exploring, much like Dark Souls did.  You’ll find in Dark Souls III that it’s exceedingly difficult to go the wrong way, since Firelink Shrine now serves as a disconnected hub-world where you teleport to the areas you’ll be exploring. The world is still intertwined and connected once you’re removed from Firelink Shrine, however these intertwined pathways and shortcuts are only present within their own individual areas, while the original Dark Souls had pathways and shortcuts  between  their areas. A fine example would be that Blighttown was connected to the Depths, and Drakes Valley, giving you an option of which way you would like to approach Blighttown from. Dark Souls III has linear paths between areas, not offering any options on how to approach them.  Combat is improved in Dark Souls III, boasting far faster combat than previous installments and  weapon arts , which are a new set of attacks which are specific to the weapon/magic you’re using. However, they’re limited by the new FP bar(Focus Points), this helps to significantly mix up combat style, offering more variety in attacks. As previously mentioned, this faster combat is done in such a way that patience and learning enemy attack patterns is still highly encouraged, and due to the quicker speed of combat, there is less downtime when waiting for an enemy to be vulnerable. It feels different, and will take some adjusting - but it’s a welcome addition in my eyes.  The world this time around feels more like Dark Souls, unlike Dark Souls II. Providing that same depressing and grim beauty we have come to enjoy and love. Dark Souls III goes further with the entire apocalyptic theme, the land of Lothric truly feels like it's dying, like the world is coming to an end. The NPCs also feel much more familiar, some previous NPCs actually returning for this third game. The characters and dialog are much better this time around too, however it still leaves something to be desired, as many of the NPCs have almost nothing to say until the closing hours of the game, honestly giving me some frustration as I was playing. It’s a great improvement from Dark Souls II, but still isn’t much better than the original Dark Souls. Characters are mostly memorable, but much of the dialog is relatively weak.  The typical storytelling and lore returns to Dark Souls III, making the player put it together like a puzzle instead of clearly stating it. It’s also in a similar fashion to the original Dark Souls, not making the same mistakes Dark Souls II made. I was worried when starting Dark Souls III that any mention of previous Souls games in the lore would be fanservice, however it didn’t take long to realize that there was actually a lot of care put into what was mentioned. The only fanservice that I felt was being able to obtain the Sun Set, however this was obtained via a non-obtuse way and wasn’t just found lying about in a chest. Overall Dark Souls III’s lore and story is handled really well, and feels like a good conclusion to the series, regardless of the questions which may remain unanswered.  Dark Souls III isn’t perfect, the linearity compared to the original Dark Souls left me wanting, and many of the mechanics which were previously favored have been heavily altered and changed. Poise being the finest example as it’s essentially non-existent, which seemed to throw a wrench at the PvP community. Many of the covenant systems also seems to be broken or not very useful, which heavily affects the online play. It’s unfortunate that the last supposed Dark Souls game seemed to have really messed up the online play for PvPers, however the PvEers seem largely unaffected by these changes. Aside from these glaring issues, Dark Souls III serves as a wonderful sequel to Dark Souls, offering new aspects to the combat and spicing it up with its speed and variety in attacks. If you have yet to play a Souls game, I suggest playing Dark Souls before Dark Souls III, and treating Dark Souls II as a disconnected additional game, as you don’t need to play it to understand the other two games.  If you enjoyed previous Souls games for its lore and PvE, Dark Souls III provides much of the same with a few welcomed additions, however PvP has been significantly hampered due to the changes with Poise.

Unlike DS2 almost all of the bosses in this game are fairly memorable, although none of them are really that interesting to fight and the strategies for all but the gimmick fights are pretty much the same. It's not as stagnant as it was in DS2, but because I played through DS2 I think it just makes the aspect of very few 'unique boss encounters' stand out to me.  The game has lots of mechanical issues that prevent the invasion aspect of it from being very enjoyable for very long, these types of games are at their best when the devs just toss the idea of 'balance' out the window and you can permanently stun some low-level idiot and break all his armor and then he sends you a message telling you it's his first time playing, or suit yourself up as an unflinching death machine and hate-♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone with a fireball that does more damage than you can possibly have health at that stage in the game, as well as it being too early on for your opponent to even be able to upgrade his weapon.  But instead we get some overreaction to people that whined on reddit and the odds will always be in the host's favor yadda yadda yadda.  The game isn't even hard by any means as well, if you've played any of these games before you can just mash R1 through anything the game throws at you and get by without much difficulty.  If you're new to the series the big learning curve is knowing how to mash R1.  If you liked Dark Souls 2 you're literally just a waste of carbon and don't deserve human rights.",

DUELS are at least fair, dont complain if your enemy has op equipment, git gud  Overall: I HATE THIS GAME SOOOOO MUCH THAT I ACTUALLY LOVE IT MORE THAN OTHER RPG GAMES!! 7/10 because invasions are WORTHLESS, if youre looking for good pvp, play dark souls 2, dont waste your time doing pvp in this game unless your a childish ganker or a cancerous overpowered weapon spamming tryhard.",

It doesn't make any major missteps, the level design is consistently good and aside from one lategame boss the bosses themselves are all serviceable.  It's a game that doesn't do a whole lot wrong, but it doesn't do anything spectacularly either. Whereas Dark Souls 1 could be very up and down, it had lots of really memorable and amazing moments. DaS3 is kinda like DaS2 in that a lot of it's most important moments end up being kind of forgetable and this is especially the case with boss theme music. In fact the music has the exact same problem as 2 did; it all just blends together into a mush and you can't remember anything. But you can say the same for the bossfights in general; outside of one or two near the end of the game they're all just kind of... there. They're not bad or anything but they don't stand out either. This is kind of exemplified with the final boss fight; it's mechanically a really, really good fight (it's not ♥♥♥♥ing nashandra or allant basically). But there's none of the emotional build-up and impact of DaS1 or Bloodborne, despite the game trying it's best to copy aspects of the final fight in 1.  And that's really the only major flaw with this game. It's the 5th in a series, of which we've been getting 1 of each year for the past 3. I think there's immense replayability in the Souls formula, but at this point the Dark Souls setting is starting to get old. The reuse of so many different weapons, items, NPC's and enemies ends up hurting the game more than helping it. Not just in a sense of it being shallow pandering fanservice, but it actively hurts one of the main draws of the series: exploring and finding new things and new lore. I struggled throughout my playthrough to stay engaged for long periods of time because I was finding the same ♥♥♥♥ I'd always found, talking to same or very similar NPC's with no new twists and finding the exact same lore for the most part.  DaS3 really suffers if you've played BB or are already really invested and familiar the series. The callbacks could either be really fun to you, or they could make your eyes roll and wish for something new. Thing is we already got something new. BB used aspects and cliches of the series, but so much of it felt fresh and it was in a genuinely new and interesting setting and it was released a year previously. It already kind of felt like From and the Souls series had moved on, or were at least attempting to try interesting spins on the formula. But DaS3 ends up feeling like a step backwards.  That might not be a bad thing for you though and DaS3 is certainly not a bad game. I'm just very tired of the Dark Souls setting and didn't think any numbered sequels were ever neccessary. If you have less experience with the series, don't care as much and haven't played Bloodborne then this could easily be your fav of the series and you'll probably love a lot of things in it.",

For the most part. If you want less cancerous PVP, go play DS1.  I'll retract my current opinion when the issues this game faces have been resolved, doesn't necessarily have to be all of them.  About the PVE... its not DS1 2.0. I don't mind the less connected world. Lots of ambushes (DS2 tier of bad). World design is top notch (great seeing quality of this magnitude after DS2). Lovely animations from DS1, albeit reworked to a small degree. Great soundtrack. Color variety among the levels seem to be lacking, everything looks desaturated.

            "review_text": "GAMEPLAY Dark Souls III excels in pretty much every aspect but suffers due to technical issues. As expected the base gameplay mechanics are probably the strongest reason to play this game. There are the basic light and heavy attacks, blocking, parrying, and two handing weapons that many players will be accustomed to. There are also some new things to try out as well. By infusing some elements and mechanics from Bloodborne, the combat is strengthened even more. Something new to Dark Souls III is weapon arts, which spice up the combat even more. Though they don’t necessarily need to be used for regular combat encounters, when used properly they can make some bosses easier to defeat. There is one boss with which it is almost mandatory to use a particular weapon art to defeat. Some may find this gimmicky, but it was quite enjoyable. Pvp is also a good place to experiment with weapon arts.  The design and placement of enemies and bosses may seem familiar, but this is in no way a detriment to the game. Players are still given the heart pounding experience as they get their opponent’s health bar lower and lower. Battles taken for granted can easily go bad, but when cautious and calm you will usually be able to make it out of whatever situation you are facing. Knowing when to use estus flasks to heal, or take advantage of a critical hit that just staggered an opponent are equally important. When everything is clicking and an adversary is bested, there is the thrilling sense of accomplishment that every player remembers and looks forward to when they are defeated numerous times prior. The combat feels significantly faster, almost as much as Bloodeborne, which should not bother too many people. The other gameplay element that makes boss fights even better is the phased/secondary forms that they take after a certain percentage of their health has been depleted. Even if the change is as slight as movement speed or attack frequency, the player must be able to keep their cool and adapt to win.  Collecting items is a pretty big part of the game, and makes exploration of the dark and mostly unfriendly environments well worth it. Whether it be picking up an outfit off a long dead corpse, or attacking titanite lizards, it feels great picking up new gear. Many times the outfits and armor will have beneficial properties for the next or current area. It pays to be mindful of stats such as poison or bleed resistance when discovering what hazards and elemental damage enemies’ deal in a new area. Weapon drops can seem a little unsatisfactory or redundant further into the game, especially if the player has been significanlty upgrading a few weapons that fit their play style. Being able to sell items at will back at the main bonfire is a good remedy when finding weapons that seem unnecessary or unhelpful. One of if not the best improvement made for Dark Souls III is in regards to the cooperative play. Souls III has the best and most easily accessible co-op out of From Software’s entire role playing catalogue to date. There is a new option in the system menu to make coop, particularly with friends easier. This is the password option. When using this tool, players with the same password chosen will only be able to see summon signs of others that have also chosen that password. There is no level cap when using passwords, and the summon signs will appear almost instantaneously. For these reasons, it makes trying to cooperatively play through the entire game a very enticing option though it will require everybody to play each area/boss two or three times. Aside from this major enhancement the other general rules apply. The host must be embered (embers are Dark Souls IIIs version humanity/human effigy), and they must not have already defeated the area boss. The gameplay is the biggest reason to buy Dark Souls III, but it is not the only one.  LEVEL DESIGN/ATMOSPHERE The level design is impeccable and much improved from Dark Souls II. Although the entire world is not as intricately connected as Dark Souls, the player will find that there will be a good amount of well-placed loop backs and shortcuts to pre-existing bonfires throughout most of the areas. There are a few exceptions however, particularly in the later mandatory and optional environments. There are some lazily designed shortcuts that are not cleverly placed, and/or that don’t make as much logical sense. There are also a few bonfires that are placed way too close to each other; one comes to mind that is literally ten to twenty steps away from the previous one. As mentioned previously, this is only true for a small minority of the zones. Otherwise the level design is very well done. The world and lore are also very good even though the story remains a bit more abstract than most may be used to. Each area has some story to tell, that one can probably figure out by looking at the condition of structures, and the enemies within them. To add even more to the world are the NPCs that can be found throughout, with sub questlines that are easy to miss if not listening closely enough to what they say. Fans will also be delighted to see the return of some very awesome NPCs from the original Dark Souls. The atmosphere in about ninety percent of the areas is dark and depressing, which is not surprising, seeing as the word ‘DARK’ is the first word in the title. There are a couple more bright areas, one of which is optional and requires a few steps to get to. These are a nice surprise, considering the contrast that they provide to the overall theme of the game.  The other element that completes the atmosphere of Dark Souls III is the soundtrack. As with the other FromSoftware RPGs, the soundtrack is made up of grand orchestral instruments and prominent operatic choirs, particularly during boss fights. Although it may not be as good as some previous soundtracks, it does what it is supposed to and adds the final layer to the world that manages to capture a player.  TECHNICAL When it comes to the technical performance Dark Souls III has some shortcomings. Those who love unlocked framerates will be disappointed, as it is locked at sixty frames per second. There is also a weird issue with 7XX series NVidia brand GPUs and some AMD GPUs as well. If the lighting quality is set to anything but “low”, the game will crash. This happens when cloth physics on an object such as a cape and an object with heavy lighting effects such as a bonfire appear on screen at the same time. When the game first released, one would have to remember to switch the lighting quality back to 'low' every time they booted up the game. This led to some frustrating crashes. The issue with the lighting being reset has since been solved by a patch. Another minor annoyance is the fact that controller button prompts still show up when using a keyboard and mouse, making it harder for those who wish to use this input method. With that out of the way, the overall graphical fidelity is significantly improved from the previous titles. With this unfortunately comes some frame drops during some boss encounters, and when the save game indicator appears at the top right of the screen. Most users with a mid to high end graphics card will be able to get the game to run at sixty frames most of the time.  As it is Dark Souls III is a great game, which could have been amazing if not for the technical issues that it had. Still it is well worth the money and should be purchased for its consistent world, atmosphere, and stellar gameplay.  Gameplay 9/10 Level Design/Atmosphere 10/10 Technical 6/10  Total 8.3/10",

You'll run into T-posed players who'll just stand frozen and hit you. Invaders are horribly outnumbered, and are punished severly.  R1 spamming is greater than ever, poise is dead, estus chugging has amplified (no longer punishable), roll spam. Ultra greatswords have insane hyper-armor that make them completely immune to interruptions.  PVP is what keeps me around for Souls-games and currently its full of frustration and issues. For the most part. If you want less cancerous PVP, go play DS1.  I'll retract my current opinion when the issues this game faces have been resolved, doesn't necessarily have to be all of them.  About the PVE... its not DS1 2.0. I don't mind the less connected world. Lots of ambushes (DS2 tier of bad). World design is top notch (great seeing quality of this magnitude after DS2). Lovely animations from DS1, albeit reworked to a small degree. Great soundtrack. Color variety among the levels seem to be lacking, everything looks desaturated.  PVE is alright, not many qualms about it. I don't stick around for PVE though.",

Also the 'Knight Fix' is more of a might fix, but it won't solve your problems permanently. I am at the 4th boss fight and bonfires are still crashing it so this is a global bonfire issue. Your only saving grace is that there are so damn few of them that you can easily avoid them.

Dark souls 3 feels like the lovechild of Bloodborne and Ds1. It plays really well, doesn't feel like it was rushed and provides you with that familiar difficulty that applauds skill, unlike SOTFS where they just took the lazy approach and thought difficulty was simply adding more mobs to fight at once. There are areas in this game that have exactly that, but at least it feels like you can fight your way through it without feeling stupidly overwhelmed and emerge victorious.  That feeling of excitement through familiarity, the throwbacks to the other games, everything about this game just feels so right.  The areas are so well made with such a great use of verticality, making you feel like you're ontop of the world in some areas providing you with a view of almost the entire game.  I could go on and on about why this game is just such a beauty so ill just say this: If you are hesitant at all about buying this due to your experience with SOTFS (may have been fun but just not what you expected) or even just unsure about the game itself then I highly recommend buying this game.

            "review_text": "So after spending some time in Lothric I thought it would be a good idea to share some of my thoughts and concerns regarding the supposedly final installment of Dark Souls. I will stay out of most story related things in this review, to keep it as spoiler free as possible.   -  Starting with the PvE. It's absolutely phenomenal. The combat is probably the most fluid and fun I've had with a souls game. Stamina regens much faster, rolls are faster, everything is faster paced. There is a new mechanic called 'Weapon Arts' which really brings out the 'personality' of each kind of weapon. To use Weapon Arts, you must spend Focus Points(FP). If you played Demon's Souls, think of the magic bar in that game. It's essentially the same thing. If you did not play demon's souls, it's like a limited resource bar that is consumed to cast spells, miracles etc and Weapon Arts. It can be replenished by drinking from you Ashen Estus Flask, which has a limited number of uses, but you can choose to sacrifice charges from your normal Estus to give your Ashen Estus more chugs.  -  They yet again did a great job with enemy and boss designs, altough I feel the AI is a lot more aggressive, like bloodborne. But jesus christ, the dogs in this game is probably the most annoying ones yet. Kill the dogs first. Always.  -  Level design feels great, but not as great as Dark souls 1 did. Sad how they seemingly can't quite nail down that original masterpiece when it comes to shortcuts and such. Feels a lot like bloodborne.  There's a loot of connection to the original Dark Souls, if you're a fan of DS1, you're in for a real good treat.  -  Side quests here are probably the most tedious ones yet. There are so many 'if you miss this now, TOO BAD. CYA IN NG+' moments it's insane. I even missed out on an entire covenant because I missed something earlier in the game, and it was too late to fix it. So, yet again, you're off to reading guides if you want to stand ANY chance to complete a side quest and not screw up. While on the topic of Covenants, I might aswell mention that you no longer have to run back and fourth to join other covenants. Instead, when you get asked to join a covenant, you recieve a badge, which you can then equip to instantly join that covenant, and you can change covenant on the go, as many times as you want.   -  They added bloodborne's password co-op system, including the level scaling, so you can now co-op with your friends, regardless of levels. Good job FROM. This system is amazing.  -  The game looks amazing, and runs OK. Unfortunaly I have to keep my game on Low, but it's not much of an issue as it's absolutely beautiful, even on low. For reference, I have a R9 280 and a FX-6100 OC to 4.0ghz, and I get 60 fps in some areas, and never dip below 30. There's been several performance patches rolled out since release, so it's slowly but steady gotten better.  Moving on to PvP. I'm not too sure what to make of this yet, but it's not exactly loved, unfortunaly, because PvP is one of the big reasons a lot of people keep coming back to a souls game after they've finished everything in PvE. As an avid PvPer myself, I'm quite disappointed. The added mechanics such as faster movement, rolls and less stamina consumption that made PvE feel much better, unfortunaly made PvP take a step into the wrong direction. Not only that, but theres a few other things that made DS3's pvp feel worse aswell:    Can't be invaded unless boss is alive. Huge step down from DS2, that system worked so well.   Can't be invaded unless you consume an ember(Humanity/Human effigy) Again, they made it work so well in DS2, I really wish it had stayed.   Nearly ALL my invasions has been versus host+1 or 2 phantoms. It seems like the game sort of priorities invading hosts with phantoms.    Blue eye orbs are gone, and with that so is the Sin mechanic. So the only way to get summoned as a blue is to pray and hope that people have Way of the blue covenant equipped. Not that much of a problem early game, but becomes a real issue later into the game.   Invaders can chug estus this time around, and it's not that much of a problem, the problem is that chugging is sooooooo much faster in ds3 compared to other souls games.   Backstepping just is not good anymore. It had it's use in DS2, but not anymore.   Guard break removed. Kick is back though.   Arenas removed. This one really hit me hard. I had a great time in in BoB arena.   Poise is nonexistant. I read somewhere that there is a poise system actually build in to the game, similar to DS1's poise system, but for some reason it's turned off. so you get stagged by pretty much everything, unless you attack with a weapon that has Hyperarmor.   With all this in mind, I can see a lot of people, myself included, going back to DS2 for their PvP fix, which I think is quite sad. I'm not giving up on DS3 PvP yet though.  - - - - -  So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Veteran or Newcomer, you're in for a wild ride for what might be, the final installment of Dark Souls. May the flames guide thee.",

            "review_text": "Great game, has entertaining PvE and PvP. Combat is the main selling point. High difficult with an extremely high expectancy to die often since the game is about learning the areas and adjusting. Enemies respawn when you die/rest to restore your potions (you get restorable HP/mana potions basically). You also lose all your souls (in-game currency) when you die although if you manage to make it back to where you die you can reclaim them all. If you die again before reclaiming your souls they're lost forever. Decent variety in what you can do PvP wise. You can invade other player's games using the red orb in which case you can get ember (increased hp and ability to summon other people into your game) as well as an item to unlock rewards from a covenant (NPC-based guild basically). You can also be summoned to protect people in their world against those invaders to earn a different reward for a different covenant. The remaining options in this type of PvP is to be the host (person who's being invaded) and fight or summon other players to protect you. The other type of PvP is a duel/fight club mode. You can summon/be summoned to duel somebody in your world or their world depending on who summoned who through an item you get that lets you place a summmoning sign on the ground. There are also 'fight clubs' that players make by summoning a bunch of people and letting them duel each other. This is most apparent in a later part in the game on a castle area that's fitting for dueling.  Pros:  PvP is very enjoyable and skill-based, although some balance issues with certain weapons, but overall a balanced game where you can upgrade most weapon and be viable in PvP. Spacing, maximizing i-frames during rolling, playing to your weapon's strength (animation speed, super armor, range, stunlock etc), and stamina management are the key parts of PvP.  PvP has limits on who you can invade/help that takes into account how good your gear is and the game automatically scales down people who exceed the range. This only happens when you and a friend set a password to bypass the restriction as far as I know.  PvE is surprisingly enjoyable as well coming from a person who loathes PvE in the majority of games. The knight type mobs are my personal favorite since they function somewhat like a player. There are also NPCs that can invade your game like normal players that function a lot like an actual player.  Cons:  Some weapons have questionable balance like the Estoc at least in lower tier PvP in the game. You basically spam thrust with it and can melt people.  The way the game calculates damage makes mixed damage weapons pretty bad. Quality builds (STR/DEX) or builds that combine STR or DEX with another stat like INT or Faith are mainly king in PvP. This reduces the variety in build opportunities that hopefully will be patched to let elemental infusions be worth it.  For PvPers, there is mild phantom range when fighting, but that is to be expected in this type of game since it'd be pretty miserable if you had to perfect connect with the enemy's model to do damage. Fights would drag on forever.  PvP invasions can be frustrating for both sides when one side refuses to fight. If you're invading it's often 1v2 or even 1v3 meaning the host just turtles back while spawning an infinite amount of people to help them should somebody protecting them dies if you can't catch them while they're fighting a mob (invaders don't interact with npcs unless the host uses a special item that cancels that). Invaders can at least return home using an item, but if you're the one invaded it can be frustrating if the invader refuses to initiate vs you and turtles at the NPCs you need to advance. Invasions are only enjoyable when it becomes 2v2/3v3 or etc.  *Minor con* Game could use more sets to spice up the customization since personally I only find about 3 sets visually appealing although there at least is a decently large selection to choose from. Comes down to preference and again is a minor con if not a con at all depending on your taste/preferences.  *Minor con* Another minor con is it'd be nice if the game just had a straight up PvP arena you could queue for with matchmaking and such. Would make dueling easier and more consistent since one issue I have with dueling is that you have finite HP/FP (basically mana) and eventually have to rest or rejoin/die if in another world.   Pro or Con:  There's lore and such throughout the game, but it's not much of a hardcore story driven game like many other RPGs. Low amount of cutscenes with the game being more adventurous trying to figure out where to go and finding loot. This wasn't a con for me since I personally don't often play games for their story given I prefer PvP over anything.  Armor doesn't mean much as long as you're at least wearing a piece in each slot. No significant difference in tankiness between armor. If you prefer more variety in builds this could be a con since there's no big enough difference for speed vs tankiness being an option as long as you weigh less than 70. This also however means you can wear whatever you think looks cool giving the game's customization more variety.  Controller is highly recommended for this game. This is can be a con if you prefer kb+m. I prefer kb+m and adapted quickly to the game's controller and enjoy it a lot. You probably still could use kb+m, but I think you'd need to play around with the key binds first.",

            "review_text": "Well what can I say? I love Dark Soul and I had big expectations regarding the new installment. After a little bit disappointing Dark Souls 2, I was worried that Dark Souls 3 will be only a good game too. Thankfully, unnecessarily, because Dark Souls 3, the same as Dark Souls 1 is a masterpiece. Miyazaki delivers.  The game is beautiful, may be not a technological breakthrough, but the artstyle is godlike. Some of the views are magnificent. Artstyle wise it’s the best game on the market (IMO). The same goes for music. Orchestral score perfectly fits fights with huge bosses, and in my opinion, Dark Souls 3 has the best soundtrack when it comes to souls/borne games.   When it comes to the bosses, NPCs and gear, I must admit that I’m very pleased. The bosses feature great design, and some of the fights are one of the best in the series. It’s hard to judge their difficulty as I’ve been playing souls games for more than 600h. I love the fact that there’re so many references to Dark Souls 1, as it’s my favorite part of the series. Of course there’re references to other titles too, even to Demon’s Souls.   Moving to locations. They deliver too. The areas are varied and feature many hidden paths and secrets. Some of the areas are located off the beaten path and player will not find them if he/she’ll not look carefully.   Of course the game has its flaws. Probably the biggest one is the net code. Very often one will not be able to summon phantoms, and if they manage to do so the phantom/s may be lagging.  To sum up, the game is great and everyone who likes fantasy or looks for a challenging game should buy Dark Souls 3. For me the game is almost as good as the first installment, which I thought would be impossible (Dark Souls 1 is my favorite or the second best game of all time). I can only hope that the game will become even better with the upcoming two DLCs.   EMBRACE THE DARKNESS! ",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls 3 - Good fun to be had in a game thats not perfect.  Pretty much just going to touch on the things i DIDNT like about the game.   1. The largest issue in my opinion is the scaling of difficulty of NG and beyond. Our group solo'd our first play throughs but we wanted to co-op on NG and beyond and get a good challenge that required teamwork. Pontiff and the Dancer (sort of) were the only 2 bosses that felt any increase in difficulty (or even scaled to having phantoms helping you). Furthermore there was no new mob placements and none of the boss mechanics changed, which is a downgrade from DS2's system of NG. **EDIT: Finished the game on NG+ with freinds, still has the same problem of low difficulty when attempting to co-op on the late game bosses. Nameless king was actually the most disappointing of the bosses in terms of difficulty. Last boss put up a bit of a fight but underhwelming. At this point we are going to start new characters and play goofy builds to attempt to make it more challenging on ourselves.  2. Overall the pvp is much better this time around, poise is still an issue but at least hits connect more often then not when they should. The largest problem here is the Sentinel and Darkmoon covanents, they needed a blue eye orb to punish sinners, or they needed the darkmoon faction being summoned when a sunbro was in trouble. WHEN the system works properly, you get some crazy invasion fights and i do love how chaotic they are.  3. Fan service is a little over the top. I loved Dark souls, but i didnt hate Dark Souls 2 as much as some, and almost all the fan service in this game in DS1, with very little to no mention of DS2. If the director gave up his role as lead developer to work on Bloodborn, he should of accepted the work and universe that was created in DS2 while he was busy. Instead this game basically ignores 95% of all content from that game, period. If i had to go further in depth, i would of prefered about 30-40% of the total fan service toned back and replaced with new and fresh that we havent seen. As cool as it is to have Andre as our blacksmith, thats a lost opportunity to be introduced to someone new.   Those are the 3 largest complaints i have. Overall i enjoyed the game, got my hours out of it, was money well spent and im sure the DLC will be good as always, just a few things that need to get patched up or reworked and this game could of been near perfect.",

Interesting bosses, most of them AREN'T big guys with a sword.  Soul Memory is gone! Thank GOD.   THE BAD:  Weapons have been slightly dumbed down from 2 and have copy/pasted movesets and sword arts, can no longer powerstance. Heavy weapons are too slow to punish both npc and player openings, and end up being inferior to swords, katanas or rapiers.  Enemies are really spastic, and do much more damage than any other souls game, dogs often phase through my raised shield and hit me, and not sensing that enemies half-second attack windup usually results in getting combo'd to death from full health.  Armor is now more about looks than protection and poise means absolutely nothing (they somehow made it more useless than 2's) which makes the spastic combo stunlocking enemies that much more of a more glaring issue.  Infusions are now borderline useless with the exception of strength or dex infusions due to them STILL keeping the system of having damage count against armor twice or more depending on how many elements your weapon is split into.  Boring, lifeless NPCs with quests even more cryptic than 1's, wave bye to that merchant, because you just accidentally sent them to their death because you didn't get to a point in another npc's questline first. Also the bonfire in 1 had more personality than the fire keeper in this.  Bugs bugs bugs, if its not a memory leak slowing your game to a stuttery crawl after a while, its outright random crashes, also having any sort of disconnect in your internet will kick you back to the main menu, resetting any potential boss fight you might have been in the middle of.

I can write a review after spending this little amount of time in the game simply because i have played this games pre-desessors and can easily compared them.  The problems that i have personally found; Level Design Mechanics Creativity Structure Layout Lazyness, i can see how much you have stole from other games  Level Design. Dark Souls 3s level design feels rather unappealing in a lot of ways but is generally okay, there couldve been more love and creativity in a lot of areas and I feel like they really didnt try to fully develop the game the way that they should. The Catacombs are the catacombs, the demon ruins are the demon ruins, anor londo is anor londo, undead settlement is bloodborne. I can feel the lack of fun and the more pressure being put on them by Bamco. This game has no original concepts and pretty much all of its features are mimics and stolen ideas from the previous games. This game feels to me as if Dark Souls 1 and 2 were smashed together.  Mechanics The new mechanic to the game has been on my mind since i first saw someone play this game and what i dont understand is the point of it. Dark Souls had its way of limiting spam casting and that was from the number of times you can use them, this felt to me like what we selected was an old scroll which could only be used so many times before it was unuseable. Now its ben turned into the equilivent of mana... NO, NO, NO, STOP. Yo udont change something that had no problems and especially not to replace it for something that is used in almost every other game...  Furthermore The game is filled with untested, or generally missing mechanics, hyper armor is finnicky on a lot of weapons and poise is 100% absent. People keep testing to find out what it does and so far every single one has been disproven. Some enemies and some areas are flatout ruined by this missing poise  If a new souls player isnt interested in the PvP, hes better off playing Dark Souls 1 since its a more challenging and, in my opinion, a better designed game. The world design is so much more intertwined and strung together geniously, and while the game is a technical mess being one of the worst optimized games ive ever played on PC, I still dont mind it  Gameplay is intended to be much faster than previous entries, and feels very different from the more methodical gameplay of Dark Souls II - Roll's are faster and have a much cheaper stamina cost. Unfortunatley, this also means that certain enemies and bosses spam ludicrous attacks that force you to roll constantly and hope you wind up in the right spot. The Dancer in particular has this problem, and I often found that the best stratergy in this game is to cheese bosses out and try and make their harder phase as short as possible.  The mechanics also lack depth - Powerstancing is gone, and because rolling is easier, the punishing and methodical PvP from Dark Souls II is gone, along with the build diversity. There's no powerstancing, no I-Frames on backsteps, and less varied movesets. Most of the time, there is simply no incentive to do anything other than R1 in both PvP and PvE. PvP suffers the most here - why bother using an R2 when your R1 will also stagger, cost less stamina, and will, unlike the heavy attack, combo into a second hit.  ",

Under all the blurry DOF and locked FOV is a really great game, no .. an entire lore, and actual boss fights that take time to master and deadly enemies that can ruin your entire progress from the last checkpoint if you're not careful.   At first i couldn't believe it, but this series of games is exactly what i had been missing all these years. And the soundtrack is beyond epic. The whole package is great so i went and bought the other Dark Souls games to catch up.   If you have the guts to work yourself into the mechanics you will easily get addicted as every won battle will be so satisfying that you just want more. Dying never made so much fun. Corpse running at its finest, but in a good way.   DISCLAIMER: this is nothing for people who are used to linear Action-Adventures and the like. This is an Action-RPG, meaning that grinding enemies for talents, gear and upgrades is essential. You will probably not see much of the game in the first 10 hours or so. Backtracking, stat management, talent builds and inventory managment is all needed. You will see the worth once you start doing so. I made the mistake and pressed on, but only made it harder than necessary.   It's different .. and just a little less forgiving. Be strong and enjoy! :)",

The game doesn't have the depth we've all come to love and expect from the series and has an underlying casul feel to it. NG+ is very uninspired and is nothing like DaS2. There are a lot of fan service and nostalgic moments along with great NPC lore but overall it was a very straight linear and unchallenging experience. I blame a lot of the dumbing down and simplicity on bloodborne so if you really enjoyed bloodborne you will enjoy this, however I would say this is borderline the worse souls game of the series. It falls victim to the modern day trend of leaving out content in lieu of future DLC packs which is pretty disappointing.    There are bugs and pvp issues galore but that's normal for these games in the beginning. Nonetheless after beating it twice already pretty easily as well I can't imagine I will play a lot more until the DLC rolls out. You need to make 2-3 characters to fully appreciate this game because of the level design, almost 60% of it is void for multiplayer if you are lv 60+. Overall its still a good game but as the last souls title in a glorious series it felt very empty at times and disappointing in the end. I was left with a sense of 'Thats it?' especially when it came to NG+ and other end game content such as PvP.   Ganking seems a lot more abundant this time around and so is chugging sunny D. High level pvp has been reduced to who has the better cheese, mid level is okay but the real action is low level pvp think lv 25 range hence the need for 3 characters. Overall the only 2 bosses that were difficult are Nameless King and Aldrich, everything else was pretty easy sailing. There were no ultra troll moments in the envrionments or traps and mazes to traverse through as well. 8/10",

My verdict on Dark Souls 3 is that it's inoffensive. It's basically boilerplate Souls. This feels like a yearly franchise formula game, loaded down with so much fan service references to Dark Souls 1 that it barely stands on its own. The game looks lovely but it's all just a bunch of ruined castles except for the village and library that feel taken from Bloodborne. The game is still the thematically goofy medieval fantasy pastiche we all know and love.  There's no level that's unplayably bad so Dark Souls 3 has Dark Souls 1 whipped thoroughly in that regard, and the level design is generally smarter than Souls 1's slapdash lazy design, but there's nothing especially good here. Just... BIG levels with three or four paths. Big for the sake of feeling big more than anything else.  The combat is an awkward mix of Bloodborne and Dark Souls, where the enemies are faster and you really aren't. Casters just don't stand a chance unless you reach the endgame just because the enemies hate you keeping a distance.  Worse still, poise is gone completely from the battle system. There is no way to tank a hit, every single enemy attack staggers you except for during rare heavy attacks where you have hyper armor. This drastically changes the pace of the combat where midgets waving their toothpicks around can easily stunlock you to death. This was always a Souls problem, but here, every single hit stops you cold and it is a net negative to the actual combat. It doesn't break it, but the game is worse for this decision.  The bosses average out to be pretty decent though.  All that aside, even an average Souls game is worth a shot, and there is nothing bad here (Well, the story is pretty awful, even by Souls game standards.), certainly not enough to turn you folks away from it. It's certainly more playable than Dark Souls 1, but not quite as good as Dark Souls 2. The only flaw is just that it's not all that interesting.  PvP is, as always, a cheesy imbalanced mess, but that's not changed a lick since Demon Souls.",

Endless crashing is the worst culprit, followed by horrendous glitches with the camera and getting stuck moving in certain directions from time-to-time.   I'm currently trapped in the Firelink Shrine as the game now crashes the moment I approach the bonfire. Some SERIOUS work is needed to fix this VERY broken game before I can recommend anyone put their hard-earned money toward it. I'm very disappointed that I cannot enjoy my experience due to these problems.   UPDATE: Tinkering with a few settings (disabling auto-detection of graphic settings and lowering Lighting to Low) took care of most of the crashing problems, and I was able to play to completion. Still not happy with the technical state of the game, though. Numerous game-breaking bugs are still present &amp; need to be addressed. Hopefully the next patch will change my outlook.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls III is an action RPG and the (supposed) final entry of the Dark Souls series by FromSoftware and a closure to Dark Souls and Dark Souls III. The game takes place in Lothric, the birthland of the fire, and allows the player to take control of an unkindled, an undead left to his/her endless sumbler. The unkindled is however soon awakened to embark on an important mission: finding the Lords of Cinder who still live in order to gather them to rekindle the First Flame and preserve the cycle.  From a pure gameplay perspective, Dark Souls III prides itself on taking the best elements from the previous games in the series (including Demon's Soul and Bloodborne) in order to craft the ultimate Dark Souls. The result is a game where aggression is slightly more important than the previous Souls and the player is tasked to find his/her way in far more complex and multi-layered areas. A feature back from the original Demon's Souls is a mana (or, better said, a focus) meter which is used both to cast spells and miracles and perform a weapon's special attack. Each weapon has its own focus move, which can either damage emenies in a certain fashion or perform some sort of crowd control. Special focus flasks have been introduced to regain focus: the player must decide how many flasks will be dedicated to health and how many to the focus. Another entirely new feature is a covenant, the Mound-Makers, that allows player to be summoned as mad, purple phantoms, who can either help or attack the summoning player as they see fit.  At the time this review is being written, Dark Souls III's meta-game is suffering from two major issues, however, which can affect both PvE and PvP: - The pose stat, which determines how many hits a character can whitstand before flinching, is NOT active, and therefore doesn't have any effect, on both the players and NPCs, althought it works for normal enemies and bosses. This makes wearing heavy armor kind of useless and strenght-oriented characters may have an harder time in PvE, since their swings are generally much slower and even the weakest enemies can stunlock them, if not careful - The potency of spells, hexes and miracles is somehow lower than in the previous games, unless the player uses all the rings and level up stats available to increase their power, therefore neglecting simple survivability, resulting in a weaker character in the long run. Pyromancies, instead, tend to be useful from the beginning of the game to its ending, especially the dark ones The main premise of Dark Souls III is about the player visiting a realm, Lothric, which is basically a crossroads between the different worlds and ages from the series. As such, the game features basically all the weapons, armors, NPCs and items the players have come to get used to through the various games, and at the same time tries to build an original experience for the final game. This kind of fanservice works wonderfully for most of the game, and the trip to Lothric really feels unique, but in other instances the pandering to the playerbase becomes REALLY obvious and many annoy some.  Another issue players may encounter in Dark Souls III is the rather obscure nature of the location of most NPCs and their related questlines, even by the series' standards. In this final game finding many NPCs and getting them to safety across the adventure requires either a good outside guide or A LOT of trial and error, as NPCS just won't appear at all or kill each other without the player being the wiser. This is especially problematic as basically half of them are also covenants leaders, meaning that losing them will cost you their covenant till the next playthrough.  It's safe to say however that any issues Dark Souls III may have doesn't change the fact that Dark Souls III not only is an incredibly solid and deep action roleplaying videogame that begs to be played more than once, but also a fitting end to a series",

For those who think it's just another bloodborne your wrong. There is only one zone that is right out of bloodborne the rest is strictly souls. The game is optimized very well in my opinion although I'm sure you will find a review or two that say it crashes and runs like ♥♥♥♥. I have had no problems what-so-ever running it 3440-1440 with g-sync enabled. It's also a pretty good looking game too! Their aren't a ton of graphical options to choose from but maxing them all out seems to get the job done. One thing I found nice about this entry is that starting a bon fire actually saves you there unlike the previous souls games where you would have to sit at one. This time around you get weapon arts which are a nice addition to the already great gameplay. From what I've seen so far each weapon has a different set of weapon arts, Or at least each 'Class' of weapon does. Over all if your a fan of the series this is a must buy. I also have played this on PS4 and the game actually looks pretty good on console but where the two versions differ (PC) - (PS4) are the frames and the resolution. The graphical side of things are pretty damn close. 9.5/10",

Some bosses seem a bit cheesy, it's just kind of something a lot of the games follow, but this one does it in a way that was very easily avoidable I'm not going to spoil it but one boss is more or less a mini dungeon, where another is just immune to everything but the windy airs.      Besides the poise issue I think the game is good and delivers just fine, better than the first two. If I had played DS3 first and then DS2 or DS1 I'd think DS3 is the better game for it's more optimized gameplay, no drops on blight, the maps are much better and unique, there seems to be more immersiveness in this game, perhaps that's just me though, the real lighting plays a big roll for me and the game actually feels a lot longer than the first two, a LOT longer. If you actually spend your time exploring in DS3 I do find it to be a very long game, people have been reporting thati t's a shorter game but let me tell you my experience with it was very different. It is indeed a FULL GAME at launch, and possible the best $65-70 you can spend right now. 9.6/10 It's amazing, I def recommend, it goes up there with my favorite games, while Deus Ex(original) looks from above.  just buy it it's worth.",

            "review_text": "If you've never played a Dark Souls game before, this is a great one to start with.   PROS: First things first; I say its a good start, because it is the easiest in the series. The motions are fluid, if a bit restrictive (once you play it, you understand what i mean), the graphics are amazing, the game is REALY well optimized, and, true to form, this game will make you want to play more, even as you have your a$$ handed to you. Even the first boss is a nice tutorial into the game. The enemies are a for the most part predictable, but dont let that fool you. Almost every enemy has one move that looks like another, but attacks at different times, which can make parrying and dodging a bit difficult if you don't pay attention.   CONS: OFFLINE: One of the major cons per gameplay is the F***ING CAMERA! it can go haywire at the most inopportune moments, which in a game series known for difficulty, can screw you over fast. TIP: You can rely on the camera but always be aware of your surroundings. If the enemy goes out of lock and you can't see him, it helps to know where he probably is and to know where the escape routes are.   Poise is basically nonexistant in this game compared to the others. With the heaviest armor (tested with a few invasions for authenticity) you will still flinch with the weakest weapon hit. Armor is basically just to help get another 2-3% damage reduction, which admittedly CAN mean the difference between crouching over and dying and surviving with a couple hit points.  The worst aspect of this game is by far the anti-cheating system in place to 'protect' online players from hackers. You can only realy expect the anti cheating sytem to work on people who were HIT with hacked weapons or people who PICK UP hacked weapons that other players drop. Trust me, the anti cheating system is the BIGGEST F*** YOU to honest players I have ever seen. Oh yeah, and just so I dont forget to say it, the anti cheating system will PERMA BAN you. Not for a week, not for a month, not for a year, FOREVER.   Now although the cons might seem to outweigh the pros, I will still recomend this to people. The hackers, do seems to be dwindiling in numbers now that the game has been out for a while, and I personally love the game and gameplay far too much to just stop. My only suggestion is that, until FROM fixes the cheat problem to something much more manageable, THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH FULL PRICE. It is worth a buy , but wait till you can get everything for about 40 bucks (DLC INCLUDED). Once they fix the cheating system then I will say that it is worth full price.",

But it's not what I'm here to talk about.  What I want to tell people who're reading this review is, this game is such a sad game, the outcome of some NPCs that fight along side you during your journey doesn't come out as good as you would see in other game. I wonder why the music is so sad in Firelink Shrine and I didn't know the reason til I started doing all of the NPC's quest in my NG+. Oh my Anri, poor girl that I can't even manage to be with even in my NG+. But if I could her fate would end up to be the same as not being with me. I spent half an hour looking for her at the end of her quest and I almost gave up if I didn't find a video on Youtube that shows me where to find her.  Then there come Sirris, sigh, why would this game make it so hard to enjoy without taking a feel trip down the crying river.  The combat aside, is quite good, even though it made me mad sometimes during my time wondering around. But the side quests are awesome, definite my GOTY unless I find another game that makes me emotional like this.  Forget your first playthrough, this game hits you in the feel when you started doing the NPC's quests just like it did to me in my NG+ and trust me, you won't regret it if you do all of them. Now I suggest you look for some guide online (Just don't buy the Prima guide since it sucks at walking you through the level if you're playing the first time, though it does quiet good as explaining the side quests) to help you out.  Would recommend to anyone who're willing to read and do research to do the quests, otherwise you can just enjoy the game and combat, this's what you would see in my journal if you happen to find it in your journey, fellow unkindled, may the flame guide thee.

I really enjoyed (and still am) enjoying this game, with all its glorious and shiny PvP, easy loot and non-punitive mechanics. But this is the biggest gripe I have with it:  It is fun.  When I think 'Dark Souls', fun is not the word I'd think of. Intriguing, Gothic, Dark, Depressive, Hard, Deep.   But not fun.  When I took care of Gwyn in the first title, I was exhausted. Of course, I was willing to take another trip in the NG+, yet I was terrified about having to go through all that sheer, magnificent pain and frustration all over again.  Dark Souls III, compared to that, is a stroll in the park.  And I am not talking merely about the raw difficulty of the thing: the depression, the choices I made, the people I saw dying; it all felt like I completed a unique, aestetic journey.  With Dark Souls III, I feel like farming, improving my stats, getting this or that weapon.   Plus, I had the dire feeling that FS had to throw cheap references to the older titles just to get its fanbase all moist. Don't get me wrong, I had my nerd boner up and hard in Anor Londo, but really, 10 square meters littered in dung? Is that it? Nice. but a cheap, really cheap vibe.  It's fun, it plays one thousand times better than Dark Souls 1 &amp; 2, but it is kind of what Battlefield 4 is to Battlefield 2 (not litterally, because BF4 is utter ♥♥♥♥♥ while DS III is lovely &lt;3).  I never thought I could enjoy a Souls so lightheartedly, and I can't really say wheter this is a good thing or not.  Long story short: if you are looking for a real Souls experience, fetch yourselves a Demon Souls or a Dark Souls, if you are looking for a slightly modern, less inspired Souls, get DS II.  If you are looking for a beautifully made, fast paced, way easier and bright Souls, get the third installment.  Praise die Sonne.",

Newcomers to the series make no mistake, this game can and will kick your ♥♥♥ but in way to teach you, not punish or mock you, and before you know it you will be morfed into a lean mean killing machine. And it will be all you, not levels or op weapons and gear but because you got gud :)   The world, it's huge, really freaking huge! The area's are everything from beautiful to downright scary. Bosses all feel special in there own way, and will likely catch you off gaurd and force you to adapt, sometimes on the fly.  The AI of the npc invaders are hands down the best i have ever seen in any game, and you will likely have doubts somtimes, was an npc or a real player? And unlike DS2 they are fair, meaning they don't have five or ten times the hp of players.   All in all and personal bias aside Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game, and the few issues i do have with i only have because i hold Dark Souls to a much higher standart and other games would likely get away with having them. Most all its nice to once again play a game that teaches you that nothing is free, you are entitled to nothing, and sometimes you fail, but for me atleast everytime i did, i came back even hungrier for victory than before.  They don't make games like they used to, but Dark Souls 3 stands out as an exception to that rule. Imho.      Side note on performance: (Fully acknowledge that for some it has been downright unplayerable)  Angry people being loud often stick out but do not represent everyone. And let's be fair no one go's to the forums making posts on how well everyhing is running.   Personally i have not had any issues worth speakin of.  And do take note that the recommed specs for the game are a lot higher than other games, but with that said, im running a nine year old system apart from the GPU (GTX970) and very rarely see it drop below 60FPS on high settings. Take care of your system and it will take care of you.",

There are some bullsh*t moments like enemies hitting you through the wall and you yourself only hitting the wall instead of the enemy in front of you or the hardest part in a fight being the fact that your camera keeps going wildly around or into the wall. The story is never really told to you, you will have to explore and find items and from those items descriptions and NPC conversations you can piece together a theory what has happened.  This game is more difficult than games usually are but one of the best things of this game is that even if you can't choose a difficulty setting, depending on how you gear yourself and what playstyle you have has a big effect on how hard it is. Also after you have compleated the tutorial area (if you get stuck on the boss for a really long time you should probably try another class) you will get access to coop making things alot easier when you summon a friend or two.  The pvp mechanics are nice, really love being an invader and trying to outplay the worlds host and most likely one or two of his friends when they try to get through the level.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls III is a fantastic game, Lothric is a compelling setting populated by unique and beautifully designed locales, ferocious and notoriously difficult monsters, and plenty of secrets in every nook and cranny. The game-play is everything you'd come to expect from a Dark Souls game, patient and skill-based, and with the addition of weapons arts Dark Souls III stands out from its predecessors as a finely polished experience. It has all the usual hiccups you'd expect from a Dark Souls game like questionable keyboard and mouse support, shaky online connection, and performance dips in certain areas, but none of it diminishes the genius of the game. While shorter than previous games Dark Souls III feels more dense and compact with lots to kill and lots to find.  You may be wondering from this gushing, glowing review why I am not recommending Dark Souls III. That can be answered with one short word:  Poise  Poise does not work, and according to From Software that is what they intended. If you don't remember in previous Souls games poise works as a statistic that determines how much damage you can take before your character is staggered/stunned. Heavier armours increase poise at the cost of speed, it only makes sense that a character wearing full Havels would shrug off the pathetic stab of an estoc. This is not so in Dark Souls III however. Poise DOES exist as a stat, in fact there are items that increase it such as the Wolf ring, who's only purpose is to increase poise. But, poise does NOTHING. You can wear the heaviest, strongest armour in the game and the weakest enemy you can encounter will stagger you. This ruins the game catastrophically. Sure heavy armour gives you great defence bonuses but at the cost of speed you can expect to be obliterated in pvp time and time again. This game will only support quick, agile fighters and that is unfair. I can understand why poise has changed, we have all been left infuriated by the Havel Moms and Giant Dads of yesteryear but destroying poise is not the way to solve that. It makes no sense for a man in rags wielding an estoc to be able to simply spam to death a man wearing Winged Knight armour. By removing/changing poise From have made half the items in the game worthless. According to tests, a higher poise has a miniscule effect on invincibility frames but otherwise has no effect in the game whatsoever. What's funny is, enemies have poise! You can strike them and they'll tank it. But we as players are not allowed it. I will gladly change this review should From correct the poise issue, but until then Dark Souls III is unfortunately (and it hurts to say this) the worst of the trilogy. I don't want to play an assassin, I want to play a slow, pondering tank, that is what I enjoy, but I simply can't, I will never win PVP that way. You may say git gud, but if git gud means changing my whole playstyle for something I don't enjoy then I'd rather stay bad.",

The game has been on the eastern market almost a week now yet the game suffers from many simple bugs that should have by now already been dealt with for a worldwide release. Bandai's excuse is not to play the game early yet I am currently playing it on the expected date and time. Currently for me I cannot proceed at all thanks to a bug in which I cannot be killed yet my enemies cannot either; we simply phase through one another due a bug involving hitboxes staying where that enemy spawns. Uncircumventable I must wait until a patch has been done or refund the game. This was your baby From Software, and you aborted the HELL out of it.

First; Ashes is by far the WORST DLC in the souls series. The introduction of the Undead arena seems to have taken up most of the development time of the DLC; leaving the core gameplay very lackluster.   First, the DLC contains a whopping 2 bosses, and very little gear. Overall it took about 2-3 hours to 100% it. While this content is incredibly limited compared to the DLC in Dark Souls 2, it should be noted that the boss fights were of good quality, it does have one thing going for it.   While the Undead Arena is an interesting addition to the game, I personally feel that FROM forgot the entire premise that Dark Souls 3 multiplayer was based on. Not to mention that the metagame for multiplayer is still horrendously cancerous makes this entire DLC feel like a waste of money.",

They've added much more mechanics as well, for example you can parry through knocking out other stamina bar. The bosses are kinda challenging but fun at the same time. Cool areas and beautiful scenery. The only problem is the commynuty and covenants. In pvp people always uses the 'best' weapon, for example 'Dark Sword' which stunlocks the target. It sucks...

Visually this is the most stunning and it just brims with atmosphere borrowing heavily from Bloodborne that also runs on the same engine. Combat feels satisfying and crunchy and a lot faster than in previous games.  It didn't feel as hard to me at the beginning but I think that's becasue I've played the previous games. But don't be fooled by this, the game gets a lot harder as you go on :)  The world doesn't feel quite as connected as in DkS but there are still plenty of shortcuts and the Firelink Shrine returns in a form that reminds you of Demon Soul's hub which brings me to one complaint. It's the only place you can level up which makes for some unneeded fast traveling every time you want to spend your earned souls. I didn't like this in DkSII and I certeinly don't here. But that's minor and I can look past this considering how much I'm enjoying my time with this game.   I'm running a R9 390 and can max the game out with stable 60fps.",

The design philosophy of making everything so difficult to fight also creeps its way into a few of the boss fights.  The covenants in this game are mostly PvP oriented so they all feel the same - even the Warriors of Sunlight (which was previously only based around friendly co-op) allows you invade someone along side another invader. In addition, they don't give you anything good, so there's no point in joining the covenants.  The weapons and armour feel as if they were balanced only for PvP, despite it such a small portion of the game overall and how rolling was made to be ridiculously powerful in PvP, so kiss goodbye to poise and decent ranged weapons for the entire game.  To be a bit nit-picky, I really dislike the 'cloth-physics' that a lot of the armour has because I think it looks silly and it clips through too many objects. To make it worse, there's no way to turn it off in this game even though there was in Dark Souls 2.  Also, I am unsure of why some weapons have scabbards - they just clip through armour, float away from you, and are never used unless you have a weapon off hand while you are two-handing another (which is very unlikely because there is very little reason to have two weapons equipped at once in this game). One last thing, why do the Souls games have the shields turned 90 degrees? It looks so stupid.",

Having to retcon the patches due to widespread complaints of outright freezes and crashes. -Lying to customers by saying no innocent players are ever banned and each account is checked by hand. Proven false by multiple youtube videos and twitch streams of people getting instantly auto-banned before ever owning the game. Hackers and cheaters are running rampant in this game. -PVP practically unplayable due to horrendous balance. Patches still haven't addressed most of the first-order-optimal strategies that unhinge the game despite claiming to. -Unbalanced magic and miracle scaling that does nothing until extremely high points in the stat (50-60). And I mean almost nothing despite upgrading the tools and casting bigger spells. Pyromancies work out of the box, so this appears to be another bug that wasn't addressed. -FOUR covenants based on being randomly summoned with no control over it. Two of which are broken. Covenant rewards consist of very little of note. No rewards for one of them at all. -Everything in the game is item-gated so you have no real freedom from the start like in previous Souls.

Core mechanics like Poise (a vital stat for almost every build in the game) have been stripped from the game leaving specific weapons with 'weapon arts' (a clear attempt at remaking trick weapons) with 'hyper armor' which makes them inherently superior to all other weapons for non-experienced players.  2. Useless mechanics like the Luck (literally only useful for item discovery and bleed build up) stat have been introduced when they were not needed.  3.

Long Review - The game itself is really good,but compared to Dark Souls 1 is really disappointing and I don't recommend it for many reasons: Replayability - After I finished it once I found it less and less fun as I went through the various NG+s.This is probably due to the lack of freedom to move in the map as you like(Dark souls 1,which I played 1k hours,gave you complete freedom of movement after the tutorial boss),making the game just a straight path to the final boss that you are forced to follow.  PvP,unparriable weapons and Poise - Poise is completely gone,which cuts out many possibilities for builds.You get stunlocked by literally everything,even bare fists.This makes PvP just a fight between who can click r1 faster and makes PvE less and less fun as you progress(as I said above).PvP right now is just full of people who spam rapiers and daggers,stunlocking you to death,and people who spam heavy weapons(God only knows why they're now unparriable),stunlocking you to death aswell.  General unbalance - The absence of poise makes many areas in the game pretty frustrating(even for Souls veterans),but not only that. Some enemies are really poor designed and bad thought(for example the unarmed Ghrus in the swamp).  Conclusion:If just want this game for PvE and don't mind the 60 bucks price then go ahead,buy it,but if you wanted it for the PvP aswell then don't even bother considering it until these things are fixed,just download it cracked from a website,because right now I don't think they deserve the money the game costs.",

As much as I love the series itself, I also love the multiplayer. I did not pay the full price for 50% of a game. This is horrible. Bandai Namco can't do their jobs correctly and the players are punished for it with no repurcussion to the company. I also feel bad about writing a negative review but they deserve a 0/10 for banning people for no reason.

Its Bloodborne 2, not Dark Souls 3 to me at this point. And dont rage, i am entitled to my own opinion. They switched from unique, beutifull and sometimes bizarre locations to just one town after another. Concrete/wood towns everywhere. Everything looks the same. Enemy Attack patterns are just copypaste from Bloodborne. Sounds copypaste from Bloodborne. Music = Bloodborne, Dark Souls always had different vibe to it, Dark souls music was more calm and just beautiful, rather than EPIC AND LOUD stuff from Bloodborne that is aimed at larger target audience... You can be displeased wiht my opinion, and i know certain ignorant fanboys will be. But still... I was hoping for Dark Souls 3 , but i got Bloodborne 2.

Their reasoning is that we didn't supply enough information, yet every time there was more than enough information to supply some form of solution. The problems here are as follows.  Harrison: Desktop rig, top of the line. Runs everything like a dream. He can run the game just fine, but he cannot connect to the servers under any circumstances. Tried port-forwarding and all that jazz, and nothing.  Jarrett: Crash on startup. Laptop, similar to mine, built for gaming and can handle any game thrown at us.  Any and all 'help' we've recieved was from various online sources, and there are no solid solutions, in addition to no obvious attempt by BanNam to fix these problems for the players who have them. I'll wait until they can play without any issues, and then I'll change this review. Until then, I wouldn't recommend risking a purchase here.

Dark Souls 2 left a very sour taste in a lot of people's mouths, and this love letter really helps wash that taste out. I'll admit there are a lot of issues that need fixing, but they really pale when it comes to how great this game is. The storyline is decent, a lot of old faces make returns, speculations are put to rest, and it feels like a Souls game. I was so worried it'd be Soulsborne, but I think it's a good thing having gone through NG++ to finish it off.   Like any Souls game you gotta beat it once to really start enjoying it, and god damn did I enjoy every hour. Well, outside of learning a few bosses, Nameless King, and a 10 hour grind for ears to finish off the Darkmoon, but still. The game does well to challenge you minus some loveable enemies who make their return, and it takes some getting used to that's for sure. It's also crazy how many builds are viable. I did a Demon Fist run and it was a blast. I did almost the entire NG++ with them, some PVP, and lots of CO-OP. If you play or plan on playing, then trust me. Get them, get them to +5, and then go do some jolly co-op on Vordt Of The Boreal Valley. It's stupid fun, especially with 3 people at the same time.  I'm no good at reviews, but I highly recommend the game. If you're a long time fan you'll really enjoy how refreshing the game is, and how well they've improved the game overall.

Playing with Max Settings in 1080p and gaining solid 60 Fps on I7 4930k and GTX 980 on Win10 64 even im not using the latest Drivers from Nvidia.  Dont take it that serious but i think most of the appearing crashes atm arent caused by the Game because thats sadly the case most of the time and blaming the Game, giving negative Reviews and start with Refunding Trains specially force others to do so is simple solid piece of ♥♥♥. I work with PCs and other Technologies for over 15 Years now and from all the Systems i got my hands on, even from People having knowlegde in using PCs, it was the Case that more then 90% of their Systems werent setup correctly. There was most of the time so much wrong about everything that it would take forever to put it in here. If you now feel offended im really sorry but only a few percent of all Steam Users know how to use a PC correctly.  Edit: Because of all so many babys crying about certain Weapons, Shields, Mechanics and playstyles in PvP. You are ridiculous, you win its good, you loose the Game has Issues ? Thats Dark Souls 3, not 2, not 1, its different so addept it and dont whine about you couldnt break a Shields guard with a toothpick. People smashing R1 ? Why you stupidly rushing with your Weapon twohanded in light Armor directly into your opponent ? The Games balance is good as it is and its your fault, simple learn to play it. Im really not that good in PvP in any of the Souls Games but even i get through it and nver came around that something was too bad or too good.",

I get an idea to lure the host out. I decide to wait patiently underneath a giant's crotch. Host notices me and uses seed of Giant Tree. Giant suddenly doesn't like that I am under his crotch. Host gets exposed when using item, wacky chase continues. Host goes down the big ladder to the Water Reserve. We follow, and have a small scuffle with the host. Host hides behind a pillar. We do not pursue the host upon realizing the two Crocowolves would aggro if we did. Everyone sits around for awhile. I get another idea. I take out my bow and arrow. I shoot an arrow right above the host's head. Host gestures, presumably in mockery that I missed my shot. I did not miss my shot, the Crocowolf right past the host can attest to this. Buddy takes the cue to make a tactical retreat up the ladder. Crocowolf lunges at me as I climb up the ladder, inflicting some damage. Host continues laying on the ground. Crocowolf loses interest in me as I ascend further, interrupting the Host's nap. Host tries to knock some sense into the Crocowolf to convince it to chase me instead. Both Crocowolves are now chasing the host. My buddy and I both watch the spectacle from a high point on the ladder. I sip my Estus Flask as I hear the host scream in agony upon death.

Second even though I have a fairly high end GPU(980ti) I only see 40-60% usage on average on MAXIMUM settings 1080p. I would also like to point out that my GPU drivers are out of date by a few months. So far it has been a constant 60fps everywhere(in the few areas I have been).  As far as I can tell there is nothing wrong with this game, and it seems like everyone who is complaining don't even meet the recommended specs, and often barely or don't meet the minimum specs.  As far as performance goes I have no complaints.  Gameplay:  Combat/enemy behavoir is basically a 50/50 mix of Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne.        ----------------------------------------------possible spoilers---------------------------------------------------------------    So far it seems the world is broken up into stages and not one area that loops back on it self like in Dark Souls.  Arctitecture and layout feel very Bloodbornish, and some enemies have the Lovecraftian vibe as well.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So far I am very pleased with the gameplay and performance.

Game runs rather well for me with my meager PC (9 year old CPU at this point with a GTX 680, 8GB of RAM), always sticking above 30FPS. I'd like more, but what are you gonna do? Runs better than the console versions at least. Haven't encountered any of the supposedly prevalent crash issues so far.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls 3 is not only a worthy successor to the Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, but skillfully combines all the lessons that FromSoftware has learned throughout the years with Demon's Souls all the way through Bloodborne. Veterans of FromSoftware's games will see references and mechanics from all the previous entries in the series, even Bloodborne. Combat is faster than previous Souls games, but no as fast as Bloodborne. For you Bloodborne players, get ready to unlearn the habit of relying on the regain system to get your health back. The environment and level design is much better than in Dark Souls 2, but they smartly stuck with the improved combat system from DS2 and improved it.Faster combat leadss into smoother combos and fancier moves, with Sword Arts being a cool new addition to the combat system.   As for performance, well that's a bit on the disappointing side. My GTX 760 struggled on the higher settings, and eventually the regular crashes forced me to lower the gnereal settings to Medium, and the Lighting setting on Low. Now it's running fairly consistent at about 40 fps and not crashing, which is good. I just had hoped that my 760 plus 16 GB of RAM and an AMD-FX 4130 processor would get closer to the 60 fps that I wanted. Hopefully the options will improve in the coming weeks, but it is a bit disappointing, if not unexpected.  Overall this game is excellent and despite some graphical issues and random framerate drops, this game is a solid conteder for Game of the Year. It's made my Best Of 2016 list already, and has a decent shot at a the Top 10 Favorites Games Ever list as well.  In short, this game takes all of FromSoftware's games and combines them into a mysterious and intruiging adventure. If May the flames guide thee.",

There are around 40-50 hours to complete the main story and with some dlc yet to be released there'll be even more stuff to do in this game, it's definately worth your buck. When the game's finished you can either go into new game plus or start a fresh character and try a whole other fighting style. It's easier to meet up with friends using the new password restriction on summoning, and it usually doesn't take very long to find those summoning signs either. PVP can be fun or frustrating depending on how frequent or at which point of the game it occurs, but definately works as intended and provides a nice little surprise once in a while which also changes each of your playthroughs.

There are a few bugs here and there, but the only game breaking one I've noticed is that the game crashes every once in awhile.

I have played the game solo offline and defeated all bosses without any help, and I can say that even for a Dark Souls veteran like me, it was very challenging. The first part was rather easy if you are familiar with the series, but the game will spike in difficulty to give everyone a challenge.   I recommend everyone to play Dark Souls 1 because this game expands on the story and without wanting to spoil too much, you will see some familiar characters.

I don't want to seem like a fanboy and praise it to the point where my review is meaninless so I will try to be as honest with you as possible. This review is meant for people who have previously played SoulsBorne games.  Pros: Better combat system: then DS1 and especially 2 in my opinion. Its faster paced and less clunky. Rolling feels cleaner and has more directions then 1 and 2 and the speed of weapons is more appealling to me. I hated it when in 1 or 2 I would swing my weapon, realize it was a terrible idea and watch as I was pulvurized into the ground, completely helpless. Thats just my opnion though. Parrying and crits also feel very crisp. The new rolling mechanics lead me to my next point, movement. Movement: You are faster, smoother, and more in control of your character then before. Thats about it for that. Lore: I wont go into detail to avoid spoilers but there is alot to get into for those of you interested in DS lore. Graphics: Very pretty but quite taxing and unstable at times. We will talk more about that later. See my specs on my profile page.  Cons: Shield are nearly useless for skilled players.  A bit unstable on my pc requiring me to play on low settings. Invasions are quite unbalanced. Normal DS PVP lag (better then the other games though). Level design not quite on par with Dark Souls 1.  Overall: I couldn't recommend the game more. Stay safe and praise the sun!",

My character is NG+3 and I can annihilate bosses like it's nothing. Now let's see if I can't do the same for this review.  Dark Souls III as the third installment to the series had a lot to do to make it more than just another remake of the Souls series.   AI-Bosses: The very first thing I noticed in the game was the wide variety of random encounters (mini-bosses) as well as the actual boss battles being extremely fluid the first time you engaged them. The transformation stages of the bosses was a nice breath of fresh air for the Dark Souls battle equations. Even random enemies transforming was a shocker. AI and Bosses were my best experience.  Graphics: The graphics were breath-taking. Each area felt like a beautiful piece of pie that I could not wait to sink my greedy teeth into. I ate up the scenery so much. However, what I did not expect was the return of an area from Dark Souls 1. I bow down to FromSoftware. My nostaligia came back in waves.   Soundtrack: The soundtrack for Dark Souls III is possibly the best out of all of the souls games. Deep, intense and very immersive. Each area felt alive, hostile, and it helped lend to me wanting to explore more.  Combat PVE: The combat for PVE felt a lot more polished than in other games. Some weapons were considered extremely over-powered in the beginning of the game, but updates were pushed out to 'nerf' them. The weapons were so varied and tons were unique. Some weapons having been imbued with WoG shocked me. Amazing touches. The new Techniques were also very helpful in changing the way I played the game solo and with friends.  Combat PvP:  Here is where my primary focus is on the souls series. Hosting fight clubs, Invasions, and being invaded just to send them home crying. The combat is extremely fluid. It feels more like a dance now with the Techniques rather than just a struggle. Shield Turtles need to be nerfed a little due to the fact you can infinitely hold your ground with a greatsword, other than that, flawless combat. Magic finally felt viable in PvP. Bows, finally felt viable in PvP. Each weapon has its own unique use now that the other 2 games had problems fleshing out into the PvP aspect.  Overall: With the amount of time I have spent in this game, both in PvP and PVE, I would easily rate this game a 9.5/10. Your time will not be wasted.... Unless, you are afraid of dying a few times. And a few times after that.",

It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as Dark Souls. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day, or even a year. But eventually, it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it will last forever. The margin for error is so small, I mean, one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don’t quite make it. One half-second too slow or too fast, you don’t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They’re in every break of the game, every minute, every second. Make a choice, right? You just decide what it’s gonna be, Don’t cry to give up, cry to keep going. Don’t cry to quit! You already in pain, you already hurt. Get a reward for it.  Now if you know what you’re worth, then go ahead and get what you’re worth, but you gotta be willing to take the hit and not point fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!  Because everyday is a new day. Every moment is a new moment! So now you gotta go out and show them that I’m a different creature. Now! I’ma show you how great I am! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.Now, what are you gonna do?

Visually, the game is stunning, Dark Souls is definitely on-par with the best games out there as far as visual quality goes. I do get occasional crashes when everything is maxed out on my 970, so it might not be fully optimized, but I dunno. The story is good, I kind of wish they made it more like DS1 where you have no idea where to go from the start, but instead it seems like they put you at the 'hub' right away, and there haven't been a whole lot of branching paths so far. Hopefully the game will open up more later on, but so far I'm loving the level of challenge.",

Pros  +Graphics are improved +Combat seems to be faster paced than in Dark Souls 2 +Estus flask are now more than 1 to start off with which is great +Gameplay is great +HUD and Menu is easy to navigate and is similar to Blood Borne +Game is excellently optimized BUT i did noticed one or two stutter (At least,i didn't encounter any crash nor dps drops) +Character Creation is now more extensive than in Dark Souls 2  +Some bosses are chellenging but not impossible and some are easy +I love how now the game doesn't punish you as much as hard as was in Dark Souls 2 where they take away half your health everytime you die but in this,if you die,you will only return to normal health,but if you use Ember (which is similar to Human Effigy) you get a health boost.Now i can see how some DS players are gonna complain how casual this is and such but for us players that are not that good at this game will appreicate this,but if you still want to have the good old hollow form,you can do so by talking to a certain NPC and he'll curse you.  +Death has never felt addicting. +tons of content  Cons -one or two stutter at times -Players phantom weren't able to cross some bosses fog gate  -a few connection lags between players and bosses -Encountered one infinite loading time once  So in conclusion,I give this game 9/10,this game is freaking excellent,i highly recommend that you go buy this right now! you won't be disapppointed,this game is worth every single penny of it's purchase price.

The bad of this game is that fast weapons are generally better in pvp, and pve (To a lesser extent); Poise is gone and never returning, no matter how many times fromsoft lies and says otherwise; and Miazaki, or whomever is handling hackers online, doesn't do it well at all, punishing the VICTIM of the hacker while hiding behind their bogus excuse of 'Just be more careful' and never adding any measures to allow the players to be 'More careful'.

The game's combat is second to none this time around. There isn't a game on the market that competes with Dark Souls III in terms of combat. As I mentioned there are MANY throw backs to Dark Souls 1 in this game all over the place. You find the lord vessel and Andre of Astora right within the first hour of the game. The bare essentials are there at Firelink Shrine as always and it's more homey than ever.   Exploration is rewarded always, unlike with other Souls games this one always will reward you for roving outside where the direct path lead. In order to go forward often times you have to go back, which I love about Dark Souls. However if you don't enjoy difficulty in video games don't purchase this. You'll die over, and over, and over again. At times you'll wonder where you're supposed to go and other times you'll want to quit altogether because you're so frustrated.

Other games hold your hand through them and guides you, what dark souls does is something else. They give you some ♥♥♥♥, throw you in a pithole and then leave you there to handle things on your own.  Dark souls have always had varying and beatiful environment and this game nails it. The lightning is good, the surroundings look good, the sounds are amazing! And the soundtrack. The soundtrack is fkn amazing!  Many different weapons, all kinds of weird ♥♥♥♥ like dual-wielding two hammers who's bigger than yourself. All the weapons are incredibly good designed and looks astonishing! The animations are really smooth and look very real.   The PvE in this game is amazing! The bosses are really cool and some are really REALLY hard and some are actually dissapointingly easy. They are all very different frome one another. The amount of bosses isn't that much, Dark souls 2 have MUCH more bosses, but dark souls 3 is more like quality over quantity which I prefer.  The voice acting is good. It's nothing impressive but they keep to the dark theme which just fits perfectly.   And then there's PvP... I love it. PvP is the only thing I do now in the game now that I've completed the game two times. PvP has its ups and downs. What makes pvp slightly bad in this game is not the pvp itself, but the players. The constant ganking. When I invade a world I'm aware that it should be a hard time for me to beat the host, but not like this. When 4 people just hide and wait for an invader to invade and then gank the ♥♥♥♥ out of him, that destroys the purpose to invade. Thanks to this I never ever invade anymore since it's hopeless 'cause the game priorities the hosts with friends so there will almost allways be 2v1, 3v1, 4v1. In some very few cases I invaded a lone host which turned out to be really fun, but that only happened 3-4 times under my entire experience with ds3. But, there's an amazing side to the PvP, and that is the fight clubs. In some areas it's very popular to set up fightclubs, where the host watches and summons people to the fightclub where you fight other players in a duel. Duels have community-made rules which I love! This is what makes PvP viable! Even if I suck at PvP, I cant stop playing it!  And if you have the new DLC, there is a matchmaking system for the PvP which is amazing! You can search for duels, 2v2, 3v3, 2 player brawl, 4 player brawl or 6 player brawl! This makes PvP even more fun! The sad thing is, that there is no rewards, not even some souls. But it still is the most fun I have in this game!  Do I recommend this game? Yes. Without a doubt, yes. This game will offer you something very unique unlike any other game you've played before.",

The only thing that concerns me(although doesn't bother) is a difficulty level. In the beginning it's really easy, perfectly suited for the beginners. I just hope it'll get harder later. Basically: Pros: Everyhing Cons:  Nothing  So, after I put over 30h in this game, I must say that the difficulty level is kind of disappointing. I expected something much harder than the second game, which was fairly easy, but I got an easy version of first Dark Souls. It's really simple, most of the bosses aren't any sort of a challenge.

The environment all links together as it did in Dark Souls, meaning that the world is more interconnected than Dark Souls 2; which was more linear. Combat is satisfying and with Combat arts more; varied than previously in the past. Magic isn't as overpowered as it once was, thankfully they did away with Dark Souls 2's broken magic system. A system that made you collect multiple of the same spell to gain more casts, and instead we once again have a mana (FP) bar. The biggest improvement (most would agree) is the reverting back to Soul Level, not that Soul Memory garbage. The big question is, is it worth your time, and more importantly your money? Answer: Absolutely! If you can handle the punishment, and avoid 'Rage Quitting' then you'll be well rewarded for your efforts and patience.  Update: Dark Souls now runs flawlessly given you have the average specs, and with the release of the Radeon Rx 480, this game should look and run beautifully! Take your time to play this one, as it's only gonna get better with age, and like all 'Dark Souls' games, it's an instant pain in the '♥♥♥♥, over and over again' classic.

It's absolutely horrendously designed, and has the worst balancing I have ever seen. Enemy designs are bland and boring, and the entire game is grey and uninspired looking, like an action rpg version of Modern Warfare 2.    Even the lore is boring, uncreative (practically copy and paste from the first two games) and barely even existing. I'll give you an example:  Yhorm. What happened to him? Never explained, but he knows Siegward for some reason.  That's it. More is never mentioned or hinted at.    Dark Souls 3 Feels like a horrible port of Dark Souls 1 assets to the Bloodbourne engine, and it plays and looks that exact same way. The speed of the Bloodborne gameplay with Dark Souls weapons and armor just don't work together. As a proof of that, they even had to remove poise.  Yes, that's right. Dark Souls 3 has no poise. It has the STAT poise, as in, you can get points in poise, but they only affect VERY, VERY CERTAIN BUILDS, and only if you use a weapon that has hyper armor frames in it's attack pattern, extending said frames, and also giving you some kind of roll hyper armor (?) that is almost completely useless, due to rolling giving you invincibility to begin with.   But no, poise does NOT affect your poise (Kind of ironic, isn't it?), and it hurts the game very, very badly, making heavy armor completely useless, due to the way this game calculates defense (you get your major amount of defense from simply wearing a piece of armor, not WHICH piece of armor). You'll know what I mean as soon as you try fighting against 5-8 enemies at once (who just so happen to HAVE poise and way too much of it too, a dinky small dagger wielding enemy sometimes has the poise of a Havelmonster back in DS 1 and 2) in this game without a weapon that gives you hyper armor. And this game LOVES to just enemy spam the sh*t out of you to compensate for how easy and boring it is.   So yeah, have fun getting stunlocked in Havel armor by dagger wielding little sh*ts, while they barely flinch when you hit them with your Ultra-Greatsword. And even IF you stagger them, most of the time they just continue attacking MID STAGGER ANIMATION. That means they will most of the times completely ignore that they are staggered and cancel out the staggering and keep attacking. Like some chum in a fighting game doing a combo breaker, but these mobs can just spam it, while you don't have such a thing. Great, huh?  Let's get to the bosses.  Boss fights are the only fun thing in this game, and the Bosses themselves are the only interesting and worthwile about this game.  There's only one problem.  They are too easy. Compared to the mobs in this game (and the enemy spamming) the bosses are ridiculously easy. Some of them can even be stunlocked with fast weapons, because they have no poise either! This should not be the case. The bosses should be HARDER then fighting the common mobs around the boss area, but they are not. Whether this is a problem with the strength of the mobs or the weakness of the bosses, this should NOT be the case.    As far as I can tell, It's like FromSoft tried to make a Bloodbourne 2, screwed it up, and then decided to throw Dark Souls assets into it at the last minute, figuring 'Eh, they'll buy it if it has Dark Souls written on it'       Overall, this game does one thing and it does it very well:  Remember me of the good old times of Dark Souls 1 and make me play that one again instead.",

I have gotten up to the Lothric Wall or whatever, the area immediately after Firelink shrine. Iudex Gundyr was a solid fight if basic, and certainly fun to roll around as a duel wielding mercenary class. The designs are excellent and feel like an exact middle ground between Dark Souls style stuff and Bloodborne, with a significantly faster more Bloodborne-esque pace to the gameplay.  Sadly, once I started on the Lothric wall, my game began to crash. A lot. Sometimes it would crash after killing some random mob. Sometimes it would crash when the dragon breathed fire across the bridge. Sometimes it just crashed for no reason at all. And let me say, this was not a CTD. This was a HARDLOCK. My monitor would go completely black, fall into sleep mode, and I would be forced to shut down with the power button.  I tried all of the suggestions I found; changing my armor, setting all the graphics settings to low, avoiding fire, but nothing seemed to keep my game stable. This seems to be a rare occurence overall but I needed to put this out there. I just cannot recommend this game if there is even the possibility of this happening. Look at my specs below, I comfortably meet the recommended system designated by FromSoft...  Specs: i7 4790S 3.2GHz 16GB DDR3 1600MHz R9 285 2GB GDDR5 (No overclock) Catalyst 16.5.1 Windows 10 x64",

Plus it's not optimized for PC, as you have no shortcut to access inventory etc. (or maybe there is, but as there is no tutorial... see next point)  - no tutorial at all. You're dropped in the middle of nowhere, and you have to figure out how the spells are handled, what equipment does what, etc. Players of DS1&amp;2 probably know all that, but newcomers dont, and thus would appreciate some guidelines (without going on internet to understand the game mechanics)  - Over exagerated difficulty... it's good to see a game where mobs are a bit challenging to fight.

This game runs gloriously on PC, and with the PS4 controller I don't feel handicapped by keyboard/mouse because lets be honest, keyboard/mouse for Souls is like playing the Deprived class on heroin. (For those who don't know, it's essentially the hard game's 'hard mode.') . Moreover for those having FPS/Crashing issues, I can't say I've experienced anything other than flawless gameplay. I have not experienced a single crash, FPS stutter, or anything of the like. The only complaint I have is the summoning system, but that's typical of Souls games.   I've spent the last two days (about 5 hours a day) dying, falling off cliffs, getting rekt by ambushes, and cursing vehemently at my computer screen for allowing me to die. I've loved (HATED) every second of it. (PLEASE KILL ME.) No, really. Dark Souls III is (in my opinion) one of the best in the souls series to date. Unlike Dark Souls II I actually find myself caring about the NPC's and the stories they tell. From Soft really got back to the old school Dark Souls I feel, and the game plays wonderfully. Similarly, a problem in DS II where you'd get insane frame rate lag when rendering large objects has been resolved. I don't think I've dropped below 60 FPS since I first booted up the game.  The boss battles do feel a little...easier? That's not to say they aren't fun fights, but they definitely dialed back the difficulty of bosses (from what I can gather.) In contrast, I feel like they really buffed the every day average joe monsters in the game. Hell, you'll fight giants and tag team NPC's similar to Black Knights that aren't even real bosses, but they will give you a run for your money every time, and they don't pull any punches.  Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10. It's by no means perfect, as no game ever is, but it is definitely a must buy for the avid Demon Souls/Dark Souls fan. I honestly don't regret buying the season pass either, simply because I know I will put in a lot of hours towards completion. (As many hours as I can while working a full time job.) If you love the Souls game, you'll love Dark Souls III. If you're new to the series, let me just say a few things:  1) PRAISE THE SUN. 2) PREPARE TO DIE. 3) YES YOU CAN FALL OF THE LEDGES. 4) DON'T TRY TO FACEROLL. 5) WELCOME TO HELL.",

Everyone having problems should try turning setting to low, stop being afraid of the dark and spend more then 1000$ on a gaming PC/Laptop.  Now for the real issues.... Matchmaking and the lack there of... I want to invade not join stupid fight clubs or get summoned into a ganked for putting down my sign. That being said make Ember Form not required for invasions. Make the invasion timer shorter for Embered players and make a longer invasion timer for none embered players that way I dont have to wait a freaking hour to get summoned as a Wolf or Aldrich or Blue and not always get summoned into a party standing at the boss gate that just enters the boss as soon as I spawn.  #1 Idea ive heard is to leave the Way of the blue and the Blue sentinels covenant emblems the same BUT change the Bladesof the Darkmoon to do BOTH passives of the Way of the Blue and the Blue Sentienls this I believe after hearing it on a forum would make for some great changes in matchmaking as a Blue.  Killing a invader no matter what covenant you are end should give me a covenant reward at least for the invade ones... if im trying to be a Wolf in the swamp and you invade as the Finger then why cant i kill you cause you are tresspassing my swamp (shrek refference) if you invade as a mad phantom in Ar londo and im a aldrich faithful the how am i not protecting my castle. This would greatly speed up the covenant grinds and would be much appreciated.  Faith builds hit like wet noodles. 60 Faith is pretty much required to get Max APR with either darkmoon blade flame weapon or lighting blade so if im force to play Dex faith or Strenght Faith can i atleast get some decent faith casts.  Great game! but i found litterally everything in my first playthrough and it took 17 hours it took me like 3 weeks of game time to find DarkLurker in Dks 2 and i never found the 4 kings in darksouls 1 until i went back and played it a few weeks ago. I really hope that there are Hidden achievements and my running around hitting every wall in the game is gonna produce a new secert boss/weapon/anything.

As the Dark Souls franchise has always been punishing if you were to do something incredibly stupid. But despite on how much I liked the previous installments, I do not like this one. The main reason is the poise system, accordingly Bandai Namco / From Software have said it is working as intended. And yet the description of said feature is not how it works. In Dark Souls I poise was a big part of game play, for casters and heavy builds. In Dark Souls II poise was altered to a good degree to make some of the PvP a little more bearable for when a Dex build vs Strength. In Dark Souls III however, it is a completely useless feature that has split the community into 2 fragments. People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs. Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment. To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.

            "review_text": "I have spent countless of hours on the first two souls games and so i was really, really hyped for this one. Unfortunatly, the game was quite a... frustrating disapointment to me.  Truth is, this is a pretty good game. I mean, graphics and artistic directions are just gorgeous, the musics, the theme, the design choices, it's challenging. So yeah, quite the thing you expect from a souls game.  Although, to me the game was more of a Bloodborne with shields rather than a Dark souls 1-ish. Which is fine, but...  Well, to me, what really made the two firsts game shine was that, even if the game was difficult it offered the player so many variety on how to tackle the challenges that, it felt rewarding doing choices and improvising builds. And these builds determined how the game would flow and react. I've never been good in souls games, but i found myself really confortable with heavy tank builds that let me actually soak attacks rather than having to nervously dodge everything at perfect frame and so i was happy with that, because even if not good i could beat things and felt clever finding right items for my playstyle.  But here, you really feel that the choices design where made to create a more dynamic experience where enemies will be fast and agressiv and where you have to timely dodge attacks in order to do a thing. And so most of the build variety was nerfed in order to promote a more specific type of gameplay that every mobs tend to follow. To be more precise, parry and poise are now quite uneffective, if not pointless. Mobs will usually overload you with attacks that remove almost all your stamina bar in 1or 2 hit, and most of the trash will stagger you if you get a few hits, even with Havels set and rings on. How dodge rolls work is that it is way more effective to spam dodge, since the stamina recover extremly fast with almost no recovery on dodge, that you have little to no need to actually parry rightly expect for a few boss attacks. I've been using ultra great swords and the like at first, being a fan of huge strengh builds, but i could barely hit a thing without being staggered by any enemy. So i switched on straight swords since most of them have better range and damage output than some heavy weapons.  It could have been just that but, on my experience, the game was also a technical mess. The camera was horrible, getting obstructed in everything it could while locked on an enemy, getting me stuck in small background elements mapped everywhere. The lock distance felt way too short and broke for almost no reason when i was passing behind small items or behind walls. It also broke when moving backward sometimes, when passing a door or like, climbing a stair. Got killed a lot by mimics because it couldn't follow its movement around me either. Enemies spotted and attacked me through walls where weapons would bounce against. In fact, most of the time my attacks would fail because i happened to hit a small part of background behind me. It felt greatly unprecise and clunky. Never had these issues in the first two souls, or at least not as often as i did in this one. Speaking of lock on, Arrows and projectiles missed target almost everytime if it was moving just a tiny little bit, firing completly out of direction. And even while aiming with R1, arrows would just pass through things sometimes due to some hitbox shenanigans.  The game added a bunch of new mecanics like sword arts that use mana but, i almost never used them in PvE because by the time i was casting them i usually got hit and canceled/staggered, if not just doing too little damages to be worth their cost in time and mana.  I also found that the game was really hard to read. Most of the backgrounds are overloaded with details and even if most of the paths are straights, enemies were pretty hard to spot since they are in almost the same tone of everything around and don't always move or behave in a way they're easy to identify (when they don't just not appear at all due to some culling problems). I found myself really spending a lot of time in most of the early area just to look around things because there was simply to many things to look at everywhere.   So... yeah, after a bunch of 40 hours and a NG+, even if the story and the ending are really, really good, to me the game wasn't what i expected to be the climax of the serie.  It's not bad, it's just... It doesn't feel like a souls to me.  It's worth noticing that i played the game in offline mode, mainly due to the hackers issues there has been going, though. (yeah, steam don't understand that people may use offline mode sometimes :/)",

Weapons have been refined to make every single weapon viable and fun to use.  The armor system is designed in such a way to make any set a solid choice. Enemies are varied and truly deadly while being fair. The bosses are incredible again. Gone are the days of Dark Souls 2 bosses where every single one is 'Large humanoid with big weapon'. The PVP netcode has been improved substantially. The new Weapon Art system ads an entire new dimension to combat. 'Quality of Life' tweaks, like passwords for co op with friends, or improved item/wepon swapping.   This game took what worked from Dark Souls, and Bloodborne, and meticulously removed everything from Dark Souls II that was not fun to create a near perfect game.  I will now be judging all future souls/borne games according to this game. This should have been Dark Souls II.",

Don't get me wrong the game is mostly unforgiving but that is okay. The intensity of the game play will keep you on edge and fits perfectly into the automsphere of the game. The beauty of dark souls is that it is hard in the right way ; it is skilled based combat so you either have to learn more about the level or get better at playing your character. I've yet to run into a scenario were I felt like getting better at the game wasn't the solution -- i.e. finding glitches. Because of the difficulty of the game , when you beat a boss it feels super rewarding and as you get stronger you feel like a huge bad ♥♥♥ because it wasn't to long ago that you fled from the enemies that you just destroyed. Ontop of the rewarding game play, the game is beautiful and emersive.  The only problems I have with the game are related to co-op / pvp. It feels like every 5th co-op i join is gliched (character models not moving properly, players unable to enter boss encounters, and frozen npcs). When the experience works it works pretty well. I would love to see From Software exmpand on the co-op / pvp game play as it currently feels a bit shallow, still fun just feels like it could be more. I am optimistic these two things will be addressed and they aren't really impacting how much I am enjoying the game.

As i'm not a hardcore souls gamer i cant make any comparisons to the earlier titles, but going from dark souls 2 to 3 i can say that this game has blown my mind, the look of the game is beautiful, the variations of the zones are amazing.   Only negative thing i have to say though is that: me and my friend had alot of issues with crashes early but we found out that turning the lighting effects setting to low fixed that problem without making any real difference in the game. keep in mind that these settings have a way of reverting themselves to just check them now and then to see if they are right.  In short: beautiful enviroment, weapons and armor models, fast and responsive combat, interesting enemies, deep and interesting storyline. Praise the sun!",

Now on to some important changes I think made this game tolerable. So they fixed the frame rate issues and some other errors.  BUT GOD ♥♥♥♥ING DAMMIT DARK SOULS  So i played through the full game around 4 times and did a bunch of pvp. So leaving aside THE ♥♥♥♥ING FANFARE THAT IS THE EARLY GAME its a pretty quality single player game. So i played through and was ultimately pretty satisfied. I loved the extra areas and npc's i found my second time around.   Soo..   Pros: - End game is fun - Lots of error fixes - Visible improvements since release  Cons: - Lots of reskinned enemies (feels like the ds2 DLC's) - Terrible story telling that is somehow worse that DS2  and finally the ♥♥♥♥ing PVP. HERE COMES ANOTHER RANT ♥♥♥♥♥ES. The pvp is what you get when you take a perfectly innocent puppy and shove a firecracker up its ♥♥♥ while 4 men stand around kicking it. THIS ♥♥♥♥IGN DESCRIBES THE 10v1 GANK THAT IS THIS ♥♥♥♥ING PVP.  So lets break it down a little more  GANKS: With no limit to what the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ of hosts can do the game turns into a chinese sweatshop. They will send infinite waves of phantoms at you to fight. But wait they also fight you simaltaneously. Its like that scene from indiana jones where they guy gets swarmed by and they crawl up inside of him.  SUNNY D ADDICTS: Being usually an invader I end up fighting about 2 phantoms and a host. So I play it smart and chip away at the hosts health using the environment to my advantage. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. And he drinks some estus. I do it again. WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ CREATED THIS CRUEL SYSTEM. Between the hosts and phantoms a good 20 something flasks are ♥♥♥♥ing chugged only for me to be lag killed.  THE LAG: Do I really need to explain this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  Updated Rating: 2/10 disable online  and as promised heres my original review    Original review:  WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ DARK SOULS  So i have been a dark souls fan for years and I would say that ds1 and ds2 are two of my favourite games of all time. I was waiting for so long in a state of sheer excitement for the game and THIS IS THE PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ I GET. FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME DROPS FRAMES SO ♥♥♥♥ING HARD ITS RIDICULOUS. NOW BEFORE YOU PIN THIS PROBLEM ON MY COMPUTER I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I COULD RUN WITCHER 3 ON MY COMPUTER FINE. Now this isn't a big issue considering the sheer size of the game but that isnt even close to everything wrong with this game.  1. This game didnt make me give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the story line. I remember watching the intro to ds1 and ds2 and I felt absolutely captivated. I wanted to rekindle that flame if it meant me lighting my literal ♥♥♥♥ing body on fire. The second i got into this game I was excited. So i made a character, jumped in and immedeatly was ♥♥♥♥ing lost. One of the biggest parts of the souls games was the STORY AND IT FEELS LIKE THEY TOOK A POTENTIALY GOOD STORY AND SAID ♥♥♥♥ IT LETS THROW IT IN THE DLC  2. THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMBAT. I loved the pace of dark souls 1. You would encounter these powerful enemies and you would find yourself trying to find every weakness and ways to beat the enemy. I loved the fights where it was you and a boss like sif staring each other down both trying to get a few good hits in before dodging away. THIS GAME FEELS LIKE IM STICKING A ♥♥♥♥ING FORK IN A TOASTER. Here's is the AI in ds1 'Well if i move back I can get him into this trap and one of us will block his exit'. Here's the AI in ds3 'Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash, slash'. THEY FEEL ♥♥♥♥ING BRAINDEAD. IT JUST FEELS LIKE THE SAME RESKINNED ENEMY SLASHING AS MUCH AS ITS STAMINA WILL ALLOW IT  3. It's just not engaging at all  0/10 ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME GO SUCK A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥",

The original DS was supportive of a very calculated approach to fights, sadly and, I believe due to influence from Bloodbourne, this is no longer the case. Where previously you could keep your shield up and time your attacks you're know faced with unrelenting enemies that have combos capable of wearing you down and then beat you to a pulp. This is also a problem in bosses, that this time have a lot more stamina and a few one or two-hit kill attacks., making them incredibly more difficult to beat and far less fun - I really felt like I was losing unjustly and that made me want to give up and just summon help, killing a fundamental part of the enjoyment.  A solution to this overpowered attacks problem could be found in armour reinforcement, but that is now gone, reducing your ability to 'bulk up' before trying a tough fight to levels and (far less significant) weapon upgrades.  The game's NPCs are also far less interesting and diverse and their appearances are very poorly spread out.  From about a point early in the game the best tactic starts to be 'go up to enemy and spam quick attack so it can't move' - this had no place in a Souls game.  If you're considering buying this game I'd say: just go play the first one.",

(fixed) Literally, bonfire was the hardest boss in the game. Optimization is absolute worst. (not fixed) Then FromSoft started banning legit players, just because. who knows. (not fixed) Some of the Covenants like Farron and Blue Sentinels don't work, they simply don't summon you. (not fixed) Poise is broken and doesn't work. (not fixed) PVP balance is absolute worst. First souls game where 5vs1 is acceptable and no amount of 'getting good' will save this. (not fixed) Longswords and rapiers are absolutely broken and OP. (not fixed) Many amazing gameplay elements that Dark Souls 2 introduced are gone: No small white/red stones. If you kill boss - co-op and pvp(forceful invade) in that area is gone for good until NG+. No more indicator what maps are popular for pvp. Slow, methodical and tactical approach of Dark Souls is gone in favor of fast pacing Bloodborn, were enemies hit like characters from Mortal Kombat or Tekken. Less spells, less pyromancies, less miracles. Pyromancy depends on sorcery and faith this time, which abolishes whole purpose of this school. Faith spells are absolutely worthless. Sorcery is legit, but struggles unlike DS1/2.  Pros: Amazing, atmospheric, bleak world in best Souls traditions. Good, but somewhat incoherent and hard to follow story. Interesting NPC's with their unique questlines. No more Havel-Mages from DS2.  Original Bosses. Probably the hardest Souls game. Good music. True successor of Dark Souls 1 which brings nostalgia like tears from onion.  TL:DR: Whether you should buy this title mostly depends on do you prefer technical aspect or lore/core/world aspect. Personally, I think game has too much of Bloodborn in it. Even some assets are straightforward copy-paste job from Bloodborn. Still, i'd wait until all issues are fixed and PVP is balanced, and buy only then.",

            "review_text": "Its so good. Really. This is shaping up to be best souls game yet, and I consider DS1 to be my favorite game of all time. The combat feels complete with the arts system, and it adds a whole new layer of strategy to the mix. The world design is as good as Bloodborne. Much like Bloodborne, the weapons in this game feel very visceral, and the blood effects are really well made. The graphics are obviously impressive.  There are only two complaints I have about the game, and those are the story and the difficulty.  The story takes the route of DSII, in that your character is considered some 'chosen one' by every member of the cast right from the beginning. This is something that DS1 perfected, giving you a sense of accomplishment as the people you met previously realize that you aren't one of the many who inevitably give up, but are a persistent enough player to best the game. I don't feel like that here. The Dark Fantasy world set up in the game suffers a bit by this weird-trustworthiness you seem to have without really accomplishing much.  My other complaint is the difficulty. I have died maybe 3 times in the 2 hours i've played the game so far. I'm not playing a specialized build (just a knight with the life ring and a higher emphasis on dex), but i've beat every boss in one try. That isn't souls-like. It could be a number of different things, maybe i just happened upon a really good setup, or i'm carrying over experience from other souls games, but it doesn't feel like it. I got ♥♥♥♥ed in DSII, like really bad. I was expecting to get destroyed in DSIII, but it hasn't happened yet.  The optimization is on par with SotFS. I haven't had any problems at all, although its worth noting that I am using an XBone controller. I reccommend a controller if you're looking to play any souls game.  All in all, the positives far outweigh the negatives on this one. Dark Souls III is undeniably worth your money, and it is an extremely well put-together game. If you're a returning souls fan, or are looking to get into the series, DSIII is a great experience.",

            "review_text": "The worst of the Dark Souls bunch Take every complain about Dark Souls II, and make it worse. Take every good thing about Dark Souls II and take it away.  -Universe-  New lore ? Nah, let's make dark souls I all over again. They squeeze everything they can from the first game just so they don't have to make new things. You litteraly fight Artorias and the Asylum Demon all over again. And the final boss is basically Gwyn with the exact same moveset and music. The ONLY difference being he can't be parried. New blacksmith ? Nah, let's juste copy past Andre of Astora. New Fire Keeper ? Nah, let's take the maiden in black from demon's souls, and put a tiara on her face.  It could pass for fan service, but it's litteraly the entire game. It's like the dead or alive of Dark Souls, litteraly.   Area wise, it's even worse. The game is litteraly Dark Souls I... Most of the game is juste castle and ruin, exactly like the beginning of Dark Souls I, then, they copy past Anor Londo in the game. Wich give you access to another ruin and another castle... It's that bad.  People complained about fighting too many humanoids and not enough monsters in Dark Souls II, they will be happy, for the game contain the whooping number of 3 'monster' bosses, including... A skeleton but giant, Gwyndolin but with slime, and a dragon wich you can one shoot.  People complained about having only Majula as inerconnectivity in Dark Souls II ? They heard you, now, even the hub isn't connected to anything. I searched for at least half an hours before realising that you litteraly had to teleport to reach the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level. Remember how areas where complexe and with multiple path in Dark Souls I ? Kiss it goodbye too, by the way.  -Gameplay-  You liked powerstancing and dual wielding in dark souls II ? Kiss it goodbye. They added a weapon art system, wich basically replace the L2 by a special attack, but that's all, and it's not even used in dual wielding, you have to two-hand your weapon.  PVP-wise, it's the worst it could possibly be. The covenant are boring, you have the invader, the invader in the swamp, the invader in anor londo, the blue sentinel, the blue sentinel but better and the sunbros. And the invader who can be killed by other invaders. Invaders are usually outnumbered, and they have their estus divided by two, when you want to level your Mound Maker (the covenant where the invaders and the host wants to kill you) they specifically chose worlds where there is a lot of phantoms, so everyone can kill you.  But it's not all, not only the convenant are horrible, but the poise is gone, letting the meta be overwhelmed by straight sword R1 spam.  The game is faster, wich is, IMO, a good thing, you can compare it to bloodborne, wich also make it easier than the two other souls. You can drink estus litteraly during a combo, and the roll as an incredible amount of i-frame. The bosses can also be staggered by regular attacks (looking at you, abyss watchers), or they can be parried into oblivion (looking at you, Gundyr).  With the weapon art system, you would think it allows some crazy weapons, right ? Nah. Remember the straight sword that turns into a whip ? Nothing like that. You just get the usual weapons you can expect, and they most of the time share the same weapon art. Curved sword have a spinning attack, and the boss curved sword as the exact same spinning attack but with pretty clouds... And the same moveset. Artorias sword has the exact same moveset as other greatsword, but the weapon art allows a jump instead of a dash, and a double spin instead of a single spin.  -TL DR-  Basically, it's pure fanservice, who forget everything good that was instaured in previous titles, such as transforming weapons, powerstance, actual dual wielding, interesting NG+. However, it knows how to take advantage of previous title to copy paste bosses and entire areas into the game, as well as putting the same lore all over again. Remember Gwyndolin ? Well, he is a boss in this game too. Remember Priscilla ? Well they cloned her so she is covenant leader (from a covenant wich was already in DSI, because making new covenant would be complicated).  After all that salt, even if the game litteraly spit on most people expectation of the 'last and best of the soulborne serie'... It's still a good game. Not as good as the rest, but a good game on it's own. However I still would recommend it if you didn't get into the soul serie, because you would not see the lack of lore (because the old lore would be new for you), and the game is easier, so you would suffer a lot less. However, be prepared, for the game is really fast compared to the others, so going back too any other game except Bloodborne will be really painful (especially regarding the estus, wich is infinitely faster and allows you to move while drinking, unlike in the I and II).",

Playing single sucks (see comments below), and is actually extremely boring. All single gameplay tunrs into rollover-hit-rollover-hit-repeat console-oriented game with basically same enemies.  Coop doesn't really works because of extremely lagged implementation of coupling, and that f*cking PvP.    Long:  About singleplayer:  this game have nothing to ofer for singleplayer, except of ♥♥♥♥♥iest control/camera/hit_detection out of all console ports seen by me so far (and I've seen a lot). And - I give it that - nice grim lore. I would say - darker than Warhammer even :) Yes, keep in mind that this is actually a _console__port_, which means that game was created for consoles, and then just ported to PC, dragging all classical console problems along with it.   About multiplayer: Let's begin with that getting coop to just work - is a difficult task. Constantly breaking connections, or summoning sighns just don't appear at all. Also - to play coop - you have to posses quite a rare item, which have quite an exceptional drop rate, I must note. So each coop session is like visiting a disneyland.  And now, the major reason WHY coop is actually not a coop at all. It's a f*cking PvP invations system.  When you play coop - you constantly get invaded by some sh*theads. No limits in how often they invade, no limits on items\\levels, at least serious mismatch on those was noted. Shortest cooldown between invastions we've noted was around 1 minute, or even less.  HOW this PvP invasions work - this is something that should be in a bibles of 'How to create sh*ttiest balance in the world in 3 easy steps' '..... Let's begin with something simple.  Let's allow any high-level with any items invade any low-levels, just because it's cool. Hmmm, still to easy for Player. Let's do so that Player couldn't leave untill he kills the motherf*cker, or die.  Sounds pretty well-balanced to me! Just think about it!  Player would have to run and search for invader till the ends of time, nice isn't it? And also basically it will always be Invader's way or no way, because INVADER decides when you can leave your game. Forgot to mention that even killing the game is not an option - you can get banned for that... Cool, right? But, still too simple. What if Invader is a total noob, and even with that he will somehow manage to lose? Oh, yes! Let's do so that invader wouldn't be attacked by mobs, so that he can then just hide among them, and make even easier frags by attacking in the same time with mobs. Now we have a Perfect balance! ...'   P.S. In prev. part there was an option to use item, and stop invasions at least for some time. But not here. And in coop - it was fun untill this invasion non-stop have crossed all the limits... We kill 5 f*cking phantoms in a row, while trying to get trough one single f*cking checkpoint. Seriously?...  For me personaly - there is no coop in this game. And I personally like coop games, so I'm not playin that anymore. Worst part is that this game was really fun when coop worked, and we didn't had that many invasions. But for last week or something - we HAD to go single because of that ♥♥♥♥. And that actually kills whole interest in the game for me.",

The game mechanics are half and half at 5/10, the main reason why PvP is down in the dumps....  ENTERING RANT MODE: Where did powerstancing go? How about every weapon's unique parry, such as those sexy ultra greatsword parries, where are they? Arenas? Netcode? Poise??? BUILD VARIETY?!?!?!? (triggered). Why must everyone roll around so quickly, and all weapon attacks can trun on a dime, making any sort of offense in PvP crumble before the all-direction tracking R1 spam. Most high skill DS3 fightclub tournaments I have been to are all won by whoever DOES NOT attack first, making it just one long staring contest. Did I mention they added phantom range to weapons ON PURPOSE??? The only redeeming mechanic I can think of is weapon arts... IF THEY WERN'T ALL EITHER USELESS OR JUST PLAIN OVERPOWERED. And DON'T get me started on the invasion system. I have been ganked so many times that I see yellow and white phantoms beating me to the ground whenever I close my eyes at night. And blue phantoms. And purple. And even other reds (help me!) Even the Estus is casualified, every Estus heals like a Hidden Blessing. Did I mention how many areas are rehashed from Dark Souls 1? Honestly, DS1 was a 'flawed master piece,' DS2 was balanced but bland, DS3 I found is both bland and flawed. Oh well, I am not the one in charge of this game. I am just some guy ranting about a game he hates that belongs to a franchise he loves. Is there any worse pain for a nerd??",

            "review_text": "After killing a mob of cloaked miscreants I wandered into a large open area with a petrified warrior with a sword stuck through his chest. I pull it out, because nothing back could happen by poking around a immense and fierce looking warrior. Seconds later he animates and comes back to life, as he pulls the mass of his body up and corrects his posture, I tremble in fear and the anticipation of imminent death. I thought well ok, he is a big guy so Ill just roll around his and run circles around him, similar to the trick of defeating the King in Dark Souls 2. Nope, every timeI roll to avoid his fearsome spear he throws out another one and impales me with his spear, lifts me 20 feet in the air and tosses me like a rag doll across the arena. Death.  This is the ONLY game where dying repeatedly and failing repeatedly is ridiculously fun. Every time I die I think, touche, good fight but I will be back. Bosses in DS3 MUST be respected and treated accordingly. They are fearsomely aggressive and have ten fold the strength of you. On my fifth attempt to get him I got his health to half and he began to transform into some ungodly abomination, if only I had the words to describe this. My health was a little sliver and I was out of Estus flasks and unable to heal myself. I thought well **** im done, at least I can just charge and try to learn his behavior and attacks. As I hack away at the demon, and doge and roll from his attacks, his health lingers at just a sliver and we both face the possibility of imminent death. As he swings his arm at we I roll in and my swing connected, ending the battle..  A RUSH of adrenaline flooded me and I began pumping my arms and beating my chest. Never has a game caused me to celebrate in an excessive manner. My neighbours must think Im crazy as they hear me screaming and pounding.   If you have played Dark Souls 1 or 2 you will adore this game, it takes all the best elements of gameplay and refines them, shaping them into a new and perfected style. Similar to bloodborn, you are much more agile and fights are faster and more aggressive. I sunk 300 hours into Dark Souls Scholar of the First Sin on Xbox One, had three characters and would farm the giant memory/level to farm souls and acheive godly strength. As soon as i booted up this game, I quickly realized that the game is MUCH more stingy on souls, which is a good thing and makes the game more challenging.  TECHNICAL ISSUES?@! When I saw all the negative reviews I started to panic. I thought please god no please let me play it. As I booted it up, anticipating some error message or crash, everything worked, The game DOES have frame rate issues, and I think a lot of people not being able to play might not have sufficient hardware on their PC to accomodate the game. I run it at medium settings on a laptop (MSI -3.6ghz CPU/GTX950 GPU) and get probably about 20 FPS. And honestly it doesnt affect me in a huge way. Yes it is annoying but dude this game... Id probably play it with 5 FPS and be happy. I havent played much so I will update this review so it is more comprehensive and detailed.",

            "review_text": "Not nearly as good as sex.  Just as diffcult as marriage. ---------------------------------------------------------------  Dark Souls 3 is my favorite game to come out since Fallout 4. In general it is a diffcult game to recommend to impatient or lazy gamers. The game asks you to figure it out on your own....which is both a blessing and a curse. I really recommend a new player watch some walkthroughs on youtube of the beggining areas to both learn the basics as well determine if you would even want to play this game.   It is extremly hard at first, but once you become comfortable it is hands down the most rewarding RPG you can play. Every single weapon in the game can be made to be good - even your intial weapon. But new weapons aren't just cosmetic or stats upgrade - it becomes about movesets and if you like how it attacks.  Nothing is given to you, not even the story. It is up to you to figure it out. This game will punish your carelessness and reward exploration. The map designs are incredible and shortcuts can be unlocked in very logical and neat ways. The enemy design so far is the best I have seen in any souls / bloodborne game. Each enemy has diffrent movesets and classic enemies like mimics will suprise you with completely new tactics and attacks.  Unlike almost every game out there, boss battles are special. The sense of accomplisment and item reward is incredible. I have read new players spending hours on the first boss which can be a daunting experience. But always understand the game is trying to teach you to 'git gud'. Once you become good and the early areas are easy. Then comes the traps, new enemy attacks, strange boss battles that have you challenging your wits as much as your timing.   On a final note I will say this. I hated Dark Souls 1 when I got it. I hated Dark Souls 2. I disliked Bloodborne......but then when I was bored of other games I jumped back into Dark Souls 2....I learned to like it. I started to get quite good, I watched some video's explaining the stats. Then I tried Bloodborne again and I finally beat it and even did alot of the challice (optional) dungeons.  Without a doubt this game is not for everyone. I hated this type of game intially....now it sits proudly in my Top 5 game series of all time next to civilization, fallout, gta, and elder scrolls.   If you can get past the STEEP intial learning curve....it is amazing experience and possible the most amazing hand crafted worlds.",

On a serious note, everything that Dark Souls and Dark Souls II built up, this game perfected. The system for spell casting with charges on spells was replaced with a mana system, and I really enjoy it. The rolling and parry system were replaced with a roll system that is a bit weirder with the 'I' frames coming in towards the end of the roll, and the parry system now has you parry at the start of the animation rather than at the middle. It took a while to get used to, but I feel like its better than Dark Souls and Dark Souls II's rolling and parry system. The feeling of the game is very atmospheric and you will be presented with gorgeous view after gorgeous view. The graphics are great, and the setting of the game reminds you of places you have been before such as    Firelink Shrine and Anor Londo    while taking a new perspective of each area. The character creation system is just as if not more deep than the other games as well. Overall, while I have not finished the game I think that this is the best in the souls series.

            "review_text": "(Disclaimer: This review is aimed towards those considering paying for this game, not the people who already have bought it, because based on my interactions, they're nothing but blindly accepting sycophants who blame all the flaws of the game on the people playing it, and deny any criticism towards it as being bad at it. This is coming from a member of the Undertale fandom and a fan of the DkS 1 and DkS 2 to a slightly lesser extent)  At any rate, I tried to review this once before, and despite my valid complaints against it, I was immediately flamed for several hours by the aforementioned fanbase before I decided to delete it just to shut the meatheads up.  Dark Souls 3 (and indeed the series in general) is a series of rather grim and dark fantasy games from developer From Software, notorious for being difficult. Set in the final days of The Age of Fire, you are Unkindled, who's goal is to return the stray Lords of Cinder to their thrones in Firelink Shrine, and link the fire to perpetuate The Age of Fire. The game takes place in the hauntingly beautiful Generic Kingdom #873 whose name I'm not sure you ever find out, except for The High Wall of Lothric and Lothric castle, and despite progressing through the game to the Castle, I can't say for certain if that references the Prince or the Kingdom, or both.  To get graphics out of the way, they're nothing short of gorgeous. I'm running it on mostly maxed w/ my 980, and it's absolutely breathtaking the work they put into the game. When I first entered Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and witnessed the gorgeous view presented to you (with messages saying the same, of course) I was stunned.  The gameplay is something I can only describe as hack-n-slash. You're given a wonderfully diverse set of weapons, from daggers, swords and shields to cartoonishly large spiked maces and world-ending sized axes, who each come with a special weapon skill to use the Blue bar (FP) returning from Demon's Souls. Not only that but you can choose from a few different styles of magic. Miracles, a faith based school of holy magic. Pyromancy, self explanitory. Sorcery, you're stereotypical arcane magic based in Intelligence. Not only that but there is also an overarcing school, called Dark Pyromancies/Miracles/Sorceries, based on the AoTA sorceries in DkS 1 and Hexes in DkS2. There really isn't a whole lot you can't do with your character, even if you want to be the guy with the naked fatass character who goes around clocking people with fist weapons.  The story continues the tradition of never forcefeeding you more than you need to know, and some area's even leave you with more questions than answers (The Untended Graves being a prime example of this; A beautiful setting enveloped in darkness, more than that I won't go into for the reader's sake) Leaving you to piece together the background from the dialogues of somewhat rememberable characters and from the descriptions of items (such as boss souls)  Unfortunately that's where the good things I can say about it end. While I appreciated the Tough but fair rule that From Soft. made a key philosophy in Dark Souls, it was lost to a small-to-medium extent in Dark Souls 2, which wasn't unbearable. I talk about this because while it was lessened in 2, it was beaten to a pulp, shot in the face, and thrown in the river in Dark Souls 3 with some of the changes, most notably by adding a large amount of hyperactively aggressive monsters and the nullifying of Poise as a concept.  The first complaint is the most glaring when looking at the game through fresh eyes. A very good example of this the red-eyed sword and throwing knife guy in Catacombs of Carthus, or The Watchdog that you fight when heading to Road of Sacrifices from The Undead Settlement. Both are agile to an extreme degree, hyper aggressive and almost ridiculously strong where if you try to block and roll for an opening, you'll take massive damage from their seemingly infinite stamina, and if you try to attack them first, you'll take massive damage because while Poise does nothing for you, there are quite a few enemies who simply cannot be staggered unless you manage to get several hits in, in quick succession, without your limbs being used to decorate the surrounding area, which means even if you go middle of the road between blocking and attacking first, taking your time and picking your shots, chances are the moment you land a hit on them, the monsters will land several on you, depleting a fair bit of your health. Case in point, the winged knight in Lothric Castle, just before the twin dragons. I did my best to evade his attacks while trying to take shots where it would seem safe to get them, only to land 1 or 2 hits and have a fair bit of my health deleted.  Going from that into the topic of Poise, it only technically exists, and by technically I mean that it is a stat on your screen, nothing more. In the first 2 games, Poise was a stat determined by armor that decides how easy you are to stagger when attacked. While it seemingly worked A-OK in 1/2, it looks like they decided to try and fix something that wasn't broke by making poise pointless and using it for something that I'm convinced is imaginary, hyperarmor, which supposedly makes you unable to be staggered mid-to-late swing, but even reading up on it, equipping the heaviest armor I could, I was still staggered in 1 shot by any monster I tried to go up against.  To summarize (tl;dr) Dark Souls 3 is a beautiful, sometimes very fun game with very high points because of the story and the beauty of it, it also has very very low points because of the fact that they let their reputation of difficulty get in the way of also making it not a totally frustrating mess. While it's not always obnoxious, I would say more often than not. That being said I will be playing it completion against better judgement, and I would only recommend it if you're okay with the above, or a diehard fan of From Softs work.      Let loose with your flaming, fanboys. I'm not indulging you any further than I already have ☀   ",

From Software made a GREAT improvement between DS1 and DS2 release in terms of optimization to run on PC. DS3 took a step backwards, and it's infuriating. First of all, the character models look worse than DS2. That's actually a small complaint, but worth noting. My GIANT complaint hinges on the fact that the settings appear to do very little, and despite my PC falling well above minimum specs to run the game, I still experience drops in FPS on lowest settings.   This is unacceptable from a large publisher, frankly. I payed 80 bucks for this ♥♥♥♥ on launch, knowing I may have troubles running it. Skip ahead to multiple system upgrades, many moths later. The game STILL runs like crap, and drops in FPS every couple minutes for a few seconds. This is an AAA+ title.... how in the name of ♥♥♥♥ is it acceptable for it to be optimized soooo terribly? I paid 80 ♥♥♥♥ing bucks for this ♥♥♥♥, and they can't even patch out these USER RESEARCHED ISSUES. Meaning their work is already done. There are literally dozens of threads online with changes to get it running properly... yet no patch... Great, now I'm going to spend a couple hours running through editing my launch file to get this steaming pile of software running like it should. GREAT! I'm glad I could spend 8+ hours ♥♥♥♥ing with your ♥♥♥♥♥ily developed pile of crap software before it became playable. Honestly I would just delete this pile of trash software and never look at it again, but after dropping close to 100 bucks, I feel like I really need to get my money worth.... which is APPARENTLY going to be very challenging. Thanks From Software, I look forwarding to pirating your next release as compensation.",

There's also plenty of areas again where you need to bait enemies to attack you one by one cause they decided to add mobs consisting of tough enemies.

( check specs in profile) anyway lets begin:  berserk references : some equipment from guts's pre dragon slayer set  gameplay : the gameplay is improved alot , FROM took the best elements out of each of their titles to create the best gameplay ever seen in a souls borne game. In dark souls the gameplay was clunky and sometimes annoying. In darksouls 3 you get the fluidity of bloodborne with elements of demon's souls and dark souls , so its basically one big cluster ♥♥♥♥ of awesomeness.  Story : simple plot , complicated lore 10/10  Difficulty : This game's difficulty gradually increases while you play , so if you're new, this game is a great entry for you. Dont get me wrong the game is difficult as ♥♥♥♥ and you'll die a ♥♥♥♥ ton of times , basically if you played souls before then the first boss will be asylum demon difficulty if you didnt then it wouldve been the last boss of a casual game ! GIT GUD CASUL SKRUB .   covenants :i found 7 covenants in the game and most of them really do effect your online experience.   verdict : This has to be one of the best action RPG games i ever played in my life ...

The list I've experienced: Ambient/background audio cutting out and instantly resetting when rotating the camera/inspecting your inventory/interacting with objects, which ruins immersion. FPS drops in many areas, which makes the game even harder to play when you cannot react to enemies. Not even able to start the game, and crashing in random areas.   Until these bugs are fixed, I will hold off on playing the game. I have no desire to play as long as FPS drops and crashing is common.

It could be the interlinked world with most bonfires being unwarpable, to create journeys between bonfires. It could be the combat, where most everything has a simple moveset that you can do so much with if you take advantage. It could be me just clinging on to the past, because I LOVE all these old boss fights and areas, O&amp;S are the best. The thing that kinda pisses me off about this game is that From was clearly aiming for a wider audience, by making TV advertizements and such. This means that so many people are being pulled into the 3rd game with no prior experience, and just rage quitting because they don't understand what to do. One of my friends refuses to even try the old game because he says it 'sucks', even though he has never actually played it. So if you are someone who wants to try out Dark Souls and thinks they should get the 3rd first, don't. The games are so much more satisfying to play sequentially and the difficulty makes a lot more sense that way.",

There are so many issues with the kb/m controls and camera movement that the game is giving me actual headaches. The developers didn't even bother to change key symbols in the tutorials/prompts to kb/m rather than controller. Which means you have to continually check in the Options to figure out just what buttons you need to press. Absolute laziness on their part.   Camera movement is absolutely jittery and keeps readjusting without mouse input, based on player movement. There is no option to disable this. Sprint and dodge are forcefully bound to the same button so there is always a delay in dodging; the game is deciding which action you want to do.   If you can get past the terrible controls or buy a controller then you can likely enjoy the game. But just know that something like 90% of the initial difficulty in this game just comes from fighting camera movement or figuring out what the hell a little rectangle with an R is supposed to mean for keyboard input.",

Once in the new game menu, the character animation fails and does not update after a while. For instance, if you change beard more than once it stops after a while and freezes the picture. Does not matter what you do, it just shows the same picture of your character. The only thing is to restart the game which then puts you back to square one. Very Beta or Alpha to me. Also, how intuitive that you have to right click and choose Back every time you want to back one step. There is about hundred different apperance settings so it gets KINDA BORING. Escape woud have been nice or back step.... or maybe a BACK BUTTON? But no, this is a video game. No buttons. Only hand controls. Nothing works without clicking through a bunch of extra menus.

Ds3 pvp is HORRIBLE the frames are off... you cant parry or backstab worth a crap. everyone just using pure strength builds with long swords... boring... before any one goes 'get good', i spent over 100hrs on ds2 finding the right pvp movent for the correct parries and backstabs + hit frames... ds3... well i have started the backstab animation to only have people roll away.... i have parried people who has STILL hit me casuing us both to stagger.... not to mention if u wanna hit someone while rolling just pray to god your the host, other wise you hear the sounds of the connection but no damage nothing.....  Story line + Pvp -----  I would love to give it a thumbs up but for me i was here to pvp....  ps. Kiddies will love the pvp... just saying.",

Dark Souls has one of the most poisionous communitys I had ever the misfortune to be a part of.  If you want to finnish a summ covenant that you have missed in the first playthrought, good luck and have fun to you. You should rather play the game from the beginning again. The odds are against you. You invading the same place over and over again will be exploited by sodomist who try to enrage you and annoy you until you quit the game.  The cases in which you wont get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, are including ganking against you, lagging people which will kill you by luck and lag, and people which think it is funny to hide fron you, so that you have to walk through the map for up to half an hour just to find them and die anyway.  I had 3 Cases of people which only purpose has been to annoy me for as long as possible instead of showing some mercy and being friendly for once in the 20 times i invaded them. I also just got a case of someone invading me, which made my game lag, causing my death, even so i am the freaking host if someone invades me and it should lag for them. Sure there are ways to avoid this kind of situations, but if you get 3 of them in one evening, imagie how many more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s there are proportionally if i had avoided them. ♥♥♥♥ this community.   Examples for a good community on the other hand are tf2. Even tho there are a few bad egg there either, in general you will fairly esasy find some nice people which are willing to help you there.  I could say that the lore of the series is pretty interesting, but you wont understand a thing without research it for hours, so just watch a few Youtube Video about the Lore, starting with Dark Souls 1, thats way easyer and free.",

It was one of those purchases where I was waiting for a real game to come out and this would hold me over. The graphics are ok, but not up to AAA status. The stages are shockingly short. The environments are creative but the game play is kinda boring. I assume hard battles are to compensate for the short game play. Since the enemies are predictable and fight according to a pattern, once you identify the pattern, they are no longer a challenge. There is no story, a hand full of NPCs who's voice acting sounds like they phoned it in, and basically the goal is to wander around, killing things and dealing with invaders on rare occasions. PVP seems to be the main draw of this game but it is poorly executed. Co-op is no where to be found, players are primarily concerned with murdering you as opposed to playing with you. Hidetaka Miyazaki will never be able to compete with real game developers like the ones who created games like Dragonage, Witcher 3 or Skyrim if this is the best he can come up with. The quick cash grab for the short over priced DLCs?, which everyone is complaining about,... just makes this game even more of a joke.",

The enemies don't really scale to any meaningful difficulty, so you'll be a true god amongst the ashes.

One that is terrible and that a small dedicated fanbois playerbase essentially lies about because they cannot accept the fact that the latest game in a series they are dedicated to had a dev team that simply did a poor job.  The RPG element is fine albeit slim as heck. Slim enough to give you pause as to why your character should care about in game events.  Most play styles are not viable. You WILL play this as a sword and board knight, or your character will be terrible.  Gameplay is button mashing Xbox cheese. No....let me say again....zero skill involved. Over and over again, there are things to do. You do them exactly right or you die. Killing bosses is essentially looking up on Youtube, seeing the exact sequence of moves and then repeating them. That hasn't been acceptable for ten years plus now and is a reflection of the extremely dated consoles with tiny fractions of resources real computers have. There is no real game AI.  This is a POOR port to the PC which does not even bother to mention the PC settings. Ironically, they are better than any game pad. But the dev team just didn't care. Did the barest minimum job.  There are many areas in the game which make you so mad at the poor development job, you ragequit. How bad is it? For a second time, while buying something at a vendor, my character decided to swing at them. Which permanently agroes them, and usually means you kill them....breaking large sections of quest chains. There is a way to fix this that is long, complicated, undocumented and most people just start over. The whole thing is poor dev planning.  After the second time it happened, I erased the game.  Not worth my time. There are half a dozen other games I could be playing and this one is literal drek.",

Also, people online are saying that NG+ has absolutely nothing new besides a few +1 or +2 rings. Recommend you wait for a bundle with the game+DLC or buy on sale, its not worth full price at the moment.   I'm happy to report I experienced no crashes on my gaming laptop. Bugs at the moment include summon/phantom animation, and a jerky framerate. Gameplay wise, DS3 is a hybrid of DS1 and Bloodborne, with more emphasis on the Bloodborne elements IMO. The visual direction resembles DS1 and Bloodborne. In fact, most new features from DS2 are absent.",

Invading isn't fun either since you always have to fight against hosts resummoning their armies of insta healing phantoms that r1 spam you to death with their dark swords. The only viable things are one shot combos or one shot parry fishing. 1/10  To PvE: WAY too much fan service and lots of stupid and unbalanced enemies. It can be fun to play with a friend who doesn't know it either in your first playthrough. But generally only really fun during the first 2 playthroughs. Get's boring afterwards, unlike ds2 which was way more fun to replay even if you already completed it 10 times. I'd rate 5/10  Overall: PvE is lacking fun to really get into it like in ds1 or ds2. PvP is crap and not worth your time. That's why i (just like A LOT of other people) go back to ds2 for it 3/10 game It just isn't a good last souls game. Really under all of my expectations",

Enemies are much more varied now than the typical large men with large swords in heavy armor of Dark Souls II, and their movesets are quite more complicated now. I did not try PVP extensively because of slow internet, but there are still NPCs which can invade you or be summoned to help you. (though I hear mage builds are less viable now)  Soundtrack is epic as always, and the sound design can be very atmospheric (hint: turn up the volume when you reach Irithyll Dungeon).   Story-wise, the game doesn't explicitly tell it to you in your face, but the background lore can be gleaned from tidbits in dialogue and item description so that you yourself can connect the dots.

The combat is fluid, the design of everything is breathtaking and the music is fantastic. There are a lot of weapons to use, diverse builds that you can create to change your playstyle, stat and resetting for trying something different. There is of course as every other Dark Souls game also multiplayer. You can read messages left by other players to aid you on your quest, you can coop with two or three other players and you can invade or be invaded by other players for player versus player.   As for the cons. The lack of covenant variety is sad and some covenants plain don't work correctly. There could had been some great stuff that could had been included on the covenants but given what is in the game the only ones who get constant activity are the pvp invasion covenants and the coop covenants. The covenants that rely on being summoned into a faction area almost never work and for some reason some players get summoned more than other players.  While PvP Arenas are finally in the game via it's first dlc I believe it's something that should had been on the base game. Regardless even with it's cons the game is still fantastic and I would greatly recommend it.",

I've loved every game of the 'Soulsborne' series so far (yes, even Dark Souls 2), and this one is no exception.  Much of the gameplay is the same but in this case that's not really a bad thing. You can still expect the same great challenges and adversity as in the previous games. Scores of weaponry, armor, and spells await your discovery, and hordes of horrors await you in their dread halls. To be honest, much of the equipment and spells you find are either completely useless or completely broken, but in my opinion learning which is which in PVE and PVP can be fun in and of itself.  And then, when you're done with the game and have absolutely destroyed every boss solo on NG+++++++ with your +10 blessed caestus (Punchie) and +10 hollow broadsword (Stabbie), the PVP arena awaits you where you can get absolutely destroyed over and over again by a horrifying, lanky, blueberry man while the onlooking crowd quietly mimes their cheers.  I'd definitely recommend adding this one to your library. Naturally you can wait for a big discount if you're the frugal sort. It doesn't really matter when as long as you get it in the end. And if you're new to the series, it's never too late to learn to git gud.  Praise the sun. 7/10.",

I am a HUGE fan of the work From Software have put into these games.  Every Souls game is a unique experience. But still with a lot of familiar connections to each other. A lot of people LOVED DS1 and hated DS2.. I loved both, for different reasons. But i most say that From Software took all the best things from every souls game and put in into this great experience of a game.. The only candidate from the previous souls games, to compete with this magnificent specimen of a game, would be Bloodborne. But they are still quite different.  DS3 is a masterpiece in many ways.. Souls-like has become a very popular and great genre. And DS3 is the final chapter to the very GRANDFATHER of the souls-like genre!",

From a story perspective, we as the Ashen One, are a mass of ashes from sacrificed individuals sent to decide the final fate of the world. Whether it is to plunge it into darkness, or keep it in the current age only a while longer. From a story perspective, it is a bit of a retreading through Dark Souls 1 mixed with new areas and bosses.    The only downsides are that From has screwed over Convenants with auto-summons. Being a mound maker is fun and hectic as you can attack anyone and everyone. However, being an Aldrich Faithful, a Blue Sentinel/Darkmoon, or a Farron Guard is annoying as you wait in invisible lines to maybe, probably be summoned to a gank fest. The game has lost a significant amount of the community as playing past level 100 sees very little amounts of players and making it very hard to 'farm' Covenant items. If you are planning on continuing to NG+ or NG++ and up, it's mostly going to be a solo battle.   As well, From deciced to port over the combat from Bloodborne as precise stabs are much less likely to help you win as spanking enemies with the fast sweeps of the straight sword stun locking any in its low stamina swings. This is only a minor gripe as it becomes kinda unfair when you just do 'R1 to win' with the straight swords.  I love Souls, all of them. All the flaws, all the weird enemy placements, all the dumb traps, all the pitfalls, everything. In a way, these show true determination. Once you start from nothing, stomp through hours upon hours of slicing and hacking your way through enemy mobs and invaders. Die from traps, swarming, or just getting bugged/stunlocked. You reach the final leg of your journey, the last boss, and you can look back at everything you've done and realize that 'through sheer determination, force of will, and self-induced hair loss, I did it. I made it here. And now, I'm gonna finish it, after I die about 3-4 times to figure out the boss' pattern!'",

Loved seeing some familiar faces again. Although the game does bring quite a bit back from previous games, it does it right, some NPCs return, Covenents are pretty much what you expect, but they dont shove these references at you everywhere you go.  There are a few cons. The frame rate can drop in certain areas and freeze up for a moment which can really screw you up during a boss fight. I haven't had any issues with crashing but it seems to be a big problem for some. These problems can be fixed in a patch.  If this really is the last Souls game.

It's sortof a middle grounds between dark souls 1 and 2, and what I mean by that is that it's not exactly as noob friendly as dark souls 2, but it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to challenge and atmosphere. Granted I understand why you'd make a game more friendly to new players, but that sacrifices a lot of the charm of a souls game. Even as far as the dlc goes - spoliers: There is 1 main boss and 1 optional boss and neither are particularly challenging. You could easily clear the first dlc in a couple hours, and that's with finding every item. Then once you clear it, you notice that you got about 4 items actually worth something. Even back in Artorias of the Abyss, dlcs to the game added much more content including more explorable areas, more bosses, more items. It just leaves a lot to be desired.  Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I say that it's something that all souls fans will appreciate throughout? Definitely not. If they made improvements could the game be amazing? Yes, and I will continue to believe that even if the developers speak to me directly and tell me why they aren't making those changes.  Overall verdict: 6/10. Worth playing, but not as much as other titles from this developer.",

The difference with this one is that it doesn't have it's own personality, it instead rides on the nostalgia of ds1 fans which for me personally made it feel like a shallow sequal.   It's still a very good game, but it really is a dark souls 1.5 type of deal. There are new stuff here to enjoy but there's is an anoying amount of fan-service that will only go unnoticed by a new souls player.   In conclusion: If you couldn't get into DS1 then this might do it for you, the combat is slightley faster and it's easier to move around in the world thanks to the teleporting without the lord vessel.",

Dark Souls III is more of a sequel to the first game than the second one was. The same framework in terms of the mechanics and lore/world-building is there, combat definitely a bit smoother, still as nuanced and many styles to go with; strength, dexterity, magic-focused, etc.   The world-building and level design, though some parts derivative of their previous games, it is sublime. And the boss battles, so rememberable, and with a great soundtrack to compliment each, and the whole game in general. Dark Souls doesn't hold your hold and over-feed you with direction and lore like most games, it has this wonderful mystery about it and when you go searching for that lore and going in whatever direction you take, it can be wonderful. Even more fun putting your own interpretion on it as some of it can come off as ambigious, which I think is intended by the developer, as was the case in their previous Souls games and Bloodborne.  Game even has multiplayer, PVP and PVE, you can summon a co-op buddy to help you with boss battles or against dark spirits i.e. people who invade other people's worlds, which I dabbled in and was extremely fun, and I'm not really a multiplayer guy! There's a sense of sportsmanship with this, you bow to one another and then commence fighting, no health potion taking (well, sometimes, not everyone is the same unnfortunately) and make more funny gestures via the silly and wonderful gesture system, Praise the Sun anymore!  Dark Souls III is one of the most immersive, eerie, dark, and wonderful RPGs I have played in years and since the first Dark Souls game, and can't wait to see what more From Software can offer but as for this series, this is a fantastic end to an already fantastic trilogy.

Along my theory, the second in the series carries off the end of the first when you choose to continue the flame. Dark Souls 3's combat is so much better than either of the first two. They made it so much faster, so much more responsive. You can actually roll away from attacks a lot more efficiently than the previous two. Of course, what's a Dark Souls game without it's in-depth, unique, and downright fantastic story telling. In the third, you're basically off to destroy the Lords of Cinder and attempt to rekindle the flame. Of course, since Bloodborne had a sneaky way to create an extra ending, as did Dark Souls 3. How? I won't spoil that. Honestly, this is the best of the series, and there are some throwbacks, if you catch my drift.",

Save your money and buy something else. or at least wait till this piece of garbage is fixed by the community as I have little faith From Soft will do anything to fix this bs.  Edit: Apparently the severe issues I was having were related to the latest patch from nVidia. Any demanding game on my system would stick my gpu into a low performance state. After rolling back my graphics drivers the game runs fine. It is worth mentioning that this game is still a bit poorly optimized and if you are running the game on a lower spec machine (mine barely meets minimum for gpu) you will not be able to run the game at rock solid 60 fps the whole time. With settings turned to low it does run well enough.  As for the content. It's dark souls. you should know if you like it or not. I have noticed a slight lack of enemy variety (especially considering some are several carbon copies of enemies from previous souls games). The game seems to have much more difficult enemies with ridiculously strong attacks that are hard to counter. These enemies are usually relegated to special encounters but some of them respawn which make going through some areas a complete chore. The boss bottles have all been wonderful. I hear PvP is good as well.",

Now seriously the game overall is pretty good but it has some flaws that the original doesn't and it corrected some of the original: First of all the online goes well as dark souls 2 but as I mentioned earlier it's just not so fair when I encounter a gangbang of especters trying to stab me to death, and there can be a lot of fun sittuations . The system is as of usual but faster and a mix of bloodborne and dark souls, the rolling is better implemented and it's overall a better gaming experience . The 'Gym Effect' as I say it like when you go to gym and spend like half a year doing exercise you expect to upgrade, but in dark souls 2 somethings quirk a little and if I spend two hours farming I want to improve my character not just be able to manage more powerful weapons. The escenaries and lore are good but not as inter connected as dark souls 1 yes zones connect but not as when in dark souls 1 you say ahhhhh after discovering a hidden path they just connect. The boss fights are epic and they are less abundant . There are some flaws with the stats as the stability because how can a dagger stagger me with a high heavy armor |How can it happen and I had high stability | . The graphics are goood but some textures are you know like youtube quality (confusing(they are sometimes good and then you say 'is that an armor or a curtain')) The essence is there but sometimes things get too confusing, for example dark souls 1 gave you a clear objective: to erase the curse by explaining you what was happening and presenting characters that had charisma to encourage you and it had a good improving and leveling up sensation so you continued but in dark souls 2 i think this didn't happened as the first and in dark souls 3 it's in the middle for example the situation you're in you are just dropped and forced to fight monsters and then you enter a ¿church? with a bunch of people (long live Andre the immortal) and just told to slay more bosses, ¿why? because you're the chosen one , because the first person you see walk in a building you suppose he's the chosen one and no one of the others who some are unkindleds are aren't the chosen ones and then you are forced to become some sort of leader and rescue others , yeah ¿why not?.   The mark I give it is 9.3 for newcomers it will be very good (I suppose ) and it's not as slow and difficult as the first and for veterans it's more of what we like. Please realise this is my opinion and it's taken from my individual experience and I don't think that developing games is easy Pd: I have a great respect for From software keep making great games.",

I have to add that I never ever played with the DS series. I saw it one of my favourie youtube blogger playing with it and I checked it if it possible to play in coop since I only play games with friends. I never or very rare occasion when I start something in single. Anyway........I see big letters on the site, CO-OP. Ok, lets see.  First of all that the huge suck that I had to live through with start of the game to even start playing with friends is one thing. I died I think 80 times. Ok, I'm a clumsy f*ck you can say that and I can accept that I'm not that good player after 37 (around 25 years of gaming) years. Lets say I'm not for this game type. Anyway, after this the real pain started when you have to trick the game of even see my friends sign to invite. Literally we spent 1-1.5 hour sometimes to even see our summoning signs. No user friendly system in any way. And most of the fans saying this is because this is game is hard. No....the hardness is note same with dumbness I think. No real guide in any way. Yes we figured it out ok. So be it. After this whole server lag issue that I found guide with information like 'please do not go to there to put a sign because it is possibility that a not open door could cause an issue with summoning'. Are you kidding? Really? Maybe I should sacrifice a chicken in the kitchen ritually to have lucky enough to summon my friend in a CO-OP game as on the official site saying?  No....I don't even start the fact that after we finally started to enjoy the game and accept the fact that we need to kill three times the current area boss to move forward together (because WE WANTED TO PLAY cooperatively and this is why we bought it) after the tree boss a sequence arrived where all of us had to move forward and kill a smaller boss and move toward an area where you cannot invite anyone. Really? A co-op game.......really? Ohh when finally moved forward again summoning issues, 2 of my friends cannot join, only one of them, lets try other way, I can join to one of them but the 3rd one cannot. Another 1 hour pure suffering and brain damage. Ok, lets see if we use that damn thing which needed for 4 player (just a reminder we are 3) but who knows wtf is going on in this japanese madness. Yeah......suddenly all the summoning sign appeared and my friend managed to summon us. OMG so great! (no guide, no user friendly explanation wtf is going on since we are 3 not 4 so why we needed that damn Dried Finger but lets move forward......).  Then again a fun part since now two player can invade our game where simply wanted to play a story mode co-op game. We manager to kill two invaders. In matter of fact usually we managed to kill all the invaders previously all the time. We can say it is fun. After we killed one invader a counter started probably and we managed to play this twisted co-op (in between us we are not allowed to say this word co-op about this game, it is forbidden.......) nicely. Ohh this also ended probably since we are experiencing that after we killed two invaders suddenly again two appeared we have no clue why or maybe when one of us died and re-invited the counter resets and again new invaders arriving. So basically now we couldn't managed to move forward with the story together (in a so callod CO-OP game) because invader pvp maniacs attacked us all the time and they just simply not letting us be and play a damn story together. Nice! So you win and kill everyone without death or you fcked basically. Just forcing me to play PVP (I don't remember if I mentioned earlier: IN A CO-OP GAME as the website saying) without any option. Yeah I know. I read it. Switch off online and pull out the internet cable. Yeah........and play singe which I won't cause I bought this because it is saying Co-OP....maybe I mentioned couple of times, sorry.  And you know what? I love the game. I love the atmosphere. I love the view. But technical point of you it is a poor designed poor programmed joke. Or ok......remove the co-op section from the marketing section. And never ever mentioned until you understand what does that mean.   p.s. ohh the fact that you have to set the settings all the time because if you don't the game just crash the ♥♥♥ out......lightning detail stuff to low but anyway nothing have been saved if you set up and quite properly. It just put things on random sometimes. When you start the game again.  Thank you and sorry",

It was at this point the game decided I was no longer allowed to play my main character, I had found the infinite loading screen... I assumed that I corrupted my save file, which was fine I was okay with starting over but after making a new character and running to the first boss, who wasnt there, I quit the game(as per instructed) to reload the area and found ALL my characters were broken and wouldnt load any bosses or travel or even load back into the game after I quit...

Pros: 1) The level design is good 2) The game itself is so good to look at 3) Offers a lot to do regardless of it being smaller than the other two games 4) Co-op connecting is simpler 5) The different quests and how to get them are interesting 6) Runs smooth even the controls whether it be controller or keyboard and mouse 7) It gives a feel of nostalgia, offering similarities between Dark Souls 1 and itself 8) Multiplayer (invasions, etc.) is better than before in my opionion 9) Get all the weapons that the enemies have and not far as I can see  Cons: 1) Boss/enemy difficulty could be more resistant, just a bit more at least between playthroughs as they felt the same 2) Kind of annoying to see every phantom sign near enough to say the words 'Unable to summon Phantom' 3) It would be nice to have something like the bonfire ascetic back or something similar but thats my opinion  I don't really have a problem with this game at all and don't let me by saying the boss and enemy difficulty could be more resistant put you off as the game is still quite a challenge, I said that mainly for additional playthroughs. To be honest as I'm having fun with the game I do recommend it especially if you have played the others and I cannot wait to see what they do to expand the game with DLC.  Bugs: Now whilst a lot of people have been having issues with the game I've only incountered two bugs.  1)The First is when creating a character and choosing any hair or facial hair and going through the options too fast can cause the right side screen which shows what your character looks like freezes. Now the three ways I found to unfreeze and get around it were, start character creation again. Two is save the character and then load it and go through it again so you don't have the to hassle at the start of it again. Three, go really slow when choosing the hair orfacial hair.  2)The second bug was when playing the game after a long duration realy players in invasions or co-op would start sliding instead of showing themselves walking and in rare cases the boses would also slide doing no damage to players that have joined a host to fight said boss.",

On top of this the combat systems have been made a lot more fluid and have a large number of potential options for the different classes. Weapons also contain special moves that can be actived to buff your character or offer new combat abilities, this isn't amazingly useful in the standard game but if you are ever caught in a pvp situation they are essential.

It stops background programs while you're gaming and boosts your frame rates. I thought it sounded silly, but as soon as I started using it I haven't had the slightest problems with the game and I was content playing it offline it's just so good. If you loved Dark Souls and were not really a big fan of Dark Souls II then I highly recommend this. This feels like the real sequel we should've gotten. The story is really great too, I mean as far as what little story informatioin the game gives, Tons of armor and weapons from past games and past npc's, new covenants allowing 1v1v1 or sometimes I've been involved in battles with up to 4 other players which is awesome even when I get my ♥♥♥ kicked. Weapon arts add a whole new depth to the combat that provides a lot more play styles than previous installments.

There's a gimmick to every enemy and boss, and the trick is to use them to your advantage, while throwing in some of your own skill. This is nicely supplemented by the new mechanics, like weapon skills, which add a new sort of flavor to the combat.  I've beaten three bosses so far, and it's funny that the first one gave me the most trouble -- at least one of the other two I killed in one try while taking no damage. And yet, it doesn't really feel that you've become more powerful, but instead that you as a player have grown in experience, which is an intensely satisfying feeling and what makes the Souls games so appealing.  Oh, and the game looks gorgeous, the voice acting is superb, the soundtrack is excellent, and I've experienced very minimal technical difficulty. So there's that.  In short, don't think you have to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy this game. Anyone can conquer Dark Souls with enough perseverence and determination, and once you do it's a sense of victory unlike any other.",

Then I fought one of the best bosses ever (coffcoffAbyss Watcherscoffcoff), and now I think this might be my favorite game of the series so far.  The OST and audio effects are great, the gameplay is better and faster, and the visuals are better than DS2 but they still look downgraded even at max settings, yet again.  There are new and cooler weapons, and the TP bar that is used for magic/miracles as well as new special techniques each weapon type has. So now instead of having magic/miracles that can only be used exactly 3 times can now be used as long as you have enough TP.  Lorewise, we are back to the same place where DS1 happened, so...you might see some familiar faces around? But the new characters are also great. They have backstory that you need to discover yourself, and I somehow got attached to some of them without realizing and even got ♥♥♥♥ing worried sick when they disappeared on me...  Now for the bad part. Honestly, the only bad thing I can think about this game is that the online gameplay sometimes is laggy. Not that this is new to any DarkSouls player, but this time you will see the other players standing literally static, just the model frozen and hovering around you. For coop this isnt that bad, but if its PVP you will not see the other player moves, so you wont know what the ♥♥♥♥ he is attacking you with so good luck trying to defend yourself. Theres also a annoying hiccup that randomly happen while opening/closing menus, when the game is saving, or when you are just walking around. Its not that bad but when it happens at crucial moments it annoys the ♥♥♥♥ outta me. Oh, and if you care about character customization, have fun with this one. For some weird reason From Software decided to make the character model face all glued togheter, so if you try to change the chin you will be also changing the mouth, or if you change the brows the eyes are going to move too, or change the lips color and watch the whole ♥♥♥♥ing face of you character turn green. YES, GREEN! What the actual ♥♥♥♥, From?!  Though they did add more customization options and its possible to make a decent character, but be prepared to waste more time on it than should have been necessary...   Overall, this game is really worth the money, and its safe to say you will put a good chunk of your free time in it. I havent even finished the game yet and I'm already hyped to start another playthrough! If you are scared about people's complaining about the game not running at all for them, wait till they are done patching the game. But I honestly recommend getting it now while the new players still need to git gud and their souls are fresh and delicious. Praise the ♥♥♥♥ing Old Wolf!",

You can download third party software to make it run better, but I feel that it's really the developer's job to make sure their game is playable.  Problems aside, I really did like the game itself. I never played a Dark Souls game before, so I wasn't prepared for the shovel to the face that was the first boss, but despite the extreme challenge I so far haven't found it unfair.",

There is so much to this game from the combat to the learning curve. Almost every weapon you pick up has a different playstyle to it, so mastering them all is near impossible, and even after mastering that weapon, you still die, a lot! This game is not for the faint hearted nor the people that have severe anger issues.

            "review_text": "This is probably the best action game i've ever played, by far.  First, I want to point out that I got this game on PC through steam, and quickly realized it wasn't intended to be played with a keyboard and mouse. I also crashed multiple times on the lowest settings and also had severe framerate drops (on a pretty decent computer). I ended up getting a steam refund (thank god that was an option) and getting the game for Xbox One and have since put in about 60 hours. If you don't have a steam controller and a strong PC, I strongly advise you to look into a different platform.  It's true that this game is difficult. To my surprise though, it's not that frustrating for me. I go into the game knowing that some enemies are going to mop the floor with me, sometimes repeatedly. This was especially true on my first playthrough. Here are some tips to keep the frustration to a minimum.  one: Keep the stakes low. When you die, you drop all of your souls (currency). you have a chance to pick them up near the place you died, but if you die again before you pick them up, they're gone. For this reason, when you reach a bonfire (checkpoint), make it a habit to go back to the Firelink Shrine (your home base) and spend your souls.  two: Don't force yourself to play when you're not in the mood. This game, by nature is very stressful, even when you're doing well. If you're not eager to play, and you have a sense of dread about a new area, take a break, and don't play until you really want to.  three: Don't set high expectations. Nomatter what skill level you are in other games, you will always start as a noob in Dark Souls. Knowing each enemy is crucial. You will die a lot on your first playthrough. Just keep in mind that with every failed attempt, you get a little better. (by the way, there's no easy-mode difficulty setting)  four: The key to being good at this game is patience. It's the times you try to breeze through an area that you get your organs served to you on a plate. With the way the combat system works, fighting multiple enemies is a terrible idea. Use a range weapon to lure them one at a time. There are also a lot of ambushes. Excersize caution around ledges, doorways and dark areas where enemies might hide. Also keep in mind that some items are meant to lure you. If you don't mind spoilers, use online resources. Watch playthroughs and guides, and read up on the Dark Souls wiki.  The combat in this game is extremely engaging and doesn't get old. Since every enemy has the potential to ruin your day, it really keeps you on your toes. The combat is all about timing, and since each enemy has different behavior, attacks and weaknesses, it's crucial to know each enemy. If your smart, you'll find yourself occasionally taking the time to study how an enemy fights, rather than killing them the first chance you get. If you love games with intense combat systems, you'll love Dark Souls.  Another thing this game does great is that it has excelent replayability. There are about ten different character classes that you get to start with. There are also different styles of combat and classes of weapons. You can be a greatsword/shield wielding knight, a dual wielding mercenary, a katana wielding assassin, a sourcerer, a stealth archer, etc. The list goes on and on. On top of that, when you finish a the game, you have the option to start again from the beginning, keeping your levels and equipment, but having an increased difficulty. The only thing I feel is missing from this game is the ability to fight bosses multiple times.  There is also multiplayer, which is very well incorporated into the game. I currently don't have Xbox Live Gold, so I can't talk much about it, but people seem to enjoy it.  The Dark Souls series has a very complex and interesting underlying lore that it leaves you to figure out on your own. You can learn about the lore through item descriptions, talking to NPCs, ect. You can also learn alot about the lore through online resources. There are entire forums dedicated to speculating and discussing the lore. If you don't want to delve into the lore, you don't have to, but it's a great addition to the game if you find it interesting.  Bottom line, this game is amazing. This is one of the few games I can play for hours without realizing it. I highly reccomend it to someone looking for a challenge.",

You start out in these ruin like places and learn the controls, next thing that spotted my eye was the Ashen Estus this is basically an estus for the new(ish) mechanic Focus Points (mana bar) and basically is only prioritized when playing a magic user.  Next thing that caught my attention was Firelink Shrine, this was the old area in the original Dark Souls and it was a pretty great HUB world in both games. You have the firekeeper who you can talk to level up, the blacksmith (ANDRE THE ONE AND ONLY) and he upgrades your weapons or infuses them. The only thing they didn't bring back, was upgrading armor like in the first souls game. I like that idea, it makes armor more unique rather than just something you would wear to look cool while being OP. With using 'estus shards' you can upgrade your estus at Andre; as well as alloting estus, which is a way to divide your estus' up.  You can find various NPC's to add to Firelink Shrine, most of the time they sell some pretty nice goods that will aid you on your quest.  Up next is the Shrine Handmaid, she's your ordinary merchant who sells you goods, but the catch is, you can find ashes and give them to her so she can put new things in her shop. Other than that, kind of a boring merchant.  Let's talk about the 'ember' system, it acts just as the human effigy from Dark Souls 2 and doesn't really have much of a difference, you use it to gain access to summoning phantoms to help you on your journey. It also gives you more health.  Online play is the same as every other souls game, you use a soapstone to be summoned to kill the next boss, and the PVP is probably what really stood out in this game. It's the same as the others but it combines many mechanics and gimics from the previous games that make it really enjoyable.     If you haven't already bought this game, I highly recommend it to people who want to get into this franchise. It's a wonderful experience and will always keep you busy with something      8/10",

Most of those are incredibly minor and don't take much from the game for me.  There's a bunch of armour and weapons and things to do and items to get. most of the things I liked from previous games make a return to some degree (including some throwbacks to Demon's Souls.) Everything feels more cinematic (probably something it's continuing from Bloodborne)   I don't think I've found a boss that was bafflingly cheap like a couple of notables from 1 and 2. Most bosses seem fair and give you time to observe them. There is one enemy that can kill you rather suddenly if you move to close to his body but if you're paying attention you can roll out.  The scenery is beautiful. The boss fights are interesting and varied. The weapon arts add a nice little layer (though I hardly used them) and the lore is intriguing.

Some enemies look like Church Members of the Inquisition. -Did I say the game was extremelly challenging? -Enemy NPC's are more aggressive than in other Souls Games.

There are no fair pvp fights outside of arena battles with players looking for the same thing.  Now to get to why you should buy this game. Its awesome. The combat system is great and while offensive magic needs work currently weapons are fun to use and easy to learn. Your not learning how to master a long string of combos when you use a weapon, you have a basic series of attacks and from there you make your own style of combat. You can use daggers and aim to crit people or you can use a longsword and keep your distance while dealing heavy strikes. Its up to you how you play.  The story requires your attention. Your not given alot of it on a platter so you have to look for it. Read item discriptions and find npcs that arent on the beaten path. There are multiple endings and each one takes effort to achieve. When you accomplish anything it actually feels like you achieved something and didnt just grind enough to hit some threshold. You can complete this game as a lvl 1 character if your feeling optimistic.",

This did not happen. There were a few cheaters here and there, unlimited health mostly. Also the game had a few bugs that i haven't seen lately so that's good (Once summoned, your master moved like you were moving an action figure, and sometimes you couldn't even enter the fog gates ). PVP is the real entertaniment now. With all the new skill sets that most weapons have, people have started experimenting and are now tamed in the art of either hitting you with giant weapons, or killing you with parrying skills. The parrying though, one person can parry you, switch weapons ( a bigger weapon), then riptose you for the kill, that's a long time your just open. Magic is ok, pyromancy in PVE is op, Miracles are still miracles. The game does drop frames at the starting area, but if you move out, you start to not really see that again. IDK why it's only in the starting area, and 1 other area is the peak, but those clouds are beautiful. Great game overall.

I feel like it is probably a little easier than some of them, which is a great way to bring on new players, but it 100% isn't an 'easy' game. There were many areas which had me pulling my hair out (I'm looking at you Poison swamp), but for the most part every aspect of this game is well designed. In fact I liked everything so much I started out as a pure pyro build at the beginning, but then respeced to sorcery, then respeced again to focus on dex....and I really am thinking about instead of doing NG+ to go back and run a miracle focused character. Everything I tried I loved, so picking on one playstyle and sticking with it was tough.   Like most souls games the story isn't laid out for you, but rather makes you want to dig deeper into the text, and research the community online to figure out what is going on which is great. It will be especially confusing if you have not played any other souls games in the series, but you should still get the general idea of it, and may even make you want to go back and play DS 1 and 2.   There are a lot of people worried about bugs and game crashes, but I have a solid gaming PC and never had a single issue, even with everything running on max settings.

            "review_text": "Solid gameplay as per usual. Rolling mechanics and movement are the best they have been in the entire series. Plot is more of the same. Chosen undead, err... unkindled I mean, fire dying pls go link. But you can choose to tell the world to ♥♥♥♥ off in various ways if you please.  PvP as of this writing is in a sad state, entire covenants are reported as broken by many players. Certain weapon classes are very very overpowered and the new quick healing and summon mechanics allow for elongated battles with many gank squads.  Poise, a mainstay of the series has been removed, albeit very haphazardly. There have been findings that by changing the value of a byte in the game's code that it can be turned back on, pointing to the idea that this removal was done hastily and at the last minute. However still, as of a month to the day after release in the West we have not received any real response from the developer as to why it was disabled. What makes this especially puzzling is poise is still included in the game as a value on all armor and boosted specifically by a few rings. This limits the style of gameplay available to melee builds. A tank spec trading hit for hit with enemies is no longer viable, and groups of rats can stunlock even a heavily armored high level player to death in seconds with no recourse. This forces a more Bloodborne-esque style of gameplay which is accented by the ease of dodging and rolling added to this game.  Boss fights are much faster paced than the previous games and if you can get used to the dodging playstyle they can be more visceral and fun. The boss fights feel less like a game of chess and more like a twitch shooter with their added speed.  The level design takes a step up from Dark Souls 2, however it does not reach the elegance obtained by areas such as the Undead Burg, Blighttown, Valley of Drakes connections, or Painted World in Dark Souls 1. It seems to be a mixture of the two. Separated areas split apart in the game world, like DaS 2, however once in those isolated zones the level design takes a nice wrap around approach like DaS 1, with mainstays like opening shortcuts and the reuse of bonfires.  NG+ and ++, which are the two I experienced going for all achievements are a let down compared to previous games. There are no new enemies, boss mechanics, or items outside of +1,2 and 1 +3 rings. The difficulty does not rise accordingly and such can be a slog to get through if you are not the type of person able to play through the same game multiple times in a row, such as myself.  Side quests for NPC's can be very opaque. To the level that I do not expect people to be able to complete them without the use of a guide, which is never acceptable in my opinion. If you are going for 100% completion a guide will be needed and will be best used after your first playthrough so you can have that first blind wondrous playthrough. Do not worry however as everything else can be obtained through the course of NG+ and ++, which you will need to go through anyway in order to get all the endings and rings needed for 100% completion.    Overall a very solid game, and above average when compared to the modern day action RPG. However coming from the A team at FROM (Miyazaki) and the lack of communication on issues such as poise and covenants being obviously broken, stops this from reaching the heights of Dark Souls 1. Let's see what's in store for us from the DLC.",

            "review_text": "I'm honestly not sure what to think about this entry into the Souls series, it does many things right, and many things wrong. However, I've nonetheless had tons of fun with this game, and I'll give it a recommendation. The following are my opinions upon the game, which are purely stemmed from my experiences with it.  OVERVIEW: Dark souls 3 is the third entry into the Dark Souls series, and the fifth entry into the Souls-like style of games From Software has become known for making (excluding SoFS). This time, the world is on the brink of a bitter conclusion, the fire fades, with no Lords of Cinder to rekindle the flame. You, the Unkindled, attempted to link the First Flame in the past, but failed to due so. With the world in dire straights, you are brought back from the dead to find the missing Lords of Cinder, and return them to their thrones. Combat is quick and unforgiving, and you'll find yourself dying many times on your path to success. Like any Souls-like, patience and practice are well-needed to survive the dark. Additionally, Hidetaki Miyazaki was brought back as the director of the game, and it's easy to spot his influence on the game if you've played previous entries in the series. We'll get to this in the next section.  THE GOOD: -Many of the disliked aspects of Dark Souls 2 have been given the boot. Firstly, animations are fare less floaty, and feel crisp and smooth. Level design is far less linear, and packed with various branching pathways and secrets to explore. Second, the dreaded plight of Soul Memory is gone, instead replaced with the favored Soul Level matchmaking system. Weapon upgrade level is included in matching players, meaning equal power levels between combatants or cooperators in multiplayer. Finally, enemies no longer despawn after being killed a few times. -Melee combat is well-paced, and makes for an exhilarating experience. Being rewarded for patient and smart play is one of the most outstanding aspects of the Souls series, and Dark Souls 3 is no exception. Aggressive enemies teach new players to hold back their lust to charge blindly, and even provide a challenge for veterans to the series. Placement of these foes is fair most of the time, and enemies no longer aggro in groups (like in Dark Souls 2). -Bosses are fantastic in Dark Souls 3, with each having two phases to the fight, and beautiful accompanying themes. None of these bosses are re-used, and only two show up later game as enemies.  -Lastly, the lore and references make for a fantastic backstory for the world's path to destruction. Many impressively deep theories have been written upon various boss and NPC relations to and influence upon the world.  THE BAD: -Poise. While I hate to keep beating an already dead topic, poise is a huge issue in this game. The lack of 'classic' poise, or the ability to withstand certain attacks without being stunned, is essential to a faster-paced Souls game. I found myself dying to otherwise avoidable attacks and being constantly stunlocked by other players because of this. While the changes to poise certainly allow interesting combos to be achieved in multiplayer, many weapons are tossed aside in favor of quick, stunlocking weapons. For example, using a rapier or straightsword and spamming attacks for all eternity is extremely viable, and stupidly annoying to counter without being stuck into a stunlock due to a failed parry. -Invasions are horribly imbalanced, with too much being given in favor of the host. Constant phantoms can be summoned with no penalty on the host, leading to nearly endless struggles between an invader and a stream of summons. Invaders receive a health reduction and halved estus, reducing chances of success even further. Even more aggravating is the existence of the Seed of a Tree of Giants, an item that turns enemies upon the invader. This literally forces invaders to rely upon things such as one-shot or high-damage builds to gain a smidgen of a chance at success. I keep to 1v1 duels for my PvP, as do a majority of players nowadays. While invasions can certainly hamper progression, they bring a unique aspect to the franchise. To see them so neglected is a shame. -While map design is spot on, the individual locations are placed in a linear manner, unlike the branching world of Dark Souls. It's not a huge issue, but it's sad to see the linear world design return from Dark Souls 2. -Covenants are disappointing, Watchdogs of Farron and Aldritch Faithful only differ in location, and Blue Sentinels and Blades of the Darkmoon are a joke. It doesn't help that most of these were bugged upon release, and simply did not function until a patch that came nearly a month later. -Hackers are a literal blight upon this game, and are killing the multiplayer. However, it's on the fault of the developers for implementing a useless anti-cheat system. Modifications to one's stats are rarely detected, but modifying a non-hacking player's stats via cheating in multiplayer lead to the innocent player being banned. From Software's has barely done anything to solve this issue, and a vast majority of players have simply quit the game because of this ridiculousness. -That one area with the bajillion jailers in Irithyll Dungeons, please. These are my personal opinions, take care to view them as such  CONCLUSION: As mentioned before, Dark Souls 3 does a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. I jokingly compare this series to the Super Smash Bros franchise as a reference to how the entries feel. Overall, I feel as though Dark Souls 3 attempted to combine aspects from Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, with a mixed bag of results. -Demon's Souls is Super Smash Bros 64. An experiment to test the waters for a new take at an otherwise old concept. Not expected to reach success, the game managed to surprise many with fun-factor. -Dark Souls is Super Smash Bros Melee. The most beloved of the franchise, it brought much attention to the fledgling Souls name. Gameplay was hardcore, but harsh to new players. -Dark Souls 2 is Super Smash Bros Brawl. Still a great game, but lacked the depth and magic the previous entries flaunted. Best played with other people for the refined PvP. (difference here is Brawl's mechanics for battles being so godawful) -Bloodborne is Project M. A new take on a beloved game, but nonetheless different from that it attempts to mimic. Well-received and loved by fans for its interesting style. -Dark Souls 3 is Super Smash Bros for Wii U. Some hate it, but others love it, it's particularly despised by despised by older fans. It's an easy game to get into, catering more towards beginners than franchise veterans.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls 3 is the latest in a venerable series of games, starting with Demon's Souls. Dark Souls has always been about risk versus reward, with challenges balanced around progress, better equipment, and growth as a character and player. Enemy placemnent has always allowed carefully progressing players to know what's coming up ahead and plan, and in theory, even at level 1, a player could overcome these obstacles with judicious planning.   How does Dark Souls 3 stand up to these traditions? Rather well, I'd say! You start out with next to nothing (unless you pick the Deprived class. Then it IS nothing!) and must crawl, scrape, and fight your way past giants, demons, and the legions of mad undead to save a dying world.   Layout in the game is fairly gentle for the first few areas, with either a few aggressive enemies or a clump of passive nonhostile undead. This changes quickly, and you learn cautious use of a bow is a requirement to peel off dangerous foes, and that any group more then two or three is a death sentence, especially early on.   Late game challenge is found not in large mobs or waves of foes, but rather strong, agile enemies that work together. One of the hardest fights is three NPCs who fight together, flanking you, distracting you, and healing while you're dodging their allys' attacks.  Overall, I'm eagerly awaiting the launch of the DLCs, and I recommend this to anyone who wants a good game to try. Just prepare to die at first.",

You can play however you want; bring a friend, play alone, invade and pillage as thou'd please, put limitations on yourself or face everything with the overwhelming power you have more than earned, most likely anyway. Be a melee and get in there, or be a sorcery/miracle/pyromancy user and strategize, or mix it all up to suit your own playstyle.

Pros:  - Beautiful environments - Fast, fluid combat - Easily accessible and good co-op (you can co-op regardless of weapon/level difference) - Excellent PVE - Interesting &amp; memorable bosses - Huge areas (though not interconnected like DS1) - New weapons &amp; weapon skills, never before seen in Dark Souls - Possibly the best PVP combat of any Souls game - Easily the best overall multiplayer of any Souls game  Cons:  - All bosses use the 'half health final form' thing (minor complaint, its just overused) - Covenants really suck compared to previous iterations. - No blue eye orb: ranking Darkmoon can be difficult. - DS2's NG+ system does not return. Health/damage bonuses only. - Invading slightly unfair to invaders (estus/health difference) - PVP build variety is seriously lacking.  * PVP variety:   - Magic straight up blows in PVP. There's no way around it. It's just bad. - Quality builds are unquestionably superior to all other builds. If you're good at PVP you can make pretty much anything that's not magic work, but quality builds are king and everything else is just objectively worse. This hurts variety and can be very boring at times. If you like quality builds however I suppose this will be a good thing. - Element enchants are... not as good as they were in the other Souls games. Lightning enchants, for instance, always lose vs a str/dex enchanted weapon with a lightning buff, even when the weapon has an S or A FTH scaling. They're fine for PVE but for PVP you're just gimping yourself. - Shields are meh. Greatshields are viable but they take considerable stat investment when it's usually better to just roll. Very small shields are excellent for parrying but there are weapons that can do the job just as well (with the bonus of being able to have a fast off-hand weapon.) Medium shields are almost entirely useless in PVP, though excellent for PVE. - Certain spells/buffs/rings/effects are nerfed to the point of ineffectuality in PVP. Since you can get by without them in PVE this makes a good chunk of items/spells effectively useless.  THAT SAID: the PVP is still very, very good. It is amazingly easy to find duels and fight clubs, but I'd be lying if I said there were no problems with it.  Overall I have to say that this game is a worthy final chapter in the Dark Souls trilogy, and that's before the 2 planned DLC have dropped. Ashes of Andariel drops October 25th and I can't wait!",

            "review_text": "I thought a long time about how to rate this game.  'Should i rate it as it's own game or in comparison to it's predecessors?'  I decided to rate it in comparison: It still get's a thumbs up, but it's close not to, it may be a good SoulsBorne game but as a Dark Souls game i feel it is lacking something and has a few things it shouldn't. In my opinion Dark Souls 3 has only a few new things to offer but some of them are either not really original or overshadowed by things from previous games (looking at you armour sets). The weapon arts are a nice addition but are just not useful on some weapons (like on a certain great hammer), the faster combat works well with PvP...  theoretically. The faster fighting gives a great opportunity for interesting and adrenaline-soaking fights but sadly makes a lot of slower weapons unviable.  PvE wise the game is really great, a lot of interesting bosses, weapons and lore. Since (like in every Souls game) any weapon/build can carry you through the game there is a huge diversity between each playthrough if you want to since every fight will always play out differently (except the fact that you either win or die).  I do hope they bring back some of the Dark Souls 2 spells back though.  On my first playthrough the creativity felt a bit forced but after i realized how short this game was i was glad they put so much thought into it, which brings up another point where the game falls short: it's shortness. Dark Souls 3 is by far the shortest of the last 3 SoulsBorne games (never played Demons so i can't compare it to that) and that wouldn't be so bad if the level-design was as complex as in DS1. The enemy design is mostly put together very well except for the fact that some enemys behave as if they were in Bloodborne (fast and almost indodgeable).  All in all it's a solid title with some things they could have done better, it feels more like a well made, fanmade Dark Souls mod for Bloodborne.",

I'm recommending this game, but I hope they fix the framerate issues. This kind of horsepower should dominate 1440p, and run this game maxed at UHD with the exception of AA, at least I would think so.

This game is HARD, I will not mark the game down for that aspect. This is a me problem, not a game issue. I suck at this game terribly. I can barely advance in this game but like I mentioned this is my first foray into Dark Souls and I am just learning this combat system.

It takes what was good from Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne and forms something that is worth to be compared to the original masterpiece. The bosses are epic in design and pose a formidable challange, their patterns are interesting and a lot of them I haven't seen before. Noraml enemies are agressive and can pose a threat well into later parts of the game as well. Unlike previous iterations the game looks stellar. However this comes with a price. A lot of people suffer to run the game on decent hardware, and also crashes and annoying bugs are also haunting systems. I myself however haven't stumbled upon any of these with the game running maxed out at a stable 60fps while streaming.  The only thing that bothered me is the lack of original armour sets but this is a relatively small issue.  TL;dR I highly recommend this game however I think this isn't the game to be introduced to the Souls series, that job still remains with the original Dark Souls.",

Can't attest too much on the PVP side of things as I've been running through the story a few times instead. Very fun to play and addicting. Currently at 68 hours of play and hopefully able to do many more over time.

Everything deserves praise.  But personally I think there are some very blunt downsides.  Firstly, I was greatly disappointed by the amount of re-used content from previous games. Almost half of locations, enemies, weapons, armor and spells was just copied from previous games. With minor barely noticable changes.  Secondly, the game felt like it had little to no difficulty whatsoever in terms of discovery. As if the developers intentionally added methods to make the game all too easy to navigate and cut a lot of corners to reduce both backtracking and freedom of exploration. There's very little challenge in getting around and shortcuts are abundant.  Thirdly, and largely personal preference; The game is simply not hard enough. Online Phantoms make too much of a difference, even ending up solo-ing most bosses whilst the world Host stays in a safe corner and watches. And there are quite a few 'crutch'-concepts, items and methods to exploit the workings of the game. Compared to the other Dark Souls, it does not feel like there is any freedom to strategise, just one way, one path. Though multiple drop-down points and shortcuts are available, they all ultimately lead to the same result.  Barring these three flaws, it is simply one of the greatest games of all time and it should stay that way.",

            "review_text": "Thank you FromSoftware; as a bored adult gamer, you’ve brought the real joys of gaming to me once again.  TL;DR: Been getting bored of games fairly quickly in the last few years and didn’t seem to have much attention span for most. Then bought Dark Souls 3 when it came out as my first ever Souls game in the series, got massively hooked and felt the real joys of gaming again. Bought the other 2 as well as a PS4 so I could play Bloodborne and now I’m a complete addict!  I have been a gamer since I remember, and now in my early 30’s, for the past few years, I found myself getting bored of games very quickly. From AAA’s to indie games I’d mostly end up playing them just so I can beat them and be done with them so I could move on to the next title, like ticking chores off a list, and quite often not even bother finishing the game at all (I’m sorry The Divinity, you were one of the better games I played recently!) I’d known about the Soul games for years, but had been hesitant to even try them for fear of frustration and boredom from their infamous difficult gameplay and the countless deaths phenomena. Until a few months ago I saw an interesting video that delved deep into the Soul games’ sense of exploration, and the rewarding factor of the games - something I truly realised later on when I played the games - so i decided to pick up Dark Souls 3 upon its release a couple of months ago. After countless hours of frustration and deaths (as expected), I realised I must be doing something wrong; I may not be a real hardcore gamer, but surely I can’t be that bad? That’s when I decided to read up on the games mechanics, stats system, guides on how to play as a noob, what starter class to pick, guides on parrying and so on and on and on. So I started a new game, picked up a knight and started to play properly. Never have I ever found myself so immersed in a game in such a long long time. I invested so much time in the game, not only by playing, but also reading up about every bit of the game - something that I’d barely and rarely done with any game before, unless it was a little walkthrough through some section of some game I was stuck at or some such. I studied the maps and made sure I missed not a single item. I read up on all different NPC’s and quest lines to make sure I’d make the most of the play-through, something I realised later wasn’t possible to achieve in just one play-through. So not so shockingly, I started the NG+ once I beat the game so I can achieve 100% achievement completion: an idea that I would’ve laughed off at in any previous games that I’d played. “Who gives a damn about achievements?' Nonetheless, I loved this game so much I bought the kickstarter board game and the other 2 Soul games in the series, which I’m yet to play because I ended up buying a PS4 (that came with Uncharted4) just so I can play Bloodborne. Yes, I’m really that much affected (read: obsessed) by these games. And Bloodborne: what an utterly gorgeous game. It’d probably come as to no surprise at this rate to say that I even ordered the game’s guidebook, to save myself from countless amounts of internet checking (which I still do anyway!). I could write a long post about how amazing this game is but I’ll save that for another time! So thank you again FromSoftware for making some of the most amazing games in all my years of gaming experience, and bringing back the joys of gaming again to this bored-no-more adult gamer. My wallet may hate your guts, but I love you.",

            "review_text": "With nearly 200 hours into the game, I think it's safe to say that I have a general feel on what I think of the game. Since I have 200 hours in, you'd think that I enjoy this installment quite a bit, and I can say that I did, AT FIRST.  This of course changed after completing my first playthrough, roughly 60 hours into the game. The game, unlike pretty much every installment in the franchise, gets stale after the first playthrough -- not only is there a lack of incentive to enter NG+, but the actual new games and onward are very dissapointing, adding nothing but new upgraded rings. It's a far cry from the brilliant new game experience of the second game, which not only added these upgraded rings, but also changed enemy placement and added new enemies in general (making NG+ feel like an actual new game).  This leads to my next point; Dark Souls III takes heavy inspiration from the first game in the franchise (along with Bloodborne, which I have yet to play). With inspiration can come dependence, and thus, fan service aplenty. This fan service was present in pretty much every aspect of the game, including the story, equipment, environments, etc... It almost made me mad in some parts when I saw blatant references and the like when I was playing through, and in hindsight, nearly half of the game was content that had already been used or covered before in past installments (Dark Souls I in particular -- there was nearly no Dark Souls II fanservice or acknowledgement whatsoever).  Now for my major criticism -- weapon variety. At first glance, one might think that there are a great amount of unique weapons in this game, based off of all of the different weapon types and different backgrounds to certain weapons within these categories. Bully for me (and many others as well), when I learned that there were next to no differences between most of these weapons. Each spear was the same, each dagger was the same, each thrusting sword was the same... You get the idea. The only weapons that had unique properties to them were boss weapons, or weapons wielded by NPCs in the game (and most of these weapons weren't even that good, since they can't be infused or buffed, and generally have unsatisfactory AR). They may have had unique movesets, being the only real catch to using these weapons, but it isn't really worth that much, considering the player can just equip a short sword or thrusting sword and easy mode the game (PvP included). There are really only two viable weapon classes in this game, regardless of all the patching that was made to 'nerf' these weapons.  This lack of weapon variety translates into stale PvP, which is what gives these games longevity (at least, in the past). Couple that with a poor matchmaking system, terrible network connectivity, unbalanced rolling, lack of working mechanics (which work as intended, if you know what I mean), and abundance of overpowered mechanics (bleed says hello, and poison says goodbye).  Here are my overall, brief reflections on the game, so you can see how I would rank this game:  PROS:  - Fast-paced combat - Mostly excellent bosses - Beautiful character and environmental art - Slightly primitive but nice graphic fidelity - Really nicely implemented difficulty curve (the best in the franchise) - Nice progression (story and gameplay wise) and pacing - Fashion Souls is as good as ever (although not as great as Dark Souls II's fashion) - Great level design by area in most cases - Very atmospheric and mood-setting - Cool lore (in most cases)  CONS: - Very limited weapon variety (lack of viable weapons) - Abundant fan service - Poor matchmaking and connectivity - Lack of replay value - Unbalanced game mechanics in some cases - Lack of game mechanics in some cases - Linear, boring world design  - Certain useless Weapon Arts  Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who has played any of the past games -- I'm sure that you would still like it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the game, but I do honestly think that it's the worst in the franchise.  6/10.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely brilliant game and a beautiful sendoff to one of my favorite series. Some key missteps aside, Dark Souls III is arguably the pinnacle of the series and builds up on everything FROM Software has learned in the ~5 years since Dark Souls 1 came out (~7 if we include Demon's Souls).  In short for those of you unfamiliar with the series, Dark Souls III is a highly atmospheric action-RPG with a heavy emphasis on weighty melee combat (or flashy spells, if you go that route). While it's set in a fantasy world, the world is decayed and bleak to the point where you wouldn't be mistaken for confusing it for an action-horror title. Like the previous games in the series, Dark Souls III is notorious for being brutal, (but personally, it's not that hard once you come to grips with the mechanics and understand how the game wants you to play).   Dark Souls III, like the previous titles, has extremely little exposition and cutscenes are sparse, so you need to actively read item descriptions and talk to the few NPCs that pop up in your journey (as well as fill in the missing pieces) to get a more complete story. That being said, what lore and dialogue that you find are incredibly intriguing and have led to some really creative fan theories (shout-out to /r/DarkSouls3)  As for the major differences in Dark Souls III compared to the previous games, while there are many tweaks to the core gameplay, it feels right at home, focusing more on refining the formula rather than overhauling it (like in Dark Souls II). Combat in PvE is arguably the best in the series. Each melee weapon now has more depth (since you can now charge heavy melee attacks and perform various weapon arts) and the enemy design in this game is really impressive (while you have your typical 'doods in armor', you also have some really creepy and disgusting looking enemies - very similar in a sense to the monsters in Bloodborne).  The game's also a lot faster paced, since the player's roll got significantly sped up in this game (and has a lot of invulnerability frames, letting you be really aggressive). On the flip side of the coin, enemies are also really aggressive as well, so you can't be reckless.  If you like boss fights, then Dark Souls III delivers in spades. Dark Souls III really focuses on having aggressive boss fights, usually in the form of duels (though there are some extremely large boss fights, though these tend to be gimmicky and not all that enjoyable) and they're an absolute blast. I'd say that there are few bad boss fights in this game, with over half of the bosses in the game are absolutely delightful, with most of the rest being okay, with only about 5 (out of the 19 bosses) that were particularly bad.  As for the bad of the game:  Poise (your resistance to stuns) got messed around with in Dark Souls 3 and it's mostly a worthless stat now since the effectiveness of being stun-immune now heavily depends on which weapon you're using (you're less likely to get stunned using a two-handed Zweihander versus a one-handed Axe). I don't mind hyper-armor (essentially, Poise whenever you attack, during certain parts of your attack animation), but it does make feel Poise feel a bit useless as a result.  The balance isn't great as well. Heavy Armor is essentially useless and the game really pushes you into being a lightly armored warrior with a sword-and-board playstyle (Hell, if you play as the Knight class, you have some of the best equipment in the game off of the bat). Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of viable playstyles (such as the fire-wielding Pyromancers), but they generally require a lot more investment/item-hunting/skill on behalf of the player.  Also, invasions in this game are absolute trash. More often than not, if you're the invader, you'll be summoned into a world with three people waiting to clobber your ♥♥♥. You also have 1/2 the healing/mana recovery charges you normally do (heavily punishing casters) and 30% less health than the host. It's also very hard to punish players since rolling is so incredibly powerful (and this affects duels as well). So sadly, until we get some more patches in, PvP really isn't worth bothering with unless there's a specific covenant item you want to farm or if you like the novelty of it. Thankfully, coop is a lot better, and password matchmaking means that playing with friends is the easiest it's ever been in the series.  Also, new game plus isn't great. I mean, it exists, but considering how Dark Souls 2 offered different enemies spawns, new enemies in existing locations, etc. (as well as the bonfire ascetic mechanic), Dark Souls III really does feel like a step back here.   Overall? Is it worth the purchase? Absolutely. It's deep, engrossing, and offers you a lot of value (first run can easily take a few dozen hours). PVE is definitely worth the price of admission and last you for a very long time if you enjoy experimenting with builds, even if PVP isn't all that great.  TL;DR Fantastic PVE game (best in the series for me), meh PVP game. Definitely worth the asking price.",

If you are familiar with the franchise and you like it, then what the hell are you waiting for? Get this game. Now. If you are somewhat new, also get this game. You can always go back to previous games in the series after you're done with this one. Of course, you might enjoy the lore of the game more if you've played the previous ones, but you are not gonna miss out on anything gameplaywise. In terms of gameplay, this game IS perfect. Combat is smoother than ever, with the addition of Bloodborne's focus on aggressive gameplay, while it still retains the formula of DS1 and 2. There is a decent number of bosses in the game, and very few of them are bad or dissapointing; Dark Souls 3, in my opinion, is the best one in terms of bosses, even found my new favorite boss in this one. Areas are pretty big and have an interesting design. Soundtrack is absolutely amazing, as usual. NPC's are pretty cool, there are couple of pretty interesting ones, while I'm not a big fan of how they did questlines in DS3. There are a ton of weapons and armor in the game, and there are quite a decent amount of unique ones, with cool moveset and weapon arts. Now, where does Dark Souls 3 fall short? Dark Souls 3 lacks innovation. Souls veterans might feel a little fed up with the series when there is nothing really new. Sure, weapon arts is new, and for those who haven't played Demon Souls, like myself, FP (mana) is a complete new stat. It is pretty cool that you can decide if you want to have more estus or ashen flasks in your inventory. Now, I'm not saying its bad that there is nothing innovative, but I can see why people might feel this way. Maybe its for the best that Miyazaki decided to end the series with this game (other than already announced DLCs for DS3. Whether or not its true that this is the true end of the series, we'll see.     For the final verdict, I'm giving this game 9,5/10. If you are a fan of the series, you'll feel like home. If you are new to it, this is where your magical journey begins. This game made me enjoy the series even more, so much that I'm gonna play them all over again. This is the series that I'm never gonna get fed up with.      Pros:   - Return of our lord and saviour Miyazaki - Level design - Amount of content - Fluid combat - Challenging and pretty creative bosses and enemies - Soundtrack    Cons:   - PC port is not so great - Couple of dissapointing bosses - Little bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy mechanics here and there",

Brought a tear to my eye and worthy of a positive I should think.  There are plenty more but these are more or less (Exception of the last one) which I think are Objective good for the game.  Con -No poise (Working as intended? A joke) -Variety in PVP. A serious lack of originality. You'll see mostly Dark Swords, UGS's, Rapier's, and Caestus's. (It's obvious why but truly not a big issue for some. Depending on who you ask magic I.E, Mircale users, Pyromancers and Sorcerers have issues in terms of builds). -Ease of game. Dark Souls is usually known for it's difficult gameplay, I however have found it to be satisfactory but others I hear aren't having the ball breaking experience like the previous games (Especially those Bloodborne DLC fanatics). -Minor bugs still exist and this game had a far cry from a good launch experience. -Once you clear a boss in that area you can't be invaded in it. (Trivial I know but I've been reading reddit forums and friends tell me it's an issue). -Darkmoon Cov, Blue Sent, and Watchdog's apparently have connectivity issues. In these terms I mean they usually don't get summoned in for fights partly because these Covenant's depend on an area to invade or a particular condition for an invasion aswell as the normal invade requirement. (Blue's have to have people in the way of the blue covenant to even be summoned, Watch Dog's have to have people walk around in a area so they can be summoned however this conflicts with the whole 'You killed a boss here? looks like you won't be invaded here ever until you beat the game again and go through this area'.) -Advantages are usually in favor of the Host during invasions. This barring the fact they aren't alone. Things like Giant seeds, Dark Moons, Blue Sentinels, White phantom summons, Yellow phantom summons, and possibly more that I don't even know about or haven't mentioned. Gank squads are the norm now and if you invade you must be prepared to fight more than one person usually. Especially since invasions are primed for multiple people in one game.   Now I know there are plenty more postitives and negatives and I know that I haven't listed a lot of them here, probably because most are people's nitpicks and are mostly subjective in my eyes. Phantom ranges on some weapons, invaders who invade have to walk back to their souls, dried finger adds and extra helpful phantom as well as a chance to be invaded by two phantoms, armor upgrades no longer exist, invaders have estus, blah blah blah. I won't list these and many more for they can be argued both ways. I think the game is more than what I thought I was going to get. I absolutely play this tons and will for the ongoing future assuming the game continues it's course or gets better (Which I hope it does). In short I think this game is a solid Seven. Now before you get angry just hear me out. A five is average, anything below is below what is normally accepted in games. If your a six then you've pretty much flown above most games. While Dark Souls 3 is far from perfect I think it strives pretty damn hard for a high ranking and totally is better than most games out there.   TL:DR - Game's good, beware of issues with game mechanics and PVP could be done better. PVE is good though.",

But Dark Souls 3, much like DS2, don't have it, the focus is clearly to ramp up the dificulty, and 'what the hell?!!' is something that i constantly feel; enemies with atack animations that defy the very mechanics that your character abide, zooming across the screen to unleash 8 hit combos like crazy, no reset; ambush like situations all the time, just to make the game dificult, the 'lore' is just lore, pointless and frustraiting much like all the rest of the game, saddly. And the graphics are a mess, crazy geometry all around that makes the character woble and goble while running, and for what ?;  locations are forgetable at best, pretty generic stuff. In the end i do recomend the game to fans, but not for people that never played any souls games. If you never played any Souls games, start with the first Dark Souls or Demon souls. Veteran players of the series like me will love it, like i do( the multiplayer is great, it just works!! XD), but i had to say how i feel about it.  The game is great as a game, but as a tittle that carry the name Dark Souls, its terrible.",

With the muddling of some good features with some questionable choices, it's hard to say whether or not this sequel is 'better' or 'worse,' but it's most certainly 'more'. To that end, fans of the series or of gloomy, skill-based action games will be getting more of what they love, but this game probably won't make new converts of anyone. (It is a sequel, though, so maybe that's to be expected?)  Personally, I love From Software's Souls series, and though I don't think I'll ever recapture the feeling of playing Dark Souls 1 for the first time, this game gets me close to some of those experiences. I really love the detail work in the art design, and there were multiple moments that gave me the same feelings of wonder and discovery that the best parts of Souls games can bring. There are some baffling game design choices, particularly in the area of covenants and invasions, but these don't affect my primary reasons for playing the game -- there's still plenty to discover and a lot of challenge to overcome.   Much like previous games, I'd recommend going in mostly blind for your first playthrough, with a helpful friend or forum available if you have questions. Dark Souls 3 pretty much nails the sense of discovery and ramping challenge, and it would be a shame to ruin much of that by relying on wikis, if you ask me.  After playing through the game twice, I can't really say that Dark Souls 3 is entirely innovative. There are plenty of interesting ideas and original challenges, but there are also some retreads and plenty of callbacks. There was definitely enough to keep me interested and on my toes, but I'd wished for more creativity after hearing how incredible Bloodborne (by the same company) was.   So, as I said before, Dark Souls 3 is more Dark Souls, with all that comes with it. It can at times be more of the same, but that same was really good to begin with. There are ups, there are downs, there are very pretty graphics. It could have been even better, but even an average Dark Souls game is like an average meal at your favorite restaurant -- still your favorite, though perhaps more familiar than astounding.",

This games really fixes all the problems that palgued the first and that is where i kinda dont like that  For me the souls games where about victory threw adversity and this game falls flat. I hate this phrase but i cant descibe it any other way but it feels focus tested. The way the game flows and presents it self feels less like you are on a journay but are playing a Arpg the fighting is now a majorty dodge rolling around mostly because poise isnt worth anything. I really think the lack of polish fo the first game really what made me loved it. It felt as thoght the game was crafted with a vision and a set goal but not as something to make millions and millions of dollars.   Pros: Graphics are breathtaking vaired landscape and enviorments Weapon types Enime variety Cons: broken auto-convents(as of writing Weapon balance(as of writing) Forgetable bosses Magic nurffed to oblvion Poise working as intended  7/10 i think im just being a bit hard on this but i guess i just didnt enjoy it as much as i though and expextaions where to high hope you enjoy it though",

            "review_text": "It's a great game on its own, but it went backwards from DSII in a lot of ways, which is extremely disappointing.  1. It has no poise, even on the heaviest armor. The slightest tap by a rusty dagger stuns you like you got hit by an UGS, which makes the most dangerous fight in the game be against three rats or dogs running into you, not an actual boss fight.  2. No powerstancing. Left hand is useless for anything except magic and shields. Left handed weapons are only usable for their weapon arts and to block with, which you would get a better effect from just two-handing it. The exceptions are a couple of paired weapons, caestus, and the parry dagger.  3. Magic requires a massive investment, far more than melee. It has multiple items that are required to be competetive because of their massive damage buffs, and it kills diversity and style.  4. Fashion stat. With poise on armor being deactivated and defense being negligible, +equip load is basically just a stat to use prettier armor while causing you to miss out on upgrading actually useful stats.  5. Everything ♥♥♥♥ing clips through the walls. All of Archdragon Peak. Snakemen throwing axes at you from the other side of the zone and taking half your hp.  6. And, worst of all, the endless amount of multiplayer issues. Some accounts barely have working summon signs at all, and a lot can't use 4/8 of the multiplayer covenants. Then they broke save transferring and the only fix for this with it.  Still, there's lots of good things about the game, like no soul memory. Highly recommend it if you enjoyed DS1 and DS2. Just hope you win the multiplayer connectivity lottery, or you might get lonely.",

Everything I hated about Dark Souls 2 has been removed (max health decreasing when you die, boring boss fights, a world that seemed patched together at the last minute, only one ending). The addition of the focus bar is awesome and makes both melee have more options and makes magic more appealing. At the time of this writing, I have 25 hours of game play and while that might not seem like a lot for 'beating' the game, I have much more to do. I missed most of the NPC side quests, I know of at least one area I missed entirely, from what I understand NG+ contains new items and enemies that NG doesn't, and I want to try a bunch of different builds. Also I have played DS1, DS2, and Bloodborne so while I might not be the best souls player, I know what I'm doing. Someone who's never played a souls game will take much longer to complete this.  Now while I wholeheartedly recommend this game, there are still some cons as there are in any game. Some of the boss fights aren't as good as they could be. I don't want to give any specifics so as not to spoil anything, but there's at least one boss that relies on a gimmick to beat and once you know that, it's no longer interesting. The frame rate dips even on my GTX 980 TI and while it was never during anything important, it's still noticeable. It really only happens when I'm picking up items which is odd. The bonfire placement in this game is really off in my opinion. There have been multiple times when I would find a bonfire and then find another one less than 30 seconds later. I think this could have been remedied by not having every boss leave a bonfire when they've been beaten. Some of them make sense, but others are poorly placed. Finally, the PVP. The PVP itself isn't bad. It's pretty much the same as it always was in the souls games. What's bad is when you have a bad connection to the other player, you have no real idea what's going on. One minute you're trying to bait the guy to attack you, then all of a sudden you're being backstabbed. When the connection is good, PVP is a blast.  Back to the good stuff. Boss souls are much more useful now. Each soul makes two items and they're not limited to weapons but also shields and rings. Covenants now only require you to find them and you'll get an item you can swap out to be part of a different covenant. Fast travel is back and behaves the same as it did in DS2. All of the NPC's are interesting and some make a return from previous games. Each area is breathtaking and an absolute joy to explore. One area in particular, which again I won't spoil, made my jaw drop when I saw it. There's an overwhelming amount of weapons and armor to get in this game which is going to lead to really awesome builds. Finally, the lore of this game is amazing. I wanna give a shout out to VaatiVidya on YouTube. His lore videos on the first two Dark Souls as well as Bloodborne are amazing and I can't wait to see what he makes for this game.   If you're on the fence about buying this game, don't let the infamous Dark Souls difficulty dissuade you. Yes the game is hard but that's not why most people love these games. It's because of the amazing world that lets you play how you want, the very deep lore that links both previous games to this one, and the fact that is doesn't hold your hand, but lets you figure things out for yourself. I can't wait to spend many more hours with this game and I can't wait to see what the expansions have in store.",

The armor that can't be reinforced, which is same like Bloodborne is between for me.

            "review_text": "Not souls 1 but not souls 2 either, The first thing i'll say is its good, but the dodge roll is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Not the roll animation itself, but the timing. There is something like .4 of a second delay between the press and the roll playing out which is not going to fly for most enemies i.e i end up getting ♥♥♥♥ed up. I did come up with a solution and that is to push it down before you want to roll and then let go when the attack comes, but if your timing is wrong you won't roll, you will just stand there, like a massive ♥♥♥♥ and get steamrolled. The game itself is very linnear which i feel really detracts from the sense of confusion/dread you feel from being posed so many options which I think is important, even though it made me give up on the 1st game when i first picked it up. It is not much of world it just kinda like a bunch of stages and thus happening upon npcs in the world is less meaningful as there is only one way to go and it doesn't feel like a chance encounter. I would reccomend the game however because if you haven't played souls 1 I doubt anything I said will be really a problem for you. I am running the game on a WINDOWS 10, gtx970, i5 3570k on Max it runs fine ",

            "review_text": "I've finished the game a few days ago, so it's time to attempt a review! No spoilers ahead.  Overall, I've grown to really like Dark Souls 3! In my book Dark Souls 1 is one of the greatest games ever made. If I had to I would rate it a 98 with only minor polish complains if any. For Dark Souls 3 then in comparison I would give something like 90. It lives up to the name and in many ways it improves upon the original game.  + The visuals are stunning. It's not so much that every texture is 4k+ or that the technology is 'next gen'. It's the big picture that really wins this argument. The environments and graphics are cleverly made so it's both performance efficient and amazing at the same time.  + The combat is butter smooth and the animations are fluid. It's very similar to Dark Souls 1 but it's faster and there is more of everything. + The enemies you fight are varied, deadly and offer a satiating challenge (during solo play). There is a little bit of recycling here and there, but not much. + The zones are massive, interesting, hold plenty of secrets, tell stories, and feel unique. One of the strongest points of the game. + You have extreme freedom in your character build. With the 70% equipment weight limit for most builds, and the infusion system (weapon modifications) you can really make countless variations. In the past there were only a few weapons that could scale from Intelligence or Faith. Now you can just infuse almost any weapon and modify it to do so. + Character creation can finally result in good looking characters! I don't think previous Dark Souls games were terrible, but this is just better. + Quite a few nods and winks for fans of the series. Returning characters, references, secrets. + Great music score.  - The greatest weakness is the cooperative PvE experience. Summoning phantoms is somehow too powerful. I've thought about this long and hard, and I believe that it comes down to the AI of your PvE opponents. They react way too slowly, predictably and frankly... poorly to being attacked by multiple opponents. There is some sort of 'aggro' system and it's hard to describe it, but just accept when I say that killing bosses with a phantom is incredibly easy. They need to tweak the AI to present faster responses and a more aggressive and intelligent combat style. Imagine if bosses could immediately turn and tactically place area attacks to hit both opponents. It's certainly possible, yet they never do it. - Online play and PvP latency can vary greatly. Sometimes it works fine, but it can absolutely break down at a moment notice. - I personally did not like the hub design of Firelink Shrine. I would have preferred a more interconnected world, but I've got to admit that this system also worked rather well. - Covenants do not play as important role as before. You are able to switch covenant on the fly, and their effects / rewards are less interesting.",

            "review_text": "===NOTE===   RECOMMENDED WITH A CAVEAT. The current stability of the game prevents enjoyable online co op/PvP for many players including myself. The core game is great, but if you intend to purchase be aware the netcode, as of this writing, is unstable and causes floating bosses, lag, and disconnects. This can be remedied by simply playing offline or not summoning. It detracts only from the multiplayer portion and not from the core game itself. I strongly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a well handled dungeon crawl. ===  Looking at Dark Souls III as someone who mildly poked around in Demon's Souls, rang both bells in Dark Souls then got bored, and made it about halfway through Dark Souls II before finding the rather bland level design about as interesting as the story presentation from the first game I went into Dark Souls III more interested than ever. I can't explain it.  I initially was not a Dark Souls fan. As the idea of dying then running back through respawned monsters and regressing when I inevitably die again didn't sound (and in practice wasn't) appealing. I ended up enjoying the first installment immensly as a viewer more than a player. Watching story analysis videos and reading about stuff other players had dug up interested me so much more than beating my undead head against a wall for 50 hours.  Then Dark Souls III came out. With not much else to play I decided to give DSIII a shot. The improvement of core mechanical player inputs is what allowed me to enjoy Dark Souls III as a newcomer. The refinements that Bloodborne made, Dark Souls II's improvement on the basic combat functions helped; this gameplay just 'feels good'. Which is an ambiguous and seemingly unfair way of describing why this game is so good; especially for someone in my previous shoes. The easiest way to understand what I am saying is control refinement. The core gameplay controls tighter, it makes more mechanical sense, and feels less like my backstab missed because I wasn't standing at the correct single digit degree. Enemies still have insane tracking when it comes to sweeping attacks but with the added mobility your character is given from the outset (rolling consumes less overall stamina) it is compensated for. Allowing for more confident rolling through attacks once the timing is nailed down.  Story is still delivered through item descriptions and vague creepy laughing NPCs that the player discovers by accident. This is a love it or hate it kind of thing. If you prefer story to be read out in cutscenes and presented directly this is not a story for you. If you prefer to discover items in the dark corners of the world that shed shafts of light on obscure references to things that end up being related but only after you find a different item in a different corner of a different area that will make you go 'ah ha!' then this is the story style for you.  If you don't like stories in game and just like killing stuff, then it is very much a game style for you. As the story can simply be glossed over and avoided entirely.  As noted at the heading, multiplayer in its current state is a mixed bag. When it works it's great fun. The key phrase is 'when it works'. I'll start with the issues that cause frustration. The idea in Dark Souls multiplayer is interesting. Players can either help or hinder another by being summoned to co-op or by invading and killing the host. In practice this player driven interactive mechanic is what makes Dark Souls so stressful (and fun). Being invaded is one of those 'uh oh' moments that seemingly always time out to happen when you have few estus and are far enough away from a bonfire that its just enough of a risk to run into your invader; frantically looking for a summon sign for some help.   I love this style of player interaction, it gives hosts that feeling of suspense when 'Embered' which is the state of being human from the previous games with a health increase. Summoning a stranger for help against another player is great fun as the invader tries to ruin your day.  The issue is network stability. When playing on a less than optimal connection, for instance a 1Mbs speed (which is my current speed that allows for 350 Kb/s downloads, its not a great connection but still stable enough for online gaming reasonably well.) the netcode for whatever reason is unable to compensate for slower connection speeds. Players slide around the map with no visible animations, summoned co op partners get stuck behind the boss fog wall, and entire bosses will slide around the boss room not executing any animations for the co op friend allowing for cheesing of entire boss fights. This isn't accounting for random service disconnects with the game servers.  Now the good thing is this can all be avoided by simply playing offline OR by not bothering to summon to avoid the boss cheese. However the invaders are subjected to this problem as well. By no means is this a blanket issue, but it is also far more common for players with less than optimal internet speeds, so be aware of that.  If you are a new player who is interested in the series but put off by the previous 'PREPARE TO DIE' or 'GIT GUD' don't worry. Dark Souls III is in my opinion both the most difficult of souls games but also the most accessable. The initial boss will very quickly teach you how to play the game properly. Go in with the midset of 'I am going to get my ♥♥♥ kicked, oh well lets do this.' and you will have the time of your gaming life.  Praise the sun! \\[T]/",

You could use the red eye orb to invade almost instantly, or wait up to a couple hours to auto-invade with the coventant in the same area. Also, the Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blade coventants are the same covenant, only difference is the Darkmoon Blade is slightly darker blue and has a rivalry with the Aldrich Faithful covenant. That being said, it is currently really hard to get summoned as either of them, and therefore very time consumptious to rank up, unless you farm the enemies that rarely drop the covenant item. The problems with the covenants would not be so annoying, if it were not for the multiple rings and spells that the covenants reward, and are therefore required for 4 achievements(All Pyromancies, All Miracles, All Sorceries, All Rings).",

Literally every 10 or 20 seconds (sometimes more frequent than that), my framerate drops into the low single digits for nearly 3 seconds. When entering a new area, the game freezes for up to half a minute. No amount of suggested fixes has solves this and I can only wait for this to be fixed in a patch.  At this point, I regret spending a full 60$ for a game with a widely reported bug like this that is yet to be fixed. But again, if it is fixed it's definitely worth a full 60$ price tag especially if you enjoyed DS1 or you feel nostalgia towards the challenging games of the 90's and 00's. Great level design, art design, awesome OST, but most of all the mechanics and controls are very well done. movement is fluid and responsive, weapons have an appropiately hefty feel to them when you strike and the enemy designs are diverse (mechanically and visually) and interesting as well as the environments thanks to the above average (for this genre) graphics/engine. Really in my opinion the game is really well polished in general with lots of incentive to explore and see the world design and there's overall a huge sense of scope when looking out over the various vistas that come up time to time.  I recommend it highly, but only if an when the stuttering is fixed.",

I'm pretty sure that's what happened to me because since day one I have not been able to connect to the servers. Overall the gameplay was fast paced, but felt lacking of something. And I finally figured it out; the level design. Do not get me wrong, the graphics and textures were beautiful, but it felt almost as linear as Dark Souls 2. Still I find myself going back to the first Dark Souls because of the level design. Another problem I found with the game was that I felt like it had almost no replayability. I beat the first in the series 15+ times and I still love it. Dark Souls 3 didn't feel like it brought anything new to the table. All of my friends and I agree that it has so many reused animations from the other souls games, just with different texures and player models. The 3rd Souls game felt like Demon Souls, DS2, and Bloodborne mixed into one game. Although still using alot of the same animations as in the first Dark Souls. Overall, I was dissapointed in the game, because like I previously mentioned, it felt repeated. As if I've already done all of these tasks I was trying to accomplish. Nothing really felt new except for only a couple areas in the game. And as I've mentioned before, it is almost completely linear with almost no reason to back-track due to the fact that you started with the teleport ability that was used in DS2. All in all, the gameplay was exciting and fastpaced, but it was hard to keep myself motivated to finish it. Remeber when you got your first souls game and finally killed that one boss after dying countless times and felt that amazing rush of euphoria afterwords? Well, I didn't feel that at all with this one. R.I.P my hopes and dreams.",

There is only one place where fps drop to about 55 - I wouldn't really consider that a problem.  Putting the problems aside - The story, MUSIC (just wow), graphics (while not revolutionary, definitely decent), and most important of all - incredibly smooth, rewarding gameplay.

And of couse the graphical improvements. Cons:  1. One thing I likeed in DS1 but lackin in DS3 is the secrets of the world and interactions with NPC. I am not saying DS3 not having them but in a somehow different way, I still believe DS1 is better in this design.  2. Why replace humanity with ember(Maybe I missed the storyline?).  3. The biggest problem I have with DS2 and DS3 are that I do not really see a BIG engough improvement from DS1. Yes, there are improvments but not big enough to make me feel the thrill I first played DS1. However I think its quite understandable, if you take a comparision between Fallout3 and Fallout4,8 years between these two games, but you still cant find the big improvment.  Overall, the quality of the game is definely worth the price. Recommend for both DS fans and new comers to this franchise.",

A lot of games from big names tend to run into the problem of 'more is better' without regarding correct pacing, atmosphere (oh man, the atmosphere of the souls games), or how you want your players to react to situations. I don't think any other game puts you into situations that feel so damn liberating to succeed in. I used to play a lot of FPS games a while back with massive, spiralling set pieces and difficult (sometimes needlessly) gameplay that just stopped being rewarding because of how pointless it felt, Dark Souls has the frustration but the payoff is totally worth it.

No time for all of that nonsense. I dreamt of sandbox RPG's when i was a kid, playing games on my C64, then Amiga. I always thought i could discover some new path or something in every game, until i was older and understood how it all works. While sandbox games of today look like they are so big and open, there is no magic and imagination is stunted with it's precreated world. A sandbox game has to be perfect to the point of an almost perfect simulation of life and it's impossible. Anyway, DS3 has nothing to do with sandbox, or RPG's for that matter. It's a super-satisfying dungeaon crawler/arcade/fight simulator with great combat and gameplay mechanics and a subtle story that leaves most to the imagination. No saves whenever you want, no reload of autosaves, no going back on choices you have made throughout the game, so you better take care in what you do. They nailed that part better than 'real' RPG's that claim how much your choices influence the outcome. Trust me, in this game, you will care about your every move. Another thing they nailed better than most 'RPG's' is the continuity of the world. As you plough along, you will feel the world as one, coherent whole. What i am trying to say is that DS beats today's RPG's, even while not trying to be one. It beats today's shooters with the level of challenge it gives you and the sense of accomplishment when you manage to move on after getting stuck and dying countless tmes. No annoying difficulty slider you can tweak in mid-game, that so many games of today suffer from and no difficulty choice at all for that matter. It beats all because it has a target you have to reach and doesn't distract you with uninportant fillers on your way to that target. Speaking from the point of view of mine from my love of RPG's, again, not because the game is Role Playing, mostly because of the dark fantasy setting - If you want to wander around some 'amazing' sanbox world, talking to mentally challenged NPC's, have encounters that you can always beat by exploiting some terrain feature, or glitch that will mess with your enemy's AI mind and call that an RPG, this is not for you. Until those games have proper AI, they have nothing to offer, no matter how far you push the difficulty slider. If you want an extremely satisfying gaming experience, in a smaller world that looks and feels great to traverse, with no silly distractions and micromanagement, with revolutionary gameplay when it comes to continuity, choices and (no)saves - try it. All 3 parts are excellent, get DS1 Prepare to Die first as to me that was the best in the series in terms of content.",

I soak in the atmosphere, my heart races in combat, I feel the grim oppression and experience the hardships as my character does. Just the other day I began playing this game a 3:30pm and next thing I knew it was 8:00, I played for four and a half hours without realizing it. Keep in mind this is my fourth playthrough of the game as well, the fact that it remains that entrancing to me really says something. Dark Souls III feels like a greatest hits compilation of all of From Software’s previous endeavors, from Demon Souls to Bloodborne. It takes little in the way of risks but I’m surprisingly okay with that. Partially because the core gameplay works so well and the lore remains engrossing but also because this is supposed to be the farewell to the trilogy. Though the derivative nature of this game means that it inevitably suffers from diminishing returns. Some of the luster has certainly worn off after so many similar experiences but it still remains an outstanding game. The fact that the Dark Souls remains pleasurable after numerous iterations is truly a testament to how solid the concept and execution of these games have been from their origins. I could talk all day about why this franchise is great and discuss the subtle nuances of all of its aspects but brevity offers a stronger message in this case: Dark Souls III ranks among my favorite games and the proverbial franchise is my favorite of all time.",

Let me quickly introduce you to what this game actually is:  A 'Souls' game (DemonSouls;DarkSouls;Bloodborne) is a unique type of action RPG which focuses a whole lot on gameplay and good mechanics. It is more or less a linear experience with a level design that connects levels together in some sort of 'inter-conected' world (very clever indeed). It has a very dark artistic theme, a lot of death and eerie stuff, complete with an amazing orchestral/epic soundtrack (with lots of cool vocals) and great sound design. 'Souls' games are thus caracterized by their visual and sonorous beauty, compelling gameplay and mechanics and intelligent level-design overall.   I'm here to tell you if Dark Souls 3 achieves what it's predecessors did.  Dark Souls 3 feels new and refreshing compared to the other souls games, it has effectively mixed multiple elements from the older games to create this feeling :  - Spells now use 'Mana' ; You can exchange Boss Souls for gear and weapons or spells (Demon's Souls) - Faster gameplay (Bloodborne) - Good old Dark Souls   The result should be nothing short of amazing right? Well it is poorly executed in some areas:  - Spells and Miracles are bad in PvP. Most of them use up too much of your Ashen Estus Flasks and deal poor damage, not to mention those that do deal damage are impossible to land a hit with. In most cases you will run out of flasks before your ennemy dies (especially if he has some means to heal himself).  Even in PvE i haven't found spells that perticularly interested me or were that fun to use... ( i still used a mage and miracle user once or twice for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles though. )  (of course you can use Wrath of the Gods, possibly a Crystal/Simple Estoc or some lightning based builds... but that's about it) - The Poise system is non existant in this iteration of the game, or at least doesn't work the way it used to. Equipping armour doesn't seem to make you less vulnerable to hit-stun weapons such as the Estoc. You can get stun-locked easily if you aren't carefull. I find this change to be odd, but it didn't really affect me since i prefer using Hyper-Armor to tank through ennemy hits (a few frames in your attack animation with large weapons in wich you can't be hit-stunned). Otherwise dodging or outranging your opponents still work well. I still have to say that i feel the commitment to attack animations isn't as punishing as in say Dark Souls 2 since you recover really fast and can immediately turn your character around in the next attack effectively making you impossible to backstab (exept in extreme circumstances ). - Boss Souls weapons are fun to use in PvE, so fun to use in fact that i started neglecting all other weapons. Crafting my own weapons and upgrading them with my ores was most of the time worse than my newest boss weapon. Especially enchantments like Blessed which are completely useless. I even used Boss weapons in PvP ,DragonSlayer's Swordspear and Two Princes' Greatsword being my favourites.  - Some Bosses are uninspired or just a bit too easy for my taste. Some of the Lords of Cinder are surprisingly bad. Some bosses such as Lothric, Soul of Cinder, or Nameless King are weirdly some of the best bosses in the series IMO. It is very inconsistent to say the least.   Despite it's flaws Dark Souls 3 remains one of the best RPG released in 2016. It is beautiful and has awsome and epic boss battles. It's ending boss is incredible and worthy of an end game boss (Soul of Cinder who represents all player fighting styles mixed together which makes for a thrilling boss fight), a real challenge with epic music and multiple forms increasing in difficulty as it tries to stop you from achieving your goal. Despite the lack of real story, it still has the interesting characters who speak with a weird accent and the bits and pieces of information that you can link together and imagine what you want for a story.   Dark Souls 3 won't hold you hand and will let you play the game the way you want to, feel free to disregard my opion on PvP combat and create your own meta if you wish, there are tons of possibilities. After all Dark souls is known for having a lot of potential for trolling and other fun stuff because of it's sheer amount of customization.   All I can say is ... I want more . 8/10   ",

The boss and enemies just have a larger health pool and hit harder. The ashes of ariandel is also feel short (finished in 2,5 hours).  9/10 from me.

After 250 hours in game I can say I've done the playthrough about 8 or 9 times, with about 5 characters and most of those done with NG+. I have tried to play every solid build and experiment with others, and for that reason I have NEVER been bored on a new playthrough, even now. Strength and faith, quality, Intellect and Faith, the list goes on for build combinations but they're all fun and viable. I am JUST now at the point where I usually pwn my invaders and the Arena is great as well, I usually win about 70% and get rekt the rest of the time.   Pros: -Beautiful game, truly. I love the gothic scenery and its done so well.  -Great combat -Replayability is incredibly high  -Boss battles are epic, beautiful, challenging...there really is nothing like it that I've found so far and I play a lot of different stuff. -The storyline or lack-there-of is incredible. By the time you play through 2 or 3 times you will really begin to put together some connections. I enjoy its openess    Cons: -Minor Frame drops in huge areas but really only in Lothric Castle. -Only one controller broken and that was from flicking the stick too hard trying to dodge a Boss haha -Prepare to Die  I really think this is my favorite game, in probably 10 years. I was bad, I got gud, now I'm gonna get better.   10/10, truly. There is nothing else like it.",

While it is true the game is more linear than the previous titles, I consider it far more consistent in the quality of the areas. And while the areas don't interconnect to eachother in any way similar to the first game, they interconnect upon themselves far more elegantly. The weapon arts system adds a welcome layer of depth to the already engrossing combat, making it possible to pull of some fancy manoeuvre with each encounter.  A strong and final entry to a series I am deeply in love with.",

In fact, it's basically an adoring hug to the fans who've stuck with the series longest - references, boss fights entirely, items and areas , almost all of them hark back to either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls 1.  The initial connection issues and moderate crashing are now fixed and the only thing that seems not to work are the 2 of the summon covenants. After so many months, I doubt it will ever *be* fixed, but the base game in itself is absolutely worth your time and money as it runs fine, offers a great challenge and that special, sadistic satisfaction nothing but a Souls game really can.",

Best boss fights of the series so far imo final boss and the pontiff are my personal favorites. Though i found the bosses challenging I found the areas to get to them much easier. This was really saddening for me sense the dangerous exploration was my favorite part of these games for me. The combat feels fantastic and the areas artistic design particulary in the late game is just fantastic. The game actually has the best difficulty curve in the series as a whole always getting much challenging and the areas becoming more epic. Despite this I rarly died. I feel this is because the faster dodge is almost OP particulary since you dont get horded as much like in previous games. I feel they tried to compensate for this by making enemys hit harder and more agressive attack patterns, but its really easy to avoid being hit all together. Multiplayer is the best yet imo and lots of people are playing right now balance issues aside. Never crashed and played this on a pc below min specs at 60 so I will say the performance is good is it actually works for you.   The DLC is probably not wirth full price  In summary another great addition to the series just wish its exploration parts were a bit harder.",

            "review_text": "Dark Souls 3 is, by game standards, an excellent game. However, by the standards of the Soulsborne series, it falls a bit short. One of the largest issues (in both PvE and PVP) is that the amount of stamina consumed per roll is insanely small, thus allowing for spamming and removes the need to carefully time rolls in order to dodge attacks. In addition, Estus healing is much faster and powerful than the other games, making mistakes less punishing. I've seen many others complain about how the PVP system is cracked due to hosts having a significant advantage over invaders, but honestly, it's not that bad. Sure, the invader has less Estus and less health, and the host has a variety of ways to kill the invader (turning the mobs against the invader or summoning multiple phantoms), but invading was MEANT to put you at a disadvantage. In fact, in the first Dark Souls game, invaders COULD NOT HEAL during invasions. And it isn't all that often that you'll meet someone with multiple phantoms or a Seed of the Giant used; most people enjoy a good fight and will avoid scummy tactics.  Furthermore, the soundtracks and ambient noises for this game is absolutely stellar, making boss fights and even just traversing through an area feel tense, mystical, foreboding. The game is beautiful in both sound, and visuals, though. Each place is well designed, with little details etched everywhere.  All in all, the game is a masterpiece and I would 100% recommend it.  Don't give up, skeleton !",

But seriously at the start it's very daunting, and you really want someone who has played it before and knows what they're doing there with you for your first session or at least be communicating with them. Once you get over the initial learning cliff it's a lot of slow learning and mastery, it's very difficult at times and you'll get frustrated with yourself, but at some point it just clicks! And from there on you just get what makes it tick and you begin to notice and absorb and become complete enveloped in the world.  Dark Souls 3 is the epitome of From's recent games. It elegantly blends the facets which made its predecessors great to culminate in this magnificent work of art. Plus it has the greatest boss I have ever had the honour of fighting. 5/5",

            "review_text": "With nearly 300 hours sunk into playing this game and learning it in and out I'm confident I can recommend it and say it's a must buy.   First of all the thing keeping a lot of people away from the souls series is intimidation. While the gameplay is different and challenging I would not let this keep you from giving it a try. The game is entirely fair but does require skill to succeed but in turn it rewards you heavily.  To summarize dark souls 3 I would say that it is a challenging game set in a mysterious medievil universe filled with monsters, magic, epic characters, and amazing levels. Combat requires quick thinking and learning from your mistakes. You can block, roll, dodge, attack, counterattack with the many different weapons available in the game. You can pick different classes at the beginning but you can also level any stat so as the game goes on you can turn your character into anything. Mixing and matching weapons, spells, shield, and even items for your character adds an insane amount of replayability especially due to the multiplayer. The game is like a mix of zelda, metroid, elder scrolls etc. The level design feels like one long journey and is the best and most masterfully crafted of any game. Shorcuts are cleverly placed into the world and make the game feel even more connected, and some of the scenery is downright breath taking (in a destroyed and medievil looking way). This is a game that never holds your hand, and explains the story and mechanics through the gameplay itself.  PVP works by in game items that allow you to team up and join other people's world via a white stone (white phantom). Or choose to face the odds and invade another person's world with a red stone (red phantom). This is all done in the hosts campaign and enemies will still very much attack you. This makes for some insanely chaotic and fun battles seeing as how red phantoms can turn on team mates as well. While this opens up the possibility of being double or even triple teamed it's still fun and you can turn the odds in your favor with the right amount of skill.  This is a must buy. If you are hesitant don't wait. Get some hours in before the last dlc rolls out and experience this series. Learn about it and become addicted like I and many other fans have.",

Those who are looking at reviews of all 3 games, my recommendation is to get 1 and 3 and skip 2. Anyways on with the review. The level design and story pacing is good. The lore is connected to the 1st game so if you have played it and enjoyed learning the lore, a lot of the knowledge crosses over and makes 3 even more enjoyable from a lore standpoint. Each fight was designed well except for a couple but that didnt take away from the overall game. (no more body flinging ragdoll, i really miss that) combat is spot on like always, though PvP could use some changes because of the way connection to hosts/servers work. A highly recommended game for those who are avid soul game players and those who like a challange just like the other soul games. And also recommended to those looking to get into the souls series though i would suggest starting out on the 1st game if you care about lore.",

As always, the lore must be sought out by the player and less dedicated players will not necessarily get the full plot (as tenuous as DS plots are).  Plus, that final boss theme! Long-time fans will recognize it.  So, arise from the grave, take up a weapon or spell, join a convenant, and link the First Fire (or let it die)!",
