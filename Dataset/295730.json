            "review_text": "Well this one sure came out of left field. My owning this game is the result of just another 'vote=key', and prior to getting the email announcing its release and my free copy, I had completely forgotten about it. Thank goodness I took the time to install and sample its gameplay, because this is one greenlight title that is very much worthy of actually being on Steam.  Sweezy Gunner is a bullet hell shooter, but unlike your typical shmup, this game lacks any sort of automatic scrolling screen or rage inducing bullet patterns with extremely specific safe zones. Rather, it's a free roaming top-down adventure, full of collectible abilities and purchasable upgrades.   As you move through the varying zones, enemies become tougher, and where you might once have only contended with a slow moving, delayed single-shot spewing hellspawn, new areas introduce enemies more than willing to litter the screen with little red doom pellets. Luckily, as the enemies grow in strength, ferocity, and number, so too do you earn the upgrades necessary to contend with them. The majority are simple; speed, strength, bullet velocity are the most common, along with basic health and defense upgrades. But the greatest benefit to your arsenal comes from dropped weapon types from the enemies you annihilate, like bullets that swirl around you as you move, rapid and wide shot, explosive shot, etc. Once you learn to juggle avoiding bullets and weaving your way in and out to nab pickups, the screen can quickly become an indiscernible mess of marbles of all colors wizzing across the screen in a rainbow of death and chaos. But don't worry, the price of death is a mere reset back to the beginning of whatever area you're in and a small loss of earned funds.  The game is broken up into two main parts, the first being the overworld, where you will spend at least half of your time getting from point A to point B. The overworld contains several themes, depending on your location, as well as varying types and difficulties of enemies. The second major part are the dungeons: contained levels with their own specific themes, often with the express goal of finding an exit and reaching a new part of the overworld. I won't spoil the steps you'll have to take to escape these dungeons, but i will recommend that you take the opportunity to use healing machines whenever you find one.  The many upgrades you can buy come in several forms. You can purchase them from the shops that pop up, both in the overworld and the dungeons, but these will only increase as you collect special coins that unlock more upgrades as you progress. The other sort of upgrade comes from special cards dropped by enemies, requiring you to kill a certain number of them before being able to buy the upgrade the card holds. Lastly, there are special secret cards that can only be found by exploring every inch of the map, and while these can be devilishly difficult to find, the benefits speak for themselves.  In the end, Sweezy Gunner was an excellent surprise, its only real limits are likely caused by the program used to create it. Even if you're not a fan of typical bullet hell games and their no holds barred difficulty, I would recommend you give this one a shot; you will undoubtedly enjoy your time with it, and the difficulty is right on the money with a casual, albeit frenetic experience that anyone can enjoy.",

            "review_text": "Greetings,  now what have we got here? A really little pearl in the big sea of Indie Games.  Sweezy Gunner, i tell you, that was love at first sight.  Beeing an old school gamer of the era of C64 and the awesome Amiga 500, i have seen many, maaaany games. I remember it was an rainy monday, having holiday for a week, i was looking in the List of Mondays Sales of the week. Looking and looking i saw that file. Cheesy Gunner. Okay i was sleepy, so ... sorry for reading wrong. Yes, that name reminds me of the old era and i had a look at it. Believe me, it WAS love at first sight because the Gunner looks so awesome. Great Design. So i paid, was it 0,50 Cent, something like that and that was the beginning of a REALLY addicted friendship.  Starting with the game, okay using mouse and keys, i was suprised how easily it was to get into the gameplay.  Driving the Gunner with the keys in all directions, aiming and firing at the targets with the mouse in all directions at the same time. No limits, except the low weapons at the beginning. But hey the Cheesy .... ehm ... Sweezy Gunner can be upgraded and that must be earned. Believe me, the Gunner has some nice weapons that will bring fun, but it has no no no Kitty Bombs. *sniff*  So you start at your ship and go from one part of the card to another. Fire all that moves, because if it moves it can hurt you. Baaaadly. You know what? This game reminds me, from the style and mechanics of the good old Super Nintendo Zelda. Go from card to card, rise up, get more hearts and defeat one Big (And i mean REALLY BIG) Boss after another, getting also cool upgrades, to reach places from before, that were blocked with some kind of walls or other obstacles. Well, your Gunner is not a smart guy with a sword and a shield. This one goes by 2 great wheels, a plated body and a biiiig gun.  Sweezy Gunner is a great Bullet Hell game, with a very nice rising of the difficulty level. This Game is fair ... well at one point not, but that is my opinion, i tell you at the end. Where was i ... ah yes, this game is fair und gives you a lot of fun. All you have to do is to pay simple 3.99 cent (Or less, look at sales).  I played so many games, that are more expensive and so many dind`t gave me the fun that Che... Sweezy Gunner gave me. I remember how i was addicted to get all the achievements, to rise the Gunner and to reach the next boss.  Yes i got through i got all the achievements and was happy .... but stop! Looking at the achievements i saw 4 new achievements. Challenge achievements. Okay, i said. Doing it, earning it, getting! You thought so. These Challenging Levels are hard as hell. And now i get my opinion from before, you remember my words. Fairness? Woah that Levels are, in my opinion, so unfair, but they can be done. Looking at global Achievements, they can be really done, but the danger of a rage quitt is really high. So i`m still sad, not to have that awesome game in my 100% List.... Dear Windybeard, thanks for that awesome game, but don´t meet me in the Dark saying CHALLENGE LEVELS, :)   Anyway at last, if you like this kind of Retro Games you`re really in. Great price, great Gameplay, great music, great design and also a chance of Ragequitting (Challen&amp;%$§$%&amp;&amp;&amp;) if you need this.  Enjoy!  I want more. What about a second part, dear Windybeard. :)",

            "review_text": "This is a multidirectional shooter with Zelda-like exploration and progression, similar to Zelda/Gauntlet clones from the 80s, especially ones made by Compile, but with more bullets on screen :) Very tight , fast-paced gameplay, decent 2D graphics, cool bosses, good sense of humour. Oh, and great synth music(DnB mostly). If you like shooting, dodging bullets, exploring and earning powerups you MUST buy this game even if it costs several times more than it costs now. Having said that I must mention that, while being very enjoyable, this game is not perfect. For example:    No gamepad support. YES, this is a 'dual-stick' shooter that has no support for 'sticks'.    You can't redefine keys, and the default layouts are not perfect for this game in my opinion. But don't get me wrong, its still a blast to play.    It crashes unexpectedly from time to time.    After several hours it becomes somewhat repetitive, because it doesn't introduce new elements and most new enemies simply have more health, move faster and spew more bullets in wider patterns. Basically, even before reaching 50% you are starting to feel like you already got most of the enjoyment from the game and its time to wrap things up.    Bullets could be slightly more visible, some of the graphics could be polished more, minimap could be useful, etc etc..  ",

It has crisp controls, it's not overly complicated (you move and shoot... all with 4 keys and 2 mouse buttons. It's great.), and the soundtrack is awesome.  The game has a lot of enemies to obliterate, power-ups to collect, and areas to explore, keeping you busy for hours. It has a little something for everyone's taste. The collector will like finding all the items, the completionist will like all the backtracking and collectibles, the sadist will like all the destruction, etc...  The areas are well laid out, the enemies pose a decent challenge, and the bosses are the right level of difficulty.  If you're looking for a mindless, yet challenging shooter/adventure game, this one is for you. Check it out!",
