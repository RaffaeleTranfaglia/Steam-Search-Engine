    "description": "It’s 11pm and the last house on your route. The windows are boarded up, the yard is overgrown, but the lights are on and the front door is open… strange place to deliver a pizza. You’re getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the house. You shouldn’t have done that.",

            "review_text": "Cute game about a girl ordering a pizza which in actuality is her way of bringing a playmate home for a foursome with her friends all night long. Once you figure out the 'games' she and her friends want to play and follow their 'rules' you can make it through the night with relative ease along with a big tip and a happy ending. Here are some hints I will give to help those having trouble getting paid for the pizza delivery and satisfying Emily and her friends.  Spoilers/Walkthrough Below:                                               1. Paper Notes can be picked up and read both on their front and back so turn them over for hints and story lore. A flashlight can be found in one of the rooms and is needed to finish the game. You keep it even if continuing after death. Audio recorders can also be listened to and will provide backstory to the game.   2. The game is broken into 7 parts/hours. After a certain amount of ingame/real time passes the clock will chime and move into the next phase of the game. When you continue, the game will resume at the previous hour you reached.   11PM-12AM is the intro to the game where you get to meet the dolls and explore the house.  12AM-1AM is playing a game with Kiki (the female doll in a black dress)  1AM-2AM is playing two games with Kiki and Mr. Tatters (clown)  2AM-3AM is playing two games with Mr. Tatters and Chester (male doll in suit)  3AM-4AM is playing three games with all three dolls   4AM-5AM is playing with Emily alone  5AM-6AM is playing with Emily and all three dolls   3. During the first hour of the game, the game itself is leading you to a 'secret' by opening doors towards the parent's bedroom closet. In the bedroom itself is a note that will explain how to exploit the 'secret' that will lead to the basement. Without opening the secret passage, it is nearly impossible to beat the game. Find the correct wall lamp in the room to touch.  4. The white board in the kitchen gives hints on how to play with each dolls, the first three hours are a lie (due to winking face) so you want to do the opposite of what it says. When you hear a particular sound cue in a room, the game is telling you that one of the dolls has entered and you must deal with him/her. Kiki has a childish chuckle, Mr. Taters has a low sounding chuckle, and Chester has a higher pitch laugh.   5. These are the games each dolls/Emily wants to play and how to deal with them. Kiki wants to play red light/green light with you being the light post so once you hear her chuckle look for her immediately and stare at her until she vanishes. If she is not in your field of vision she will make it to the light post (you) eventually. You can also run from her into nearby rooms which she may or may not follow. Mr. Tatters is playing the same game but in reverse roles. Once you hear his sound cue, stop all movement immediately and wait until he goes through another two sound cues with the second sounding like a sigh. Once he leaves the room you may begin moving again. Chester is playing tag and he is 'it'. Once you hear his sound cue, run away into another room as fast as you can or he will tag you. Emily wants to play hide and seek in the dark so once she shows up at 4AM, you are given a timer to find her in the house but luckily it's just the two of you. If you turn on a lightswitch, she will come after you for not playing her game correctly, so the flashlight is needed to proceed. If the timer drops to zero you lose and she will find you instead. Once you do find her and tag (touch) her, she will hide again in the house and the timer will reset. Each room has one possible hiding spot so continue playing with her until the next hour comes and memorize the locations to save time seaching each room. If you don't find the entrance to the basement you may never get past this part since she sometimes hides down there. Also sometimes she is tricky but hiding in the same spot twice with each timer reset so check it again if you can't find her. Lastly, for the final hour Emily wants everyone to play so now you must continue to look for Emily through the house while dealing with the three dolls. Run from Kiki (stare her down if you have the time though) and Chester but stop for Mr. Tatters. Make it through this and you finish the game. Good luck!",

I *probably* prefer  FNAF , but this is a cool little game that offers a slightly different take on the jump scare deal - most notably you have more freedom with the ability to walk through the house a la first person.   I didn't finish the game (yet), but did read through a non-spoiler-free walkthrough, and some of the strategies needed to win are fairly clever.   While its not a masterpiece by a long-shot, it gets my thumbs-up as something that would give you and friends a fun evening. ",

            "review_text": "Oh, wow. Let me tell you. I haven't been this jumpy in a long time. The scares in this game are excellent and the concept is amazing.   Twitch LIVE Gameplay Highlight -  Twitch.tv/halios00  Live play of the game - Warning, Language is sometimes pretty strong.    Story  You are a pizza delivery guy. You get a call for a large pepperoni with anchovies to a home. Normal order, normal place, right? Yeah, that's what they want you to think. You arrive to a home that the front door is wide open. You peek in and yell to see if anyone is home. That's when your night starts. When it ends, Emily will decide.     Graphics  Not the greatest. I don't believe the developers were going for futuristic graphics when they made this game. They made everything detailed but not cutting edge.     Sound  .....yea, they got this one pretty much perfect. God, I hate these noises.     Setting  Very creepy. The house is boxed up here and there, like the family is moving and makes for tense moments when you are trying to move quickly through the house. The home is small but seems huge when a scary moment is happening.     Mood  Tense and scary. They captured the feeling of uncertainty and the pressure of fighting for your life beautifully.     Replayability  You WILL lose. And lose. And lose. Then you will start to understand how things work and start to succeed. Once you beat it, it would be fun to go back and show friends or beat again.     Final Say  The premise, mood, and general feeling you get from this game is excellent. It's been a long time since I've felt this crazy tension that hits you the moment the game starts and it never ceases. It actually intensifies near the end, when impossible odds are placed against you. This live action Five Nights at Freddys will keep you guessing and jumping until the final credits.     Final Score - 8/10",

You play as a pizza delivery boy, who is on his last house for the night. Upon arrival, the door is wide open and the house seems abandoned, yet the family had just moved in. No one is home, and you enter, desperate to get out of the rain. That's where everything goes wrong. There are creepy dolls everywhere, and a little girl named Emily owns them. Emily is hiding, Her dolls are seeking. They stalk your every move, and If you spen too much time doing one thing, they will kill you. Find Emily, don't die.   First, I was bored, and bought this to pass the time. I found myself jumping and screaming the whole game. (i have not beat it yet) It's cheap, and a great play. Hard, but thats ok. Scary, really scary. And the lack of music while playing makes it 10x more terryfing.  Story: 5/10 Gameplay: 6/10 (standard horror click and move) Graphics: 7/10 Horror/scares: 9/10  ",

There is no 'body light' like every one else i see play this game has. So i wont be able to navigate through the game past night 4. 1-3 is fine but after that its messed up. Basically its too dark. But it seems its only me and my pc setup is good.",

It relies on jumpscares in a very cheesy way. You have NO idea what to do and it will take you longer to learn how to play this game than it will take you to refund it. There is little direction, the story sucks, the graphics aren't that great yet demand a lot?  This game is a mess. Unless you want a ton of jumpscares and not much else, save your money.",

It will be interesting to see how this game developes and if its finished, what it turns into, there isnt much ''gaming'' to be had from it right now, its going t need more leels and all sorts of stuff to keep people entertained.  I dont recommend this game yet, for the lack of content and things to do, lets see where it goes.",
