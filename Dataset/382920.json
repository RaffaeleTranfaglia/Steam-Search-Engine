            "review_text": "Mirrors in history have always been a mythical and powerful object. Aside from 7 years bad luck for breaking one, they also are believed to be portals, gateways to the soul, a tool for visions and much more. RETSNOM gives you the power of mirrors in a clever and twisted Puzzle/Platformer. You can bend and warp your surroundings to your will as you make your forward in a strange laboratory full of zombies. What makes RETSNOM so enjoyable is the key to solving puzzles lies in your ability to think outside the box. This game has more then one way to skin a cat and this is what I absolutely loved about it. What enables this trial and error of imagination is the games amazing level design. Each level adds a new challenge and makes you think of a new way of doing things. This especially becomes more true as you move deeper into the game as platforms begin moving not only from left to right, but up to down, and can disappear all together. Other areas of the game shine, such as the soundtrack which is purely instrumental and builds on the somber but thoughtful story of the game. The game revolves around one mans quest to cure his daughter of the zombie virus and he won't stop at nothing and will kill anyone who gets in his way. While zombies are over done, the tone of the story reminds me of strange and classic sci-fi story from the early 50-60s. Involving time, space, and consequences of ones actions. RETSNOM is a very underrated game and really deserves your attention. There are times that can get frustrating and occasional bugs but each level is more or less 2-8 minutes long. So repeating content isn't that big a deal. So if you are in the market for a great soundtrack, amazing level design and an intriguing story. Get this game. Plus its a good price!  I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!         YouTube™ Video:  IndieView - RETSNOM&nbsp;",

Some of the levels are rather extensive so early in, and the monotonous colors of the environment can be tiring on the eyes, but the puzzles are fun to solve, and the music is lovely.  While I'm not the best at the game or videos, they can give some insight if you want to investigate the game a little before buying it:         YouTube™ Video:  Retsnom (World 1)- Part 2: IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING&nbsp;",
