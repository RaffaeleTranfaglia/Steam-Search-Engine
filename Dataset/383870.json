            "review_text": " Firwatch  Firewatch is an enjoyable 'first-person mystery' by a small team of folks who know what they are doing.  Applying the 'walking simulator' is not inaccurate, but that may be too dismissive of the refined experience Firewatch offers.  Much walking through a nicely realized, highly stylized forest environment is involved, but the most notable ingredient of the game is your character's interaction with the other main character via portable radio - one of the finer examples of such interaction in the video game medium.  The game starts by building a backstory of your character via text, allowing you to make several choices - an effective technique to help you identify with your character. These choices are later reflected in dialogue (although they do not, as far as I know, have a significant impact on the plot). The dialogue mechanic, the control over dialogue responses effectively facilitates immersion and the dialogue is very well voiced.  Firewatch does a good job at pacing, at maintaining suspense. Although, you can choose at times to wander off on a few detours and delay story progression. There's a decent amount of optional secrets and details to discover, but not very many - if short on time, don't worry about them and just stick to the goals at hand, as you won't miss much. The game can last about 4-8 hours depending on how much you stray/dawdle.  Perhaps the most questionable aspect of the game is the hype and marketing that emphasizes the mystery. There certainly is mystery, and it's pretty good, but many, perhaps even most, might be surprised and perhaps disappointed that the story progression doesn't match quite the expectations they had. Although I did feel a mild sense of being the victim of misdirection, I liked the story, and the game.  The other perhaps surprising but astute design principle here is what isn't explicitly shown. The (visual and auditory) presentation is such that much is left to the imagination and exposition is trickle-fed. A cynic might accuse this paradigm of being a cost saving measure. And maybe it is. But, it is effective at engaging the player's mind.  I recommend Firewatch as a short but good interactive mystery experience, especially if it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "I had high hopes for this game after I saw the 15 minutes review gameplay on YouTube. I didn't even mind the high price tag for the supposedly short 6 hours of gameplay as I was expecting a good mystery for my character to solve. But all in all, I was pretty disappointed with how the game unfolded.   + Beautiful graphics. + Very atmospheric. + Good soundtrack. + Excellent voice acting for the witty dialogues. + Engaging story at the start and towards the middle.  - Story didn't really deliver. It started off strong and then just fell flat / boring towards the end. Some parts were predictable. - Very short (expected at least 6 hours of gameplay, got only 4.5hours).  - No consequences of your dialogue choices.  - No replay value. - Price tag is too high for its current content. - Linear. Since this is more like a walking simulator, I was expecting a bigger map, if not an open world. - Expected a good mystery but got   a flirty woman on the radio instead  .  Buy it if you don't mind a walking simulator with a subpar storyline, but I simply cannot recommend it at its current price; there's just not enough content to justify the price tag. Get it only when it's heavily discounted.  EDIT: Like a lot of people, I wish there's a Neutral button that I could give it. It's not a bad game per se, it has its merits and I did enjoy some parts of it. But with its current $20 base price (less in my regional Steam store), I got about 4 hours of gameplay. Of a mediocre story line. With an abrupt 'WTF' ending that I didn't enjoy / like.   My Rating: 5/10",

            "review_text": "First off, let's get it out of the way and say that yes, the game is extremely short. It took me about three hours to play all the way through the story. With no incentive to replay it, the game might not be worth the asking price for many people who read this review. If you don't want to pay $20 for a 3 hour experience, then that is fine, and respectable.  However, the experience that you're buying here is something unlike other games you've played. Firewatch, no matter what all the naysayers believe, is a very groundbreaking game. It did something no other game has ever done for me: make me feel like I was talking to an actual human being when I had conversations with Delilah as Henry. The connection you build with her is something unlike anything you'll see in another game. It just feels so... real. She feels like a real person. I believe that the feeling is amplified by the fact that you never really see a physical representation of Delilah in the game. You only ever speak to her through your handy walkie-talkie, which means the only thing I ever associated her with, was with a real, breathing human.  The story that Firewatch tells is also an extremely believable, heart-wrenching, and yet heart-warming one. I'll not go into details or spoilers, but let's just say that the story is a very human mystery, and has a few twists that leave you pondering every single thing you ever did in the game, and wondering how it was all connected. The story wasn't something that will completely blow your mind and make you rethink your life, but it is just that hint of subtlety that makes it so enjoyable. It just feels so real, man.  I believe that the price tag on Firewatch is worthwhile. The beauty of the landscape in which the game is set isn't really comparable to very many other games. The world is exquisitely detailed, and the art style does a lot for the overall atmosphere the game is going for. Photorealism wasn't something that the developers were going for, as the art has a very cartoonish, animated feeling - and yet all of the finer details in the world are still there, such as print on the back of some of the books found in the game that can actually be read. The environment will immerse you in your surroundings, and if not for your map and compass and Delilah's guidance, it would be quite easy to get lost in the extensive wilderness in which the game is set. On top of that, the voice acting in the game is probably some of the best you'll ever hear. For such a small title, it is astonishing how well voice acted it was. The voice acting certainly helped to add to the immersion of the world, but it also helps justify the price of the title, as quality like that can't come cheap.  In the end, if you're looking for a quick, hearty game that you want to make you feel something, then this game is definitely worth your time, and your money. If you don't have the cash to fork out for a game you'll probably only ever play once, then I don't think this title is for you.",

            "review_text": "I don't really care enough to write reviews, but this game I found genuinely dissapointing. I saw it on sale for about $16 the day before it's release. I remember seing the E3 presentation of the game and thought 'Hey, seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting'. So I had an interest in this title. But, did it fare to my expectations? Nope. Here's why.  Now I am going to avoid spoilers, because I respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves, but I strongly recommend waiting for a sale. Like $5.00 sale.   I'm going to start off with the pros, because despite my over-all disappointed there are some commendable attributes.  Pros: +Voice acting - This is definitly the golden prize of the game. Interactions between Henry (Rich Sommer) and Delilah (Cissy Jones) are engaging and rather entertaining. It definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationship.  +Soundtrack - The ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed.   +Art Style - A rather pretty lookng game, I definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team Fortress 2 especially in player model (A modded asset from Team Fortress 2). Environment is pretty to look at. But ultimately feels kind of lifeless.  +Story (Acts one and two) The sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts, definilty made a rather intense on-the-egde of your seat impact. It was what drove me to keep playing till the end. But, this is where I get into the cons.  Cons: -Not enough depth - I thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing. I initially felt the game could've had a lot to offer in terms of exploration. I mean, look at the map when you first get into the lookout. It seams plentiful, like there'd be a lot to find and discover. But unfortunately there's northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling. I didn't get the flashlight till near the end of the game and I pretty much didn't even need it.   -Lifeless - When you start off and come across an Elk and then a tree scratched to ♥♥♥♥ by a Grizzly, I thought 'Huh, maybe there'll be an encounter with a Grizzly'. Nope. Asside from the gran-total 3 npcs to come across, there is very little wildlife present in these woods. Even though the game warns of these encounters, they never occure. Ever.  -Length - Having finished the game in only 3 hours, I finally understand Angry Joes contempt for short ♥♥♥ titles, I've often avoided them because they aren't worth the asking price. I honesltly hoped this would've been a bit longer. 8 - 9 hours atleast.   -Illusion of choice - One thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between Henry and Delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on end-game. Even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose. That's it.  -Ending sucked - A game presented like this, at least could've had multiple endings.... There's only two and they're both exactly the ♥♥♥♥ing same.   All in all, I give this game a 4 out of 10. It's not really worth $20, if on sale for like $5:00 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot. But for the most part, it's pretty 'meh'.  ",

The art is really neat and looks great for what it is. The music is captivating and goes great with the setting. That being said, the plot falls short. I felt like I was playing 'Explore the Woods Simulator 2016' more than a mystery game. Sure there is a mystery but it never really is explained it kind of just develops out of nowhere. One minute you are at point A. and suddenly you are at Z with very little in between. It was frightening to play thinking that there was more to come but it just never happened. The most intense moment in the game is a semi stealthy exploration of an unchartered camp which, in reality, isn't even a threatening part of the game. I was giddy in the middle. I felt like the game might have a scooby doo ending where theres a villian behind everything trying to scare away people to secure his treasure or something silly, but it didn't even come close to that. In fact, you never even really encounter a villian. Like I said, its a decent game, not worth $17 though. Maybe grab it on sale and kocnk it out one day. Just don't go in with hopes of a great story.   Would not reccomened for full retail. Pick it up on sale and enjoy it.",

There's really not much of anything in the way of actual gameplay. You mostly wander around trying to find your way between various waypoints with the help of a compass and map. So it really kind of depends what you're looking for.  Overall, it's very well done. The story is compelling as you play, though I did feel the ending was a little weak. The graphics and general feel throughout are great. If being alone in the forest while experiencing a compelling story in a beautifully realized world appeals to you then you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't expect a ton of traditional gameplay. It's really more of a visual novel/interactive movie.   ",

When I got further into the game and eventually beat it, I felt pretty empty and betrayed. Firewatch builds up a pretty interesting story and characters just to ruin it at the end and throughout.   What I liked: -The voice acting was very convincing and felt very genuine. Very charming game. -This game made me feel emotions, joy, sadness, suspense, something I crave from games but rarely get. -The visuals are gorgeous, quite possibly one of the most beautiful games I've played. (I've spent alot of time taking screenshots) -The soundtrack was beautiful and played at very appropriate moments. Guided the players' emotions.  What I did not like: -The game was very linear and more often than not did not feel more open, rather it had the illusion of being open. -The story fell flat on its face toward the end and halted to a stop abruptly. A giant build up just for nothing (very disappointed personally) -Player choices did not matter at all. the game doesn't take any turns if you choose a certain line of dialogue. (at least thats what I gathered, I may be wrong) -Very short, I usually enjoy short games, for example Dishonored. With this game, it was too short for its own good and could have been longer so the story met a satisfactory ending. -Price tag is a little too high for this game, I felt like I paid too much for what I got. -Boring achievements. Congrats you did something mandatory to finishing the game!  Some of my additional opinions: -The main characters, Henry and Delilah, should have tried to fix each others issues rather than continue to just point them out, some character progression would be nice. -Their chemistry got a bit stale for me, but never got annoying.   Conclusion: I don't want to tell you if you should get it or not because I don't feel like I have the authority to do so. Take my points into consideration and come to your own conclusion. Because I can't give a neutral review on steam I will give it a negative review since I'm teetering more on not recommending it. I don't hate it since it did give me some enjoyment even if it was followed by disappointing. I really wish there was a better ending to Firewatch. Maybe wait until a sale.   Thanks for your time!",

However, i dont think it was worth its price. If you do decide to get this game, wait until it is on sale. I felt there was not enough content for it to be worth its full listing price.. or even its sale price (which was 17.00 when i got it.)  Sad to say, i ended up not enjoying much of the scenery because i was glued to the map the entire time, making sure i was going the right direction. There was all this suspense towards the end.. and i was floored the entire game long, waiting for something amazing to happen something to be revealed.. some deadly secret everyone was keeping from me. But at the end of the game.. six hours in.. the ending left me feeling dissapointed. I needed more answers.. the abrupt way it ended just felt.. wrong.. the whole time i expected more.. but there was nothing. Honestly, the game end made me feel like someone ripped the middle and parts of the end out of a really good book and then just left me with the scraps.  Not to mention i spent nearly an hour stuck on a set of rocks, glitching out with invisible walls which didn't seem like they should be there at all. Why let me climb a rock and then not go back down the other side when its touching the ground. It was rather frustrating.  In the end.. this game is a walking simulator.. which i tend to enjoy when they have a story.. but this one.. felt dull and lifeless.

Pro:  Good storyline  Fun game ran fine for my with a 3820 CPU with a 980 TI graphics card.  Con:  WAY WAY too short  too expensive for the time only 1 ending. multiple ways to get there but only 1 ending.",

            "review_text": "  Firewatch  is a great walking simulator. So great, in fact, that many gamers (including myself) at times wanted it to breach the walls and actually have more 'gaming' elements.  This game really has the whole package; the artwork, music, voice acting, animation and atmosphere are all expertly crafted. The storyline is moving, to say the least.   The two major shortcomings in my mind are 1) the game is quite short (3 hours to 'finish' the story), and 2) there is little replay value.  I will elaborate on both.  Although the twenty dollar price tag has become fairly standard for quality walking simulators (a la  Gone Home  or  Dear Esther , among others), you only get a measly few hours of enjoyment out of it. The hours are top quality, though. After I was done, I kept asking myself why they couldn't have added in more achievements or side quests to fill out the time and add more incentive to replay. Sure, there are little 'easter eggs' of sorts littered throughout the map, but its certainly not enough for me to justify the large-ish price tag.  Achievements would incentivize this; for example, I earned all the achievements in my first 3 hour playthrough.    Beyond that, everything is great. The story is wonderful and the experience is divine.   Just realize that this is a walking simulator proper. They may tease you with finding an axe, but there is no game here. Thats ok, but I think some of us wanted it to go to that next level.  It was most likely created to be a short experience on purpose, though. For example, while the map feels large and sandboxy at first, it quickly shows that it is quite limited. Once again, thats ok, but it merits being mentioned. The map is not as open-world as it may have us think. Its a series of 'tunnels'. Very beautiful tunnels.   Pros:  +Stunning artwork and scenery +Truly great voice acting +Outstanding story-telling +Music is excellent +Its short, but what is there is powerful   Cons:  -Its short, with a fairly steep price-tag (albeit par for the genre) -I wanted more 'game', but thats like asking for more guns in  Minecraft  (hey devs take that as a compliment, because you really made something wonderful that could go in any direction) -The map really needs more life added. I didn't see a single bug-swarm for example. I could go on and on about this, but you get the idea.   Walking simulator fans really need to play this for the experience.  Even with only 3 hours of play time at this moment, I don't regret a single dollar spent.",

Before I continue any farther, the tl;dr version is that I recommend Firewatch whole-heartedly, and I enjoyed it immensely. Some of the climbing was in some ways a little tedious, but in otherways added a lot more deliberate-ness to the situation. It felt more... immersive. It was a tediousness that felt a part of the game rather than a flaw in it, which for me excused the issue. Other than that, I loved Firewatch.  Anyway.  Firewatch is a fantastic game overall. The choices are interesting and feel personable, the characters are relateable and instantly likeable, and feel like real 3D people with great depth.  And that's really what Firewatch is about. People. It is almost entirely about your interaction with the Voice At The End Of The Radio. Other than that, there are people around that, that affect the situation and the topic and your responses to the VATEOTR, who are always on your character's mind, and in turn, on your mind, but ultimately it is about your interaction with this one, other person.  And it is fascinating. It's so enjoyable to talk with her. Her responses are real and sometimes funny and I laughed and I cried and I enjoyed the game all the way through. At the time of writing I finished the story in about four hours, but I will definitely be playing it again, and it was four hours well spent.  One of my favourite parts which sets almost the entire mood for your conversation with the VATEOTR, is the scenery. The world you're put in is absolutely gorgeous, and an absolute constant pleasure to be in. It is styleized in such a gorgeous way that makes the game feel truly authentic.  In essence, I loved Firewatch, and I will play it again.  10/10",

In a very good way because of how it shows and opens up itself. During the day and night. There is a lot of humor to go around and it gets very interactive and immersive when you explore everything. Like picking up and Pine cone and examining it and I'm like 'Damn this Pine cone looks Beautiful' and other silly things to go around which is fun.

And to adress those issues, I say:  To both A and B... Why even buy the game, then? It should be pretty clear by the videos, trailers, and description that this game is mainly about story telling and environment. Not gameplay. Negative reviews written because of that purpose hold no water, as they're biased right out of the starting gate.  To C... Eh. It really depends how much you like story and environment-based games. If you really, really like them, this is definitely worth the $20. It has a good amount of replayability, as most of the chat options you choose are pretty obvious choices between being a total ♥♥♥♥ and being a good friend, so you can replay all you want to change your relationship with Delilah.  Look, I'll be blunt. There's no multiple endings. I don't want you to buy this game if you're in it for finding all the endings. But the different dialogue paths are certainly intersting. You can restart any day, so you don't have to play through the entire game again to change one dialogue option (Although some days are pretty long, so you might have to play through a bit if you're changing a dialogue option towards the end of one of them...).  Is the dialogue, environment, and storytelling good?  Yes. In fact it's some of the best I've seen in any game, really. I'm not exaggerating. The reactions seem very real, and at times I would think or even say something the characters were going to say in a couple seconds because, well, the reactions are very human and not faked at all. If your character sees something horribly unsettling, he's not going to be all heroic like, 'Do not fear! I will... yada yada', he's going to freak the ♥♥♥♥ out.  Like I said, it's sort of a walking simulator. But don't mind that. Please don't take that as a negative at all, unless you really, REALLY hate walking. The environment is so beautiful, you'll totally forget how long it took your to walk one place to another. There's also a jogging toggle without a stamina limit too, if you're not the type to want to stare at painstakingly crafted, beautiful landscapes (you monster).  There's not many characters either, which is good if you ask me. It helps the game really develop all of them, although I will say some relationship statuses are sort of forced on you through huge time-skips, where things sort of happened without your consent. And some of the dialogue options can be variants of the same thing, making you say something you don't want to, one way or the other. But those are basically the only bad things about it. No map glitches or texture bugs to be found.  Oh and last bit of advice, there's no way to get a game-over. No way to die or anything... Which kinda helps actually, since it makes the characters' reactions to dangerous scenarios more realistic and less 'Oh, well, if I die its no big deal anyways'. So if you want a game where you have to worry about dying now and then, and have the tension of danger over your shoulder... Look elsewhere.  Overall, 9/10. It's a bit short and is really only a great game for the people who are really into the genre of environment/narrative-based storytelling games, but believe me, for those people, it's a must-have. Please don't pass this up because of a few harsh words if you're really into the genre.",

There are so many different things to say and routes to take that it would only make sense that your choices would matter in the end, right? Wrong. No matter what you say, the ending is always the same (with one other mediocre,ridiculous ending that is not even remotely satisfying) with the slight exception of conversational elements throughout.  The most intriguing part of this game for me was the mystery. And as the mystery unfolded, it pulled me deeper into the story! This was amazing. Until... there is actually no resolution whatsoever. There are implied resolutions, and all of it is just that    the 'emotional lifeline' on the other end of your radio was screwing you over the whole time after taking you on an emotional roller coaster.

Your job is simply to identify, observe, and track wildfires as they move through the area. Sounds pretty mundane, right?  Well, you're not wrong. There isn't much action aside from the occasional rock-climbing. That said, this game isn't about action. It's all about the story.  Firewatch is an interactive story, more than a traditional game. Thankfully, this is Firewatch's strength. It is well-written, and the voice-acting is excellent. There are times when you can get absorbed with taking in the scenery, and others where the scenery is blurring by as Firewatch dials up the tension. Even the casual controls help keep your mind off what your hands are doing, and focussed on what you're experiencing.  I've seen a lot of complaints that it's short (I finished in just under 5 hours), but there's no point to dragging it out. The narative is what is presented, not the mechanics. Would I say it's 'a fun game?' Maybe not. But it's definitely an enjoyable experience, even if it's only for a few hours.  Oh, and the graphics are gorgeous. I love the art style.

The first hour or so of the game is wonderful, thanks to the chemistry between Henry and Delilah. It's some of the best writing and voice acting I've seen in a long time.  Then it turns into an episode of the X-Files, and all the chemistry between the two leads vanishes.   I'm not going to spoil what twists and turns the story takes. Instead, I'll point out that the story starts out great and ends up falling flat, largely because of two things:  1. The pacing. The game starts with a slow burn. You're learning about the two characters, about the world, and occasionally a weird thing here, a weird thing there. That's fine. Then, all of a sudden, there is an abrupt turn into crazytown. I felt like I was just starting to settle into the groove of Hank 'n Delilah, when all hell breaks loose. Suddenly Hank and Delilah are bemoaning [spoilery thing I won't mention] plaguing them ALL SUMMER LONG, and I'm like 'Wait, what? All summer? It was Day 2 of summer ten minutes ago. Then you jumped to Day 30 something, then Day 40 something, and now we're here.' The game doesn't actually build a solid foundation between Hank and Delilah; it pulls the equivalent of 'Two months later...' and expects that time to add weight to the proceedings. It doesn't. You can't just skip months of time and then have the characters say 'Oh, all that time we've spent together' as if it means something. It doesn't.   2. The quality of the writing. The first hour is phenomenal. Hank and Delilah have charmingly awkward conversations about their pasts, about the job. You have opportunities to press a little, or hold back, and you begin to shape your relationship with this total stranger who is also your only lifeline. Once the game takes the aforementioned sharp turn into crazytown, though, every conversation basically becomes:  Hank: I found a thing. Delilah: You found a thing?! What the hell? Are you sure it's a thing? Hank: I am certain it's a thing. Delilah: I can't believe it's a thing. I don't like this, Hank. Hank: I don't like it either. I'm going to keep looking. Delilah: We've got to find out about the thing.  Relationship building? Basically gone. Character development? Not so much. Sense of humor? Vanished. As soon as the plot kicks in, the core pillar of this game - the relationship between Hank and Delilah - is sucked dry of everything that made it interesting. As soon as the story takes center stage, they become a *stunningly* boring pair.  I don't even care about the actual plot. Weird stuff happens, more weird stuff happens, you're given a seemingly plausible explanation for some of it, the end. By the time the credits ran, I couldn't have cared less about any of it; I was still just wondering what had happened to those interesting characters I met in the first hour, and why they were replaced with Blandy McBlanderton and the Blandtime Band.  What a waste. So much potential, and the developers clearly know how to write compelling characters; I just can't understand why they would abandon those characters to focus on a completely run-of-the-mill story instead.",

With a game thats basically all about story, thats really all you need for a recommendation. You'll know if this kind of game is for you or not  To those complaining about length, its a $20 exploration game. If you expected 15 hours out of this, you must not play this genre very often. You have to be okay with a few hour experience. I finished after 4.5 hours while doing moderate exploration and trying to get as much dialogue as I can. If you can't rationalize $20 for a game like this, by all means wait for a sale, but for a lot of people including me, its already worth the 20 price tag for getting basically a longer, better written movie.   Some of the downsides, its a first person game without an FOV slider. Not sure why they left it out, but I did get a mild headache. Its possible it was because I played for almost 5 hours without stopping, but be wary. Also some people are experiencing performance issues and glitches. For me though, I only had a few minor graphical issues.

Once I heard that the head devs for two of my favorite games, Walking Dead Season 1 and Mark of the Ninja, had founded their own studio I knew I had to play their first game. Firewatch didn’t disappoint me at all.  Firewatch is a narrative driven adventure game that has you play as Henry, a man working in a national park looking out for forest fires, seemingly trying to get away from his normal life. His only real contact to anyone else is his superior, Delilah, who’s stationed in another outpost miles away. The game focuses on how you develop your relationship with them, as well what kind of guy Henry is. There’s also some good amounts of exploration as well. The dialogue is fantastic and reactive, and you will probably make a habit of calling in everything to Delilah just so you can have more of their interactions. It's overall a fantastic character piece video game and the first ten minutes alone illustrate this from the get-go.  While the plot is set in stone, their relationship and who Henry is is not. The plot is also engaging and has an air of real mystery to it. The ending is ultimately quite satisfying and bittersweet, practically all loose ends are tied up and it can end on a melancholy yet hopeful note. It also has really good pacing, people may whine that its short, but some gamers just don’t seem to appreciate tightly-paced games. (And really its not that short, it took me almost five hours to complete it, also give me quality over quantity any day.)  Also the game is gorgeous and walking around the forest is great. The soundtracks is also really good too and adds to the atmosphere.  Overall Firewatch is a great adventure game and while I’m still mulling it over if it’s one of my favorite games of all time, its most definitely going to be one of my GOTY.",

Delilah is that person you connect with in an MMO or other online world and you feel you could hang out with/ date/ marry irl. While the game is fresh and fun and you're exploring together, the banter and chemistry gets stronger over time, only communicating by voice. You start to wonder if this is a person you could spend time with in real life despite not even knowing what they look like- but you don't know if the other person is thinking the same. As the game dies down, people quit, and the end draws near for various reasons- you casually test these waters. The other person likes you as a partner in this virtual world, but is clearly not into the idea of meeting irl. Once the game is over (the semester begins as summer ends?) you aren't quite sure if you'll ever talk to that person again. You even ask if they'll play again on their next break ('next summer') but they sound like this will be their last big foray into video games. It's a sad but very real portrait of how many of us can envelope ourselves into an MMO and the relationships we form cemented in a world that isn't real. In the end the only thing that was real are the emotions you felt during the experience. its also worth noting how the game ends. You don't quit MMOs or other community driven games that you play for months/ years after some momentous climax or riveting boss fight. You just kinda... stop playing. There's numerous other parallels in here about getting immersed in the huge forest of a gaming world (instead of quitting, Ned just immerses himself even further, and he doesn't want to be pulled out)",

Let's get started with what the game is not, because I think a lot of people expected based on previews more than what it's offering. It is not really an open world game. Yes, you have access to most of the map at all times, but the objectives are linear and mostly punctuated by taking you back to the tower once you complete them. The world is pretty, but there isn't anything in it. Aside from a few lockboxes you find and objects specifically related to your current objectives, there's nothing you can interact with in the world or see besides trees and ♥♥♥♥.  This game is also not a choice-based story in the vein of Life Is Strange. While you do have dialogue choices, they will not impact any in-game events or the game's ending in any meaningful way. It only affects the dialogue you hear back from your dispatcher.  This game does not have challenges in its gameplay. There are no puzzles, no combat, no way to 'die' or fail your objectives. You are simply going through a story in first person.  While none of these things are by any means requirements for a game to be good, it leaves us only with the story, which unfortunately isn't as good as I had hoped. The idea of the game is that you're alone, and because of your past you're emotionally unstable and susceptible to paranoia, and weird ♥♥♥♥ starts happening that you have to figure out. The game does an amazing job with the setup, and an amazing job of making everything feel creepier and creepier. But the big discovery about what's happening is super disappointing and anticlimactic (though I'll give that it's interesting and unexpected). I think they had a great opportunity to take it a step further and they didn't. And then everything that happens between that and the ending is really dull and unsatisfying.",

I'd caution you from buying this game if you're looking for a Skyrim; but if you're someone who wants to take a 2 or 3 hour break from life and just watch the beauty of nature, this is your game.  In Firewatch, you play as Henry, a new fire lookout in Shoshone National Forest (in Wyoming). You spend your days doing fire lookout stuff, including looking at just how ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful this game is. It kinda makes me want to take a trip to Yellowstone just to take a look with my own eyes. Anyways, along with this, there's a plot (that I won't spoil). It's mediocre, but there are definitely some sad parts, and some happy parts. But, along the way, you'll look at the beauty of the entire map, and listen to great atmospheric soundtracks, and generally have a good time as you explore the forest and everything it has to offer. In addition, character development is pretty nice: I love the personalities in this game, and you really feel like you're Henry and going through the ups and downs of life. Plus, this game isn't mechanically intensive; it's supposed to be a relaxing game, which is great if you're looking to take a break from fast-paced anything.  I have very little criticisms of this game: unlike some other players, I don't really feel duped or anything. I will say that it's a short game (2-3 hours), doesn't have much mechanical or plot depth (counterbalanced by amazing visuals and audio), and the ending is a bit... wonky.

There is no doubt that 95% of the game will grab you and pull you in and bait you with promises of a grand relationship to come amid banter that is so well scripted that at times you might forget that Delilah is but a voice on the other end of your two way. The mystery and intrigue build consistently as you near completion and suddenly it all comes crashing back.... to reality. And That is the point, and I can respect it.

I also understand that people didnt like the ending as it was open ended. Understanding that, I still loved the game.   It was an immersive game, the world looked fantastic, and the story via radio transmitions really put you in a position to care about what was happening in the forrest with yourself and Delilah.   My argument for the people who disliked the ending would be, that if you really pay attention to the dialogue between yourself and Delilah, you'll realise why she did what she did, she wasnt the person you thought she was. I'd recomend even going back and looking through more closely if you are interested.   Well worth $12, given my time over I would buy it again.",

It’s not life changing, but what it does – it does quite well. You get to walk through a beautiful forest, solve a mystery, and listen to two well-rounded characters deal with some of the real problems that can happen in life.

It's a story of people experiencing life events beyond their control, and how they deal (or don't deal) with them. Woven around those themes is a compelling mystery story with many twists and reveals. The art style and music are fantastic, complementing the story and furthering a mood.  Some will complain that the game is fairly short and doesn't have a lot of replay potential. Indeed I took my time and finished in about five hours. Compared to $10 for a movie ticket I think it's well worth it, only because the quality of writing and acting here make that a meaningful comparison. The compromise you make for the excellent writing is that the game funnels you into a single storyline despite what appear to be choices along the way. The funneling is subtle and done in a number of ways, and while I knew it was happening it didn't bother me because the writing and presentation work so well. As much as anything this is an interactive movie, or a first-person narrative experience.  If the aim of art is to evoke emotion, Firewatch succeeds brilliantly. Like Red Dead Redemption or The Last of Us, it conveys something more complex than the usual game and likely to stay with me for a long time.",

I may play through it again one day just to explore more of the territory and other dialogue choices, but I'm not sure it's 'replay value' is all that high.

Firewatch isn't about having a long, extravagent game or an extraordinary, ♥♥♥♥-your-pants ending.  It's about the details, the little nuances in the game you interact with and discover by chance or curiosity. It's about the spectrum of human emotion, trapped in between a gorgeous, surreal environment and a slowly-creeping unease, left only with the voice on a walkie-talkie keeping you company (and possibly a turtle or wooden cutout). It's about how you relate to the characters, and how they relate with you. And for what it's trying to do, Firewatch is just the right length.  The people, the dialogue, the fear and uncertainty and relief--it's just all so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -real-. That being said, you may need to be in a certain mindset while playing. If you don't have the time to explore the game or aren't in the mood to slow down and snap a couple of photos of the sunset (quite literally), there is no way you can fully enjoy this game right now.

If you enjoy walking simulators that focus on the human aspect instead of a grand and epic mystery, give this one a go, it's really worth it. I got it on sale for 13,99€, but in hindsight, it would have been worth full price.   Couple of things to note:  - It seems to be weirdly taxing on the GPU. The fans don't even work this hard with Fallout 4 or a heavily modded Sykrim. I'm not sure if that's specific to my system, or if the requirements just aren't accurate. (R9 390, 4GB)  - Default controls are meh for small hands, change them right at the beginning to your liking to avoid doing it again and again as you keep picking up tools. (Tiny nitpick, but it bugged me until I changed it)  - I saw somewhere that the game was advertised as being six hours long. This may or may not be the case for you, but it heavily depends on how you play. If you stop to explore every clue and listen to every conversation, you can have a six-hour-long relaxed playthrough. If you rush, you can make half that time, perhaps even less. Whether or not that detracts from the experience for you, you'll have to decide for yourself. From my 5.3 hours (as of writing this review), my actual playthrough was about 5 hours, and I usually take my time with these things.   Well, that's it. Great game, would buy again.",

The story was somewhat intriguing at first but it was actually very light, in that I think most of the game shines in the dialogue between you and the woman you're speaking to on the radio. It kept me on edge, though. There were some genuinely tense and suspenseful moments in this game that had me uneasy.  I guess the main reason why I'm let down is that I wish the story was a little less... simple, I guess? Yes, simple stories can be wonderful, but throughout the game I kept expecting that there was more to what was going on, and the theories started swirling around in my head. But I was disappointed that the big 'twist' wasn't really all that big at all, and I just... wasn't that invested in it, to tell you the truth. And the game also isn't as choice-heavy as I was expecting. You don't really get to make any huge decisions, and none of the choices that you do make seemed to matter in the end, and they were just there to mask the game's linearity that lurks underneath.  Another thing I'd hoped was that I wish there was more to DO in the game. The area you get to explore is huge, and it would've been more enjoyable to explore if there'd been actual collectibles or secrets to find. The closest thing to that are the various caches that you stumble upon, but they're all pretty close to the linear path that the story takes you, and are hard to miss. Heck, they all even have the same padlock code. There's not really any replayability with this game, and it's pretty short. Should take you 3 hours or possibly less to complete it if you blitz through it. Took me longer than that cause I tried my best to really look around and get the most out of it, but like I said, there's really not much TO explore.  I don't know if I would recommend this game, I'm sad to say. The good things in it are good, but the lackluster things in it are exactly that as well. Maybe my hopes were too high, I don't know. Overall I was just let down by this game. I understand the kind of narrative experience it was trying to give, but it lacked the extra oomph that a game like, a most recent example would be OXENFREE, had. It left a lot to be desired, and was pretty linear despite its illusion of branching pathways.  I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to experience the game for yourself, but otherwise a playthrough on YouTube would suffice, I think. This game is a 5/10 for me. The art style, voice acting, writing and soundtrack are all great, but everything else sadly doesn't live up to the hype, and I don't think that it's worth the asking price.",

At this point, I haven't played it in a while but I remember getting absolutely hooked when my friend (shout out to Raptor) sent me a copy on Steam. The story is amazing, the linear gameplay is fun and the whole game feels like a puzzle only instead it being easy to get into and difficult to master, it's difficult to get into and easy to master. That doesn't mean there is a learning curve; it's completely fair. Your actions actually affect the gameplay which is what made games like Mass Effect great.  And on top of all this, the graphics and voice acting are superb, something that I already expected.  My only complaint is that there are certain technical issues. There isn't a distinct way of telling where an invisible wall is and is not and sometimes they are scattered all over the place. I once tried to get a better view from a cliff (because the views are amazing) so I got up on some rocks. But the rocks were covered in invisible walls with no consistency so getting up onto and down off the rocks was like a maze. Regardless, Firewatch is still an amazing game. If the new Zelda game, Cuphead, Star Fox Zero, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy XV and Mighty No. 9 are this good, then 2016 will be a great year for video games. Firewatch gets a 8/10.",

I spent a lot of time just enjoying the gorgeous setting and soaking in the sounds around me, and just plain exploring.   I approached the game without expectations, and although you have to follow the story line, I chose to explore as much as possible while I did. Unsurprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.   What you need to know: Good story, mediocre but oddly fitting ending, brilliantly executed both visually and aurally. Next to zero replayability. Wait for a sale.    If I had a magic lamp: I wish there was a survival feature, you must eat, drink, seek shelter, etc. I wish there were more 'days' to play. I wish I could go back again next summer. I really wish the Wapiti Station had been fleshed out, even if it didn't affect the end game. This is a hook that left me really wanting to know what was going on, and then... nothing.

It starts you off with a failing relationship due to adult onset dementia in your wife, a truly terrifying thing. You end up taking a job in Yellowstone as a watchout for fires. Your first few days have you exploring and dealing with troublesome teens, but soon a darker more malignant feeling descends upon your area of the park. With someone- or something- seemingly watching your every move, soon you're entangled in a seemingly complex and terrifying conspiracy. All the while a wildfire rages, coming ever closer and threatening your very life.  All in all the graphics do very well in building a beautiful landscape, you hardly see any human models, so it's hard to judge them on what is given, they seem a bit offputting, but you're in the wilderness for 98% of the game, so it hardly matters. You quickly learn your way around the park, roughly half way through the game, you'll hardly need your map anymore. Story wise, I found the game a tad lacking, however if you don't go in with as high of expectations as I did, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, I know I did.  Final judgement: Buy it if it falls below -25%.

Here are the two greatest negative criticisms—and note that one of them is a spoiler, although I'll do my best to make it relatively generic:  1. The game is short and for the most part, I think, lacks replayability. Playtime clocks in at about 3-4 hours. There may be some possible alternate conversation paths that could be worth playing through to experience but other than that, the main story is wrapped up in a relatively short amount of time for a game currently priced at ~$20.  2. The ending of the game leaves you with a desire for a sense of closure that it doesn't deliver. The primary antagonist escapes, your reasons for beginning the adventure in the first place are left mostly unresolved, and your relationship with the secondary protagonist is left up in the air as well.  Despite all that, I actually got a sense of fulfillment from the game that actually STEMS from its lack of closure. Life simply isn't always as simple and neat as we'd like to be, and the sense of not knowing exactly where to go, or what is going to happen next, echoes perfectly the state that Henry (the main protagonist) must have been left in.  Part of me wants a happy ending for him anyway, and the fact that things are left open lets me write that ending in my head without it being dictated by the game's creators.  Overall this was an enjoyable experience. The game itself is gorgeous, the soundtrack is both peaceful and haunting in equal measures, and the voice acting and characterizations are both believable and touching. I would honestly hesitate to call Firewatch a game; it's more of a playable narrative, an interactive movie that forces you through its sense of isolation and solitude to really connect with the main character.",

I went ahead and bought it as I needed something different to play from the usual.  I was brought into a gorgeous World when introduced to the wilderness. The scenery was amazing at times, they really nailed the atmosphere in Firewatch as well. The story however escalates pretty quickly, as you'll notice when days pass on. I won't spoil, but there was a point in the story that got me feeling spooked at times. Maybe it's because I was so immersed into the World, but as I said earlier they nailed the atmosphere. Honestly, in the 3 hours I did spend I had nothing but fun and lots of entertainment. I will definitely be doing another playthrough, especially when choosing my responses. Maybe they could add some story DLC down the road? Who knows, but hopefully they have another IP set in mind.   In the end I really enjoyed this title, though the price is debateable.

Literally it was love from the first sight. Short summary of a long text: This game is amazing, it even exceeded my expectations and will maybe forever have a special place in my heart.  People complain about many things: The game is way too short, it is a stupid walking simulator, there is no real open world, dialogues are boring, the story is too linear, the ending is bad. I don't want to argue too much, everybody has his own opinions, I just want to share some of my impressions.   The main reason why Firewatch got my first attention was the graphics. I don't care too much about texture quality, shaders etc. What matters for me is that this game is by far the most beautiful game I've ever played. Firewatch has an awesome graphic style, colors and illuminations create an outstanding atmosphere in a very well designed environment with lots of little details to discover. While it is possible to do this in 3 hours, personally I've never understood why people buy and play games in order to rush through them. This is a wonderful exploration game, so take your time, pace yourself and enjoy. I visited many places, watched the sunset, took many screenshots, looked at the books and information pieces lying around and had fun for around 10 hours. If you have an eye for details 5-6 hours should be viable at least. People are right when they say that Firewatch is some kind of walking simulator with simple interactions. You don't need skill to play this game, there is no challenge, no puzzles, everybody can play through it. And this is great. Because It is so chillfull and allows you to focus on the real package: the nature, your map, your compass, your walkie talkie and you. If you disable the location marker on the map it feels even more realistic. Yes, there are borders limiting your open-world experience, I did not care about, everything else was just so good. Voiceacting is the best I've ever heard in any game, no exaggeration, and the music is also very immersive. Boring small talk? C'mon, this 'boring small talk' is absolutely fantastic and one of the reasons why this game is so authentic and emotional. This is what makes you feel like being a part of the game and not just being the audience of a hollywood blockbuster. It is about small and ordinary things, things we like because we are familiar with them. Do you like french movies? Maybe you know what I mean. While the story builds up tension during progress you should not expect and action-packed survival game, expect heart-touching dialogues and an adult story about people dealing with their feelings and problems instead. Firewatch is unusual mature and honest for a game and for me it did far more than just scratching the surface. I also can't think of a better ending, in my opinion it is perfect because it is refreshing realistic and consistent. Everything is said, there's nothing more to explain.  Seriously, nothing has been really negative for me. Sometimes I've wished there would be a bit less talking, a bit more silence. Also there could be more animals. Often you hear but don't see them, for example at the lake. I have not seen the turtle however, another reason why I need to play the game at least once again. Possibilites for hiding the HUD or crouching for better screenshots would be sweet. Regarding the price it can be reasonable to say that there are cheaper games out there in relation to the pure playtime. But that depends on your viewpoint. For me this gaming experience was really revolutionary and I don't regret a single cent I've spent. Definitely worth my money.  I think there should not be a question if Firewatch is good, because it undoubtedly is, there is just the question if this is a game you would like to play. If you are not totally scared by walking simulators in general and the game appeals to you, you should give Firewatch a go. For me it was certainly one of the best games I've ever played.   Dear developers, thank you so much, you did an awesome job! Days after playing the game, I miss it. And... I miss you Delilah.",

After picking it up on sale I can say that it was one of the most beautiful and interesting games that I have played in a long time. Firewatch sets the standard to which all story driven adventure game will be judged against. I can say without any hesitation that I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone with a shread of interest in the genre.  That being said the ending did feel a little rushed but it ties every aspect of the story together with a nice, short, and sweet bow. I just wish the bow was a bit bigger.  Campo Santo is definitely a developer to keep your eyes on.  9/10 Needs more bow.",

            "review_text": "I suspect that the negative reviews for this game relate either to its length or its relative simplicity which, while understandable in one sense, is blatantly unfair in another. Firewatch is not a long game, I've beaten it in its entirety, including wandering around a good bit to pick up missed stashes and such (I'd forgotten the combination for the locks at one point) in under 5 hours of play. With that said, I don't feel the slightest qualm about having paid $20 for the priveledge of venturing through this masterpiece.  It is best advised that you approach Firewatch not as a game, which it is in only the most technical of senses, but instead as an interactive movie. The vast majority of choices you make in the game will have only the most minor of effects on the story, and many don't have a meaningful outcome at all, and that's okay. Firewatch is immersive in a way that few other titles are, In many games, you are empowered to shape the main character into anything you like or not at all, but not in Firewatch, In a bit of masterful design you are not left without choice, which would have served to detach you from the story as a mere observer, but instead provided just a bit of choice, the exact right amount to give you investment with the character and his story without requiring a vastly branching story tree to accomodate each choice and its' outcome.  This sense of investment, coupled with the beautiful artstyle creates an experience like none other. It pairs the best features of video games and movies to create a triple-feature-length tale that draws you in and leaves you wanting more. Henry is (most likely) not you, his story is not yours, but because of the small choices you are allowed to make along the line you are emotionally invested in his story and that is what makes Firewatch so brilliant. You are left hanging on the edge of your seat as the mystery unfolds and wrapped up in the tale on through its inevitable conclusion. I paid full price for this game I would be glad to hand Campo Santo another $20 and another $20 and another $20 for future stories like this one. Compared to going out to a movie, for example, there is no competition, Firewatch wins hands-down and, even better, it's cheaper by far if you factor in concessions. You won't get a thousand hours of gameplay out of Firewatch, and its replay value is limited for the most part, but if you treat it as an interactive story, not a game, you won't be disappointed.",

Its realistic plot grounds the player in reality, whilts effectivly enaging with them through the players interactions with other characters. The confilct of this game is actually the plot, theres no enemys to shoot, no puzzles to solve, and no bosses to slask with swords, but this is actually refreshing. It is rather like book or story arc rather than a game. Similar to how people can point to certain movies that trancend the film screen like Star Wars or Interstellar, this 'game' becomes an expirence. I think the only disappointment is when the game ends, cause unlike other games were one feels as if they've finished another challenging battle and need to do something else just to get away from the game. Firewatch leaves the player with a sense of longing and wanting more initally but upon reflection ends justibly. Which of course is the sign of a well made game, movie, or book.",

            "review_text": "Firewatch is a beautiful single player mystery game, set in a Wyoming national park in 1989. You play as Henry, a man who has taken a job in isolation in order to escape the reality of his life. We learn at the start that his wife suffers from alzheimers and no longer recognizes him, and so he deals with the guilt of putting her into a home by becoming a lookout in the Wyoming wilderness.  The only human contact Henry has is with Delilah, his supervisor who keeps him company via radio and sends him out to deal with potential fire risks, check communication lines and other such duties. The story takes an adrenaline-pumping turn when a set of strange circumstances arise. The teenage girls he tells off for lighting fireworks are reported missing a week later, and someone appears to be keeping him under surveillance.  I want to keep this review spoiler free so I won't reveal any more of what happens, but as the mystery deepens and Henry's relationship with Delilah comes into question, the already immersive story of Firewatch continues to drive the player forward with an urgency that has you gasping for breath come the end.  Being a first-person game that could almost be considered to be a walking exploration simulator, it's important to note the key elements at play here that absolutely make the game a worthy experience: the delicious, sun-drenched environments, the perfect voice acting for Henry and Delilah and a story that moves at a fast pace while keeping you wanting more.  As the mystery of Firewatch unfolded during my 4 and a half hour playthrough, I found myself questioning everything, coming up with crazy theories as I worked towards figuring out what was going on, and so it was that I found the actual ending to be something of a let down. It felt like the game had been building up to this amazing climax only for it to fizzle just a little bit right when it mattered the most.  With that said, it was a thoroughly enjoyable journey. I would absolutely play this game again even though I know what happens and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who values beautiful landscapes, well written characters and immersive storytelling.",

As someone who has spent considerable time in the outdoors I enjoyed how they didnt attempt to make walking some thrill ride or add in some sort of teleport feature, instead you are forced to take time to enjoy the scenerey.  All this said, I cannot ignore that this story had lots of potential that was simply never tapped. It seems as if they had a vision of where the game would go and then all of a sudden the gave it up. There is a beautiful setup for something strange and unbelievable and all they manage to pull off is 'surprising.'   In short, I would play this game. Its worth it. Never (except perhaps for times when I was sure there was going to be a jump scare) did I consider my experience un-enjoyable. However, if you are expecting a storytelling masterpiece I would set your expectations strait (and leave room to be surprised if you enjoy it more than I did!).

In Firewatch, that relationship is between Hank, who is married to his wife who has early onset dementia, and Delilah, his boss that he only communicates through the radio.  The game gives you various things to say to Delilah with prompts from items, settings, and responses when she contacts you. It's up to you to choose what to say, and a lot of options are to flirt with Delilah.   All of this is fine, and it's hard to say anything about this game without spoiling it, so I'll tread lightly here. There's a big tonal shift in the game about halfway through, and I was honestly surprised by it. The game started referencing characters that were only mentioned in passing, and now suddenly they were a big part of the story. It left me scratching my head, wondering if I was just not paying enough attention.   Look, I don't really know what else to say about the story, but I will say that it just left me extremely underwhelmed and slightly confused. The game is executed well; the voice acting is some of the best I've heard in gaming, it's really stunning to look at, and it really is fun to explore the Wyoming wilderness as a Firewatch person-guy. But in the end, I think it dropped the ball.   I don't want you to not play this game because of my review, because I think a lot of people will find enjoyment from this game. I don't think any of my problems that I have with it are especially damning. It's not like the game doesn't work, or isn't fun or whatever.

You found a request for a lookout and took the job. You arrive in the forest an hike to your new workplace, a watchtower ...  The rest is a tragic and mysterious but sometime also funny story with a luminous ending.  I wont say more, you have to find out on your own.  So now to the pros and cons for this game.  +Pro:  + A very very good story (one of the best of the year for sure) + A big map with secrets everywhere + A overhelming good dialog with many options to choose from + Many texts and notes all across the map, underlining the story + Sweet jokes between the characters + The characters (All of them!)  -Cons - Its short a short game - Some lil' texture buggs - Price-Gametime (But its still worth it!)  Conclusio: The game is a diamant in the big treasure of games. A hard found but earned title. I ensure you, you will have one of the best experience in your gaming life. The story is gigantic and the dialog filled with never ending deep and good conversations.  !BUT! You have to like these tips of games. Your mainly talking with your coworker and interacting with the world. For all you hoped for crafting or fighting, your on the wrong shop site!  This game is a secret tip!",

It is also worth mentioning that Firewatch has probably the most well-done voice-acting and dialogue in video game history.

Many complaints about this game are due to the length of it compared to the price, and at $20, that's understandable, but when compared to a film at ~$15, this experience is far more fleshed out and comprehensive, displaying such a beautiful understanding of storytelling and intrigue that other games actively disappoint me at their lack of attempting to expend that much effort.   The aesthetic of the game allows for even the most mundane of sights to be wonderful experiences, with many humerous and interesting things hidden throughout the rather large and fluid map. For a 'Walking Simulator' the game teaches you alot of mechanics, and uses the radio and your own observation as a genius supplement for a tutorial, as it revels in you finding new things to talk to Delilah about, with some of even the most minute details being well fleshed-out discussions that tell you more about not only your only companion, but yourself.  All these thoughts of pseudo-isolation are aided by the fact that you never actually SEE anybody else until very abruptly at the finale, allowing for an incredible amount of tension to be built during the mid to late area of the story, in which a mystery presents itself and is constantly elaborated upon, and evokes feelings that I personally have not felt since Lost, with the sensation of discovery being the most satisfied I've felt in a huge amount of time.  The music is the as the one that composed the music from Gone Home, which shows not only in the music, but the setting, as they are both set within the same time period and deal with the same themes of isolation and pseudo-horror. But, anyways, the music is incredible with a country-esque theme to it, being mixed with the 70s-80s synth, allowing for an incredible range to be achieved and atmosphere to not only be built, but amplified.  Another thing about this game that has brought a large amount of flak to it is the ending, being criticised as too sudden and not closing every topic brought up, when for me, (Though most certainly not for all) it closes itself just as it started, by using you, it has you think about all of the possibilites and results of the ending via providing no definitive one, hell, if you want to, you can even refuse the ending and allow it to resolve in one singular way, via doing nothing.  And to revisit the earlier topics in a TL;DR format, the Art Style is outright beautiful, with an incredible amount of thought being poured into it, the story is one of 3 that have permanently stuck with me (The others being Bastion and Transistor) due to just how well and intelligently made it was, and this game even excels in the area of game design itself, even though, due to the medium of the game being a 'Walking Simulator' isn't even close to being held back.  All in all, I would recommend buying this game, downloading, turning your internet and lights off, and then taking a few hours to allow this game to dazzle you.

Bear in mind, I would still recommend this game regardless but the flaws must be adressed. While I think the gameplay is great, there are a few problems, some dodgy collisions in the world, VERY SLOW acension of ropes, the iffy interaction with climbable objects, all of which I feel can be solved with simple patches so I won't take too many imaginary points off for that. *A mild spoiler about the story* The story is great for the first 2/3's of the game but then it pulls a bait and switch off the dull and anticlimactic variety, the character interactions then become dull and the ending is unfulfilling to say the least, ALMOST enough to have me give the game a negative review.

I have always been a 'about the journey not the end' kind of gamer but it is hard to get jazzed about an on the rails journey where huge swaths of time are skipped over, and relationships get no time to build. This game is beautiful, and when the sound doesn't glitch, has amazing voice acting and sound design. It also has an awesome premise with good characters. That stuff doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ though, when nothing is allowed to develop and there is no gameplay to back it up. The 'OH ♥♥♥♥' moments carried no impact, and the tension was light enough to breath.

The game is akin to the Text-Based Adventure games from the 1970's and 80's, where you explore your environment, solve simplistic puzzles and experience a story heavy experience. Text-Based Adventure Games have been coined as Interactive Fiction and that really is what Firewatch is. You explore a vibrant and colorful world, uncovering a mystery while interacting with another watchperson via a walkie-talkie. The most important thing you need to know is if the story is good and if the characters are engaging. The answer to those questions is yes. The story is engaging. I have heard critics say that the story has a lackluster ending and I disagree. There are themes and elements that leave the ending open to your interpretation and that always sparks controvery. The reality is that the game is a delightful mixture of emotions that tug on the heartstrings in a variety of ways. If you are looking for a story-driven interactive fiction, then the game is for you. It isn't for everyone, I understand that, but for those looking for this style of game, it will not disappoint.",

I knew it was a mystery and not a game, but I refunded it on the basis of it being a disappointment solely on its merits as a storytelling piece. The story was so uninteresting to me that I'm confused that others would be captivated by it or find the dialogue compelling in such a setting.  As a firewatch in a Wyoming forest, I would expect to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety of others first, and a sense of adventure second. But I found neither in Firewatch. I felt little sense of adventure going through points on a map at the command of my supervisor. And I felt no responsibility: the story puts me in charge of a character who took a firewatch job without any interest in it or qualifications, just to escape from the harsh problems of reality. Not shoes I would want to fill. Worse, I'm expected to believe my character's supervisor would immediately shirk her responsibility in a life-or-death situation just to avoid talking to authorities, and that my character would be okay with that and continue to converse with her in a friendly or even romantic way.  The conversations and connection between the player's character and his supervisor play no role in the mystery except to present conspiracies that you know won't play out.  The introductory videos on Steam try to build up suspense, drama and humor that don't really exist in the game. I believed the story was going to pick up as certain factors were presented, and that my character was going to learn to deal with the conflict or have to figure his way out of something. But in fact as the mystery 'unravels' I found my character was all along having a sort of pointless non-encounter with someone I knew nothing about and cared nothing about. So there was no arc. Then the story ended even less dramatically, punctuating the weakness of the main discovery with nothing at all happening with another character I cared nothing about.  The graphics and audio were great, especially for an indie title, but I did not buy the game for graphics and audio.  I see a missed potential. I may have enjoyed the interactions if this had gameplay rather than just storytelling, and I had been given some challenges performing duties as a firewatch with some risk and reward. With the environment that Firewatch has (minus the invisible collision meshes that prevent scaling over anything 10 inches tall), I might find some enjoyment discovering and locating fires, calling them in, and even fighting the flames as the story unfolds. But Firewatch is not intended to be a game at all, and the story failed me on its own.  A couple of other notes: (1) I considered the walkthrough format, being commanded to go from point A to point B to point C in the order prescribed by the storytelling, to be an abuse of my time in this context; (2) any indie can do better than a 55 degree FOV that can only be changed by a registry hack; (3) when changing controls, a previously mapped control should be removed when a new mapping is made, rather than preventing a new mapping, and Firewatch not only prevents the mapping, but apparently has no way to remove a control mapping, which is a disaster.  1 / 10 - Story 6 / 10 - Interface 8 / 10 - Audio/Music/Voices 9 / 10 - Graphics  A mystery is nothing without its story, so overall 1 / 10.  Steam refund process 10 / 10.",

You just need to know how to use a map, and a compass, thats it. The storyline, and voice acting is super amazing, but for $19.99 I just do not feel it was completely worth it. Sure, factor in all the work they put in, the development, the actors, the modeling and everything else, but it lacked in the time of gameplay with a stale ending that was no where near as good as the middle part of the story.

But it's still relatable. The quiet and ultimately selfish despair of those who idle and engage in frivolous activities to stem hurt. None of it is real. And even if it were it can't last; you have to go back some day. But for now, let that day be tomorrow and enjoy the sunset while shooting the breeze with Delilah.  So I guess, thanks Campo Santo for making this game and releasing it NOW of all times; when I have to decide what to do and every decision feels wrong.",

The whole story builds up, where things are very uncertain and everything becomes a mystery. But the game lost my recommendation when the reveal happened. The whole reveal was terrible, it was so damn unsatisfying, it was boring, I was sitting there 'so? was this the whole so called mind ♥♥♥♥? Was this the reveal?' And the ending was absolute horrible, terrible, it was so bad it hurt my brain.  You also get a false feeling that your choices matter. They don't really, extremely small things change, you barely notice them at all. I got a gamebreaking bug between day 9 and day 15, so I had to start over again, doing things different.

Its hard to explain whats wrong with this game without spoiling it, but i'll try my best.   Firstly the games storyline only really makes sense if you connect dots that arent acctually in the game itself. I came in aware that people didnt like the ending, and that the story is better if you read everything, and I still came out extremely dissapointed by the time the game ended. It lacks in basic story telling fundamentals. If the game had been played through the eyes of multple charcters, rather than just henry, I feel like it could have fixed a lot of the issues. It certainly feels like the creators of this game had half fleshed out idea of what they were doing when they started and than had to wrap it up as funding dwindled. If there were more gameplay, not directly related to the main story, beyond hitting space bar occasionally, I may have a diffrent opinion. Though if your games 100 percent about the story, and story is extremely amatuerish, I can't recommend this game.  Only buy this game if you've played all these games first and are just fiending for more interactive story: Walking Dead season 1 and 2, The Wolf Among Us, Telltales's Game Of Thrones,Tales from Borderlands, Sherlock Holmes Crime and Punshiment, Life is Strange, and 1979 Revolution",

It's smartly written, with well developed characters and some of the best dialogue and voice acting I've came across in any game.  It mixes genre well, with genuinely moving moments and characters you're drawn to invest in, while keeping you consistency gripped with incredibly tense thrilleresque sections. The vast and stunning natural environment around you contributes to a feeling of eerie isolation as the game goes on, and you share your characters increasing anxiousness and paranoia when it becomes apparent that you are not alone.   Firewatch's other great success is how this all draws you to invest completely in the central mystery; and ultimately this is also where the game disappointingly falls a little flat.. From the moving and poignant introduction, through the consistent building of tension, and suspense at the unravelling of the games main mysteries, to an urgent ending as the forest fires rage and close in around you.. there comes a suspenseful expectation which is not met by the far more understated (both in tone and event) and somewhat anticlimactic ending. While in some ways I do actually like the ending in terms of those characters and the games themes, due to the build-up it inevitably makes the experience feel a little confused in tone in the end, and just a little unfulfilling.

Firewatch focuses on a very grounded and human story, about a man named Henry who's just trying to get away from life and get some perspective on things. As the story develops you as the player get to choose what kind of man you want him to be, through the conversations you have with your watch partner Delilah. This is where the game shines the brightest and it was pretty much the only thing keeping me interested throughout the game. The dialog is well thought out with great voice acting to boot. There were moments I found myself grinning like a complete idiot because of the friendly banter between the characters, and there were also the heavier darker moments which made me genuinely feel for them as well. Add to this a beautiful woodland setting and a great soundtrack and you've got yourself one heck of an immersive experience.  This is pretty much the only good I have to say about this game though, sadly. When it comes to mechanics it falls short in pretty much every department. The hiking around is teadious and I found myself having to bring up my map way more often than I'd like just to see that I hadn't gotten turned around. And while we're on the subject, there really isn't any point to exploring becuase most of the areas are locked away until the game tells you it's ok to progress down the storyline. Most of the areas you explore are just big empty spaces anyway (albeit pretty spaces, but vast and devoid of content nonetheless), so in the end I just found myself plowing through the story just so I could get to the next section of dialog.  And to adress the elephant in the room: this game is short. As you can tell by my game time I beat it in two sittings at around the 4 hour mark. For a 17 pound game this is not ok, no matter how great your characters are.  At the end of the day though, I advice you to get this game, just not at full price. And I genuinely wish the devs the best of luck. Its been a long time since I felt so invested in the relationship between two videogame characters and I'm eager to see what Campo Santo can cook up in the future.",

The game is worth $20 and for its length it's a fair bit overpriced. However, if you look at it like it's a 3-4 hour movie you play then it's two 10 dollar movie tickets. Not exactly being gyped but still kinda short. The other thing people can be sour about is the ending. There are no real spoilers here but to say the least it ends a little abruptly. But the old adage rings true here: It's not the destination, it's the journey.   Now the messy part is over, I can drool over the game with all its good things. First, the writing. It's a mystery game, so it's the most important genre to keep interesting and the viewer engaged. They do a very good job with Firewatch. It's a slow burning tale of two people figuring out what's going on that isn't quite normal. The characters are expertly written by the two writers for Telltale's The Walking Dead and so the two main characters have a naturally interesting relationship throughout the game. As a normal man doing a normal job, the introduction of the mystery into this normal enviroment keeps people intrigued enough to explore the story. As well as the story, players will like the slice of Wyoming wilderness that you are stationed in. It's large enough to make each place feel different enough, but small enough so that each place is familiar enough to you as you play. Firewatch is so chock full of things from its world that it feels like a real place. Every lake and forest has its own name, there's a mascot akin to Smokey the Bear, and it's more real that it's based in a real place. Small elements in a story like this makes it on par with Alan Wake and even Dark Souls for setting a tone for it's lore.  TL;DR: It's a fairly short game but extremely dense with a good mystery and characters, and a real world waiting to be explored.",

Reality after finishing the game is different...  + *Great voice acting and dialogues *Story *Graphic stylization *Environment of Wyoming forest   - *Short. And I mean short, 3-4hrs for first gameplay is more than disapointing. I am one of people who dont have countles free hours to play games, but I would expect double play time. *Performance issues even on higher spec. computers (could be fixed hopefully if devs will look on it) *Tunnel game. I was really expecting that it will be open world.. but you have only few paths where you can go and it is ridiculous that your character can not even climb small rock or go through bush... *Decisions dont change the game. You get different conversation options, but result will be the same..   Neutral: *Price. I dont have problem to pay more money for quality game, but in this case 20Euro for 3hr game with issues above is too much. But it's dev's decision and they can put any price they want.. *Forest is empty. You see one deer at beginning and thats it. I would expect to see some animals sometimes, but nothing.. there are some birds far far away on sky... *Game was presented as mysterious, dark, scary... dead teens, somebody watching you, vandalized outlook etc. Reality is different, but I dont want to spoil here.  Well, too bad that you can not give 'neutral' review, but it has to be Yes or No. As mentioned by some people, if this was Episode 1 from the whole game I would highly recommend it although it has some issues. But as a full final game, I am still saying yes go for it, but in case there will be at least 50% discount.  Right now I am giving 6/10. If they fix performance issues it will go to 7/10. In case they will release some additional content (preferably for free) it could go higher.  Sorry devs, it could be really really good game.",

Went in blind without reading much of the reviews or articles the game had spun out over the first day release. But thoroughly surprised at how rich the characters were and the game graphics were quite pleasing to look at (Many screenshots were taken :D)... However, I was severely disappointed in how the game went on as I played - it was tipping the scales of what 'kind' of story it was driving and then I was kind of left out in the cold at the abrupt end of the game. There was much potential to possibly drag out the story more or even have more things to do in it.. but nope. Nothing. :/  Overall, buy this game when it goes on sale.",

The best thing about this game is its atmosphere and relationship you develope with the 'person on the other end of a handheld radio'. The gripes i had with this game are severely outweighed by the things that kept me interested in it and although it was a mere 3 and a half hours of gametime, it was well worth the sale price of $9.99. Definetly a game I feel that most everyone should expirience, wether that is playing or watching someone play it.  Pros: -Beautiful Atmosphere -Interesting Main Characters -Interesting and Strong Story -Good SALE Price  Cons: -Expensive when not on sale -Short playtime -Repetative gameplay elements  Overall: For those looking for a good mystery game that sort of plays out like a movie, i highly reccemend this game when it is on sale. This game isnt for everyone however, its gameplay could get boring to some making them not able to sit through the short but in my opinion, sweet, story. As far as story rich walking sims go, this is a really great one. For those turned off by the price tag of $20 and on sale $10, you could probably get most of the expirience by watching the game on YouTube, although i dont think its going to be comepletely the same, or as good.",

The visuals are completly immersive, you can almost smell the woodsmoke from fires and feel the crunch of dry pine needles under your feet. There have been a number of complaints about the ending; that it feels anticlimactic. Let yourself break through that gamer barrier that needs the adrenaline pumping, all encompassing finale.

I never had any glitch or hiccup. There aren't any real video options to play around with but the game booted up fine, ran at 1080 and maintained a consistent framerate. The voice acting was pretty good and very realistic.   Now the bad: this game is just a major disappointment. The plot starts off suspenseful and you are left wondering how things will play out and what impact your decisions will have. It kinda draws you in because you want to find out what will happen next. Things take a turn for the worse, however, when you begin to realize that the story isn't really that good. And all that suspense you thought would keep you going through the game kinda just wimpers away. Also, the end game was spectacularly bland.   When I finished the game at about 4 hours, I realized that this really wasn't a game at all. It was just a story. A bad one at that. Dialogue options don't change things much and everything ends the same.   The game really loses the little charm it had at the beginning when you start to run into invisible walls and stop following the game's structured sequences without any repercussion or consequence. Also, you can't die. Where's the fun in that?  I think video game news outlets should really stop hyping these types of games. I bought into this hype only to regret this purchase. I can't understand how video game journalists can praise a game that you can literally watch on youtube and have the same exact experience.",

The sound. yeah, it feels that devs worked on small things, what we hear in background, not to mention the voices of actors and all other sounds. The voices are fitting to this setting, IMHO. Ok, what we have next... A story. Yeeppp... this is where things get mixed. Story is nice, made of many small pieces, which adds to whole view, but it is short. Too short. I said, the story is too short. Gimme me more. It feels like first chapter of 10 chapter game. Going on... price... Another big question. For the short story price is too big. For the mystery game price is too big, having in mind that personally me very rare come back to solved mystery games. I remember everything and it`s not fun to repeat it again and again. Now i think that i must speak about those people who requested a refund from Steam. Yeah, If I`d hate the game after first 5 minutes, I`d returned it with no problems. But the thing is I liked that short story, I completed it from start to end. It feels not moral just take it and give it back. I used the product and I`m cool with that. Also if I`d been paid about 5 pound, then I wouldn`t have any negative feelings towards it.  Overall score. If you have the money and it`s not a problem, buy it. But be warned. The fun lasts only 5-6 hours. It`s a nice short evening story before the bedtime.  Thanks for reading.",

The voice acting was top notch, its just that the story and dialog sucks. It was written for middleage men whom has never had a GF by a middleage romantic woman who has never been in a relationship.

From the moment they first met to the end, you can here the tone of the conversation changes as they bond throughtout the game, it felt natural. All the characters including Ned have their own past that they're trying to forget and avoid but the reality is, that it'll catch up to them in time and they would have to face it eventually. Rich Sommer and Cissy Jones really did an amazing voiceover work in this game.  I was really into the story/mystery part of the game. It kept me engaged throughout my gameplay of it. Which not all video game nowadays does it for me, and I appreciate this so much.  Yes, can't deny that there's a lot of walking in the game. It's not an open world as you would like it to be sometimes. There's definitely exploration you can do by yourself in your time without the game forcing you to progress forward. Sometimes I just feel like they cut some of the dialogue out or change the story of the game throughout the development process.  Like most people, I really do wish it was longer. After finished with the game, it left me wanting more of it. I want more Henry, more Delilah, more Firewatch. With only few people working on this game, I'd say Campo Santo really did an excellent work on this as their debut title. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I enjoy every second of it. I really do love the atmosphere and the sense of solitude being in the woods and mountains. Really looking forward to see what's their next project going to be. Congrats!",

You only get out of the story what you put into it, so if you just wish to coast through the game don't expect to get too attached to either the story or the characters. In contrast the more you explore the National Forest an interact with the wilderness around you the more story you uncover and better understand the characters. Despite the strong story however it is a little on the short side. You could probably blast through the game in little under 4 hours if you put your mind to it.

Don't go in expecting a traditional survival/horror game, and instead anticipate beautiful scenery, witty dialogue, interesting characters and an overall enjoyable 3.5 - 5 hours. I'm glad I played it, but am a bit disappointed I had to pay $20 for the experience.   SPOILERS BELOW  The game suffers significantly in its final act; it ultimately felt as if the creators had too many balls in the air and dropped 90% of them. That said, some of what they achieved and their unique take on the genre is definitely worth a play-through. The design is beautifully done, evoking a sense of paranoia and slipping sanity that hinges on the unreliable narrator. You can't trust yourself, and that's really interestingly done here.  Was it a let down? Yeah. I'm not sure what I wanted to happen but I know I wanted it to have more meaning, more impact, something. I want to know what the burned down cabin was, why there were bears, why would he have faked an entire research site? Ned's actions don't make sense within the story, and it's waved away with the explanation of PTSD. I wanted to meet Delilah, to know more about my wife, to run across other people or have a chance to explore different cave systems. I think a collectible system would have improved the game significantly- a reason to explore the wilderness would have been fantastic, and could have fleshed out the bare bones world. The game has the illusion of choice, but very little reason to venture off the strictly set path.   There may be some value in a replay- different choices, different dialogue options- but without significant reworking or the release of new content, the ending would feel the same way. I wish this game had lived up to its promise.",

He is sometimes in dangerous moment, at night, wire is cut etc. Adventures in this game and quests are really awsome. It is impossible to get bored  I almost cried how Henry was talking to Delilah. You can easily hear that he misses her. Sometimes there are jokes but mostly you can hear a miss in his voice.

Seriously, just take a look at some screenshots. You could take a picture of nearly anything in this game and it would look BEAUTIFUL. The soundtrack is very mellow and fits with the tone of the game very well. Sound design is amazing. It just really feels like you are out there in the Shoshone as Henry.  Gameplay would be a hit and miss for some people. If you are looking for amazing mechanics, you'll be out of luck. It would fall under the semi-new 'Walking-Simulator' genre. But it is more than that. The game has you navigate the terrain with a map and a compass and that's it. There is an option to turn off the map indicator for Henry which would leave you only able to know where you are based on natural landmarks. I left it on mostly because I didn't know of the option before reading about it later, but that seems like the best way to play the game.  Also the game is pretty short. I got through it in 4 hours.

Maybe it's because I walked in expecting the ending to be abysmal, but it's really not all that bad. I'll admit - it could have been better.

The same could be said of American Psycho, Inception, The Thing, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but they're all still great films.

A dialogue-driven adventure game between a lonely man and his female instructor set in the Wyoming wilderness.  Natural beauty abounds as various mysteries pop up and the story becomes more complex.  Between 4-6 hours of gameplay on average make this more of a short story than a novel,  but it's a game I won't forget soon.  Overall, there are almost no jumpscares in this game, save for hl2 hunter-esque noises and damn racoons.

            "review_text": "*An explanation of the ending without spoilers.*  Now I’m not one to usually write a review about one, but seeing how this game has gotten so much hate because many felt as though the ending was abrupt or lazy. In the next paragraph I hope to explain that in my opinion of why people disliked the ending, and how that resulted in so much hate towards the game.  I want to first start off saying that it can’t be denied that the developers at Campo Santo made a beautiful game which you can’t deny even if you think the ending sucked for Firewatch. Now onto why I think many people thought the ending sucked. From the first day Henry showed up at the Shoshone National Forest in the Wyoming wilderness for the firewatcher job, he was asked an bizarre question by his supervisor Delilah, which was “What are you escaping from”. Now to keep it spoil free I won’t mention why, but through the next day’s Henry will start to get more bizarre questions that he will both ask himself and Delilah. Now throughout the game there starts to become this one big problem that Henry and Delilah are trying to solve, this problem has you guessing, and questioning so much. This problem is what I think was the cause to many hating the ending, because throughout the game the as you’re getting closer to solving this problem, the rising action increases ever more, until you reach the climax, which is the answer to that problem. Now during that rising action there becomes many speculations on what this problem is which leads to the player overthinking it and becoming frustrated when it wasn’t what they hoped it would be. The same can be said about the ending where things didn’t go the way players wanted it to go, but to think that certain events would play out in the way you hoped were not possible. Because if you remember what I mentioned about day one, that this place was an escape for Henry, that he was carrying weight from his place back home, and that while he was here in Shoshone National Forest he could feel free, but once he leaves he has to return to the world he once left. Now some of this might not make sense since you haven’t played it, but I’m telling it this way so I don’t spoil it for you.  Now I hope I was able to convince you that Firewatch is a great game, that should not be rejected because some players felt it didn’t go the way they wanted to and that Campo Santo has given us a masterpiece for only a mere $20, while many AAA developers out there charge us $60 for something they can’t even deliver on now a days.

It's been weeks since I've finished it and I still think about it - like a great book, or a great movie, it keeps on living in my imagination.  A great story doesn't have to be complex, and this is a good example. As a Park Ranger, you move in for a quiet summer in harmony with nature. The only nuisance could be your supervisor that you regularly get over the radio but what could go bad? Worst case scenario, a fire starts and you'll have to call for help and let the pros do their job. But more is to come...  One of the best things about Firewatch is that it is relatively short. Making it longer wouldn't have made any sense and would have broken the magic of walking around the beautiful map of Firewatch. It's simple but realistic. The athmosphere is near perfect, subtle and smart. This game isn't about quantity anyway, it's about quality.  Wonderful game. If only they were more like this.",

However, it seems that a lot of people expected or think they are entitled to something other than what the game delivered. Granted, it is a short title, and the climax of the story could've been woven a little bit tighter, but for an indie developer I have to applaud the finely polished work they do deliver. Don't play this game expecting it to be the end all of videogame for all eternity. Play it for being just a good short story from a small developer who deserves some support to bring more projects into this world.

The price tag is absolutely rediculous for a game with only 3 hours of content. It really depends on how fast you can beat it but here's what I think (no spoilers)  Pros- Story- The game starts off with a sort of choose your own back story, having the option of changing some dialouge later in the game but not really that big of an impact. The only other person you talk to is Delilah, (female character voice in trailer) and you start to really see the isolation get to them. The game gets into a very psychological view of things and the mystery that drives along with the story adds to it. I personally really enjoyed the voice acting and the plot that I encountered. I was expecting a compeltely different ending than what I got. Map/Graphics- The map is a bit annoying as it constantly has you going through areas you already have, but the map changes a bit as the story goes on so it's not always the same. For graphics, gorgeous. Each 'level' is at a different time of day, and with that comes different views to be seen. I pesronally really enjoyed the graphics and just the overal atmosphere that the graphics created.  Gameplay- This game is classified as a 'walking simulator,' but it really doesn't feel like it due to always being able to talk about things to delilah. And abviously theres not much walking as the game only has 3 hours of content. The animations feel smooth, and again the voice acting was perfect which made my character feel a lot more alive. I really felt the emotions and the feelings that the main character (us) are going through.  Cons- Price tag/bugs- I personally didn't encoutner any bugs so I can't really talk about that, but the devs were quick to start shooting out patches so I think thats all been sorted out. (they even added a restart day button in case you want to change something). For the price, I DO NOT agree with it at all. 7ish dollars seems a lot more reasonable to me as 20 is compeltely rediculous for such a short game. Yes the amount of time the voice actors had to put into it does make sense, but I would be looking for more content to go along with it.   Over all I really enjoyed the game despite feeling a little bit ripped off with the price tag. Personally you HAVE to pick this game up once it goes on sale, it's a really fun experience. I'd say a 7/10, taking 3 off because of the price, besides that I really enjoyed this.",

            "review_text": "FireWatch really is an interactive story. Everything about this game is beautifully written and it is very grounded in a realistic story. The reason for the negative reviews is beacuse the story is hard to convey when you can't put it in words. The story is subtle and filled with small details that really help build the mystery behind it as you go along. It should be noted that you actually have to explore and look around to get everything despite it being a relatively linear game, which in my opinion, helps naturally pad out the game. I played it with a friend and it made the game a lot more interesting with two different people making decisions and thinking of new theories as the game runs its course. A lot of negative reviews think all the tension is dropped at the end and this is true but thats what the game is trying to do. A theme of the game is the characters oer analyzing things as more of the plot is revieled and more questions arrive. The payoff is meant to be a little less then what you expected because you are listening to these people who are on edge and paranoid, making up outlandish theories. The game is doing its job because you begin to believe in these theories and believe in Henry and Delilah. As for the ending, its easy to see that Delilah is selfish simply from details in game besides it flat-out telling you at one point. So her actions at the end aren't really deviating from her character at all. Although im sure people wanted this game to end happily with the love story being all tied up it just wasn't what the story was meant to be. I like the game more because of this, it feels very human and maybe even close to home for some others because of its lack of closure. Can't wait for a book or a sequel.... ;P    ",

The production value of the entire game is a patchwork of great and poor in all facets, including art, script, design, and sound.

Was it done deliberately to indicate that the game contains a deeper riddle to be solved, touching on the nature of the human condition? OR did a character place it there carelessly, just like you, I and everyone else does. Look at your shelf; is everything arranged carefully and in the same direction? Or like me, does your bookshelf have a pile of Robert Jordan paperbacks stacked haphazardly between your neatly arranged ADnD modules and your books for homebrewing and mushroom hunting?  This is a game that explores a very emotional and traumatic time in a person's life. I'm going to guess that it's easier to get sucked into this if you're married and/or have kids but that is NOT a prerequisite. It is a game about coping with loss (or NOT coping, if that's how you decide to play it), paranoia, investigation, being able to just enjoy something pretty and handling your emotions.

There are also some legitimately scary moments in this game that gave me worse feelings of unease and fright than your typical horror game does. I mean, seriously, is anyone still scared of zombies or otherworldly possessions from space? You know what did scare me? Raccoon Carter. But you know what scared me worse? Finding an abandoned kid's backpack.  ... I just... Look, there are lots of reasons to buy this game but only one not to; if you're looking to shoot the bad guys and jump from a burning building onto a plane which is going to crash moments later, go play Uncharted, I think I saw it on sale. If you're open to a game which plays on much more realistic fears and aren't looking for a bit of escapism, buy this game. If you want charcters you can actually relate to, buy this game. Buy this game because everyone either was, or knows a kid who was too nerdy for his own good but couldn't be anything else. Buy this game if you want to explore what happens when an otherwise perfect life gets dealt a blow it can't seem to recover from.",

            "review_text": "I rate the game Firewatch 4/5. Good, but not a masterpiece.  This is a good first person perspective suspense-thriller personal drama story. Though very linear and relatively short, this was still interesting and humorous enough that I played it through 3 times (mostly to ascertain how much (or how little) freedom this game actually gives you). Ultimately, Firewatch is more of a mildly interactive story than an actual game. Indeed, there are places in the story where this 'game' almost seems to play itself out and there are no choices you can make which have any great, ultimate effect on what happens in this game or on how it ends. You, the player, are essentially just along for the ride. It's an interesting (and at times, extremely tense) ride though.  The good: +Good Graphics throughout, especially outdoors (which is where most of this game takes place. This game has a nice, well thought out cartoony, graphic novel style. One may think this graphical style would be enough to keep the game feeling humorous throughout but surprisingly this game depicts some increasingly tense and suspenseful situations. There are wonderful graphical flourishes throughout and a great attention to detail. Also, when you look down you can see your character's body, unlike many other games. Your character's hands do look a bit too pudgy and odd though.  +Great sound. Perhaps perfect sound actually. The sounds are realistic and excellently detailed. Crickets chirp and birds sing and bushes rattle mysteriously while strange metallic tinkling can barely be heard in the exact places where you should hear it. Every sound is meaningful and intentional. The sounds are vitally important to creating the tense atmosphere of this game and succeed brilliantly. The music works well to increase tension even further but wouldn't make a great soundtrack in itself. Voice acting is outstanding throughout and the script writing is excellent as well with many witty exchanges and jokes.  +The game controls well (it feels like you are playing as an out-of-shape but muscular guy which is exactly what your character is) and the controls mapped very well (and very easily) to my keyboard and mouse using the control settings menu. The controls are also fairly simple making this an ideal game to use if you want to learn how to play a first person perspective game and are uncertain as to how such game's should be controlled or are not yet very good at it. It is a bit odd though that you can make your out-of-shape character sprint around (including up hills) as much as you want to. It was also a bit overly difficult to figure out how to operate the radio and select dialogue choices (Odd considering what a vitally important element of gameplay this is) but I got used to it.  +The environment is big but not so big that things get boring if you enjoy being in the real-life great outdoors. It is big enough to get lost in but small enough that you can easily find your way back again. The environment feels like a fairly realistic outdoor area as well (especially if you were in some sort of state park). It is a bit grandiose for a mere national forest but that's a minor issue which is easy to overlook.  The Mediocre: +/-This game could have had better pacing. I sometimes felt as though the game was trying to hurry me along through its plot. I particularly wanted there to be more peaceful moments wherein I was not encouraged to hurry but instead encouraged to explore for the sake of exploring. There's lots to see and have your character respond over the radio about but mostly you are busy with some more pressing matter (like trying to make sure someone doesn't set the forest on fire). There's no actual time limit on completing objectives (perhaps there should have been though) but wandering idly along looking at every little thing that catches your interest while someone or other is setting off fireworks in a high-danger fire area seems really strange, particularly after your boss has just told you to hurry (but doing just that kind of thing what you must do in order to get the most character and plot development out of the dialogue in this game's story. The game does give you an opportunity to go exploring on your own before the plot fully winds up but it doesn't seem like its encouraging you to do so at that point.  The Bad: -It's almost impossible to figure out just how nasty or sarcastic your character is going to be before you select a dialogue choice (if I wanted the character to say anything at all). This encouraged me to want to play through the game again and again in a very frustrating way because, after the game was done the first time, I had yet to really see what would happen if I had responded in a way I wanted to. I had responded to several plot-critical situations with sarcasm or with nasty remarks wholly on ACCIDENT because the game won't tell you whether you are about to say something sarcastic or nasty. It only gives you the first few words of what you might say and nothing more. It's hard to choose one dialogue option over another based just off of that. All Dialogue options should have been labeled with easy to understand emotional labels such as 'sarcasm' or 'angry' or 'depressed' and so forth to give the player a heads-up on what they are about to make the character say before they let the character say it. The dialogue systems in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and in Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 are head and shoulders above the one which this game is built around.  -Regardless of what you say or don't say and regardless of whether you have your character respond at all (even to direct questions being repeatedly screamed at you), the same basic plot occurs and the same basic situations happen each time you play. This game is very linear and (sometimes as sheer luck would apparently have it) nothing you say or do really makes much permanent difference to how the plot develops. This is totally unrealistic. If I refuse to talk to anyone at all, there will be ramifications. If I act insulting on a constant basis, other ramifications will ensue. But in Firewatch? The same thing happens each time. Some of the same dialogue will be spoken NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY OR DO. Your relationship with the main character will seem different to you but that does not change whether or not the forest burns down and nothing you say or do can change whether or not you prevent it. After playing the game 3 times in a row this inability to affect the game world in any meaningful way left me with a feeling of mild frustration. This game should have been more like a choose-your-own adventure story with multiple different endings. Instead it's like a normal suspense-thriller novel. It's fun the first one or two times but it wears thin far too quickly.   -I could more easily accept the fact that this is a relatively short game if it had a plethora of potential endings but it doesn't. It has just two endings and they both seem a bit anti-climactic.Despite it's flaws though, I'm still glad I played it once, twice, even thrice (to see and hear everything the game has go offer) but I will not play it a fourth time. Now that I really have seen 90% of what this game has to offer, playing it yet again would just be repetitious and boring.",

We have a lot of interactive objects and lots of cache boxes which we barely use. Areas are too empty and lack of wildlife is disturbing. But unfortunately nearly all bad sides of this game exist solely because of a budget constrains.  But in this 5 hours you will become a part of a great little story about a simple man and a woman who are hiding from or battle their demons while keeping (unsuccessfully mind you) Wyoming from forest fires. It's presented to you through the brilliant voices of Henry (Rich Sommer) and Delilah (Cissy Jones). Their voice acting is amazingly fluid, natural and organic. Sometimes you actually feel like a part of their conversation but at the same time as a amazed listener. It would've made a great radio show, just this two talking.  Overall story is solid up until the end. The ending certainly is anticlimactic but at the same time it fits the story, developers wanted to tell us. Much like our heroes we've been tricked into thinking some events have more meaning than they really do. Maybe we should take a step back and take this piece of art for what it really is.

I found the voice acting was very well done and the game looked great in the Unity engine, the music and effects were realistic too creating a good atmosphere that has you looking back hoping that nothing is following you.

This game should have been at least 15-20 hours long yet we got only about 5 hours. Granted you never used sprint button, a feature literally made to make you finish the game faster. We have a lot of interactive objects and lots of cache boxes which we barely use. Areas are too empty and lack of wildlife is disturbing. But unfortunately nearly all bad sides of this game exist solely because of a budget constrains.  But in this 5 hours you will become a part of a great little story about a simple man and a woman who are hiding from or battle their demons while keeping (unsuccessfully mind you) Wyoming from forest fires. It's presented to you through the brilliant voices of Henry (Rich Sommer) and Delilah (Cissy Jones). Their voice acting is amazingly fluid, natural and organic. Sometimes you actually feel like a part of their conversation but at the same time as a amazed listener. It would've made a great radio show, just this two talking.  Overall story is solid up until the end. The ending certainly is anticlimactic but at the same time it fits the story, developers wanted to tell us. Much like our heroes we've been tricked into thinking some events have more meaning than they really do. Maybe we should take a step back and take this piece of art for what it really is.  Pros: - Voice acting - Unity engine never looked better and more stylish. - Music - Dialogues  Cons: - Short gameplay time (due budget) - Underdeveloped characters (we have very little idea about who this people were before) - Lack of interaction and actual gameplay (due budget)  Overall: 7.5/10 Solid, beautifully crafted work.",

I don't write reviews very often, and I am going to preface with this, this game IS AN INTERACTIVE MOVIE. I pay $10-12 for movie tickets around here, so $17 for an interactive movie was worth it to me, but this is all subjective. I also am a total softy who gets very into stories so if you're not a person who cares much or finds yourself attatched to characters easily, just SKIP NOW!   The game puts you in the shoes of Hank/Henry, a man who's wife was diagnosed with early onset dementia. You attempt to work through it, take care of her, but the burden becomes too much. Her family steps in to begin taking care of her, distraught, and confused, you notice an ad for a job. You take it. This job is a Firewatcher.  The game throws you in already with your heart strings tugged on, and greets you with the beautiful wilderness. The game is all performed in a first person perspective, full body for maximum immersion. You look down, you got legs. You're greeted over the radio by your boss Delilah, who you end up forming quite the emotional bond with. You will laugh, you might cry, you'll feel the tugs a normal relationship comes with, including possibly upsetting her and causing her to step away for a few. As the game goes on Delilah notices fireworks being shot off, the park on a fire watch this is obviously a big no-no. She sends Hank to check it out, and the game progresses from there. Things get weirder, and weirder. I don't want to spoil too much as I don't believe in spoilers and think media like this needs to be experienced first hand. The game plays itself like an interactive indie thriller with AMAZING voice acting and beautiful scenery. With this preface and synposis I'll list pros-cons, please keep in mind these are all subjective and just my opinion!  Pros: + Extremely well done voice acting + Beautiful scenery, seriously, the colors, the lighting + A narrative that leaves you emotionally invested to the characters and their stories + The performance was outstanding for me, but on a 980 TI this is to be expected. + The game offers plenty of graphical and sound options. The default controls worked for me so I admit I didn't check them + A well rounded story with while a bit quick of an ending, one I found satisfying   Cons: - The game is short, it took me 3 hours pacing myself, but I was using the run key often and not enjoying the scenery as much as I could, I also skipped some trails. I do not find this an issue for the price paid but some may!  - The story at some parts felt rushed, skipping ahead a lot. But as I said, it very much feels like an indie thriller - I found there to be some lacking moments that could have been filled with more dialogue - It is hard to completely get attatched characters outside of Delilah, I felt underwhelmed or just uninformed in some instances -/+ Some people were not satisifed with the conclusion and I assume wanted a supernatural or more horrific ending. Perhaps some more interaction or choices that meant much, this isn't really a CON.. but I thought I'd put it here    I am sure others have many more and or better pros and cons but these are mine. For my $17 I feel like I have gotten my monies worth, I was very satisfied and enjoyed the experience. For others it may be best to wait for this to go on sale, for myself who loves story games and wishes to see more interactive narratives I do not mind paying the full price to support developers and encourage more!",

The story and the interaction with Delihla is also fantastically fitting as the story progresses, you have really obvious responses, awkward responses, and really off-putting responses that can chage your actual interaction with the game as well as the progression.  The game unravels beautifully and I'm very glad that I made the purchase. I paid $15, would have paid $15 and even paid $20. Would buy again.",

            "review_text": "Oh Firewatch how I had such high hopes for you. There are spoilers in this review so beware.  Firewatch definitely had some good things about it, but the bad outweighed the good.  Pros: - Gorgeous settings and art style. Every time I traveled to a new area of the map I was amazed by the beauty. The colors were great. I felt like I was there. - Excellent dialogue between the main characters. It felt natural and not really scripted. The voice acting plus the words spoken made for a superb combination that flowed nicely.   Cons: - The length was dreadful. I don't mind short games, but holy hell. I finished it in almost 5 hours, and I was going slowly I think. Midway through I felt the story wrapping up and I didn't want it to end abruptly. - That ending man, ugh. Everything that was interesting about the story just fell apart. How you do mess that up? By connecting all of these events with this one guy who was only mentioned in passing throughout the whole game. Then there is a fire and everyone goes home. Seriously? I understand that a big part of the story was running from your problems only to in the end have to face them and blah blah, but come on don't tease your players with gold and hand us crap. - The entire beginning segment was dreadful. It was a series of conversations with some choices here and there that really don't matter that much. You could at least give us a basic comic strip or something to work with. I can't emotionally connect to words spoken by characters I don't know. - The illusion of choice really bothered me. Pick a side! Either commit to player choice with ones that actually AFFECT the story or give you options for a different ending, or remove the choice element all together and allow me to experience who this man is with a solid story driven game. You get all these choices in the beginning and through your conversations with Delilah, and nothing to show for them. It's annoying. - The game is way too linear. You are given lush environments, beautiful landscape, and the works. But, it's a lie. You really can't drift far away from the set paths the map gives you. - Not enough of an incentive to replay. Give me hidden items, extra SOMETHING to work with. The only thing that I'll get with a second playthrough is oh I can choose this meaningless option that changes nothing in the game.  I bought this on sale, and I still overpaid. There are two kind of jump scares in this game. There is a part where you find this clipboard, and shortly afterward you get a strike to the head. The second is a missable one during a second trip to the abandoned cabin in that oven.",

Does it actually make you feel like you're hiking and exploring the wilderness? Well... for the most part yes. But is it a good GAME? ...Not really.  Pros: -THE WRITING. This is probably the best writing in a game I've ever seen, beating out most movies. It does such a good job of making you feel the relationship Henry and Delilah as it flourishes, and the way that it just hit every single emotion it possibly could was outstanding. -The Graphics. No, they're not the best in the world, but they can look very pretty at times and serves the game and it's tone well. -The Sound. From the little clicks that your radio makes to the sound of wildlife around you (even if you hardly actually see the wildlife itself) just further immerses you into the game.  And.... thats about it. That's all that's really noteworthy about this game, but boy what it does well it does WELL. Firewatch is probably the best game to play when you're tired after a long way and just want to enjoy something nice, calming and damn beautiful (in terms of the story).",

The ending on top of this felt extremely rushed and just a way to end the game because the developers got bored with the project and had to end it someway. I was extremely disappointed by that. I put a little under 4 hours into the game and I took my time to enjoy the scenery and do everything I can. At the price of $19.99 it is 100% not worth that price. When it comes down to whether a game is worth the money or not the biggest factor for me is whether I played atleast the amount of hours of the price so it comes out to about $1/hour.

            "review_text": "first of all, so hard to choose between Yay or Nay, but i don't know, i think i'll go with a No although i enjoyed the game and liked it.  Cons  You may get it wrong: I think I'm putting a negative on this, because I kinda got the game wrong or the videos and photos made me think of it wrong before the purchase. I thought this would be an open world, kinda surviving themed game, could have you play it for hundreds hours, rich in gameplay and character features, customizable and stuff. but it wasn't. it's actually like a comic book where you watch the story for at most 3 hours and then it finishes. you don't feel involved at all, it looks like nothing you do matters. Player involvement: although i stated earlier that it's just a comic book, like you're watching an animation, but again a minimum amount of involvement could be nice. you may think with yourself; Should I pick up that flash light? maybe i better pick up and keep all these files and notes i find in case i'll be needing them later, I'd better check every angle of every room for details, this place looks suspicous i'd better be careful, I need to learn the map completely so i'm not confused when necessary... NO! No No No! none matters. and ow my god this feels bad that nothing you do matters, not even the conversations you choose.  As in Conversations - this is not a spoiler just a really little detail, no worries - for example at one point, you choose how you pose for a drawing of you, later in game you look at the photo and the difference is either way you posed. I finished it one time and played through half for the second time and changed all my dialouges and options, just tiny minor changes in details. not related little details, it's like these are just put so that you think with yourself aw aw I have options cool. not really.  Pros  The Story: The story was really intense, it gets you so hard. emotional waves just drive you with themselves and these are great feelings and experiences and you're drowned in your train of thoughts, and seeing dialouge choices kinda feels weird and makes you think about your daily life and choices in conversations. The two main character voices are so delightful with funny, charming dialogues. great sense of wit. although the ending is kinda vague, not satisfying,and seems like they didn't know how to end it and just knot all the strings at once, but again in a whole, it's really good. Graphics: so beautiful, specially at early stages of the game the views, lightning, fantasy textures and the environment layout and details hits you right in the spot. you really want to look at the sunshine, the cliffs and stars at night. sometimes there's a little, soft, piano music which fits just perfect.   Overall  Well, as i said before it was hard for me to choose, since i also got the game wrong and it was a huge bummer for me, but i tried to put that out and look at it as it is, fairly, and it was a really beautiful game, but lacks a lot. I mean in it's easiest way, 20$ for a game that lasts 3 hours and has literally nothing to offer more than that is a lot. maybe they could made an animation movie out of it and not a videogame.",

Looking back on it I wonder how much of my choices really mattered, or if they changed anything. It would take another playthrough to find out. Of course minor things would have to change such as    Ned's tapes and documentation of what you say, and what the image of you would be like, and what you name the Tortoise (Bucket Jr. for me!)    Visually the game is simplistic but not to the point where it feels like laziness, though I did notice unusual clipping of moving things. Particularly of butterflies flying through rocks and a tortoise clipping into itself.    Along with you not meeting a single person and the only people you see being entirely black. In fact the entire woods seems almost entirely void of fauna, not once do I remember seeing a bird fluttering by, or even the scampering of a squirrel. Only butterflies.   The park itself is lovely and well designed, I very much enjoy the variety of settings available from the lush patches to the rocky mountaneous regions to the cave to the open grassland. It makes it all the more exciting to explore and discover.   Audio wise it's fantastic. The music does its job of inspiring awe and wonder when necessary, along with uneasiness and nervousness. Along with top notch voice acting. But, of course I can only speak for the dialogue I did hear, so there is the possibility they botched alternate dialogue I never heard. Also the sound of the environment and of animals (the few that you hear) work well.  Gameplay wise it feels reminiscent of a metroidvania in places, namely the 'You found this, now all this is available'. This would be more valuable if you could go back in time to before you have to 'put your nose to the grindstone' and really start working with these tools that you find. Also the inspect, while cute, doesn't do anything.   Along with that a great deal of the gameplay is dialogue options and I find myself wondering if any of it was worth the trouble. This is a make or break in this type of game, which can readily be seen in the recent Telltale lineup of games.    The story is well written and well paced with a great deal of suspense. I enjoy how it turns out overall, though there are some gripes I have.    There is an excessive use of red herrings and a great deal of things that are simply not explained. The fenced off area isn't explained explicitly, what happened to the girls isn't either (outside of them being attacked), along with the fact that Ned worked against himself by making himself known. Was this on purpose? Who knows? I certainly don't. And, again, I find myself wondering how much of it did I really impact? Did picking Bucket in comparison to Mayhem change that much? Did suggesting to have kids later rather than excitedly wanting kids change that much? Did anything you say to Delilah change anything at all (other than Ned's records)? Also, as a personal note, I didn't like the gap of days that were skipped. I would have preferred to complete day-to-day tasks with the option of skipping instead.    All in all, it's a good game though not quite what I was expecting from the trailer and what was built in my head. I envisioned this as a game where you play as a park ranger, looking out for things, exploring, and having day-to-day activities. This is instead a rather linear experience, but with the opportunity to go and explore on one of the earlier days it does make it interesting.",

The game is pretty enough, and the characters are quite relatable. I wish it was a bit less linear, but I guess that is the point of a story.

The art design was beautiful and the game has an amazing soundtrack. I played it on my 980Ti and was quite impressed with the scenery. However, the game is VERY short! It took 3-4 hours and every bit of it was amazing but I really didn't want this story to end. The way the game abruptly ended was a real turn off for me and I'm sure it was for most people. It felt as though they ran out of time and money and tied the knot way too early.   Pros - Extremely original - Stunning visuals - Immersive plot - Great soundtrack - Best voice acting and dialogue  Cons - VERY unfulfilling ending - $20 Price tag - Way too short  Overall  I was quite disappointed. I would not recommend this game considering the abrupt ending and extreme pricetag but I would really love to see additions to the storyline. If you can resist buying this game for now, it would be much more worth it to catch the game on sale for $5 or maybe $10 as opposed to $20. I see plenty of potential in this title and in the developers. I really wanted to love this game to death but to pay $5 an hour (literally) to play was very dissatisfying and not worth it to me.

The beginning is quite boring, but then you are hit with shock after shock. The game gets more interesting as you go on, but the climax to the story is...short.  Like you go to a fancy restaurant and order prime rib. You start eating it, it's the most amazing meal you've ever had, and the waiter takes your food away before you are finished.  It's hard to say whether it's worth $17.99. If you are looking for a game to pour hundreds of hours into, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a solid 4-8 hours of entertainment that's better than going to a movie theater, this is the game for you.",

It's about three characters who aren't willing to face large problems in their lives until a tramatic incident forces them out of the wilderness they've escaped to.   Since I turned off my location indicator on the map, I got turned around a few times. In retrospect, I noticed myself reflecting deeply on the character's situation as well as my personal one each of those times. If the story and mechanics made heavy with fast pace bells and whistles and a blockbuster ending, I couldn't have had that space. I guess if we thought of this game as music, many other games are a wall of sound, while this one emphasizes the rests.  As someone currently going through bumps like Hank (though by no means as devistating), this story might resonate stronger with me than someone who feels their ducks are in a row. Either way, I think it's worth anyone's three hours to see what impact in makes on you. Those three hours made me grow more than the three hours I spent last night on the final showdown of XCOM2.",

Excellent, believable characters with well-written dialogue, and beautiful visuals make for a game that you could spend hours on just walking around, enjoying the view, and talking on your walkie-talkie. Which is great because that about sums up the game. Walking and talking.  Shame about the story though. It builds atmosphere like it ain't no body's business, but it ends both suddenly, and disatisfactorily, utilizing none of the atmosphere it built, and the characters just seem to stop caring about each other, in sharp contrast with how they have otherwise engaged with each other so far. It almost seems like they planned at least 4 more hours of classic slasher-isolation horror, but then ran out of time or budget, and decided to write a half-♥♥♥♥♥ conclusion and rush the release.  I am pretty torn on whether or not I would recommend the game, because aside from the disappointing ending, my experience with the game has been overwhelmingly positive. I really want to recommend it, but there is just no excuse for ending the game in that manner.  Gotta say though, I do love their approach to NPC companions: A person on a radio who rarely contacts or engages with you, except when important plot points occur or else when YOU choose to contact them. You choose how much -excellently written - exposition you're willing to engage in, and you don't have to bother with some NPC running around, getting in your way and ruining your immersion with shoddy pathfinding or glitches.",

The story is very good up to the very end of the game. What really sets Firewatch apart though is the dialogue between the two main characters and is a large part of what kept me playing. The ending just kind of happens and that's the best thing I can say about it. I understand what's it supposed to represent and after playing you understand where the main character is coming from, but it's still a letdown after the amazing experience leading up to it.   The biggest detriment to the game that I can come up with is the length with the ending following close behind.   With that being said, I would still highly recommend playing the game for the environment, story and most importantly the dialogue. Just don't expect it to be a long ride and take the ending for what's it's really meant for and you'll enjoy Firewatch just fine.   +Environment +Storyline ++Dialogue  -Length -Ending",

Storyline is on rails, as many do say - no multiple choices and what you say doesn't affect anything; but you don't even get any choice in the books, although you read them and you like them :) The ending which many people find disappointing looks quite OK to me.

As a game that goes for a price tag of $20 USD its playtime is limited if you don't explore, and even with the exploration, there's a limit to what you can pull from the game, which tends to be in the 2-4 hour areas, which you may think won't be worth your time, and you'd be right if you were into games that are full of action and are for the mechanics rather than story, as most games tend to be now. However, as a story telling game, Firewatch really does shine, it takes you through a different type of story, with a more realistic end considering what you endure, without going into any details. That's where I've seen the most complaints, in the ending, but as the game's story is simply about people, the ending is rather fitting for the adventure, you get to make up for yourself what you want this game to be. You're in control, even if it feels as though you're not, it's worth the price tag, and I would happily buy this for a friend.",

            "review_text": "Firewatch is probably the best of the 'Walking Simulator' genre I've played yet. While there is a mystery plot that provides some set dressing, the real meat of the story is about two characters who have found themselves at a turning point in their lives, and deciding which direction to go. Each is informed by the events they experience in the woods of Wyoming.  Unlike a lot of scary, tension-filled games, Firewatch digs directly at real-life fears. Running from zombies or hiding from space monsters can be tense and scary in the moment, but the characters in Firewatch are coping with real problems that may yet strike me or my loved ones. At its core, the game asks 'what would you do?' in a somber and direct way that makes you wonder what your values really are.  Firewatch isn't targeted at hardcore gamers, or casual gamers, or even any audience we would normally thing of as a market. It is targeted at people who have reached the stage in life where the thought of something happening to your spouse or life partner is far scarier than the thought of it happening to you. It isn't a story about the people struck by tragedy, but about the people around them, who have to cope with the aftermath.  If you're in that category; if the most frightening thought in your life is having to find a way to go on after your happily-ever-after has been brought low by disease or disaster, pick up Firewatch at any price. It will be an experience you might not necessarily enjoy, but you'll appreciate. If not, give it a miss; if you just come for mystery and adventure, you're likely to be disappointed.",

I don't really mind how it ended, but there was so much build up and then all of a sudden, 'there coming to get us' and done.  The game however kept me entertained. I absolutely couldn't wait to continue each day. If you're a big gamer and have the time to pull our several hours in a shot, you're probably going to finish this in one sitting. The game play was smooth, the graphics and colors were spot on beautiful. The story-line kept me wondering what was going to happen next.  If you're looking for an action game, this isn't it. This is about suspense... what's going to happen next. I imagine it's what it may actually feel like being stuck out in the middle of nowhere.

            "review_text": "If Steam had a middle option for reccomendations, this is where my review would be, but as it stands I give Firewatch a Yes with a big ol' asterisk.  POS  Firewatch's visuals range from serene woodsy vistas to gorgeous pinkish sunsets.  The dialogue between Henry and Delilah is well written and acted well.  Latter half of the game is tense but not overbearingly so.  The presentation lends itself cutting out some fat, e.g. instead of you walking back to your watchtower, that game hard cuts to to the next day.  Afet you finish the game, you can get real life prints of photos you took with a disposable camera you find. Neat!  NEG  As you have read from literally every other review, the ending is lackluster. To explain why would spoil the events, but the jist of it is that the mystery that takes up most of the game does not resolve in a very satisfactory way, which some people are very unhappy about. Personally, I found it lackluster, but I didn't hate it. I understood the point, I just wish it was executed better. To end the way it did was unsatisfying - which may be the point? - but that doesn't make it good. Part of the problem may be the pacing. The game jumps rather quickly from Henry just chilling out doing his job to BIG MYSTERY in way that makes the way it slowly turns into the ending section jarring. My two cents, but I feel the game would benefit from being bigger, let the player get more into the feeling of being Henry out in the woods (mostly) alone. More menial tasks like yelling at the teenagers in the beginning. Actually observing and reporting potential fires. Warning some campers about their smoking. Firewatch suffers from its linearity because, like an unfortunate amount ofd the story based games, it doesn't benefit from being a game. Firewatch as a movie or short tv series or a book would have been the same experience. That said, it didn't ruin the experience for me, and I certainly won't be seeking a refund for a game I played to completion.  Some graphical and technical issues, nothing major.  Sometimes you are met with what the characters describe as an impasse but in a way that only makes sense in the context of the game's controls. Henry could easily finagle his way past that downed bridge. And, most egregiously, the concept of CLIMBING a fence is never brought up. It breaks immersion when what the characters percieve and what the player percieves are not in line and in fact conflict.  Again with the really bad portrayal of teenagers. Yeah, real life teenagers talk weird and are jerks, etc etc. But with how well written and acted Henry and Delilah are, it is very out of place for the two teenage girls to be the standard cliche Teen Slang and Not Caring About Mean Adults!  I wish I could have kept that radio past the first day. That ♥♥♥♥ was my JAM.  TL;DR  4 outta 5 I say play this game, or at the very least watch someone else play it. Definitely think about it if it goes on sale. I don't regret my 20 bucks on it. I really enjoyed 3 out of the 4 hours I played, and was only moderately displeased with the other 1.",

As you walk around doing to story you sometimes stop and look in awe of how awesome the scenery is. Thankfully they give you a camera to take pictures with and you can even get them devolped. The graphics had me in complete facination the entire playthrough.  2. Immersiveness  In most games, you can find some pretty lack luster voice acting. This game was not one of those. The main Characters, Delilah and Henry, talk like real adults who are having a time, running from something, and even showing some signs of romance. They talk like people, not actors. They showed emotions and were the backbone of this game. keeping it correct and interesting as you walked around aimlessly.   3. Story  The 'mystery' started off really strong with much to look forward to. it had and oppertunity to do so much more but they didnt which confused me. from about half-way forward it started to feel stressed and terribly put together which had me confused and a bit let down while I played this game.   4. Verdict. This game is essently a glorified walking simulator with so much potential but a lack luster story that ruined the game towards the end.",

The graphics is my opinion high end for an indie game but cannot match AAA titles. Anybody who expects beautiful depictions of wilderness, open world and realistic graphics will be disappointed. The graphics is nice looking but with cartoon shaders and not very realistic. The game itself is an interactive story with lots of conversations and some mystery. It is best described, in my point of view, as a serious short novel turned into a video game. It is essentially about people who somehow got stuck and need to find a way to get on and find a new life. If you like the idea of putting such a plot in a video game, you might like this game.   If on the other hand you expect a large open world wilderness game with survival elements, as for example a totally misleading review at Arstechnica has suggested (which is why I bought the game in the first place), you will get none of this and will be disappointed. The wilderness is only a setting for the story that unfolds in the conversations with Delilah and by some things that occasionally happen. The game is also relatively short, around 5-6 hours of gameplay maximum.  Back to the story: The beginning is kind of horrible and there is some annoying psycho-babble later in the game, too, but overall I found the story interesting and well-executed. There is also some mystery and suspense in it. So I recommend the game although it's not the kind of game I'd usually like to play. It's worthwile and serious entertainment.",

The story is what it is; you can make choices about how you respond to it as it unfolds, but it's not a choose-your-own adventure with branching paths and multiple endings. I loved the story and felt the ending was very apt. Obviously some people feel differently, that's bound to happen with this type of game in the same way it does with any fixed narrative like a movie or book.  OK, now for my actual review: I was transported by this game and immersed right from the start. It's very well written, the dialogue felt authentic and the voice acting was excellent. The environment is stunningly beautiful and has wonderful ambiance, I could (and did and will) walk around in it for hours and hours. I felt that the story was powerful, moving and the ending was entirely appropriate.  Some have commented that they didn't feel the various elements of the story (particularly Henry's backstory and the events of the summer) had any real thematic connection, but I have to disagree. Without giving too much away, I thought there was a strong theme of loss and guilt tying everything together. It felt very genuine and human - mistakes you've made, time you can't get back.  This game has made a real impression on me in the way that certain special movies and books do, it invokes such a strong sense of place, time and feeling that it comes together as a whole transportive experience. I'm sure I'll come back to visit again and again.",

It's a beautiful, suspenseful mystery game that twists at your heart as it tells a story about fidelity, trust, the wilderness, and early-onset dementia. I played through it in two sittings, in about the same amount of time it takes me to read a good book. I highly recommend it.  Four things to note, no spoilers:  1) The pictures you take with the camera you find can be retrieved later after the game. You don't need to use the camera to collect evidence; you just use it to remember your run after it's over.   2) My favorite feature of the game was the radio control. You can only speak to your boss, who is the only other character in the game you ever interact with, by holding down the left Shift key and scrolling with the mouse, just as if you were holding down a button on a two-way radio.  3) You control how your relationship with your boss, Delilah, develops based on what you say to her and if you choose to talk to her or not. I suspect that players can work out a few different endings based on which conversation tracks you choose, or if you choose not to say things.  4) You only have so much time to respond to Delilah - and the amount of time you have changes depending on how sensitive the subject you're broaching is. If your hands are busy when you're rappelling or holding your map and compass at the same time, you'd better not ALSO be trying to have a serious conversation, or else you'll miss stuff.",

(eventhough you should take your time in this game)    Out of 80 possible days to work with, they skip around to show only about 5 days, I felt that if they used some more days then they could have developed a deeper mystery or added more. There is no real attachment to solve this mystery until you get to the last two days.

I believe that it accomplishes this extremely well. It explains to us who these characters are and gives us a good idea of their history and motivations with very little exposition. You feel like you're learning about them in real-time. I had to finish it in a single sitting because the intrigue kept me going through the entire experience.  The best way I can sum it up is that it plays like an episode of 'The X-Files'. The mystery surrounding the characters is what fueled the whole experience.

Very little actually happens in the game - you engage with only a couple of people, and the rest is lonely wandering through a forest.  It's basically a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' with stunning graphics and sound, but without the alternative endings. I tried playing through the game several different ways, choosing different combinations of responses, skipping responses altogether - no matter how I played it, the same variables popped up, and the same storyline continued on down the road, in spite of my efforts to stray from the path (pun intended).  If choosing different responses turned your character into a different person and resulted in a different story line playing out, then I would absolutely love this game, but because it's pretty much the same outcome regardless of how you play it, I just like it.  Will I buy future games like this? From the same producers? Probably.

            "review_text": "My take on the first game by developer 'Campo Santo'   Since its initial announcement, I have been pretty stoked about giving 'Firewatch' a try. And that is not because of the impressive developer cast behind the game, but because of the idea. After finally getting the chance to step into the hiking shoes of Henry, I was instantaneously blown away by the visuals. The way the Unity Engine is used to simulate the wilderness is something to behold. But don't let the beautiful cartoony exterior of the game fool you! Underneath it you will find well tuned gaming mechanics, which allow you to traverse the Wyoming wildes with ease. So far from a visual and navigational standpoint 'Firewatch' is solid, but what about the story?   The beginning sets a special tone that does not slowly ease you into the life of our protagonist, but on the contrary - it throws you in! While you are still trying to assimilate the predicament Henry is in, you find yourself atop of a watchtower in the middle of nowhere. As the player and the hero take in their new surroundings, the immersion intensifies itself by giving Henry a handheld radio with a voice on the other side - your supervisor Delilah. At this point you learn that not only does she speak, but your character does as well. This initial moment sets up the stage for the upcoming performance by the protagonist and the disembodied voice, as they try to protect the the wilderness from forest fires. This is immersive, because of the incredible voice acting by both actors portraying Henry and Delilah! During their talks the player controls the direction these conversations take and so he shapes Henrys personality, thus turning the player into his own version of the protagonist!   The developers at 'Campo Santo' have fused movement and storytelling mechanics with the visuals excellently, allowing for an immersive and emotional adventure, where you become your own unique Henry, while also forging a unique relationship with Delilah! Sadly we reach the ending quite abruptly, leaving us unsatisfied with the length and the conclusion to the story!   This is a game that is all about the journey, not the destination! I suggest playing the game more than once, so you can experience different conversations between Henry and Delilah as you make your way through the Wyoming wilderness. During my second playthrough I found new and exciting areas I had missed, and managed to develop an interesting new relationship between our heroes.  In conclusion - I give 'Firewatch' a very high recommendation for all fans of interactive storytelling games (or oldschool fans of the choose your own adventure books, like me).",

I really like these kinds of interactive-narrative games, and I have played quite a number of them in the past few years. Firewatch is a title that is definitley a little more interactive than some of the more popular titles such as Dear Esher and mabye even Gone Home, but as beautiful as those games are I feel that Firewatch accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and may appeal to a broader audience within that genre. How you take that experience in hits home more than just an interpretation of what did or didn't happen in the story; but instead has greater potential to affect you on an emotional level, and the decisions you make can perhaps allow you to observe your own life through it's lens. I would even argue that this interactive narrative, actually interacts with YOU the player.  Talking about the more tangible features of the Firewatch;  The pacing of the story is brisk with a number of fresh and concise plot turns here and there. The game also lets you play around a bit in it's world, and take it in at your own pace. You can observe the enviornment and whats in it, or consult your Delilah over the radio if you want more advice, insight, and story. It's up to you, and this makes it easier to craft a very unique interactive experience. There's crisp humor, some mystery, and even the feeling of inherent spookiness that just sort of comes with being isolated in the woods. That maybe you yourself are always being watched, an ironic spin on the game's title.  You come into this story knowing alot about your character from the start, and I feel that this allows the you to focus on how he might be thinking at this very moment, instead of being concerned with his past. Because of this, I feel that the intent of the developer was to set up the decisions you make to have more emotional weight to them for you, the player. Additonally, The external world itself changes as the game goes on, which I felt to be sort of a figurative display of how the characters are feeling internally, and how you might be too.   At any rate I'd highly reccomend picking this one up. It's price tag is more than reasonable considering the amount of work that went into it.",

The narrative really relies on making a connection with Delilah, the only other contact you have other than yourself. If you get this game, beware. It will tug at your heartstrings and make you feel truly alone. I'd give this game a 8/10 if I had to rate it, just because the ending felt a little lackluster, and how the game felt a tad bit shorter than I would have liked it.

While my time played says two hours, it's probably closer to three hours give or take, but I finished it in that time anyway.  Gameplay wise, it's a first person, naritive focused walking simulator. There is still plenty gameplay to be had here with different means of traversing the beautifully crafted landscape, but to it's core, it's a walking simulator. The game has set paths that you will have to follow, meaning your range of exploration is somewhat limited. Half of the map you can't explore because of this. If you're looking for an OPEN world game, this game isn't going to satiate you I'd imagine.   Presentation wise, the game uses a cell shaded artstyle, making it all look like a very well made cartoon. The graphics are pristine and the enviroments are beautifully made. The animations are smooth as all hell, they make the main character feel that bit more alive inside the world and also do a good job of showing his character from time to time. Where this game shines to high heaven is the sound design, which is arguably some of the best I've ever heard in a video game. The voice acting is phenominally done, making both the main characters feel extremely believable. You can trully tell how both character's feel, even though one of them comes from a walkie talkie.   This is a story game through and through, it lives and breathes for the story; but is it anything special? I'd definately say so. There is little that can be said that wouldn't expose the game's plot points, so excuse me if I sound vague. The game hooks you from start to finish, the opening alone made me feel like I just got punched in the gut. Midway through the game, stuff starts to get real as both you and the other person in the walkie talkie begin to get paranoid. The game's story eventually makes you feel uneasy, like you're always being watched, like any corner you turn might result in a swift rock to the head. There is a huge pile of mystery sneaked into what I thought was going to be a game about dealing with forest fires.   Personally, I didn't mind the ending.   Although I do feel like it kept things way vaguer than it should have done, leaving you feeling like there was something else you missed on your journey.     Despite it's short length, I do recommend this game. It's an amazing experience, one that tells you the story it wants to tell. While it's length and ending may be questionable, I still believe this game is something special to be had. I'd say it's overpriced just a bit, so I'd wait for a sale first before purchasing.",

You will find that all of the discussions look exactly like what you would expect to hear from a book club meeting. People voicing their opinions of character's, their relationships and interpreting them and events in the story respectively. You'll see people speculating on the meaning of this or that. One person might label something as an oversight, while another will explain how it was intentional and meaningful. This is the result of great story telling.    As with any story or game, there are mixed opinions, but one thing nearly everyone will have in common, is that they will still be enveloped by this one when it is over. If a story leaves you with an unhappy or dissapointed emotion or feelings, but did so intentionally, that is good story telling and that's what this story does.   Some nitpicking:  -- I found navigation to be tedius at times. The map is open, but traversing is confined to a network of trails which can be easy to miss. Not being able to jump up, over, or down to any surface was a tad frustrating, at times, but time and place are integral to the narrative in this game, so I get it. Some markers and a slightly more open/accessible playground, would've been nice.",

The voice acting is absolutely phenomenal, and the relationship between Henry (or Hank in some situations) and Dililah is sometimes hilarious and touching.   This game did keep me entertained and wanting more 90% of the time. Sometimes knowing that you'll have to take the long and boring hike back to your watchtower, or where ever it is good ol' Dililah will have to going at the time, makes it hard to stay focused and motivated to keep going. But as soon as you get there something else will happen that grabs you again.  There's no real action to this game... Just lots of walking around and looking at things to report back to Dililah to get some kind of direction or insite on a particular object or area. Which, is a lot more exciting than it sounds.  The story is great, if not a bit depressing at times. The whole mystery aspect had me on the edge of my seat at times and for some reason a little scared to look behind me while running through the forest.  Ultimately, I give this game a 9/10 for what it is.   It's funny. It's sad. It's happy. It's suspenseful. &amp; there's a few WTF moments.  I enjoyed the short 4 hours it took me to complete it.  Not quite as much content as other $20 games on the market, but in my opinion, it's overall worth the cash.",

Literally, in a tower in the woods, and the only contact you have is a walkie talkie. You walk around and a story just unfolds. You'll navigate to different areas to accomplish tasks from the story (which are interesting). I WISH I could give you more details and some of the feelings i felt so you can understand how much of an emotional roller coaster it was.   Yes, a video game.   This was the best part of the game. The story is awesome IMHO, but some would argue that. It's debateable according to some. Voice acting was superb. Like really, honestly, superb. The conversation system was revolutionary IMHO. Something like the choosing to talk, or tell or not tell what you see, will change how much depth a video game can have in the future (i hope). Graphics were oddly good looking and rough at the same time, just a bit. Like a little jagged, but still great with some gorgeous scenery. But this game is for the experience anyway.

The game is shines in the amount of dialog options you use to gain information between the two 'main' characters, Henry and Delilah. These are in depth conversations and often there is so much that you have to wait in some areas just to ask about the view in a forest or the like.  When I first opened the game it ran bad, optimisation is not quite there at the moment and may be better later down the line. On lower settings the game obviously runs better but you run into a problem common in FarCry 2 where the further you're away from something, it won't bother to render it. You could also say you have a circle around you which is quite obvious due to the amount of pop-up from terrian and textures.  For the amount I paid for the game, it was quite short of an experiance. As it was in the closing phases I was deeply hoping that it would continue, just for a while longer, drag out the story in some epic plot. My game time was 3 hours, but does show what can be done by indie developers. Then again I wasn't hoping for much after the pre-load was 3GB's in size.  It's highly recommended that you watch the trailers, watch the first few days, get a feel for it and see if it's for you.",

You are along to experience the story, however you actually experience it (and don't run around listening to story orbs, eugh). You have dialogue choices to make, you physically navigate the park and even use a map and compass to do some basic orienteering to find your way around. You are experiencing the story as it happens, and influencing it in minor ways along the way with your choices.  Its a fantastic mystery with a slight let down of an ending, and there isn't a whole lot of replayability for the price of admission. During my playthrough I took it for having a little more depth than it actually did, in regards to the objects you can pick up and the various interactive items in the game.

If you are after anything other than a story, go elsewhere. This game is as barebones as it comes, similar to something like 'Dear Esther' but with interation with a number of things around, usually in the form of informing the lady at the other end of the radio.  The game starts out with one of the most solid emotional connections ever in a game, I have never felt a connection to a few lines of text before, but this game crafts a fantastic relationship with only a few lines of text... Then it kicks you in the teeth.  At this point my (and probably your) expectations were (will be) at a very high point, this continues to sky rocket for about another hour or two, then things start to get revealed and questions start to get answered and the game falls so far so quickly you will barely realise it's wrapping up before you are out of the wildy and back in the menu.   The graphics are gorgeous, the particles, skyboxes, enviromental assets and various bits and bobs you can touch and read are all fantastic, some of the best in this art style.  The voice acting and writing (for interations between the two main characters) are perfect, amazing talent, really brings the characters to life, you want to meet Delilah so badly due to how realistic she feels and sounds, right now im considering playing through a second time just to choose different options and try learn more about her.  The story, as mentioned before starts insanely strongly but falls too far too quickly and is a real dissapointment which is an immense shame because of how fantastic everything else is. I really hope there is some DLC or something, ANYTHING, to flesh this out some more.  Do i recommend? Yes, but under the pretence that you go in blind. Don't watch trailers, don't get all hyped up from reviews, infact don't read reviews at all. The less you know about this game the better, much like in 'The Begginers Guide' because the more you hype this up inside your head the more dissapointed you will be coming out.  Overall a fantastic game but misses beats in story and pacing, some more fleshing out would have been better or a different ending/reveal.

The aesthetic is amazing, but even more so is the interaction between the two characters and the way it influences your perspective of the concomitantly evolving narrative threads.

I don't expect much on that end, though.  The length is something to consider, if you evaluate the value of a game based on play time. The game is rather short but you can find yourself losing the notion of time while exploring the vast world (note that some parts are either blocked or harder to reach until you find specific tools, toward the end of the game).  Noticeable bugs on launch, for those interested in trying it out right now:  - getting stuck on rocks (easy to walk up, impossible to get down) - while reading a note, do not try to exit with Esc; only with Q",

You are left to find your own way with, literally, a compass and a map. Story is, mostly, well-paced. Graphics are cartoony, but nice. Very few technical issues.  Cons: Story line is EXTREMELY short. About 5 hours with some wandering around in between. Could probably be finished within 2-4 hours. Some of the plot reveals feel sudden and very rushed. Some plot holes are created as the game tries to trick you away from the actual villian. Many storylines that are hinted at are either never explored or I missed them in my play through. This does not create any replay value as I will be trudging through a story I've already heard with the hopes of simply stumbling upon missed notes. Occasional frame rate dips, graphical errors, and hit detection problems.  MINOR SPOILER BELOW***  The ending was crap. Sorry, but it was. I could have guessed it, but the absolute lack of a twist made me believe it could not have been correct. Even after the 'big reveal,' which lasts mere seconds, I spent the entire ending sequence waiting for the actual ending. 'That could not be it' I told myself. There had to be more. There wasn't. I even sat through the credits in the hopes of something. Anything.  Thus, this was the biggest problem with the game. The ending does not explain the purpose of the story that was just told. Why go through all that? And every single time the game led you to what felt like a massive reveal or something epic, it turned out to be something plain and wholely expected.  My biggest hope is that the storyline does truely change depending on how you play it and, because I played a genuinely nice character I set forth the story that was told. Otherwise, this was an example of a great, unique concept with mediocre execution.",

They do help flesh out these two wonderful characters. And that coupled with two powerhouse performances really makes that relationship feel real and leaves a lasting impression on you.

This game can be beat in a short amount of time. But as I was going, I thought of it like this, translate this game into a novel and you will probably reach the full length required for something to be considered a novel. Compare to the price which is about $20 and it is incredibly worth it. Firewatch is stunningly beautiful with a plot that is thick with undertones and moments of true suspense. Though I don't know if decision making plays a huge part of the game, dialogue feels dynamic and real.   However, since it's a strong narrative game, it's very linear. There isn't much to explore apart from when the game lets you go on a new path, but on the first trip through any area it's pretty awe inspiring.   However, I wish I could've been more immersed but it's to be expected that the game isn't about you right from the get go. A succinct character is introduced with a dynamic backstory. There's no reason for you, as the player, to think that you are in any way Henry. The only thing you are is a choice for his dialog and the engine that drives him. I think that if you go into the game thinking this, you'll have an awesome experience of being a part of a great visual story with a thrilling conclusion. The best part is, I don't think anyone's story is necessarily the same. Maybe your desicions give you better outcomes, but maybe they don't.   For some, this can be a very introspective game, making you look at yourself and your own relationships.  If you're looking for a great narrative game, then I highly reccomend this, but if you're looking for something with cool gameplay or skill based gameplay, look elsewhere. Firewatch is a visual story, so just let yourself enjoy it and get caught up in the emotions.",

            "review_text": "First of all, big props to Campo Santo for making such a lovely, rich game - at first try!  As I am writing, I finished the game just 3-4 minutes ago and just looked up on the internet what other people thought of the game. I will make this review spoiler-free.   Personally, I liked it. It is a visually stunning-looking game and is absolutely admireable in regard to script and voice-acting. Future games of same or similar genre should take note from Firewatch. Because in my honest opinion, the script and voice-acting of this game is a new milestone in videogame history and very pleasing and feels real.   Now, about the game itself. To me this game is about the journey, not the destination. The game builds up a lot of tension and mystery which is creepy at times but in a good enough way to keep you intrigued. The relationship between the protagonist, Henry, and his boss, Delilah, feels genuine and thanks to the script is a fun experience to witness. The game is very simplistic when it comes to controls, which is fine. For a story-rich 'walking simulator' this type of game does not need elaborate controls. There is a gimmick in the game that lets you pick up items and 'examine' them, exactly like L.A. Noire. Except in L.A. Noire at actually had a purpose. It does not really have any impact in Firewatch other than letting you examine certain items (for reading books and notes). It is a thing I feel they could have explored some more.   The story itself is odd. As of yet, I cannot decide whether I found it weak or strong. The mystery and paranoia is amazing and really makes you think about what you should say/report/do. Throughout the game I was conspicuous to whom was creating all this mayhem. However, the ending somewhat falls flat in the last act when it is revealed what was going on. As I said earlier, to me, this game was about the journey, and not the destination. The journey is amazing, the destination is a slight let-down.   I have read a lot of comments about this game. It seems a lot of people seem dissatisfied with relationship between Henry and Delilah. To me I was not surprised what happens between them, it is somewhat implicit and obvious within the game design and story-telling. I do not think I can say anything more about that, without spoilers.   So, last verdict. Firewatch is a beautifully looking game, without a doubt. Its cartoonish looks fit perfectly for what it is. By the way, again, BIG props to Campo Santo for making such beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Wow. Gameplaywise Firewatch is simplistic with slight 'process' in terms of equipment that eventually gets 'upgraded'. As said before, the script and voice-acting is superb and was the selling-point for me when I first watched the gameplay trailers about 10 months ago. The ending is a slight letdown.   Despite the anti-climactic ending I would give Firewatch 7.5/10  I enjoyed Firewatch A LOT. It was a charming, fun little game. Steam says I have only played it for 3 hours, which I do not know is true (I have run it through steam and desktop directly and I do not think steam has recorded my gametime when I did not run it through steam). I think it took me between 4-5 hours to complete.   I sincerely hope we get to see something more from Campo Santo. Not necessarily a sequel, but definitely something more with same type of script and voice-acting.",

However, the narrative, voice acting, visuals and optimisation (at least in my experience) were superb, and thats where this game excels. Purely due to the fact that i wanted so much more of this title is a testament to how likable and realistic it's characters and setting was.   I feel like the developers could have got a lot more out of the scenery and utilised the way that the narrative was framed more effectively, e.g. the days were counting down yet this took away a sense of pacing. I would have liked to fill out some of the mystery (which was great while it was still mysterious) with a few more mundane days, maybe with some varied activities and optional tasks to do on these 'filler days'. This way, the players can explore and interact with the landscape rather than just utilising it for the plot.   I actually don't think a mechanic like a scrapbook would have been out of place in this title, we already have photo's which was a fun idea. If there were plants, animals and samples to record and collect this would have been a great 'mundane' optional experience that would fill out the sense of seclusion and properly feel like a retreat to nature.   I throughly enjoyed my nearly four hours of play, and think that the developers have done something quite bold and refreshing, however i still think that the experience could have been supplemented with a few tried and tested adventure game/rpg mechanics.",

Pro:  - It's very atmospheric. - Graphics suit the style and atmosphere well. - Great storytelling. - Nice sound-design. - 'Cozy game', because you don't feel completely alone (D.) and all you gather is part of your home later. - The first 3/4 of the game are building up much tension. - The arguments between D. and H. are awesome and funny.  Con:  - It's very short and doesn't match the price, except from when you expect exactly such a game. - There were some events that could have brought up much more tension if D. wouldn't have joked around. - Sometimes things didn't really make much sense and could have been worked around better. - Very hard switches in the timeline. - Light spoiler:   I would really like a game that doesn't just bring up nothing in the end, but a real conspiracy or even totally irrational, unexplainable stuff, I somehow expected something in the vein of Twin Peaks in the mountains. ;)   - Beware of MAJOR spoiler:   The end could have been better. It was a bit senseless with all the tapes and stuff just for the cause of a disturbed father who lost his son... too much tension for nothing in the end.    There's also other things you need to know when you buy this game:  Don't expect complete freedom, it's more a storytelling than anything else, but if you like atmospheric games, this one is for you.",

The graphics are gorgeous and a big selling point. It seems like everywhere you turn is a work of art, and I had fun pulling out the in-game camera to take pictures of sunsets and vistas. I love games such as Borderlands which are stylised in a unique way, so this really stood out. It looks almost painted.  The conversational system was a good idea, and felt pretty natural -- instead of getting locked into a conversation screen, you pursue branching conversations while walking around the environment, and you can phone up your radio buddy to start conversations about most of the things you find. The dialogue is well-written, well-acted, and often hilarious. The main characters' relationship did seem to develop depending on what I said -- I'm looking forward to playing again as a huge jerk and seeing what's different. Even inconsequential-seeming dialogue choices sometimes paid off later on in small ways that made the world feel a lot more immersive.  The story kept me interested and guessing, and broke my heart in a couple of places, and I really came to care for the characters. There's no combat or puzzles, but the mystery and characters keep pulling you along, and it's easy to grow fond of the environment you're hiking around in. My one gripe is that travel sometimes got frustrating when I found myself lost off the side of a trail, and had to double back. But I've never had much of a sense of direction.  It's short, but it's short like Gone Home -- the game is about the right length to tell the story, and no longer.  I recommend trying it out, I had a great time.",

            "review_text": "Just wanted to give a quick spoiler free review for Firewatch since i enjoyed it so much, just gonna outline the core features and my opinions on them  Story - 6/10 I enjoyed the story, didn't find myself predicting alot of the twists like with some stories. I really enjoyed just the laid back feeling in the beginning and the ramping up towards the mystery. But i feel the ending could have been better. Then again i had emotionally invested myself into the story and just wanted the conclusion i thought i should be able to have chosen. For the game itself yes it is a very short game, but if the developers had stretched it out i feel like it would have made it worse. Seems to me this is the kind of game best completed in one playthrough or at least one day.  Sound - 7/10 Great. The voice actors are amazing and really helped me connect with the characters it felt like the dialogue and interchange between the main characters was very fluid and not forced. Didnt find myself hearing the same old sound effects that other games use so that was refreshing. Music could use more work felt like there were only a few tracks that looped every 6 or so seconds.  Graphics - 7/10 (Played on max) Love the art style, plenty of detail in objects that you can pick up, read and even manipulate the 3D model to look at all angles. Textures may have needed a little more work but the game isnt going for photorealism it uses alot of light and shadows to set the scene. Reminds me very much of The Long Dark in a way.  Gameplay 6/10 - Just running around a forest really, no jump button just using LMB RMB and SPACE to interact with the world for the most part. But thats all the game really needed.  Replay value - 1/10 This isnt a game i plan on playing again anytime soon, not because i dont like this game, i just feel there would be not so much more to do to warrant another playthrough. The only thing i can think of is to go back and choose the other dialogue options to see what difference it might make.  My opinion 7/10 overall. Very nice game for me it was worth the price even for such a small amount of gameplay, took me little over 5 hours to complete the game working at a medium pace trying to absorb and read everything i could and activating as much dialogue as i could by interacting with points of interest. If your a fan of a nice immersive story then yes buy this game. If your expecting any kind of 'action' then no don't buy it.    ",

I would definitely reccomend it, if only as a view into one of the best examples of storytelling in video games to date. But, like many other people, I have a few problems.  In many ways, this game lived up to my expectations, but not all of them. It was gorgeous, with a well-written story and fully realized environment. I, for one, never expected it to be open world, and it wasn't. That wasn't a problem for me. What was a problem for me, however, was that the game seemed a little empty. At the end, I felt like there was something missing. Some sort of closure I didn't get. But, I think that was supposed to be the intention all along. This game is probably one of the more realistic ones, in terms of story, and for that reason, the ending is similarly realistic.  Now, this isn't to say that I disliked the time I spent with the game. I most certainly enjoyed my five-ish hours with it. I wish there was an option where, at the end of the game, I could explore the park at my leisure, but there is not. Regardless, I'm excited to see what else Campo Santo will do in the future, and while Firewatch may not have been everything I hoped it to be, I do not feel like I wasted money on it. This is one of the few games I could see myself playing again.",

Edit: Also, the soundtrack is absolutely stunning, while it's not used much throughout the game it is used to help build tension, relief or revelatory moments as most of the time the game instead focuses on the dialogue and the incredible sounds of nature to help build the atmosphere.

THERE'S ALSO A TL;DR AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW    I was really looking forward for Firewatch. The trailers they released made me so very hyped for the game. The game looked amazing, the characters looked full of personality, and the story sounded very interesting. A day before the game was released, many websites released their reviews for the game. The reviews were all praising the game for being amazing so, I took their word and took the plunge to buy the game.  I started the game and instantly I saw the slick menu. The options menu is lacking of a FOV slider but I didn't really get too bothered by this but, I know some people who will get bothered with this. I launched the game and it started off with a very well written backstory. Even though this was only about ~10 min long, I really got intrigued to continue with the story.   After the starting is over, you start the main part of the game you meet a girl named Delilah. She talks with you through a walkie-talkie. She's a really big part of the story. Hearing the main character, Henry, talk to Delilah is probably one of the best part of the game. The connection they have and the conversations are really fun to hear.  You're probably wondering why I gave this game a 'No' after writing all these nice things. Despite all of this, the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ poor. The whole game is very linear, you can't take other paths to get to each objective. Places that look like you can go are either blocked by rocks or invisible walls. This whole game is beautiful and all I want to do is explore the forest and take paths my way. I think this game would be better if this could be done. I also find the speed you walk/jog quite slow.     TL;DR   Firewatch has a beautiful story, visuals, and very live characters. All of this is hindered due to the fact that the gameplay is just a slow paced and linear walking sim.   I won't give this game a score since I didn't finish it. I think just marking this game as a 'No' is good enough.",

People complain about the length, but it felt right to me; think of it like a good mini-series. It took me about 4.5 hours, about a third of which was spent poking around taking in the little details like the fake vintage book covers. It was worth every bit of $20 for me personally, but if you're just going to rush through it then I think you're missing the point.  Oh, and go into the settings before you start and turn off the position indicator on the map! I wish I had have known that earlier — it makes the game much more immersive.",

            "review_text": "SPOILERS INCLUDED!  With some mixed reviews, but generally positive overall, I was a little unsure about buying this one. Still, I quite like walking games with strong dialogues.   The plotline – a creepy-looking mystery in a Wyoming state park in the late 80s – also seemed unusual and eye-catching. At just over C$22 I thought I’d give it a go and decided not to read the reviews much further so as to keep an open mind.  The pros:  The conversations you have with Delilah are the strongest parts of the game. There are some moments when I chuckled here. For example, Delilah tells you all the cache boxes are coded ‘1234’ because it made life so much easier – a neat, realistic touch.   The on-radio relationship between the two is believable, as well as the guilt Henry feels because of Julia’s condition.   The other strength is the world you find yourself in. The rendering of the park is nicely done and the conditions, depending on the time of day, add a great deal to the overall atmosphere. When you get into the caves there’s also a real sense of claustrophobia and some moments of disorientation. The woods can be eerie at night, and the sounds effects of nocturnal scurrying sometimes a little unnerving.  Some nagging points: You collect lots of notes that serve no ultimate purpose. The same is true for the photos you take to build up “evidence” as they only provide some images during the end credits.   The walking about can become repetitive, taking you back through areas multiple times. You start to realise that much of the playable world is quite limited, especially when it’s the fifth time you’re heading to a destination via Jonesy Lake.  It was also a disappointment that larger use of the caves wasn’t made. It would have been neat to have several levels to explore and really broaden things out.  The scientists’ base, their arrival and fate is left unexplained. Indeed, Delilah even says she didn’t know about their arrival or the fact that they’d managed to fence off a massive slice of the park even though it’s close to her watchtower. That's odd because she’s paid to pay attention to what goes on in the park.   The cons:  The gameplay is really short – I completed the game in just 4 hours and that ending, arriving as it does so soon, also finds the plotlines collapsing like a soggy soufflé.   You see Ned, a previous firewatcher, had taken over a scientists’ site and used their equipment (and his own) to listen into Henry and Delilah’s conversations. He’s the one trying to spook Henry and Delilah. He breaks and enters; beats Henry unconscious with a rock; attempts to kill Henry through starvation by locking him the caves; and finally commits arson with the intent to destroy evidence.  So why did Ned go all ‘Friday 13th, part XXIV: Michael Myers takes a vacay in Wyoming’? Because he thinks the pair has become too inquisitive about the fate of his son, Brian, whom Delilah had allowed to stay with Ned some years before, despite it being a breach of park rules.   You see Ned was a poor father who drank and insisted his introverted boy accompany him while camping, climbing and caving. And it was during the caving that Brian fell to his death. Instead of reporting this, Ned decides to just hide out in the wilderness near the scene of the accident.   Oh and he doesn’t bury his boy – he just leaves the body in the cave… so there’s that.  After playing the game I thought about the conversations between Henry and Delilah that revolved around Ned and his son – the ones that provoked Ned’s sociopathic behaviour. They last no more than five or ten minutes and lack the depth of those discussions that revolved around Julia.   But the greatest failing relates to the relationship between Henry and Delilah. It seems so crucial, but has little influence on proceedings. In the end it suddenly appears very linear and, if there is any real surprise to the game, it’s that.   The price:  For an indie game at C$22 I’m not expecting over 100 hours of gameplay with all the bells and whistles on. But 4 hours is a let-down. Once a game is over $20 the excuse of ‘what did you expect for that price?’ doesn’t sit right with me.   The developers clearly worked hard on what they put together, but I suspect the curse of the indie game struck – that an alpha/beta product was placed on the market as the resources to deliver the envisaged concept simply dried up.   Score: 3/10 and a great shame because there was some superb potential here. That’s why I felt really disappointed with the game and thought I’d try my hand at reviewing it.",

I was extremely dissatisfied with the intro. I grew to hate the protagonist about 3 minutes in. I felt no connection to any of the protagonist's problems. I felt like it was written by a 15 year old. Moreover, it tried to make me feel like I had a say in what was happening. Decision A: Be a little girl about it, Decision B: Do something stupid.  Once the game gets going though, it is pretty fun. The world is beautiful, the controls are simple, and the dynamic of having the person on the walkie to talk to was interesting. There's enough interaction with the world to keep you interested, and even do quarky things at times. It's the mystery that hooks you, and keeps you wondering what is going on until the end. They added a few smaller details that get you interested in a bit of lore about the area too, which I appreciated.  There were some plot holes I had a problem with. For example, your character can't swim. Or climb a fence. Both of which are things the story hinges on. Had I been able to climb that fence, or swim over there, many of the questions could have been answered in a fraction of the time.  The end was more satisfying than the intro, but still dissapointing. I won't spoil it by talking about it too much, but to me it just felt extremely anti-climatic.  It's the lack of re-playability and 3 hour story line that makes this feel like a movie. And the price tag that makes me not recommend it to anybody.

            "review_text": "For a game whose opening chapter covers ground ranging from the use of illegal fireworks at peak fire season to anxieties of dislocation and purposelessness—and whose narrative auguries are quite literally forecasted—Firewatch seques the player into its world with surprising gentleness. Chris Remo (alongside a rather rhetorical choice system) ferries us through Henry’s emotional traumas with a subtly and appropriately bruised score; the notes of which are, as with the cosmic heartsick of his work on Gone Home, acutely tender. Moreover, Firewatch‘s willingness to tear the bandage from Henry’s past for the player in a single and relatively quick motion, detailing but not dwelling on it, keeps the game’s prologue from feeling heavy-lidded and mawkish, despite the fact that we find ourselves in the Wyoming wilds after a series of fades in and out from black akin to the false awakenings of a hot, restless morning.  While I question the need for this front-loading of expositional player choice, as it could have been embedded in the system already present through the rest of the game via Henry and Delilah’s radio conversations, in which the player makes these same kinds of choices anyway when deciding how to respond to her friendly inquiries about his past, it is Delilah and not Julie (Henry’s estranged but omnipresent wife) who gives the story its glow. Indeed, her kittenish but openly clawed charisma is clear within seconds of Henry’s lifting the walkie talkie from its cradle and betraying his greenness both as a fire watch and a lost pup. Campo Santo‘s intent here, as with the moments preceding it, appears to be to establish a directness with the player—to characterize the experience early, and with candour, so as to afterward surprise them on level ground. The virtue of this strategy is that the compounding mystery later in the game feels genuinely mysterious and not merely masked. The story is able to play its hands, in other words, without resorting to tricks.  This is not to say that Firewatch is without its distortions. Artist Olly Moss‘s pastel forest, flush with gossamery midsummer heat, assumes both a buoyancy and the monodimensionality of a cutout animation, the effect of which bending more toward one or the other depending on the time of day or night; the shadows of the aspens convoluted in the wind or rotating as if by sun or moondial. When the plot begins to cash in on its earlier thunderstorms and the ilk and takes turns toward hazards ostensibly more serious than fires, the weather, and “problem bears”, this environment begins to suffocate Henry and Delilah’s (and the player’s) thoughts. Prior to these turns, Delilah’s radio assistance reliably keeps Henry par for the course and in bright spirits, but little by little her words lose their irreverent good nature and become kindling for his paranoia. (And vice versa.)   I won’t ruin what results, except to say that Henry and Delilah are eventually able to piece together a kind of cracked mirror, thematically speaking, of their relationship with one another. But while said turns give the game urgency and mystery, its most urgent, universal questions go unresolved. This is so by necessity and not design, though Campo Santo’s awareness of the fact makes the distinction as thin as air at elevation. Firewatch, like all good stories, only partially satisfies; it knows that the answers to the fundamental questions it raises are less crucial than their pursuit. The central “quests” for these characters, to put it in videogame terms, precede the opening credits and survive the closing ones. In this sense the Wyoming wilderness, and its ‘watch’, are a game not only for the player but for them as well: a remove from reality both geographical and psychological, only one of these evidently a success. (When Delilah admits her own storied hardships in response to Henry’s, declaring that the two of them are “both ♥♥♥♥ed up”, she does not say “were”.)  As both a game experience and a narrative one, Firewatch shows a level of restraint rare for the medium—especially when considering its subject matter. This restraint is, however, despite the developer’s good intentions, the reason for its shortcomings as much as its strengths. On one hand, Henry and Delilah’s patent need for one another is painted in neither saccharine nor manipulative strokes (even fading to black rather than showing the one moment in which direct transmissions of their intimacy are sent and received in seriousness); on the other hand, the game hits some of its most critical beats without giving them quite enough space to satisfyingly breathe. Once the plot is in stark ascent toward its climax, the experience is remarkably tense; but this intensity gains too much momentum without pause, I think, and with too much haste, the game’s apparent concern over trespassing on the player’s time such that it sacrifices its own. These self-awarenesses do not stop the game from excellence, but may be ultimately what stop it short of greatness.  Even so, the takeaway here may be how small a difference that makes. Firewatch is, semantics aside, thoroughly beautiful work. Subtle, but also confident; and able to balance devastation with rejuvenation, to handle difficult subject matter with sensitivity and frankness, but also humour and a healthy measure of uncertainty; it is, really, a class act. From a purely “game” standpoint, yes, the vast majority of Firewatch is spent walking, talking and listening; and the environment which envelopes these activities is as much a solicitude as solace. Crows quill the treeline and shadows warp the flaxen ground and thirsting creeks. At dusk and dawn particularly, the forest often resembles the very thing the player is tasked with protecting it from. But if reality as we experience it is, as the game implies, so much of our own making, then scorched earth is a lost cause only if we apostacize it. If we can accept what is for what is and not paint failure as the end, perhaps we can be as forests, or avatars in a game: regenerated, and better with each restart.",

Storyline is pretty neat, but in the end made me think there was something more to it due to the high tech equip. but it was just Ned and his son. Why would he be netting the ground there? Why would there be 3 beds?  While playing I kept wishing to be there, I wish there was more to the open world / orientation and not just 'follow through here' or 'you can't go through here because there's an invisible wall so you know it's not here'.  I'll be back at it to it just so I can enjoy some more landscapes and free wilderness sounds, but that's it. My view of the game? Has/had potential to be something way bigger and perhaps with lots of more content... It's an amazing experience and I'll recommend everyone I know that likes this kind of games to play it. Is it worth the current price? I surely don't think so because of the lack of content as I just described. The price I paid for 3 hours of gameplay does not really feel like it was worth it. I mean..I could just watch 3 hours of some youtuber of my choice and I'd be as pleased as I was with playing it myself.  See these as things to improve, I loved the game. I wish there was something else to do now.",

            "review_text": "Firewatch is principally, a mystery story. It takes place in the wilderness of Wyoming and you are Henry. You come in control at a crossroad in his life as his wife has an early form of dementia, and he's had some recent trouble involving his drinking problem and the law. He escapes to the Firewatch post as he can't quite come to grips with his situation and the solitude might have done him well.  After a two-day hike to the watch tower, you 'meet' the boss, Delilah, via handheld radio. This vehicle of communication is literally your only means of any sort of social interaction as you're quite alone with only the trees and wildlife to keep you company. Or, are you?  The game allows you to respond to situations and dialog with several choices, and playing through, there's that personal touch like you're making a difference.  Your first day is a bit tough as you have to deal with some skinny dipping college girls—I said tough didn't I? Though the interaction is never face-to-face, you shout empty threats at them across the pond in an effort to get them to stop being litter bugs and shooting off fireworks. With the addition of a far-off interaction with another hiker, the day was rather uneventful until you returned to your watch tower. It was very clearly trashed maliciously.  From then on, when Henry isn't enjoying his summer solitude in the woods, there's an air of mystery as strange things happen. It is all brought to a head when he discovers a clipboard with transcripts of his and Delilah's radio conversations out by the lake! Shortly after, he's knocked out and the makes of a conspiracy start to unfold.  Much of the gameplay was running errands for Delilah up to this point, but it quickly escalates into investigating an unknown fenced region in the middle of the woods and the eventual abandoned caves.  So much of what you find points strangely toward a human experiment involving two people left in isolation for an extended period of time. Even more mystery unfolds as those girls were reported missing and suspicious calls, claiming to be Henry, report that Delilah knows what caused the forest fires that quickly swallow up the area.   The conclusion comes all too quickly, and it honestly, left something to be desired.   The story-crafters did an excellent job in building it all up as I was hooked in wanting to know more. Once those final credits made their crawl across the screen, it then left me wanting more, actually disappointed since—this—was it.   You're given a disposable camera mid-game and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to document the strange occurrences. Even more so when evidence began to point at your character's guilt! Those photos' ultimate purpose was a bit of a slap to the face as it really makes you feel foolish.  I could only think of all the strange things that had happened to Henry.   In gameplay, I found charts with character traits written in. Indicating that whomever the author was, specifically believed that Henry was gullible. Even knew his history prior to joining the Firewatch program.   On those charts, Delilah was also mentioned to still be in a relationship despite her tale of how she came to be at her post. She seemed to be just as innocent, but she admitted to fudging a report to avoid talking to the police.   Things weren't adding up.   Regardless, the ending was so simple.   I enjoyed the game and was engrossed in it's execution. Running from one end of the forest down to the lake front, and back up to my tower as quick as my feet would carry me. The character development between you and your only emotional anchor, Delilah, is effectively the main attraction next to the mystery that surrounds the woods. It was so engaging, I really liked the snarky wit and chemistry her and Henry shared. The visuals were beautifully cell-shaded and the ambiance really immersed the player into the environment. From the first person perspective, scaling cliff walls during those intense moments, there were several opportunities I was sure something dangerous was going to be waiting for me.   It was the equivalent of a good book in terms of entertainment. Being able to choose my immersion level meant I could look at everything, or just follow the objectives. It was neat reading and investigating whatever I could put my hands on. Putting together these details into this side-narrative next to the one built into the game.  Ultimately though, it was a book that ended in such a way that it actually made me angry.   Not so much at the journey, as it was great ride. But at myself for being so invested.  It's a 'life is tough' tale, and really, that doesn't bother me. It's the fact that my choices may have warranted different responses, but played no part in the ending at all.  Games made by Telltale like 'the Walking Dead' series make your choices matter by potentially losing favorite characters and changing the outcome of the story. Whatever that may be, your crafted it with your own morals and values. Firewatch fell flat in that regard, and it should have been evident to me early on with the prologue choices. Plus, I don't think it was worth the $20 price tag. I knocked it out in 3 hours of gameplay and there wasn't much 'playing' besides running back and forth while making superficial choices. If it had had more substance, or it hadn't skipped in the number of days, and just allowed me to explore freely in the mean time between chapters; maybe I would have felt more justified.  I walk away from this game conflicted that it could have been better, but then I remember that it did it's job of engaging me. It had me with the little adventuring prior to the great mystery and the with the interactions with Delilah. I didn't want to miss a single one. Oh, and Turt Reynolds, too.  The mystery, despite not meeting my highly imaginative conclusions, was something so simple I had dismissed it early on in favor for something grand. Accustomed to other story driven games where there are always aliens and secret societies in the background, it ruined me for Firewatch's epilogue I think.   Delilah beckoned to the hopeless romantic in me. There was an authentic and convincing nature with the voice acting. Even though in hindsight, she may have been behind it all, in some way—says the conspiracy theorist in me.  This story doesn't wrap up neatly the way you might want it to, but it does in it's own way. It really was an experience. It would be worth an afternoon play through to learn about these characters and delve into the shady nature that looms in those Wyoming Woods. Enjoy the visuals, be absorbed by the isolation, and feel sad for the kid. Only you should do it after a Steam sale of Firewatch.",

            "review_text": "Even though I played this game on my crappy gaming laptop which hardly managed the medium settings and the audio was delayed sometimes, it turned out to be one of the most profoundly captivating gaming experiences I've had in a long time. If you've read Thoreau's 'Walden' you will feel right at home here, although the tranquility of solitary life in the woods is constantly subverted through a masterfully crafted undercurrent of awe, dread, joy and the superbly voice-acted dialogues of Henry and Delilah. This is a game that you won't play for the challenge of solving complicated puzzles or achieving a goal as quickly as possible, but rather a game that you play for the incredibly immersive experience of its dense, unique atmosphere of a slowly unraveling mystery in the North-American wilderness. Even though it's a short adventure, it's one that will stay in your thoughts long after its credits have rolled. Instead of providing simple answers, this game dares to ask questions and leave you wondering, inviting you to think for yourself, about your morality and your decisions. And it is one of those rare games that truly made me be absolutely uncertain if I had made the right decision, because the options were as complicated as life, and I love it for that. This game is not for everyone, but don't let the short duration fool you - this game lasts much longer than the actual play-time, especially when kicking back, closing your eyes and listening to the slightly melancholic soundtrack after a long day. Then you're right back there, in the Wyoming wilderness, hiking through woods that never seem to show you the same marvelous face of distant mountains, infinite pine trees, rocky canions and breathtaking sunsets twice.",

            "review_text": "Firewatch is a mystery. A good mystery, at that. So what makes a good mystery? Interesting characters. Interesting setting. A sense of tension that grows until the catharsis at the end. A story that keen minds will unravel just in advance of the plot is revealed.  It's as replayable as a favorite movie or a loved book; you will almost certainly remember what happens once you get into it, but it's so beautiful and engaging that you won't mind. Henry and Delilah will feel like old friends, or enemies, the next time you see them.   PRO Art - It's beautiful. Like playing a painting. It pays attention to how light and motion color the world around us, like an impressionist painting, but with the beautiful colors and emotional bias of expressionism.   Voice Acting - The voice actors for this game are phenomenal, and there's an incredible intimacy in communicating by radio or telephone. It's like being in bed at night, phone cradled to your ear with a friend or loved one on the other end.  Story - The game has a story it wants to tell and an emotional impact that it wants to make, and it succeeds with both.  But what about it being... Short - If you're expecting a long AAA title, this isn't it. This lasts about as long as a long movie, and you should treat it as such. If the price point bothers you, check out what a theater ticket and a beverage would cost you.  Directed - Because it's telling a story, it wants to direct you from point to point and not give you a lot of time to explore the scenery. If it gives you an indication to use the radio to report you are ready, resist the urge and explore. The game will take you to most of the locations, but there are some fun things to explore.   Campo Santo did an amazing job witht his, and if you catch it on sale, you have no reason not to get it. That said, I waited until it was full price to buy it and I'm glad I gave them my money.",

Althought it can get tiresome relaying information back and forth about trivial stuff and waiting for a conversation to end. Also the park sets an interesting atmoshpere just for how absolutely alone it can make you feel on top of the overhanging but always there chance of death.  However the game's story (which is ike 90% of the game) is undercut by the videogame that is its foundation. And I'm not referring to it not being the prettiest looking game out there and everything in the park repeats itself from the rocks you climb up and down to most of the trees. I'm referring to it handholding you from event to event around the park, nothing happens that the player can ♥♥♥♥ up. You can change the story slightly by choosing the wrong answer for dialogue but you can't get hurt, there's no input to fight anything and there's a run button which Im certain is there so that travel isn't grating. Its by the end that this comes full circle and the worth of your past 3 hour adventure comes into question.   I'm not saying it's awful but a book totally would have done the job",

The animations are top notch, and the texturing and color palette are odd yet remarkable. Hard to describe. You almost get the feeling you're in an adult-themed Pixar film, if that makes sense. The voice acting IS SOME OF THE BEST IN ANY GAME, EVER. Which is good, because the quality of the voice work would be a real make-or-break factor for this title. Details abound that will captivate you in this world, some you may not even notice at first (like how your character, Henry, has a difficult time scaling rock faces at first, heaving and dragging himself up, but becomes more proficient with time).  Then the story starts to unfold, and it is absolutely gripping. The atmosphere in Firewatch is spellbinding, and I was left at the edge of my seat with tension and a feeling of impending doom more often than almost any other game I've played in recent memory. There's a certain vulnerability to being alone, in the woods, with only one tenuous link to another human being. Campo Santo plays this solitude along with incredible art and music to deliver a complete package and exhilarating experience.  There's the oft debated question 'Are games art?' If you're still on the fence about that, Firewatch will make you a believer.  Oh, and a lot of folks seem to be complaining about the ending and the interaction with your supervisor at the end. I, for one, appreciated it. Because it was a real ending, not a video game ending. I won't spoil it, but I think us as gamers get used to common tropes and, eventually, get dissapointed when a game doesn't fulfill these things. Sometimes the climax isn't something that would be found in thousands of other games. Sometimes things don't work out the way you want them, even in this virtual space.   I love this game, and I appreciate its honest ending.",

This game is exactly what I have been looking for to satisfy my need for a game that is story driven, not hack and slash driven. It is slow paced, full of story, and quite interactive in regards to conversation and elements in the environment. It has beautiful graphics, really compliments the feel of the game. Voice acting is spot on. Music is very fitting with how the various moments feel in the game. You have a map that at first may be confusing, but don't let this get you down. Just use it with your compass, and don't forget to jot down the extra notes when you find them. This helps fill out your map as time goes on. The game is short compared to most games. For some, one play through is all they will need. I personally will be playing it through again, in hopes of making different dialogue options and completing four achievements that I missed my first time through. Many were not happy with how the game finally ends. I actually quite liked it. It may not have been as EPIC as everyone anticipated, but it fit with the story. Everything tied together and you see where you fit into all of it. If you buy this game, do beware, the game is labeled as 'adults having adult conversations.' There are times where conversations get deep about the lives of you and Delilah, but for the most part, I did not come across anything said that was lued or crude. The game is labeled this way due to the amount of cussing used. At times, it can get really annoying. Your character even references once how much it is overly used. Personally, I am an adult, I work with adults, and we don't use language like that. So as a warning, for some this may be a shock or deterent from buying this game.  All in all, though, I recommend this game for any that want a story driven, non action based game. You will enjoy all of its moments: serenity, suspense, mystery, distress, comedy, life.",

There's little action, no quick-time events, no rooty-tooty-point'-n'-shooty, no strategy, or sense of 'achievement'.     Many reviews complained about the abruptness of the ending, how it was 'anti-climactic' or 'a waste of time.'   Playing Firewatch, I found the game's highlight to be its characters. I think people were let down because of the ending because they came into it with their own preconceptions about the story. But it's not about the characters' story, it's about the story's characters. You really get to experience the setting through Henry's eyes, understand his thoughts, and see his back-and-forth with Delilah. Honestly, in the end, I didn't care about the story. I cared about the characters. You get relatable, believable characters, with superb voice-acting and very well-written dialogue. The game expertly flows between light-hearted joking and playful teasing, into paranoid anxiety and somber melancholy. I cannot speak highly enough of the writers, their dialogue and characters kept me and the girlfriend enthralled the whole way through. (She actually sat through the whole thing with me, from beginning to end! I don't know how many games can boast that kind of third-person retention!)  One of the other reviews I read put it pretty succinctly, the story has a bittersweet ending. I think other players went through it all, expecting some big payoff at the end, 'solve the mystery, get the girl, save the day.' But real life isn't always like that. Remember when I said I'd get to the part about this being a 'game'? I get that games should be an escape from real life, but this is sort of what makes Firewatch special; it's  not  a game that's meant to be  played , it's a   story   that's meant to be   experienced  .  Exploring the Wyoming wilderness, getting attached to the characters, and getting immersed into their world. That's what Firewatch is about, and I think it achieved its goal admirably.  - honk honk &gt;(o )",

The world is fine, artstyle terrific, music pleasing, and I think it's definitely worth a buy, but there's lost potential here.  Delilah and Henry are overall both written terrifically, and I have nothing but praise for the dialogue and performance of their VAs. These two were organic, convincing, and overall just  human  in a way that many game characters fail. During the first few days their relationship developed in a sweet way, and I'd be content if the game focused on that the entire time. Nevertheless, the story presented always had a feeling of that there was supposed to be something more, past the point of an intentional red herring and into where it seems that the last arc especially was altered with not much time left in development.   What made the characters so great was dropped at the end - they no longer remained logically consistent and failed to behave as an emotional person would. The game spent a huge amount of time building up to a seemingly certain climax, only for it to never come. Events occurred, sure, but the reaction to them by both Henry and Delilah fell completely flat. The last scene suffered from the same issues.  Regardless,  Firewatch  succeeds in both developing and keeping player attention, and while I'd have preferred a different ending I also wouldn't say that the current spoils the game entirely.",

By no means is this a hardcore thriller though, I spent most of my first playthrough exploring the gorgeous environment in between working toward the main plot. The backbone of this game is the relationship that is developed through dynamic dialogue with Delilah, an off screen character. As you may have read many folks were disappointed with the 'lackluster' conclusion of the plot, but I found the openess of it to be liberating as a player. In essence the conclusion leaves you with more questions than answers, and in doing so forces you to think about the characters and their motivations even once you've finished the game (an objective that every game should aspire to, I think).  2nd Adventure (November, 10 months later) Total Time: 3 hours   The second playthrough was possibly more enjoyable for me than the first, even though I knew what was going to happen in the main plot. Going into this run I planned on enjoying the scenery and taking more pictures in game, the artwork is really that good (I now use these photos exclusively as my desktop backgrounds)! It was really gratifying to know the layout of the map based on past experience, the game feels more emersive when you intuitively know how to get around. Once again though, it was the dianamic dialogue and subtle plots that made for superb replay value. What you choose to say as a character directly affects which subplots you have access to, and I discovered many clues and stories this playthrough that I had assumed were simply unanswered/unfinished the first time.   I look forward to revisiting this game in 4 or 5 months, via a playthrough with developer/voice-actor commentary.  Pros: -Artwork/scenery -Dynamic dialogue -Emotional character plots -Judicious use of suspense and tension -Ambiant music that enhances mood -Open world -Special features -Replay value (occasionally)  Cons -Short highly structured plot -Limited endgame",

The game is rather easy and doesn't allow you to do anything stupid or to miss any clues, the main challenges are to navigate the wilderness using a map and compass and to listen carefully to what is said on the radio. I suppose the game could be made more difficult by allowing more objects to be properly interacted with, which would also give the game a little more depth; like to pour coffee or to play with some of the devices. Also, there could perhaps be a little more content in the form of side quests of some sort. Having said that, I do recommend the game, but you should expect something more akin to an interactive movie rather than a traditional game.",

Playing a game that's basically a very expensive dlc its not really my thing. Firewatch was one of the best experiences I had in recent years meeting excellence in the plot construction, actors, art and soundtrack where the only thing I have to say bad about it is that only lasts 3.5h and maybe a map too linear. If you like fast-paced games then this one might not work for you, but if you're still interested I recommend you give this game a shot. Where most titles cost up to 59.99€ or even further to an almost reptitive experience every year, I would gladly give this game a bit more. Definitly worth my money.",

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a slower, story-driven game.   ",

I did some research and saw that Firewatch almost always runs at around 5-10 FPS for some people with decent PCs.  However, I turned my settings down and I played the game fine.  I played the game thoroughly, up to what I can presume is close to the end. This could've been up on my top 10 favorite PC games, but one fatal error ♥♥♥♥ed that up and forced me to write a negative review.  So on Day 77,    when you have to follow the transponder thing to the strange backpack   , Henry decides to automatically run in the last direction I pressed. I have never had this problem in any part of the game, and I even restarted the day and did not have any trouble until I went to clear the bushes. I opened up Steam Messages to see if my keys were stuck, but it worked perfectly fine. I looked at the key bindings, and there was no 'toggle directional run' binding. I even turned 'toggle run' on and off and he still sprinted. I have Googled this extensively and found no other reported cases of this, so I can not find an easy fix.  If anybody else does have a fix for this, then PLEASE direct message me, and if it works then I will turn this negative review into one commending the game for what it deserves.",

The few complaints I have about the game are really from a desire to have more Firewatch! I would have loved to be able to interact with the world a little more. A few side quests, or something. Also I wish there was some replayability, but there is absolutely no reason to play this again.  It would be really cool if they used this game engine for a better adventure game.

I've gone with recommand because I realised that I would part with the £13.50 to play it even if I knew then what I know now!  The sense of immersion is superb - from the way the environment is done to the relationship the characters develop. The amount of tension in the middle and near-end of the game was perfect.  As with many people I was, however, very disappointed with the ending. I googled for alternative endings, but it appears that all choices just lead the same way. I'm going to look at some other things like what if you hike to Delila's tower before the end, but it appears that the entire thing is very linear with little if any replay value.  I've seen reviews stating that 'if you really think about the point of the game, the end makes perfect sense and the feeling of things being unresolved was intentional', but can't come to that point of view. Whatever the intention, the ending and the linearity feel like laziness or time constraints on the part of the developer - just like a book that leaves the ending up to the reader: no - I've paid because I want you to give me the narrative!  So - would have bought the game even knowing what I know, but it could have been so much better with a sense of resolution and with just slightly more of an open world feel. It doesn't need to be a 'completely' OW game like FC3. It just needs a little more flexibility.",

Cons: -The game is extremely short for the price tag is the big complaint. I don't know that I would say it's a rip off, but I'm not overly impressed by the amount of time spent for the money. -The ending, as others have said, is pretty bad. -There are repeating mechanics that you do over and over and it gets a little old watching him climb up multiple rock walls with the exact same hand grips, and every log you walk across looks the exact same. - The dialog options frequently seem like you just have the illusion of choice when you actually can control the conversation there really doesn't appear to be much impact by your actions.  Over all I was happy with the game so would recommend it, but I would wait for at least a 50% off sale if you want to get your money worth. I beat the game in less than 4 hours and am unlikely to play it again if that gives you any idea. It is worth a play through, but certainly not game of the year or anything.",

Though its not very long, and the $20 pricetag seems to be a little high for this reason I can't do anything but commend it for its amazingly well done design. I found myself back-tracking sometimes but that isn't a big deal in a game that keeps opening or rather introducing you to new areas.  The story is increadably compelling and I played the entirety of the game in one sitting (As you can tell by the amount of hours that i have played). As I mentioned before this is the only downside. If your looking for a game that is long and will keep you entertained for hours uppon hours, this isn't the game for you. If you want a good strory then yes this is the game for you. I beleive that it is short so that the story doesn't drag on and leave the player with a bad exsperience. Rather there is little to no filler and it is constant development and growth.  --------------------------SPOILER WARNING DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE PLAYED-----------------------------------  The end don't get me wrong was a good way to end it off but it left me wanting more. Especialy when I chose to ask 'D' to wait for me around the end of the last 'Mission' in the game. However upon reaching the empty tower I thought to myself 'Well I knew this was going to happen but Dam did I want to meet her.' Then it ends with the ROFL copter picking you up (or not if you wait 2 min). Also leaving you with no conclusion besides talking to her one more time on the radio. This was dissapointing but, it does allow for the player to predict what may happen next. From what I get from the last bits of dialog you and 'D' never meet again. She says she might but, cmon, we all know she won't; and you are left to go home to your wife who is in a mentaly decaying state, which is ok. In a sense. I would have just liked more after center game conent, as after you finish the main part. You can really only go back and re-play it again, but with different dialog.",

The game creates a pleasant and soothing vision of nature.  The most profound thing I can say about Firewatch is that it is not trying to be profound. From the story, to the characters, to the graphics Firewatch is seamless and subtle in nature. While Telltale goes after narratives shown on television shows, comics, and video games. Firewatch is not trying to be 'hollywood' and for me personally it was a nice change of pace.  TL;DR It took me about 3 hours to complete, and may warrant a second playthrough. Buy if you want something different than Telltale narratively, but in a similar vein of genre.",

We don't wear SCBA in Wildland. The flipside of that, is that there is a lot of authenticity in this game. Many of the brocures and documents you find along the game are *almost* exact replicas of RL things, such as the fireline handbook (which even went as far as adding NWCG standards), fuel model publications, USFS prints and logos -hell even the terminology was for the most part correct. I was initially twitching a bit when he calls the pulaski an 'axe', but pleasantly surprised when he was quickly corrected.

Well, that theory just got shattered all to hell. Damn, this is some crazy ♥♥♥♥... Maybe it's one of those good stories turned bad horror flick? Nope, and then the heartstrings.   I honestly feel that the creators did their homework on this piece. Are there technical things that weren't 100%? Sure. But then again, I've never played a game that's... well, a simulation of my career. So that's a first. Going into it, I expected a lot of mistakes and some of the more common misnomers to fly right up in my face, but was shocked when I started to notice just how much care was taken in creating this work of art.   The music is on par, the scenery is awesome, the story is amazing.   Do yourself a favor and buy this. Best money I've ever spent on steam.   Bonus: The ending credits remind me *so* much of some of my fondest memories, going on western fire detail. That little addition was the icing on the cake. Campo Santo just HAD to make me all nostalgic. I'm not going to ruin it for you, but when you get to that point, you'll see what I mean.   Short and simple: Buy it.",

            "review_text": "Firewatch is a difficult game to review. On one hand, I liked it personally, but on the other hand, it definitely won't appeal to everyone. Some people will even go as far as to consider it a 'walking simulator' similar to Dear Esther, as the game generally consists of you walking from one part of the forest to another while chatting with your supervisor over the walkie-talkie. However, there are still some mild adventure game elements present; you will need to obtain a few tools to reach certain areas that would otherwise be inaccessible, and you will need some orienteering skills to navigate the forest using a map and compass. Furthermore, you are constantly presented with multiple dialogue options during the radio conversations with your supervisor, which subsequently influences each character's tone when speaking to one another - although it has no effect on the major events of the story. I believe that it can actually be beneficial to maintain a certain degree of linearity in the plot because it becomes difficult to tell a compelling story when there are too many branching paths for the player to take. That being said, the game still presented an adequate amount of interactivity to keep me engaged.  The biggest criticism most people have of this game is that they were disappointed by the ending. You will often hear people say that the whole game maintained an aura of suspense leading up to the finale, but then the ending fell flat since they were expecting something crazier. You will also hear that, while the ending resolves the central mystery of the plot, it raises even more unanswered questions that are left open to the player's interpretation, and people wanted more of a sense of closure. I personally think that the developers intended for the game to end this way; Firewatch has a very strong theme of realism, so it would only make sense for the ending to follow suit. However, I will say that I sensed some budget difficulties as I witnessed the ending. I won't spoil anytihng, but I'll say there were certain elements that could have easily been added to the ending if the developers had either more time or money.  Speaking of realism, the voice acting in Firewatch is nothing short of excellent, and it makes the characters very believable. No matter which dialogue options you choose, you can always see why the characters respond to each other the way they do. To top it all off, the environments in this game are absolutely gorgeous; you will feel as though you are walking through a real forest in Wyoming. You can clearly tell that the development team poured a lot of heart into Firewatch, despite consisting of only 11 people. Still, I think $20 is a lot to ask for considering the game is only 4 or 5 hours long. It might be best to buy it duing a sale, but I'd still say it's worth your time.",

            "review_text": "I went into Firewatch knowing nothing about it other than what the store page had.  I don't watch youtubers play games, so my purchasing wasn't based on seeing someone else play.  This game blew me away the moment I gained control of the character. The art style was just so unique and yet still very realistic. I felt connected to the character while making decisions at the beginning of the game.  The mystery element that shows up towards the middle of the game had me on the edge of my seat trying to think of what was going on. I was immersed in the story until the final act.  After a big reveal in the story, I felt like it was an easy cop-out and that the last portion of the game was very rushed. The ending left me wanting more.  There was no conspiracy to the 'mystery'. My time spent talking to the other character seemed wasted. The game describes as 'the only other person you can talk with' and 'will you be able to keep a relationship while you are alone?'   In all, I enjoyed the game as an artistic experience rather than a game. I find it hard to believe that it's priced as high as it is when you can beat it in less than 3 hours. There is plenty of opportunity to explore, but it's not an overly expansive world, so you can only really add another 1 to 2 hours of gameplay by exploring. If there was a neutral rating on steam, I would choose that. I liked the game and would recommend it to someone who wants an artistic experience, but I also wouldn't recommend it based on the price.",

            "review_text": "Interesting, but short. Plenty positive comments have been written about the lush graphics and amospherics, so asa counter I thought I would highlight a few poor design desisions / limitation kept breakintg the immersion for me.  1: Despite being out in the wilderness the world is suprsingly contained, lots of places you cannot go because the designer says so and corals you to a path. Only being able to climb 'special rocks' when they let you, being obstructed by a small bush, etc not quite invisible wall, but nearly. Frequently running into these artificial restrictions is jaring and reminds you your a rat in the designers maze, not free roaming the wilds of Wyoming.  2: It became apparent that there was not much character animation or even characters in the game, so despite the narative telling you to watch out because someone (or bear) might jump out and attack you. You knew it wasn't going to happen as that would require character animation. This also meant the anti-climatic ending was predictable.  3: You have to answer Delilah, your radio companion and narative driver within a short time period, but despite it being a small walkie talkie, you cannot use the radio one handed (even though this is how it is animated), so no reading the map and talking. This mean Delilah becomes quite disruptive, a chore and you often just want her to be quite and let you get on with the task in hand.  I would recomend it for the wonderful look, clean style and atmosphere, but in truth it left me feeling frustrated that it kept clumsily breaking the immersive spell so much effort had been put into creating.  (spoiler alert) The naritive is also a disapointment, the voice acting is great, compelling, the story builds in drama, there is a raging out of control fire threatening, are you the innocent suspect in a double murder? you are about too confront your elusive tormentor and finally meet the delectable Delilah your partner in adventure and crime, and then, meh, nothing, no payoff.  Given all the hype this game has achieved, what was delivered underwhelmed.  You need to decide if $20 is good value for a 3 hour game with no real replay value.",

Granted, this does leave the fate of the protagonist and his wife up for interpetation, but since this game is story driven, and plays at being driven by choice, this oversight detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game.  Overall, I think that this 'twinky' of a game - which can be completed in a quick 4 or 5 hours - is well worth the price of admission.   On a side note, I found this game to be significantly more pleasing to play with a controller than with a keyboard and mouse. Your milage may vary.",

Sadly, I had to settle for the lowest graphics settings.   That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you'll pay $10 to see a movie you want to see, I reckon you would gladly pay $20, $30 or even $40 to experience this game. The dialogue is excellent, the scenery sublime, and the atmosphere is itself playful, suspenseful, thrilling and frightening, as you hike your way through the story.  As far as narrative-based, story-driven short games go, this is one of the most enjoyable I have ever encountered.

No points lost there, it was unrelated to Firewatch itself.   Once that was fixed, I have been tackling the game in 30-60 minute chunks. I took it slow and read all of the papers, picked everything up and generally spoke on the radio as much as possible. (Except during the height of my paranoia when I avoided talking to D several times).  The experience is very different than what I expected going in, however the marketing was vague and designed I think to attract people in an expected way to an expected story. What you actually end up getting is something I haven't experienced in many games, and I think it's something along the lines of really feeling connected to the emotions of the main character. In the end I can't tell if it was for the same  reasons , but I was definitely empathetic with the situation, and had paid enough attention to eek out a few final observations on everything that was left unsaid.   There is a sense of faux interactivity in this world - it is quite linear and there is no 'game'. This is not just a side effect of 'walking simulators', at least in Firewatch I believe it's quite intentionally done to put you as much as possible, into H's shoes.

The near-walking-sim gameplay can be boring if not monotonous at times, but this isn't Rocket League. The gameplay isn't the focus, and the story is well capable of carrying the game. It's a twisting tale of spying and deception worthy of a mystery novel. A novel, however, would have lost two of Firewatch's greatest strengths (besides the story, of course).  One, it's gorgeous. It looks and sounds simply amazing. The visuals aren't gunning for photorealistic, and they don't have to. The game simply looks awesome, the sort of game where nearly any screenshot looks like concept art. The environment is pretty and well-designed, full of rolling hills, green plants, and rugged cliffs. The atmospheric effects combine with the haunting soundtrack (which plays at major plot points, Half-Life style) to bring the tense story to life, and the sound effects bring a surprising amount of realism to the slightly cartoony style.  The real reason to buy Firewatch, though, is the simultaneous isolation and connectedness brought about by its premise. You're in the deep woods, so people are few and far between. However, you have one connection to civilization: your radio, carried with you at all times. It is through this radio that Firewatch's story unfolds, and your developing relationship with the person on the other end is where the game really shines. Nearly every dialogue offers you a choice of words, and those words have a deep effect on your developing relationship, if not on the game's core storyline (which is fairly linear on its own). Every single dialogue choice is elaborated by some incredible voice acting work. The voices are relatable, believable, and really bring the two characters to life. And on the rare occasion that your radio fails you, you truly begin to feel alone.  I have only one real complaint with this game, and that is that it suffers from a few technical issues. The game's FPS varies wildly, and some scenes are quite obviously not optimized. I also managed to get into a situation where the game ceased to respond to keyboard inputs, forcing me to return to my previous save.  My last statement is one of cost: Firewatch has a very low price to gameplay ratio. I got it on sale, and well I thoroughly enjoyed it and would pay full price, you may not find 4 hours of gameplay to be worth $20. There is some replay value, but the story itself doesn't respond much to your input, only the subplot of your relationship with the one at the other end of the radio.  All in all, Firewatch was an enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend you try it. If you're on the fence about the price, go for it! You won't regret it.",

The game got a really great story, but all in all it's 'just' a walk simulator with an amazing walki talki talk the whole time and a superb environment (if you like the graphic style and play on max. settings mostlikely, but even on lower settings it looked just great). a bad thing is that choosing different answers in the dialogues wont change anything in the game and the main story will be just the same. different answers in talks are really just the details fo the talks in that moment and wont affect the, lets call it 'opinion', of Delaila. thats why -0.5 stars in my rating ;P If you plan on playing this game you shouldnt watch many gameplay videos about it because once you know the story it looses a bit of it's excitement since it's a story based game.  4.5/5 stars deserved.",

Pros:  + Interesting story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  + Great break from most mainstream shooter/RPG/sports/etc. games; this game is quite unique.  + Doens't hold your hand on where you need to go with waypoints or anyting. You have a map which displays your current location and a compass that tells you what direction you're walking and thats it.  + While the graphics are somewhat cartoony, they are very well done. Even the bugs had shadows (probably uncessisary and contributed to the FPS drops listed below).  Cons:  - The ending is somewhat anti-climatic. (I should note that its still worth the playthrough.)  - Random FPS drops, it would drop from 60 fps to 35-40fps semi-regularly, on a few rare occasions it would drop to 20fps (please note, this is not a twitchy shooter/action/sports game and the FPS drops aren't very noticable until they go down to 30fps or lower, and even still it doesnt look that bad. More often than not I didn't even notice unless I looked at the FPS counter.)  - Not much replayability. You could play it again and select different dialogue, but it wont affect the story much.",

Overall, this game is an emotional rollercoaster; joy, awe and sadness overwhelms you throughout the game.  I can definitely  recommend  this game to you all.  About the ending (SPOILERS):   A lot of people seem to be annoyed by the ending, calling it anticlimactic. Sure, they could have gone full conspiracy-mode for the ending, but I am glad they didn't. Instead of ending with the feeling of understanding and relief, you are left with the feeling of sorrow. You feel sorry for the kid, Brian, whose father forced him into trying climbing, leading to his death (Boy, during the credits, those pictures taken by Brian, they really kick you in the weak spot). You feel dissapointed about Delilah's desicion not to see you, after a whole summer of conversation about life.

Firewatch isn't a long game - in fact, I finished my first playthrough in just a few hours. I'm very pleased with both the depth of the game's story and the story's pacing.   The movement controls are pretty easy to get used to and usually accompanied by an onscreen tutorial, but the on-screen indicators could use a little bit of introduction. I missed a few early dialogue options before I realized that they have time-limited controls.   The game doesn't require much in the way of skill to navigate. Just an appreciation for good story and the curiosity to keep looking out for what comes next.   I'd recommend this to anybody.",

The story itself is sufficiently compelling if not entirely convincing upon its conclusion; it is not overly long and the dialogue somewhat restricted within a defined scope of possibilities, but what I found appealing was the visual style. The scenery is pleasingly depicted but also the camera style when climbing, jumping down drops and even jogging is novel: you can see your own feet and arms and such like. A limited endurance might have added a nice touch to that feel if the protagonist could get out of breath, but it might have just frustrated the pace of the game.",

It seems as though many people are focusing on the graphics and while this is an important factor that makes the game more enjoyable, the graphics aren't the reason this game is so important. This game deals with a lot of adult themes in very adult ways through the conversation Henry has with Delilah. I talked to Delilah as much as possible throughout my three and a half hour playthrough and I wish it was more. The reason for this is because of Delilah's sarcast yet caring nature which made me fall in love with her. The dialogue between Delilah and Henry is some of the best written dialouge I've ever heard and sitting here post game it blows me away. The ending of the game is what has a lot of people on the edge about whether or not this game was good or even worth their time and money. This game is not supposed to make the player feel safe and comfortable. It was designed for the player to make difficult decisions that affect multiple different lives, and not all the options are happy ones. People might be dissapointed by the ending but thats life, it contributes to the adult themes I was talking about earlier. Everything isn't always going to work out. Some things will go wrong, but the player (or character) needs to find a way to control the damage and move on. This expirience is something that should not be ignored and everyone should play it and enjoy it. It deserves no less than a 10/10 Well done Campo Santo",

Wow. Besides the flora rich environment, and the great pacing, this game packed some serious punch in the three hours of gameplay in its storyline. Henry is trying to escape some trouble back home with his wife who was diagnosed with a form of dementia, and he was no longer able to take care of her. His boss Delilah is the only other person who he has contact with throughout the game constantly. Feelings begin to fly and the two form a great relationship and friendship. Frelationship? I don't know. I digress.  What makes this game so great is the storyline. Many people were upset and could not get over the end (myself included) because it did not feel proper. It felt cut off, short, and very anticlimactic. However if you sit back and think about the process of the game and how Henry and Delilah progressed together and put two and two together about events that occurred (  H and D were paranoid about the potential Government employees spying on them, tapping into their radios frequency, listening to their conversations, which apparently was solidified when they thought the biologists camp was a monitoring station spying on them, but once H found out Ned was simply covering his end because of the death of his son, and making up everything as he thought they were out to get him, H and D suddenly realized everything they had done was out of human feelings of paranoia, and ultimately, for nothing.  ) you realize that it was simply basic human gut reactions. The final knife in the heart so to speak. We see ourselves in Henrys shoes, doing the exact same thing, and when everything we worked for was taken away (   Delilah leaving us and not staying, never meeting up like she wanted when she told you over the radio when she was flirting  ) we feel hurt, and betrayed, and confused. Almost like a 'Real life simulator 2016'.   Campo Santo really drew into human feelings and interaction in this game and really hit the nail on the head. I'm still not over it and I feel an emotional pull to this game, which is very hard to come by these days. I absolutely recommend this game.

You play as Henry who takes up a post at a firewatch tower in the Wyoming wilderness for the summer season. Henry's only human contact in this isolated environment is with Delilah, who is a colleague working in a neighbouring but distant tower and all Henrys interaction with her is through a walkie talkie radio. As you wander about the wilderness completing task you'll chat to Delilah via this radio with different dialogue options. The voice acting is brilliant and really makes the back and forth between Henry and Delilah is the games highlight.   The games environment is fantastic. Its features some breathtaking scenery and captures that feeling of isolation perfectly. Its great how the mood can fluctuate between peaceful and really tense out in that environment.   The games story is also quite good as early on in Henrys stay at the tower something starnge begins to unfold and Henry and Delilah try to get to the bottom of it.  Good points: - The interaction between Henry and Delilah is this games highlight and its helped by the fantastic voice actors for both characters. - The scenery and atmosphere in this game is incredible and it really captures of the feeling of being almost alone in the remote wilderness. -It has a great story which is great in the build up even if the ending was a bit lacking  Bad points: -The game does feel a bit padded out at times with long treks through the wilderness but exploring that beautiful scenery makes it less of a chore ",

The outcome of the dialogs were the same, in most cases, even Delilah's replies were the same. Once you know the story, there's no reason for you to play again. Unless, of course, you want to just walk around. - Content: I finished the game in 2.4 hours. That includes restarting a few days or restoring former saves.  Summary: is the game worth buying?

It's an adventure game that you can take your time with and really explore and thoroughly investigate stuff to your heart's content.   On the 'leisurely' note -- it took me quite a bit longer to finish than some other people, as well. 7 hours, rather than the 3-4 it seemed to take others. But then, I did just what I mentioned above... took my time with it and really investigated everything, to milk the story and characters for all they're worth. :)  It's also extremely witty and hilarious.

            "review_text": "Firewatch is a great game, but more importantly, has one of the most profound narrative experiences I've had from a game.  Graphically, there's a lot to love, The art style is fantastic. It gives the world such a beautiful, rich and colorful feel. And my goodness, is the world incredible to look at. The lighting effects, the varied scenery in form of trees, grass, water, rock, all gel together to form a beautifully scenic visual experience as a medium to experience the rich narrative of the game. Nothing to complain about the visuals of this game, simply splendid.  As for the gameplay aspects, there really wasn't much in the way of anything interesting. Exploring is enjoyable because of the rich visuals and dialogue, but gameplay is rather uninspired. It mainly takes the form of walking around and button presses to one-dimensionally interact with the environment (such as tap a button to chop a tree, open a supply crate, grab an item, open a door, etc). Simple traversal through areas is really the main form of gameplay. The best thing I can say about the gameplay is how much it evokes the sense of actually experiencing a nature hike, given the beautiful environments and just the organicness of using a compass and map to navigate. That just makes it feel so much more real It's a really immersive exploration experience.  I absolutely loved the character building of Henry and Delilah. One of the most amazing and meaningful developments of characters relationship I've ever seen in a game. The dialogue was fantastic. Fun, witty, extremely well voiced acted (probably the 'most real' I've heard in any game I've played), and most importantly incredibly natural and immersive. But even more so than the dialogue, both of these characters simply bled depth and their relationship was given one of the most complex and well thought out stories I've ever experienced.   It's amazing how well Henry and Delilah complement each other in the story. Both characters are clearly flawed, but more specifically, are shown to be running away from their problems. They are both in the same boat. Henry was unable to handle the situation with his wife (who has dementia) and took a firewatch job to escape the pressure. Likewise, Delilah had left her behind relationship with her boyfriend after his brother died, failing to be there for him and being afraid of facing him. This puts Henry and Delilah in a position to really understand and connect with each other, which can be seen happening as they get very close with each other. The truth is, they've found comfort and solace in each other as they share their past experiences and find out just how similarly they deal with their problems: running away, alcoholism, isolation, and avoidance. Their relationship blossoms because of this, and this makes the dynamic between the characters truly meaningful.  What is interesting as well, is the development of each character differs in how they deal with their problems throughout the story. Delilah is shown to be undoubtedly still running away. She speaks only through a radio with Henry, seemingly reluctant to meet him. She lies about having involvement in the incident with the missing girls in the police report, hoping to avoid the police. Most importantly, she decides not to wait for Henry when evacuating, despite his wishes to see her. She's been avoiding and running away from confrontation her whole life, and it really shows in the progress of the game. Now take Henry, who develops differently. Henry makes an effort to stop running away. He takes the initiative to investigate the strange events occurring around him. He tries to fix his problems. He even seems to stop drinking when he's on the job. The fact that he is the one doing the work really goes to show that unlike Delilah, he's really trying to change himself. Although these two characters come from the same position and grow close because of the connection they share, the difference in how they deal with their problems in the course of Firewatch really shows just how much they contrast each other as well.  In the end, the evacuation really reinforces the idea that both characters are still running away. But this time they are running away together instead of alone, as they've grown to understand and connect with each other. However the difference in how they are conveyed is that Henry is shown to still be trying to tie loose ends, by making an effort to meet with Delilah when they evacuate. It's easy to see that Henry is trying to stop running away. Delilah in contrast however, is unwilling to wait for Henry, and simply wants escape from her responsibilities, instead of looking to face them.  As can be seen, the relationship between Henry and Deliliah is really the centrepiece of the game. It's so much more complex and intricate than what most people who play the game give it credit for.   I've heard a lot of people call the ending disappointing, because 'nothing really happened or was resolved'. But I think people give it flak for the ending because they judged the game as a mystery-suspense story. It's not one. It's a drama. The mystery arc was simply a plot device for the development of Henry and Deliliah's story arc. The mystery car was not meant to be resolved because that's not what the game was focused on. People were expecting it to be, and felt empty when it wasn't, which is likely a prime reason for why there was an air of disappointment surrounding the ending. But it's not about the mystery story. It's all about Henry and Delilah and the progression of their stories and characters. It's about showing a bonding between two people, born out of the similarities between who they are how they deal with problems. It's about studying character interactions and development.  If I had a complaint, it would be that the game didn't really seem to fully 'complete' Henry and Delilah's character arcs, as they didn't progress as characters all that much and never really 'resolved' any of their problems and flaws. But I couldn't honestly expect a full character narrative, given that this game is only $20 and has only 4 hours of gameplay. It was simply meant to *show* character and relationship dynamics and how characters deal with problems and provide a thoughtful perspective on human interaction, thought, and behavior. Definitely a game I enjoyed more when I took the time to really think about it.",

I like to have a smooth and consistent frame rate experience. I put everything on ultra because I play all other games like so and get great fps. However w/ this game I had to set everything to low and still got major dips in the fps. Maybe I had to download a past update for Firewatch on Geforce, but that shouldn't be the case. Read online that Unity makes unoptimized games, but I don't have the evidence to personally state it as fact. Your experience may vary as did the community's.

            "review_text": "Firewatch is a pleasant experience the whole way through, the visuals are incredible, textures are extrememly detailed, and the using of lighting is phenominal. the gameplay keeps you interested and invested, as hiking around the forest isn't a thing the game forces you through, with 'waypoints' or lines that show up on the ground telling you where to go. you rely on a map and compass to get you to where you need to go and it can be very easy to get lost if not paying attention.  The environment also starts to feel familiar while playing, and you start to rely less and less on your compass and map to go places, as you recognise where you are and which way is the right way, as the environment do not feel 'samey' in any way, and landmarks and area's are very easily recognisable and memorable, making the game feel dynamic and leaving the player feeling in control.  the dialoge and story telling is one of kind when it comes to videogames, the writting is very very well done, as the story basically contains only 2 character (Henry and Delilah), you never feel bored with them or feel like things are becoming stale, you find yourself invested in the characters and never ever feel like skipping dialoge. you can feel the emotions in the actors dialoge and it never feels like simply 'an actor saying lines'. and being able to walk through the forest while simultaneously talking to Delilah is easy to do and is very fun and dynamic. press shift to bring up the radio, scroll to the one you wanna say, let go of shift, which is never interrupted by other actions done while exploring. your actions and movements feel like part of the environment, and you always feel connected with your surroundings, like your actually in and moving through a forest, rather then 'a player camera looking around a built environment'. it all feels very natural.  I know this was said earlier but the visuals are truely stunning, I typically don't tend to pay attention to graphics in games but you really cannot help but just stop and think 'jesus this beautiful' while playing this game, as well as how detailed textures are, as in most games I find when you zoom in on objects in the environment (books, vehicles, etc) you start to notice pixels or things poorly done with the texture, but in Firewatch zooming in on objects really proves to the player how much the devs cared about keeping Firewatch as immersive for the player as they could avoiding anything that could take the player out of it pixels are rarely seen and objects feel real. at points in the game you'll come across such stunning visuals that you'll feel like this should be something to take a photo of, which the game devs clearly realized by the fact the game hands you a camera and you can stop and take photo's whenever you like, and the photo's are showcased in the credits, which I felt was a very very nice touch.  the game itself is not long, which I appreciated but was also disappointed with both at the same time, because the devs didn't try and force the game to be long by forcing you to do unnecessary tasks or making paths longer then they needed to be. it told a nice concise story and didn't over stay it's welcome. I was disappointed simply because I never wanted this game to end.  if I were to say any negatives about the game I'd say that the ending in terms of story was satisfy and well done, but for me personally it didn't have any punch. not a bad ending by any means and I left it feeling satisfied, but it lacked any sort of 'wow' factor that the rest of the game had.  overall Firewatch is an immersive, thrilling and plesant experience which leaves the player in control, and tells a very well written and interesting story with incredible voice acting and characters.",

Other reviews say that they are disappointed by the ending, but imho it goes well with the atmosphere of the game: you become completely immersed into it, you experience feelings, and you also mold with the surroundings. Adding gore to the endng would've ruined all that. So there isn't much of it, and you can retain the pleasant feeling of having visited an autumnal forest. It doesn't mean that you won't experience suspense, barely sitting on the edge of your eats, though.  Gameplay is okay, however, I wouldn't say that your choices change a lot. Some of your actions and responses change the other responses, but I have a feeling that the plot of the game wouldn't change at all.  Graphics are great, but my PC couldn't candle them all without lagging. Still, wasn't disappointed even at low settings.  Overall, I recommend the game, if you want to feel elated from going outside in an astonishing forest, but it's December and you are in Siberia or Yukon.",

I try to gauge games by how much fun I am having while playing them and this game was not necessarily fun to play, but it was relaxing for me since I played it after work when I was tired.

Campo Santo did such an outstanding job at casting voice actors that matches the story, and the banter between the two characters. By far, my favorite thing about the game.  Firewatch is also visiually stunning. Campo Santo has their own styalized adaption of the Shoshone National Forest that is both unique and beautiful. It ran near perfect at 60fps on ultra settings, with a GTX1080.  The soundtrack is also great! It does an amazing job at capturing an 80s vibe, as well as being ominous.  The only downside to the game is that it ended too quickly!  If you are looking for a story driven game that's full of mystery, you must play Firewatch.",

Also the intro is both a personality test for your character and a good back story.  Cons: There is a lot of walking and it can be easy to get turned around until you get a feel for the landscape.

I said to myself that if this game is over in the next hour I'm refunding it. And thankfully I was wrong. This game is like digging for gold. You start off with some dirt, you dig a little more and you see traces of gold and then you hit the jackpot. This game has a beautiful soundtrack, breathtaking views, and a theme that connects with me at this exact moment in time. The theme is about (in my eyes) running away from your problems, the forest being isolation and the fires you have to snuff out being the confrontations. Until a giant forest fire occurs you mostly enjoy the bliss of being alone. But the giant forest fire is the final confrontation, you can run but you can't hide. Pros- Good soundtrack Lovely forest Interesting theme Relaxing Kind of funny at parts You can steal people's stuff, I stole this kid's plastic dinosour and could've stolen this girl's boom box Cons- Easy to get lost ending is a bit iffy You have the option to flirt with your boss but you realize that the wife you already have who you only know through text (not speech), so of course your going to get attached to your boss more then your wife",

People make the argument that it's trying to show that it's all life. It's disappointing, you aren't special (how Henry and Delilah weren't actually being tracked by the government), and showing how people deal with their problems and fears (by running away from them). I feel like this was just lazy, sloppy, and felt rushed. I wanted to see Delilah. I wanted to see Julia, I wanted to see Ned. I wanted to see Ron and Dave (what even came of these guys? Literally nothing). I wanted to see myself. But most of all, I'd have liked a different final act all together. I was ♥♥♥♥ing terrified playing this game. When I showed up to the already wrecked campsite of the teenagers (who magically appear alive at the end of the game, whoopee) it started feeling eerie. Then the notes of the walkie talkie conversations. Then I started to doubt Delilah even more. She was just someone up in a tower so far away that I'd never seen and that I just began to immediately trust, and that started to wean. Then when I was hunting the trail of the hunters I was just so ♥♥♥♥ing creeped out- it was legitimately scary. Don't even get me started on the cave near the end. The ideal ending for me would have been for all the missing people (Ned, Brian, the teens, Mitch (the random dude who went missing around the lake- the ♥♥♥♥ happened to this guy anyway? They've never said anything more about it)) all of those missing people were in a government facility in the cave where they were tortured and being tested cruelly and it was gonna be dark, disturbing, and creepy. The game could have been horrifying. Instead, in the course of five minutes it's revealed that it's just crazy ol Ned and the whole thing doesn't matter and then BOOM the ending and you're disappointed. I'll give the dead Brian good value for being eerie, sad, depressing, and great objectively for the story.        Anyway, the game was good but it lost all scariness once the Ned reveal came about, and when I beat it, I actually completely forgot I'd been scared at all when playing, that's how much it was ruined. The game wasn't meant to be scary, and I've played and watched many scary games and movies which don't get to me what-so-ever, but this one did. The paranoia of being alone and feeling watched made my skin crawl. When I had to go the creek near the scout camp after D was acting quite strange over the radio, I could swear I heard rustles in the bushes and it was freaking me out so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much. It may very well have been the scariest moment in any game in my life.      All in all, the game's ending could have used a lot of work, but I don't regret my purchase, my time spent playing, and I'd definitely recommend it to friends.",

One of the titles was this game. Read few sentences, watched the trailer and looked for Firewatch on Steam.  Let's see the game. I do not want to spoiler anything about its story so I just summarize my feelings.  CONS: - The play time/price factor is not very good. One can purchase a game with much more play time for that amount of money. - I'm quite a fan of role-playing games. Although this is not an RPG, but it's mostly dialogue driven and I cannot play a lawful-good character. There are many choices but all point to almost the same direction and you cannot be, cannot play the good guy in shine armor on a white horse. Even when you try to act as good as possible the story does not let it happen. I understand that the developer tried to minimize the characters, events, interactions but dispite of all that, I missed the opportunity. - The story is written. No matter how hard you try to change the main narrative, it remains the same.  PROS: - The game created such a unique atmosphere that I hardly noticed how time passed - The dialogues are well written, they enlighten events from the past - The player can easily immerse into the game's beautiful world. I sometimes went hiking in the woods just for fun and to take some pictures of the wildlife. - At the end, for $15 the authors can send you hardcopies of your shots, so try to make really amazing pictures.  All in all, I liked the game, I recommend the game even if you could purchase it on a sale. For me it is like a point&amp;click adventure game in a charming, fascinating environment. Do not expect complex riddles, just live the life of a not-completely-ordinary man in the wilderness.",

It's fairly short (&lt;8 hours), but somehow that seems fitting for a game of this magnitude. I bought Firewatch on sale at $12, and for what is essentially the price of a modern day movie ticket, this game is absolutely worth it.  You're put in the shoes of a man who's life has gone astray. His personal relationship has fallen apart due to circumstances out of his control, and he is immensely troubled. He decides to escape into nature for a summer, only to find himself in the midst of mysterious events that test his sanity and his convictions as he develops a repertoire with his supervisor, the only contact he has.  Yes, it's a walking simulator, but one in which you're in charge of how your character responds to the supervisor on the other end of the walkie talkie. And it's one in which you constanly guessing what will happen next, all alone in the beautiful, desolate nature of Wyoming.  I would love to have more games like this, especially it they develop on the 'your choices' affecting the storyline.

            "review_text": "First of all let me say I knew nothing about this game going into except for the fact it was on sale. Secondly, lets dive on into it.  Pros:  1) Beautiful scenery. Thats literally the first thing you'll notice about the game and its spectacular.  2) Relatable character. Even if you have never been in Henry's shoes, you can easily feel empathy and understanding for him. 3) Steady pacing. The game moves at a relatively steady pace, not too fast where it feels like you're at the end already, and not too slow where you have no idea where the hell the end is. 4) You get to have choices, which for me is a personal pro.   Cons: 1) The choices you make don't seem to impact the game at all. (This can be a con if you feel like they should which is obvious, but for me I didn't really care if my choices mattered or not, I just chose with what I felt during the story.) 2) The only person you see is at the end, you don't even get to see Henry or other people (For some this isn't a con, but I felt like If I was going to relate to a character I wanted to at least know what I looked like)  3) The story is HELLA short. I wanted more out of this game because it was so good, but sadly the story is short. 4) The ending really didn't satisfy me. (This is commonly seen throughout reviews for this game, simply because it's true.) The ending makes sense, but it's also not as satisfying as it could've been.  All in all, the game is great and I'd recommend this to anybody. It's thrilling, easy to follow, and beautiful. At least a solid 9/10.",

            "review_text": "If you expect big action or fast paced gameplay then you should search somewhere else. But Firewatch delivers a beautiful story, with a lot feelings at a slow pace. There are no big decisions to make and the fate of the world doesn't depend on your actions. In Firewatch you enjoy little moments, it really is great in setting the mood with a quiet somewhat melancholic tone at first wich develops into a paranoid feeling, wich is often broken up with some good comic relief that mostly comes from the conversations with D.  It takes about 4-5 hours to get through the story, wich is short, but I felt like that was some quality time and somehow justified the price of 12 € (wich is about as much as a cinema visit around here). Even if Firewatch is the real 'walking simulator' it never felt boring, I had fun exploring the Forest and thanks to your walkie talkie it always stays interesting. They did a great job on that, I somhow even felt that I missed the chatter when it wasn't possible due to some reason. The soundtrack/sounddesign does a very good job helping you to get in the mood and adds a lot to this game.  The flow of the gameplay is mostly unhindered. Sometimes the controlls could be a bit more precise, like standing on the wrong place in front of a fallen over tree to walk over it. But it isn't that bad. The graphic style is really nice, but could have used some polish here and there I was noticing way to much texture seams on rocks and whatnot.   I would buy it again. Lovely crafted game, with a deep, heartwarming story and a great feeling to it.",

Yes, it is short (I beat it within 3 hours) but if you really take your time and explore outside of the where the story takes you to, then you will find alot of amazing detail in this game. The story it self was amazing, I'd rate it an 8/10 overall! If youre looking for a casual game to help you relax from the stresses of your day, then look no further then Firewatch. I can't wait to see what CampoSanto brings up next!",

            "review_text": "I've never written a review before, but I've decided to do so for this game to express how deeply dissapointed I am with it.   I thought the game was a great idea and provided a mysterious experience I could share with my girlfriend-- and at the very beginning it had us guessing--but only at the very beginning. Honestly, a mystery story is only really a mystery when there's more than one suspect. This game mentions 4 people, one of them is you, one of them is your ally, and one is incapable of the actions that are 'mysterious'. Right from minute one you know how it ends if you spend any time thinking it.  A casual story game with minimal mechanical gameplay is usually only good when the story is emersive and thoughtful. Instead I solved the mystery in 15 minutes and waited 3 hours to NOT receive any closure or be left with any question; it ends exactly how it started: depressing and simplistic.   I would recommend this game to anyone who's never played video games before because it's extremely forgiving (i.e. you can't die, your decisions aren't that impactful at all despite the time limit for responses and the large amount of them). I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for a real story that makes the player think.",

It's not a game which boasts complex machanics or which would test your skills in any way; it's a narrative interactive experience. The voicework is really enjoyable and there are plenty of little details to pay attention to and put together if you want. I'd say its definitely worth the price of a DVD with a good movie; you'll get about 3-4 hours of content from it (a bit more if you delve into extras), so it's best to play it in one sitting and really get into it.  Oh, and you have an option of disabling the GPS showing your position on the map. Do it. Enjoy the landmarks. Navigate yourself.",
