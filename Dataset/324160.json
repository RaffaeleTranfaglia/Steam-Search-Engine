Clannad is the best visual novel of all time, a roller-coaster ride of emotions that will change your life.   The popular question of, 'Is it really worth $50?' Yes, in fact, it is worth infinitely more. You can't monetize a life changing experience, and playing through Clannad will provide exactly that.",

There is a common japanese comment on CLANNAD -- “CLANNADは人生(CLANNAD is life)”. Which means CLANNAD give you another feel of life.  This game have a lot of routes and you really need time to finish it. With all finished and all dialogue listened, maybe about 80-100 hours no repeated experience. So it is very worth the price, (if you think just a visual novel cost too much you are wrong). BTW, the game need you finish every routes in school chapter to unlock the 'after story'. And the after story is the best in the game so dont end before finish it.  And the Developer KEY is very famous with Kanon, Air, Little Busters etc. They even have a game about one of CLANNAD heroine Sakagami Tomoyo named 'tomoyo after'.  Also these are two animes from the game named 'CLANNAD' and 'CLANNAD after story'. I think you can find it easy for digital and blue-ray box version.   At last, thank to KEY/Visual Arts for such a excellent game to player. Also thank to Sekai Project to make a english steam HD version of it(though i have finished it for many years on multi platform in japanese).",

This was one of the best purchases I've made on Steam and, just like how its anime counterparts are on the very top of my lists for most favorite anime series of all time, it'll take a hefty and severe kick to knock these down my lists. I instantly fell in love with Clannad back when the first season first aired. It's the only anime that I've actually gone back and watched multiple times while still having the same impact on me every time. Since I never got my hands on the original VN and heard this was coming to Steam, I knew right then and there that it wasn't just some random purchase. It was a purchase that I NEEDED to make. I've truly fallen in love with this series and that love still stands firm to this day. Clannad is one of those masterpiece anime that is VERY rare to find these days. Most anime can't even match up to the level Clannad was brought up to. The soundtracks make the anime and the VN a thousand times better.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I never would have tried this VN (or any VN for that matter) were it not for Clannad's anime adaptation. It was my first VN and I highly recommend it. If were like me and typically played FPS, RPG, and RTS games but never gave a VN a chance, Clannad is the VN to take the risk on.   If you like anime at all I'm sure someone has recommended that you watch Clannad. IMO, the anime is really good but assumes you have some additional understanding from the VN. While both the anime and VN are Clannad, the anime and VN tell the stories slightly differently. In the anime, which I think is better understood if you play the VN, most of the routes are somewhat combined so all the characters make an appearance. Fuko's, Kotomi's, Mei's, and Tomoyo's routes are blended fairly well into Nagisa's story (however the anime doesn't do everyone justice, for example Kappei doesn't even make an appearance). In the VN by contrast, most of the routes are fairly separate from the various characters. The anime's and VN's stories are similar in that their primary route is Nagisa's but each approach the story differently.   The strength of this VN is that there is more dialogue, alternate routes, and information not provided in the anime. I also had some of my questions about the anime answered by the VN's explanations. That said, the VN is long and if you aren't into reading then you may prefer to just watch the anime as you will cry just as much watching the anime as you will playing this game. If you are like me however, this VN will have won you over to try other VNs. I plan on picking up Tomoyo After in the near future.  TLDR: If you've never played a VN before given this one a chance. If you still can't be bothered to do that, at least watch the anime. I think it is one of the best anime's I have ever watched.",

The first part is a harem style VN with branching storylines. Some storylines are stronger than others but they all serve to flesh out the world and it's people.  The second half of the game becomes a slice of life VN. Because you've played the first half you become a little more connected with the protagonist and the situation. (I honestly did not like the guy in the first few hours.) One of the core concepts of this VN is   family.   I think a lot of what makes a good VN is the ability to relate these concepts in your own personal life - this game definitely brought it.  If you enjoy VN's I recommend playing through this one. It'll definitely get you laughing and if you're not too cold, you may even shed a tear or two. It took me 40 hours to get to the true ending so there's a lot of content here.",

            "review_text": "Alright, here's a review from a jaded and critical visual novel enthusiast. If you eat up visual novels like candy, there's no reason not to think that you'll love Clannad, as most of these reviews are pointing out. But maybe you're like me and are a bit tired of outdated anime tropes taking up hours of your time for a simple misunderstanding, or because the girl is 'too embarassed'... well, honestly, Clannad has some of that too. Refreshingly though, it's really not that jarring nor frequent.  Let's get the cons out of the way first, for a big purchase like this you should know what you're getting into if you have high standards. Obviously I'm in the 'you should buy it' camp, but there is still room for some eye-rolling. If you want to get every route in the game, there's a route with a creepy over-sexualization of a minor (nothing sexual happens, but she is sexualized), not to mention that route suffers from one of those obnxious over-the-top suffering scenes, where really a teacher should have been called. It's about the worst it gets though. Besides that, there are a few repetitive jokes, and semi-overt anti-gay sentiment (mostly, they say people are gay to make fun of them), and a lot of casual Japanese-themed sexism. It's not as bad as other games, but seeing as this came out early 00's, you probably shouldn't expect it to feel very progressive. The girls are pretty diverse and interesting, but every once in a while it throws in a line like, 'you shouldn't help me because you're a boy' which is like... meh, I 100% would have helped with her sewing, I'm not scared that thread is going to suck my testosterone dry... whatever.   But on the positives, this is a really fun game. The main character is fleshed out very well over time, and is refreshingly honest and straight-forward for the most part. He is lazing about going day-to-day without any real goals or meaningful relationships. There are tons of different paths you can go on, not just with different girls, but interacting with different groups of friends depending on how to act. It's very in-depth with its ability to bring several elements together based on your previous actions. It's interface is also probably the best I've seen, very easy to use and helps with whatever you need.   It's hard to describe 80+ hours worth of story and characters, while at the same time covering mostly just a month or so of time. This game feels professional, yet it can sometimes feel like you're just hanging out with your friends. There's lots of lessons in this game that resonated with me, and a lot of jokes that make me laugh out loud. I'm usually pretty stoic when I'm reading, so it was a pleasant surprise when it was able to make me laugh and cry. If you're like me, this isn't a crazy tearjerking festival, but it cetainly went far enough to make me tear up on the route I was most invested in. This is good though, because it means this isn't melodramatic. There are difficult things that happen, but they all feel very realistic and earned.   To me, some routes felt a bit forced at parts, or maybe they appealed more to a Japanese audience, but overall the stuff that worked REALLY worked. Even characters I hated at first became dear to me in their own way. Unlike most VN protagonists, I never feel frustrated by Okazaki. He was light-hearted, easy-going, and pulled a lot of pranks. He has tons of issues to work through, but probably ended up being my favorite character of the game. It's nice to have a protagonist who's a underdog, but still feels like he deserves being admired by all these girls. I'd want to be his friend too, and it's nice to see him get off his ♥♥♥ and find a reason to keep going.   So tons of varied content, realistic slice-of-slife with down-to-earth problems, doesn't take itself too seriously or poke fun too much, and professional interface and voice acting. It's probably not going to blow your mind like something with sci-fi or supernatural/horror, but you'll probably remember it for a really long time, like it was a school year of your own.",

Miscellaneous: Dangopedia gives insight on old school Japanese culture. Comfortable controls. Might feel outdated, but that's par for the course (CLANNAD's first release was in 2003).

            "review_text": "Making this review as I just hit the 50 hour mark at the completion of my 5th route. I bought this game while it was on a half-off sale because I had just finished watching the two anime seasons and immediately came to regard Clannad as the best anime I've ever watched. The anime made someone like me, who didn't even feel sad while watching various other emotional anime, cry for a whole day. Two days even. Maybe even three. Of course, when I finished it I just had to go get the visual novel.  Purchasing the visual novel was a great idea. I know full well what I'm getting into when I go into most of these routes. Of course I do, I watched the anime, which covered a lot of these. However, it didn't feel any less emotional when they hit me. In fact, I've cried about things while playing that I didn't cry about while watching. I've done 5 routes in 50 hours, so that's about 10 hours per route for me. That's a lot of time I'm spending getting as much dialogue as I can from certain characters, and I end up getting more attached to the characters in the game than I did in the anime. I can't help but feel sad when it's time for the emotional punches.  Clannad is known for its sadness, and its sadness is something I couldn't resist myself, to the point of tears. However, at the end of the day, Clannad has always made me feel more happiness. Both the anime and the game have given me lots of happiness. The characters are all charming, the romance is adorable, and I find myself laughing like an idiot at some points. Sometimes I'll find out my mouth hurts because I've had the biggest grin for a while. I absolutely love the game's soundtrack, both the upbeat and the sad music.  I don't dislike a single thing about this game, and I can only have more great experiences as I continue to play this past the 50 hour mark. I just had to give it a positive review. Clannad is a masterpiece.",

Learn the importance of a family by being a part of a great one in this visual novel, which often makes you very emotional to the point of crying as you care deeply for the characters &amp; become part of their lives as much as they become a part of your life( I genuinely felt bad during the day of graduation as I would never meet my friends at high school again everyday,Im talking about the game not my graduation in real life).And as the game will tell you.. family is where you make it, it does not neccesarrily have to be your parents alone.

Come November 23rd and we finally have Clannad in English on steam!! I can only imagine how much longer others have been waiting compared to me.   Playing the VN takes some time to get used to if you are used to watching it in crisp 1080P on blu-ray before this and the anime had much better drawn characters but the VN gets it's point across to you quite well, only having been in the game for a little under 2 hours now and I have already seen a fair bit of content I have not seen/read in the anime!

I look forward to seeing the paths of the character relationships as the game progresses and look into getting Okazaki with the other girls and seeing how that plays out, however I think we all know which pairing is the best xD ( dango? )  As a Clannad Fan, I would give this a 9/10 ( More of a personal preference, kind of a tough one since I know this VN is actually from 2004 but me personally just going from the blu-ray anime to this kind of annoyed me but 9 is still great, the resemblence to the anime is very good with the exception of some minor details at times but the asking price of $50 is high in my opinion for an old game which isn't quite on the same level of visual quality as Tales Of Grisaia for example )   For people who have yet to watch or know pretty much anything about this series I still highly recommend you get this VN, but if you want better value purchase copies of Clannad and Clannad afterstory on blu-ray then buy this later on when hopefully the price drops some so you can get yourself into more Clannad content as I am currently experiencing! :3",

It's not actually depressing, it's just very good at messing with your feelings.  It's also REALLY friggin' long! Each route on it's own feels like it could be a book in itself.",

BGM are especially good at setting the mood. Art may seem strange at first but once reading you quickly get used to it.  Both scenario, music, and artstyle make this VN a legendary work.",

            "review_text": "I was first introduced to Key with the anime adaption of this game, I did not however start with the original and rather watched After Story without knowledge of the game or other anime adaptions based on them. I would in turn latter watch other works that were based on or related to Key such as angle beats and learned of the games. In time I found myself interested in a kinetic visual novel named Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet (Which I am very interested in the movie coming out for it.) This at the time was one of the few games on steam with the anime style which I craved. It was an amazing Gem that I had found and I finished it on new years day as people were celebrating as I was to be blunt crying over a game. Around this time I found interest in these games and searched far and wide for a copy of games such as Clannad, with a few fake versions out there I lost interest in trying. I did still find interest in studying the game and Key. I then found out that OtakuUSA was putting ads out for the new English version of Clannad. My hype went up but I was not able to get to it till recently due to the sale prices allowing me more room for spending. After playing through a portion I had found the game to meet each quality the anime and their other works had given me to expect.    Mainly the characters are very interesting and become very charming to an extent as you play and feel as if you are in the game, it helps to add in your own name making them yell at you with your name (With san added) more interesting and comical to me. The art in comparison to the original version from japan has improved but not as much compared to the giant jump of other visual novels such as Higurashi, but this is mainly since the art was already very well done alike to their other works. The art also as I should note mainly focuses on giving the characters big chins which always reminds me of the game that was panned in the world god only knows called One Leaf that had the character Yotsuba Sugimoto with her big chin small face.     Along with this the lines and story in general takes you around a natural organic line of emotions that allow for a human element to be felt. Another great inclusion in the game is the Dongopedia which allows non Japanese players to have a better grasp on what the characters are talking about which without it would probably be many lost jokes and poor understanding, it however would be hard integrate so much cultural understanding into the game in a more organic or natural form as it would both bog down the game with exposition and two cause many troubles with the story in general. I personally like the immersion of the game and would love a working naturally way to allow for this understanding but really the only way to get it is living there for sometime.    For the music it may at times feel off from what you expect, I am not sure if it fits with the tone or area always even know the music is lovable and amazing, it mainly gives me the feeling I am descending from the heavens or some magical place. It is amazing and I enjoy listening to it but the above remains true no matter how much I like it. At times it works out for some amazing scenes though, with the game Planetarian I felt the music often depicted how the scene was very well and allowed for alike amazing scenes though such as one where you watch the character aim his grenade launcher at a large machine.    This game had in turn spawned many titles from makers inspired, wanting to do better, or to compete. In turn I played many games that clearly have inspirations but also can relate my past experiences to this game. I view many of these visual novels as experiences in general so its greate to be able to relate so many to this game which in turn means it is doing a good job at pulling both on my emotion and nostalgia. For example Nagisa Furukawa speaks about how she was unable to be at school due to her sickness, this reminded me somewhat of narcissus somewhat ( A more serious and more depressing case of sickness) which in turn made me feel even more sorry for her even know the situation was not as grave as in the other game.    For a cute factor the characters are mainly cute thanks to their relatability, humanity, and conversations that allow you to bond to them, in comparison to acting cute and looking cute you have games such as Nekopara (Which when not on steam is an eroge and also has many hentai products.) Even know Nekopara is a fun and good game It lacks that bonding and relatability to the characters which make these as said earlier experiences. Clannad is mainly a clean fun and emotional story. It does not try to play to being about satisfying your wants and rather goes to telling a story that reaches the human element in us all and does so masterfully.    For interaction there is a fair amount and can be considered a dating sim almost due to being a harem based anime game where you are most likely as a player trying to have one of these characters fall for you. These being called paths in the dating sim game genera. I would consider it a dating sim myself but very tame compared to others, the decisions are not as frequent as dating sims and the game mechanics are not based around dating such as other games like Huniepop and newer dating sim. The choice you make do lead you down paths still that can lead to love but the focus as said is more on story.    So lastly I would recommend this game mainly on it being an amazingly well written story, and with all its options it allows for a multitude of ways for this amazing story or stories to be told. I find most problems to be more comical then deal breaking and do not detract from the game at the slightest. Along with recommending this game alike recommendations would clearly be all the other Key studio's works both anime and game Planetarian being most notable, Keys anime and Manga are also amazing in story and art and if you find interested in this you may find interest in the all female group clamp and its works. Even know their art is more stretched looking it is amazing. For another visual game developers I would recommend stage nana makers of Ame no Marginal -Rain Marginal- and Narcissu.",

Faces look really unnatural, weird (Yes even for an anime style) and doesn't even stay entirely consistent depending on their angle of view. As you'll be spending a lot of time in front of these i honestly can't stand it.  If only i could get over the art quality i'd be totally happy with this as i liked the anime adaptation a couple of years back and have been dying to try this one out. But i just find it unbearable and therefore i'll refund it considering the asking price isn't what i'd call on par with the quality i'd expect. Though if you are a person who finds all the screenshots appeasing enough then i'd say go for it.  Edit: Just to clarify. This is simply my opinion and impression. I'm not saying it is objectively bad, just wasn't what i expected.",
