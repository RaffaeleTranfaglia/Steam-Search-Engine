            "review_text": "Unreal 2 starts very real, introducing your character, an ex-marine that patrols space for the Terran Colonial Authority with his cozy little spaceship, a funny pilot and a hot female companion (oh and the techie that gives you a bunch of new guns and mods after each mission). The dialogue is fun and the graphics holp up very well but the gameplay is slow and the loading times ridiculous (maybe it has something to do with my system but playing on 'hard' means you will see more of the loading screen than the actual game even when returning to a quickload). LOADING-STANDBY-INITIALISING...The psychodelic intro is nothing like the game. It was probably hard to top the creepiness and sense of alienation you had in the original, as well as it's speed and agility. Still, the game has enough variety in the settings (very different planets and climates) and the weapons (very cool stuff including a flamethrower, turrets, and even a spiderthrower) to make it worthwhile.",

            "review_text": "Unreal 2 was amongst the first games to use Unreal Engine 2, Epic's technology that for years rivalled with id software's own engine. Still, after the first Unreal we had to wait 5 years for this and 2003 was just a year before 2004, the year when a lot of big names appeared; each offering something new in terms of technology (Far Cry, Doom 3 and Half Life 2, just to name a few).  Interestingly, the developer was Legend Entertainment, the guys behind the expansion pack of the first Unreal game (the company has since gone defunct) and it is a shame they could only come out with a generic shooter. While graphically the game was amazing it had little to do with Skaarj, the main antagonist species we fought so hard in the first episode. The story now is very different (but then again Quake 2 had nothing to do with Quake 1, right?); it revolves around an artifact our marine hero is set out to retrieve.   Gameplay-wise Unreal 2 is quite exciting: with John we regularly return to his ship to converse with his companions who can prepare us for the next mission. This hub area has free roaming characteristics until the moment you commence your next mission which is very linear. We visit several planets; all with its own visual theme (we have deserts, snowy areas and even an alien spaceship here) just to make the gameplay more interesting.   Too bad that there are too many cutscenes (the generic dialogues make them boring after a while) and for some unknown reason the game only has very generic weapons. Where is the Flak Cannon we have grown to like? Here you have rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers - all too generic even with their alternative fire mode.  The game offers a decent, 9-10 hour long campaign but not multiplayer. I understand Legend came out with an expansion just to add the missing feature to the game. Still, Unreal 2 is a mixed bag. Its unique weapons disappeared from the sequel and while the story was interesting there was not much to go on with the Skaarj. The voice actor for the main protagonist was a definite miscast.  It runs well, though. There are some error messages upon launching the game but using Windows XP compatibility mode can solve all the problems. I am upvoting it mainly for sentimental reasons (after all, it was a good pastime before the new generation of FPS games were released in 2004) but perhaps you are better off with the Gold edition of the first game.",

            "review_text": "I remember playing this when I was younger, and I didn't realise how incredibly generic the entire game is. It's in that awkward period of time where FPS games followed iconic predecessors like Half Life and Quake but did very little to differentiate themselves from it. The movement is slow and clunky, the enemies move erratically, the story is bland and the graphical themes aren't much to write home about in 2003. A huge departure from the original Unreal. The weapon selection is pretty good, however some of them are plagued with slow projectiles and short ranges.  Unless you're playing for nostalgia's sake, I wouldn't recommend it. Use your time playing the original or Unreal Tournament instead.",

            "review_text": "This game brought back childhood memories, and that may have been one of the main reasons I enjoyed it. This game is excellent (as long as we forgive voice acting), adding a variety of weapons each with their own unique alternative functions. The storyline is great.  There is some cons, though. Your character moves unbearably slow, and you have to use cheats in order to accelerate him to a playable speed. There is a variety of enemies you will face, but the apparent main enemy you are supposed to be fighting is the Skaarj an they are there in very few missions. The replayability of the game is low, not to mention that you may become frustrated when you completely forgot to save (there is no autosaves) and then are forced to restart the mission.  Ultimately, I loved the game. It was a throwback to the days when games were original and good, and ultimately gave me a shot back at the past.",

            "review_text": "Perhaps the least known game of the Unreal series - for a reason. It does not feel like Unreal, does not sound like Unreal, does not even look like Unreal. There is just one alien race and three names of corporations reminding you of the other games of the series.   Not everything in this game is bad. Graphics are really nice for a 2003 game, and you fight in a wide variety of different environments, from a standard desert military base to the internal organs of a huge planet-covering alien creature. The TCA Atlantis, your own spaceship, has many nice details in its rooms.   Unfortunately, it lacks all the best aspects of the first Unreal. Maps and missions are very linear and predictable. Your movement in the bulky mech suit is clumsy and slow. The way of combat is quite different, not necessarily bad but not appealing to the fans of fast FPS. Background music isn't as impressive as in the first U. Storyline is OK but also quite short and flat. You won't feel the same mysterious atmosphere that made the first Unreal so great.   Want something like Unreal? A fast-paced survival FPS? Do not buy this.   Want a generic sci-fi tactical shooter? You might like this, although I'm pretty sure there are better alternatives.  Overall grade: 4/10",

Where to start? Story: General and cheesy with low budget actors and no room for character development. Weapons: While some have interest concepts, the weapons in this game feel like they do extremely low damage to every enemy. Music: Generic and forgetable I could go on like this with something negative about every aspect of the game. To top it off the game is forcebly making the main character run VERY SLOW giving the idea that the game is longer than it actually is and surprise,it does not have a multiplayer which is the most interesting part of the Unreal series. Do yourself a favour and stick to the Unreal Tournament series and give this one a pass.",
