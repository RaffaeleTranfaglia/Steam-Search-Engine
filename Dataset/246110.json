            "review_text": "A very frustrating game. A full campaign took me a little under 22 hours to finish. There's too much I can complain about, so I've reduced this review to major grievances.  Gameplay can get boring real quick. Prepare to fight in the same maps over and over again. With 3 classes (plus 6 breedable hybrids that have minor tweaks) there is not a lot of variety. I wish there was more to do in the game. I wish you could be more proactive in fighting the Cadence, in some way taking the fight to them. Staring at a timeline waiting for the Cadence to attack is a very dull experience. The random events in-between attacks do more harm than good. I constantly lost buildings, heroes, and gained negative traits. Each time the timeline stopped for a random event I dreaded it. There's practically no story, no lore. 300 years of defending against an enemy and I knew nothing about them. I was hoping that the ending would explain or at least give some insight into the Cadence, but of course it didn't. The ending is very short, vague, and feels like a cliffhanger.",

            "review_text": "If XCOM-style gameplay in a fantasy world sounds interesting, Massive Chalice might be worth a look. There are 3 aspects of the game that really stand out:   Combat, units, equipment:  With a few base unit types and a variety of different equipment types, armor, etc (that you slowly research by killing certain types of enemy units) the strategic turn-based combat was really fun. I loved scouting and flanking with invisible hunters to find “nests” of enemies for my alchemists to lob grenades into and then warriors to charge in afterwards.   Your land:  The “base-building” side to the game is pretty unique in that you might build a structure on the outskirts of your land for a large short-term bonus, but you know that it will eventually fall into dust later on and it makes you question if you want to “waste” the years of that build time. The buildings and bonuses are pretty cool too.   Heros and bloodlines:  This is the most unique part of the game for me. The war lasts 300 years, and your heros do not! A huge part of the game is managing and creating the Houses and Bloodlines of your kingdom, making them stronger, worrying about babies, and training babies to become your future epic heros. Along with that, if you marry cross-class the offspring will be hybrid units (parts from each skill tree)! There are 6 hybrid classes, making a total of 9 classes in the game. The concept that was just so cool to me is during this 300 year war, heros are born, fight in their prime, maybe die during battle, but then definitely die of old age, and hopefully after they have birthed some offspring and started to train them.  The art style is pretty refreshing as well and the controller support is excellent, just sit back and strategize!  Really, the big complaint I have is about what happens after the 300 years:    Once you reach the 300 year mark, you need to engage in one final, huge, battle to defend the chalice. The issue with this “wave-style” battle is there are 20-40 little Seed enemies constantly, and you have to wait and watch, one-by-one-by-one as each of them do their turn, along with the 10-20 other enemies on the field. Oh, and there are like 5 waves of enemies in this fight as well. 95% of the time during this battle you are just sitting and watching enemy units move a couple of tiles, one-by-one. It was so insanely boring that I never “finished the game” in that regard. At times during the game I wished there was a “skip animation” type option so I didn’t have to watch the enemy movements, but this battle was unbearable due to the ridiculous amount of enemies there are. I lasted the 300 years, but I couldn’t last the hours it would take to go through that battle. Really a “slap it together” finale it seemed like and that was really disappointing.  So to me, the game ended at the 300 year mark, and it was a good game that I will play again - but I wont even think about starting that final battle again.  ",

            "review_text": " Summary : A game where the developers put in the bare minimum effort.  To start with, I want to say that I purchased this game when it was 80% off (I paid $4) and I feel what I got was worth the price I paid. However, had I paid full price, I'd have felt ripped off.   First is lack of variety.  * There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of bloodlines. (Apparently it was a backer award.) They are all virtually interchangable. They each have a flag, a color scheme, a name and a motto. The first three only matter for identification in the menu, while the motto appears after a member of the bloodline gets a kill. I'm not saying they need a unique perk or anything, but for the sheer volume, they boiled down to class and menu color. * With only 4 hair colors (including grayed), a handful of hair styles and one skin tone, heroes start to blend together very early. Even the armor colors stop distinguishing heroes once you get Cadence armor types. (And you'll want to use Veil Armor on every hunter.) * There are 9 classes (3 base, 6 hybrids), but only around ten unique skills. Every hybrid shares the majority of its skills (and armor appearance) with its two base classes. So of the nine classes, there is very little difference in basic function. Heroes will spend the majority of the game being distinguished by which of the three weapon types they use. * Seven enemy types. Seeds (basic mooks), Ruptures (explode), Lapses (drain exp) and Bulwarks (ranged attackers, take 1 damage from all attacks after the first hit each round) appear early on, joined by Wrinkles (age heroes), Cradles (spawn Seeds) and Twitches (swap positions with heroes) within the first 100 years (of 300). 'Advanced' versions show up around the 150 year mark, which just buffs HP, damage and exp. The only mechanical difference I noticed with any of them was that Advanced Lapses also slowed down cooldowns. Each enemy only has one attack. * The Chalice duo will occasionally chime in after an enemy or ally is killed, at the end of a battle, or when a random event pops up. By the fourth battle, these lines were already repeating. * Each zone has one map, with the only major variation each mission being your, and the Cadences', starting positions. Same goes for each structure, when they're directly attacked. (At least the final battle has a unique map, which added a sliver of variety after I had spent the last half of the game just going through the motions.)   Second is a lack of balance.  * Hunters can stealth, which is essential for scouting. They can also attack at range, and get a double shot that can potentially one-round Bulwarks. They are awesome. * Alchemists can throw a limited number of flasks (read: grenades) per map and can get an extra item slot. They're useful for dealing with seeds early on, and actually manage to get really powerful with time. * Caberjacks are melee heroes meant to mitigate damage. The plethora of Ruptures and ranged attackers early on makes them sitting ducks, since they lack the HP or armor to soak any more damage than a hunter early on. In theory, they can knock back enemies to avoid rupture explosions, but their low damage on their first knockback skill means they can only kill a rupture if it's nearly dead, otherwise you need a hunter to off it anyway. Theoretically, they can stun enemies by knocking them into each other or against walls, but again, only if they can close the distance. * Most hybrids are similar. Shadowjacks are just caberjacks that can scout with stealth. Blastcappers and Boomstrikers don't stand out from their base class much. Brewtalists has the sole distinction of getting a melee version of the hunter's double shot. Enforcers are just hunters that can knockback at range (which is an upgrade over cabers, at least) and are a bit more durable, but durability doesn't matter much when hunters can avoid getting hurt in the first place. * Trickshots are notable for being an actual interesting hybrid. Their flask arrows sacrifice the ability to be thrown over obstacles and must be aimed at enemies instead of being able to target an empty square, but have longer range.   Third is the story.  While the game is sparse on plot, that isn't my issue here. No, what bothers me is the forced and groan inducing 'twist' at the end. WARNING: Spoilers for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Massive Chalice.   So you've finished the final battle and the Chalice informs you that the Cadence can't be stopped, only pushed back for a while. This is a pretty common trope, kind of dull, but acceptable on its own. But it just makes the next bit more frustrating.  I bring up XCOM because the endings are quite comparable. In XCOM, the Volunteer personally flies the alien ship away from earth, knowing it's about to explode. This is heroic, because the character is knowingly and willingly making a personal sacrifice for the good of the world.  In Massive Chalice, you beat the game and the Chalice informs you that the Ruler - the character / role the player fills - will die when the Chalice does its thing to push the Cadence back. Both the player and Ruler are unaware of this fact until a moment before the Chalice fires. This is not heroic, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because the player/Ruler was being lied to, manipulated, the entire game, unaware that not only would they die, but their goal of wiping out the Cadence is literally impossible.  XCOM's ending was heart wrenching, because I had to watch a character I grew to favor and rely on, to care about, walk knowingly to their death. If Massive Chalice's devs had any creativity, any drive to make the player feel something other than frustration, they'd have put more effort in. Even one little change could make all the difference: Imagine if using the Chalice  would  wipe out the Cadence at the cost of the Ruler's life. Now imagine that the game asked you if you wanted to go through with it.    Despite the game's potential, it fails to live up to any of it. I feel sorry for the kickstarter backers.",

There are far better examples of the genre, and it doesn't really do anything new. I did not beat it because of the weird difficulty ramp and repetitiveness. If you haven't played a game in this genre before, there are far better options. Do not buy at full price, but anything $5 or less.  I will recommend because the addition of the bloodlines adds a interesting dimension in terms of getting attached to your characters and their descendants, and the core gameplay is solid, but there is not as much depth as you could get in other games.  Great potential, but falls a little short.",

If you aren't convinced, wait for it to go on sale ($10 is a great deal for it).  A good friend of mine played this right up to the 300 year marker, but then lost because his heroic bloodlines went infertile around year 250. No one was left for the final confrontation.

            "review_text": "I just completed the game (Normal Iron mode) and wanted to share my thoughts.  The game is often compared to X-COM for its tactical component and therefore criticized for having less depth in this segment.  I would say this: - It is less deep (big difference is overwatch), but still deep enough to enjoy. - It is faster! You will handle many encounters upon finishing the game (around 30), so it is a good thing. - The tactical maps are not too varied and rather small. But in the end, it helps making the combat resolution faster as you don't have to seek enemies everywhere.  This fast pace suits the game as it focuses on managing generation of heroes. You want to see how generations evolve and not linger for hours in tactical and wait hours in the management part of the game. So, I think it is sound design here. This is what will make you love or hate the game. You have to consider if it works for you or not if you hesitate purchasing.  I still felt attached to some of my heroes (not for so long, at best you play 4 times with them). The fact that they are not long-lived makes it so that you are not punished hard when you lose one. And there is always the next hero to be fond of.  The setting/theme of the game is original (never seen elsewhere monsters), the chalice, the generations of heroes makes for a new experience, never played before game. In this day and age of sequels/clones, it was a good surprise.  Graphics: Atypical but very clean and I liked them. I loved the fact that the armors/weapons get different looks when research advances. It shows care for details.  Music is also very good. The voices are superb.  The controls are very well done.  The game is really balanced in my opinion. Funnily, I read most people use hunters. I used my alchemists (brewtalists to be exact) so there is more than one way to play the game. This is positive obviously. Some research options on the weapons open tactics as the abilities offered by the different classes.  Is there anything not to like? Well, for me: not really. I just have some regrets though: Sometimes, it is a bit difficult to understand exactly how stats and traits are propagated. Granted, part of the fun is maybe to figure that out. I wished there were better ways to track heroes in the different blood lines. There is a small family tree, but would have liked an overview. I sometimes wished there was the (optional) possibility to customize heroes/Houses. But the Houses out of the box are already very enjoyable. I somehow, want more... So many heroes were 'lost'. You can assign them to research, training, combat or breeding. I wished there were just more to it (more options), more events, leaderboards of heroes and so on...  I do realize though that more features could work against the design of a fast paced game with constant choices. Relics were a brilliant idea to have some cross generations element, I wished for more. More logs/relations between heroes.  Congratulations to the developers, this is a very unique, well designed, well executed and beautiful game.  I will finish with a last comparison with X-COM :the price. Price tags at release were very different. I would dare to say that quality/price, they are a close match, or maybe even Massive Chalice is the winner there.",

            "review_text": "I don't normally do reviews, so I will keep this brief.  This game is the start of something great. In massive chalice I see the seeds of the game which any warhammer/game of thrones/lord of the rings fan could love and harbor as a true classic. I will cover these seeds below.  - You are the immortal blood emperor of what remains of mankind, thats awesome!  - You command aging, powerful heroes to save the world agains TEH DERKNESS!  - You have immense magical powers, and total Dictator level control of your kingdom, as well as two hilarious advisors.  - You get to create noble houses and powerful blood lines who become more epic as time goes on, asigning them to the roles that will determine their lives.   - There are events which occur while 'sleep' that prompt your waking which are not enemy attacks, such as hero fueds and such.   All that said, there are some other things that keep this game in ther 'seed' stage, as opposed to the actual dream game we all want. I will list these below.   - The game tries to be silly and serious at the same time, sprinkling bits of a serious plot amidst two bickering magical halves a big ♥♥♥ cup (Guess which), heroes who range from silly to insane (not the good kind), and in general a lot stuff which broke me out of my epic role and screwed with my immersion.  - NO HOUSE POLITICS. Heroes and the noble blood lines and houses are completely loyal...maybe to loyal. Outside of events which are personal to individual heroes, and which may not occur at all, they never fight amongst themselves and never seem to be 'alive'. Though some of my heroes had some epicness tied to them. it required a lot of imagination on my part.  - No armies at all. Just the heroes and stuff. The humans, outside the usurper queen when she appears, are pretty bent on obeying you and doing nothing else, so you never need to use them, since monsters are not fought with armies in this game. Hard to feel like an Emperor without armies or politics.   - Not enough effect from events, not enough customization. I love my first playthrough, but sadly, the second playthrough was nearly identical to the first. I can't customize my heroes appearances very much, nor can I alter the appearance of...almost anything at all aside from placing buildings. And that is far from satisfying my builders craving.  - Lack of enemy units and type of attacks. To keep it short, there are not enough of them. The ones we have are great and unique and do require a stratigic approach (Wrinklers and lapses anyone?) to properly enegage, but the fact stands that there are not very many of them.  - Ending is a blueballs spectacular.  There is a lot more I could say about the game, but like I said, I want to keep this brief (Failing). So why did I rate this thumbs up? Because I had fun playing it, and if they built on this and released a sequal, I would buy it in a heart beat. I want to support progress towards a game we all want.  This was not the game we deserved, but it was the game we needed (In order to get the game we deserve).",

Battles would stretch to 15-20 minutes of exploring very similar maps, looking for more of the same enemies so you could use the same moves to probably kill them. I'm not the kind of master strategist that gets really excited by 'Oh!! The wall is over *there* now so I have to deploy my hunters like *this*!'   I struggled to the end of one game and now feel like I know enough of the mechanics to do much better the next time - there are some specific things I'd like to try - but I simply cannot yawn through another endless series of battles!",

Veteran stragegy players should definitely play on Hard or Brutal, since that will give you more of a challenge. My first playthrough was on Normal, just to get a sense of what options were out there, and the mechanics of the game.   I'd love to see a DLC or a patch that allows for House creation by those who did not back on kickstarter, and I think most of the Kickstarter Backers are okay with that sort idea, since the House you would be creating would just be limited to your local game copy, etc.  Again, overall, it is a game well worth $20.00 -- and if you can get it on a sale, then I think that is a pretty stellar deal.",

I got through my first playthrough, but there's nothing in the game that keeps me wanting to play through the other difficulties. Add on the fact that modding is not available, or (as I hear) planned, I don't see myself coming back to this game.  I want to like this game, the core mechanics are good, but it's just a very shallow game.  Examples of shortcomings: Most choices you make in management, like marraiges, don't seem to make huge differences. By the end of the game, I had generally positive traits, but it still didn't feel like there were enough traits to make it seem like any one family was really special in a good or bad way.  Classes were kind of neat, but there are only 3, each with 2 variations, and your control over what classes you get are constrained by traits due to their inclusion in the marriage mechanic. There aren't many enemies, and the main crowd control mechanic is hard movement of enemies. It does add more depth to the combat that I saw at first, but that was about as deep as it got.  Relics are random, and absurdly strong. There are really no other options. You can research a few weapons per class that mimic enemy mechanics, but they still pale in comparison.  Research is limited to a few techs, that never change based on playthroughs(though they may be unlocked in a marginally different time frame). I also disliked the idea of having to 'research' more troops to recruit. I see why they did it, but it seems silly.  Perma-death doesn't hurt much in the long run, really just for that battle. If the dead person carried a relic, it is passed on. If the person had good traits, well you chose someone else for marriage instead of them, who likely had even better traits. I would have liked to see more units needed for battles, and the inclusion of regents in the fighting forces, to raise the stakes. The finale was neat, and if the mechanics of battle were better, it would be incredible to play.  Lastly, I'd like to see more done with the overworld. It's the same everytime and is, in the grand scheme, rather small. Basically 5 areas, with 2 divisions (10 total), where only the outer region carries any value. On top of that, the invasion mechanic is painfully simple. Bad guys invade 2-3 areas at once. Defend one area to reduce 1 corruption points, other regions gain 1 corruption point. None of that matters unless a region reaches 3 corruption points, at which point it just disappears. I'd like to see regions be affected by corruption, and lost regions do more than just go away.",

It fulfils the original goals of the design document and nothing more,and ultimatly feels more like the product of an indie game jam than a kickstarter project.   Given that turn-based games like this are simpler to make than real time games, the real test of quality is in the execution of unique concepts that go beyond what somebody simply copying XCOM or Tactics Ogre could have produced. This game has no such features to speak of, other than a fairly basic hero-breeding backdrop, and a quirky aesthetic.

Some battles are really easy then you'll have one that's nearly impossible.

I also suspect there are some underlying game mechanics that aren't being exposed for regent marriages.

I coudn't figure out an actual reason why this is happening so the only thing I can figure is that there's some unexposed game rule about someone marrying their cousin. =)  All in all it feels like a game that could have used a bit more work.

I know it feels and plays like a copy of Xcom, nut you really have to look past those kinds of flaws and not really compare a game to others that clearly outclass it. That doesn't seem fair to me.",

Pretty light on gameplay though, so as of this writing I would probably wait till it's $10 or less, because there's just not enough here for a $20 dollar game.",

            "review_text": "If you were looking for an fun and immersive alternative for a turned based strategy game - Seek no more. You just found it.  A brilliant and storyline filled with witty jokes and sassy sense of humour which sets you against the 'Cadence', an demon/plague like species which soles purpose is to decimate your people and corrupt your lands.  Seeking a way to defeat the Cadence, you, the master ruler of the lands, seek out the power of the Massive Chalice, hoping to find a way of cleansing the Cadence. The Chalice is played by to charming voices, an pervy and sassy man and an wise and witty woman, whose purpose is to play the role of advisors trough the game.  The game starts with you waking up in front of the Chalice. The voices are telling you that you manage to achieve what you wanted: An way to purge the Cadence. The punch line? This purging will take 300 years to gather the energy and research necessary to be completed and mastered.  But fear no more! Thanks to the powers of the Chalice you achieved immortality and the power of the 'Eye of Thundera' (you basically have an extended vision of the role Kingdom, anywhere you want)! All you had to do was sacrifice your body, becoming entangled to the Chalice. (Y).  Throughout the 300 year timeline, you must build upon your territory different alternative building's and research new and better gear; You must forge an strong bloodline of ferocious fighters to defend against the Cadence to ensure the Chalice is not damaged. For that, you will control the marriage of your warriors, being them infants or nor, transforming this game in an interesting but twisted and kinda sick, 'Game of Thrones' thing.  Like Pokemon, you will have 3 starters classes: x2 ranged and one melee. Your fighters are sub-classes which are desginated by lineage, thus being necessary the wisdom of Game of Thores again.  What's unique about the level system is you are not investing your time into a certain character but in a lineage/family. You marry your lineage off to another and make babies. These babies have good or bad traits which are then passed down from generation to generation. This traits may be good for combat or bad, like good eyesight, giving you better visibilty of the terrain or alcoholism, meaning your warrior will move less tiles and atack less because will be with hangover. Your lineage determines your fighter class as well. For instance, if you marry off one Caberjack to a Hunter you will be making a Shadowjack.  You will be controlling the family clans that you send out to defend from atacks in a turned paced duel. Each class will have an amount of tiles that can walk or atack and so does the enemy. With more battles, more experience your warrior get. Experience which that can be later used in a very intriguing skill tree.  With the passing of time and accumulated experiences, your warriors may create legacy gears which, with the eventual death of such warrior, will be passed through his linage, generation after generation, getting stronger and stronger.  Time itself is sped up until an event occurs (research ending, babies being born, old members of the lineage dying, cadence presence,...). With the advent of time, the atacks of Cadence will become more often and in greater number. They start atacking one land in the early game and then, late in the game, three or more, making you have to choose wich terrain you will be sacrificing, since you can only defend one at a time.   For the amount of time you must spent calculating the odds of your strategies to work, for the huge amount of laughs this game will give you and for the connection you will be forging with the families you create (or not, You can be an insensitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that will be sending young ones to death just to buy time for the true meaning of the game...(No worries, I ain't judging ya)) all I have to say is: Buy this game, it sure is worth playing it.

You need to make your attention on your population which directly affects the heros you can choose in a single battle, also the age of your heros does have the same effects. 这确实像幽浮、兄弟战团或者其他的什么回合制策略类游戏，不过这里有些不一样的地方，你不是选择你的战士，而是选择你的血统。你需要时刻注意你的人口信息，它直接影响到你每场能选择的英雄数目，当然，还有年龄。  There are actually 12 types of units rather than the simple 3. And each type is unique. In the right usage of your abilities that you can make it easy to defeat your enemies. i.e. Due to the lack management of population I use only to Shadowjacker to fight a battle, but I won(In a stealth-&gt;recon-&gt;stun-&gt;attack process). So there is a lot much fun. 这里不单单是3种单位，实际是12种单位。每一个单位都是很特别的。使用正确就能轻易击败你的敌人。举个栗子，由于我对人口管理的疏漏，我有一场战斗只有2个潜影破坏者，但是，我通过潜行-〉侦查-〉击晕-〉攻击的流程赢了那局。所以我玩这游戏不会少乐子  And there are different types of monsters. Try not to be agressive before you find out the attribute of those invadors. 这游戏还有各种各样的怪物。在弄清楚它们的特性之前，切忌冒进。  GL HF. 祝你好运，玩得愉快！",

Massive Chalice is an excellent blend of long term strategy and turn based tactics.  to give you a comparison, it plays very much like a low fantasy version of XCOM Enemy Unknown. You take on the role of the faceless (and mute) commander, You place your buildings into your lands. The enemy attacks several provinces at once and you can only defenc one of them. But unlike XCOM, your heros have a limited lifespan and will eventually die of age if the enemy doesn't get them first. to save some of their valuable traits you can marry your heros off in order to breed the next generation of cannon fodder. This adds a whole new dimension to strategy and it is something I wish more games could implement.  overall I would give it about a 4/5 the only downsides are the blocky looking art style which I don't like but seems popular these days. and the fact that it seems like it will have limited replayability, there are only so many ways to do things so I feel that aside from achivement hunting it won't get to many repeats from me.",
