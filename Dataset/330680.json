            "review_text": "Solar Struggle is one of those indie-games that tries to inject some fresh ideas into the space shooter genre, but ended up as WTH were they thinking?   Solar Struggle, or just SS from here on, is a 2D space shooter with a high-and-behind-chase view. Yes, you heard that right... It looks 3D, but the game's actually 2D only. There is no 'up/down', only left and right. You can turn, and you can 'side strafe' (i.e. fly forward and sideways).   What's more, the enemies move way too much for the weapons that you do have. You're almost always outnumbered and will score 10-30 kills per mission, but the enemies are twitchy and you'll need to hit them dozens of times to kill them. So you basically end up in the spray-and-pray mode as the 'weak' guns you have is unlimited ammo and needs no cooldown. The big guns you have have limited shots, so you save those on really slow targets.   The controls barely make sense. Why have side strafe at all?   The cutscenes are just static text blocks, usually quite short.   Graphics are below average, sound is below average.   All in all, this game feels like someone's garage project that barely makes sense and is worth maybe $1.00 USD.",
