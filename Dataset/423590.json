            "review_text": "Short but brilliant. Best of all, it dodges the dull dead doggy dilemma.  This is a game that's willing to be serious and humorous one after another and even simultaneously, and it works quite well! The story, of a father looking for his own father when his daughter follows him to somewhere neither should be, had plenty of work put into it!  Of course, if you seek challenge, best look elsewhere. The only 'puzzle' I needed help with all game was when I went in a window and failed to realize that I had to leave through another window without doing a single thing.  Looking forward to future projects by the same developers!",

            "review_text": "The art and animation direction is stunning, each character has so much personality with every movement they make. The character designs themselves are adorable and charming, and oh man the monsters are super creative. The music is lovely and very fitting, I enjoyed how the mood changes depending on the environment.  The puzzles were fun and interesting, and I'll admit, the hint feature came in handy a couple times when I got stuck, haha. It was a blast to play and I'd like to go through again to find the other achievements!  The gameplay is like playing through an animated movie, so it's like Dragon's Lair but actually fun to play ;)",

            "review_text": "The word that first comes to mind when playing this game is 'charming'. The artwork, in the style of Don Bluth, is fantastic as is the music. The story is short and sweet and very linear. Normallly I prefer an adventure game where puzzles can be sorted out in different orders but in this case, the general lovliness of the game overcame that problem. The puzzles are not too difficult although I did not get all the achievements yet so some replay is in order! For a first effort, this is a great little game. Do keep in mind, the play time is short, but linger a bit and spend some time enjoying the love put in the game. You'll miss the speed achievement but you can round that up on the next playthrough!",
