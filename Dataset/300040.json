(too much navigating/loading new areas). Gender locked classes, uninteresting classes. In total this seems to be a mediocre game not worth much time.",

I really wanted to like this game and tried to, but sadly could not as it got boring real fast. The story is mediocre, and vague at most, graphics and voice acting is not that great either.     ",

(I would add that the block function is completely useless as you are hit-stun for long enough after a block that you can't dodge the next attack)",
