            "review_text": "Surprisingly, I have found myself addicted to this game. It's very simple, yet fun. It doesn't take any skill to play, though. You go through levels, to win the level you build houses and cottages to generate money, which you can then use to build resource buildings. You have an unlimited amount of workers, which makes it too easy, and basically all you do is click. I read somewhere that there were a few glitches in the game, so far I haven't noticed anything except for a typo. (hehe) I give this game an 8.5/10 on the 'this is so ♥♥♥♥ing chill and relaxing' metre.",
