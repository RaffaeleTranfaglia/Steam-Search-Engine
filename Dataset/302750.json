To be honest, I found myself enjoying playing it (being a dad) more than an adult probably should, seeing as it is designed quite well and turns into quite the fun brain teaser kind of experience, allowing you to pull of some crazy combos, if you're any good at addition and subtraction.  I certainly recommend this game to mothers and fathers all over the place as a fun way to get your child engaged in some math.  The art style is cool, the game is deeper than it appears, and it's just a good time, all around.  Certainly worth it.",

Relearn how to Math fast and have fun at the same time.  Don't, but I mean don't play this with your kids or any kid. Like games with online, the rating goes to M really fast as you curse at them for being so stupid and slow. You might even smack them... hard. I know I did. I regret nothing.",

The difficulty is also rather self-paced, and seemless, which makes it easier for little children to digest. UI is superb!  Bonus points: the game is almost a-lingual, so kids that do not know English (or any other of the supported languages) can enjoy it just as much!",
