            "review_text": "Soccertron is a competitive sports game in which you either play vs. bots or play against (or with) up to 3 other players (locally).  There are 5 different types of rounds (game modes) which have some similarities with real sporst like; Basketball, Volleyball and football (No, I won't call it 'soccer'!).  The gameplay is fun and works nicely but a controller is highly recommended.   The main problem with the game is that it's very minimalistic. There simply isn't anything to keep you entertained in the long run. The bots (on the highest difficulty) may seem like tough opponents untill you figure them out.  The 5 gamemodes are fun for a while but get boring pretty quick.  There's no online multiplayer. You could ofcourse try to beat every achievement, which are very easy (Lose 200 times for example) but simply take a hell of a lot of time.  Overall 'Soccertron' is a fun game IF you can find some friends to play locally otherwise I doubt you find this one interesting enough to keep playing.",

I couldn't care less about sports, but this is a good little local multiplayer to put on your laptop, and it won't bog down your system with tons of memory . It's perfect the way that it is, and doesn't need anything . The jet pack jumping action, and the neon look give it a sci-fi flavor . It plays just fine on my Windows 8.1 system . FLIP DAH BUCKS AND GET DAT GAME !",
