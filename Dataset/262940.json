            "review_text": " 'But the Serpent was wiser than all the animals that were in Paradise...' 'And God cursed the Serpent and called him 'Devil'...' 'And He said, 'Behold, Adam has become like one of us, knowing evil from good.'' -  The Testimony of Truth (Gnostic Gospel circa 100AD)     Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse  is the last part of Broken Sword series, coming out in 2014. Yup, our lovely duo is back in our lives again, nearly 20 years after the release of the legendary first game. We have witnessed George and Nico evolve throughout years - and devolve in some games, to be honest - yet after the commercial and presentational failure that we'd know as  Broken Sword 4 - Angel of Death , I wasn't expecting much from a new game. I had come to accept that even though it had a marvelous beginning, Broken Sword series were dying in our age. Now I am thrilled to announce that I was tremendously wrong after playing this adventure gem. George and Nico are back, and they are at their best!  Some years after the 4th game, George and Nico run across each other by another odd chance in an art exhibition. They are back in Paris again: the city that holds many memories for both; of cafés, of music, of love and of death. Where it all began years ago. This time, George is working for the insurance agency which the gallery owner made an arrangement with, and Nico is simply there to catch a scoop of the gallery opening. Just before they can catch up or get on a nostalgia train through longing looks they exchanged, they witness an art theft and an accompanying murder! Gallery owner is shot and  La Malediccio  - a religious Gnostic painting by the mysterious artist El Serp - is stolen. As fate pushes Nico and George into each other to run through a final mystery, we take on yet another mystical yet hilarious adventure with them.  Okay, from this point, it might very well become a love letter and a summary of the whole franchise and narrative, so feel free to skip this part if bored. Narrative pace, presented lore, character interactions and humor are incredibly well here! I was really worried - and a bit depressed after playing the 4th game, since it was obvious that with each new game hailing from the series, the quality of all these aspects dropped down a bit more. Legendary with the first, well-done with the second, quite nice with the third and... Downright horrible with the fourth. Now this game, brings back George and Nico, and what made both their personalities and the stories revolved around them special. We'll meet new characters, catch up with old ones and work on a full blown conspiracy with medieval background yet again. This time, the lore focuses on a less known - and mostly apocryphal side of Christian history: Gnosticism. It is a different approach with authentic scriptural storyline, compared to the millionth Catholic witch hunt we've seen in video game history so far. It is refreshing.  Environment design is again 2D classic point and click, with 3D depth enhancement. Keyboard interference is completely gone once again. Artworks are marvelous, and site transitions are wondrously smooth. You keep playing the game without a notch of display quality dropping down. Character designs are marvelous cartoon exaggerations again, with some comic art shading, which is a tip of hat to older games yet a refreshing redesign when it comes to animations. I have to add that the soundtrack was also the best in the series since the first one. Kudos!  This is a text-book classical P&amp;C adventure if I've ever seen any. We have inventory collection, NPC &amp; environment interactions, and of course puzzles to solve. Well, not to dishearten, but puzzles are not really challenging. They only take some attention to detail and some careful reading in most places. Yet, they are not actively time consuming at least. Now that we are not dealing with 3D environments anymore, all box-pushing puzzles we've suffered through in previous games -3rd and 4th, to be specific - are gone. Yay! Oh, and there are achievements added to this game, which is a first in the series here on Steam. By the way, as another side note to fans: the goat is back!  Beautiful, mysterious, intriguing and funny. All these are the qualities of a Broken Sword game, and this 5th instalment delivers all these aspects in full potential. It is a must for the fans, and a more than decent addition to all adventure gamers' library. Enjoy!

            "review_text": "As a die hard fan of original Broken Sword: Shadow of Templars, I really dislike this game. However, if I'm about to be fair, it's slightly above average. Adventure games aren't that common these days, and if you've never heard about Broken Sword series, for the price, it's not that bad.   Synopsis  But if you're a Broken Sword fan like me, I would either not recommend the purchase, or buy it, thinking of it as kind of spin off game that has little to do with what made original great. For me particularly, it's the writing, acting and music.    Storyline &amp; characters   Very uninspired and lazy. Dialogues are not funny, painfully cheesy, stuff happens solely for the plot to continue further, characters are (with some exceptions) quite bland, even George (!!!) and you can spot every cliche from miles away. 'Hey, this place is not safe, let me tell you all that important stuff at much safer place, and count on me not to get killed on the way there!' Original Broken Sword was playing it seriously, but was packed to the top with dry humor that was fitting perfectly. Here, it's nothing like that. Goofy, lazy, stupid and only here and there you'll catch a glimpse of something funny. A lot of old characters that have been brought back are just pointless cameos without any reason to be there, plus they've all lost their charm. (Moe is nothing like the funny goofball he used to be, now he's really just a guy. A guy without any personality.)  Voice actors are also really bland. They all play it safe, so you'll never get a really bad impression, but you'll never get an impression that they beleive stuff is happening around them. Compared to how amazing they were in first game, once again, it's just a letdown. I personally blame whoever was in charge of voice acting, because actors can only do so much on their own, if they're not told what kind of vision director has. And I don't think they're bad, just badly utilized.   Music and graphics   Music is also somewhat of a letdown to me. Broken Sword 1 had amazing and memorable orchestral soundtrack and each track was carefully selected so it really had a meaning and helped out building atmosphere. Here, it's sometimes decent, but overall I just felt like in case of Fable series, where soundtrack never got any better than the first one. Plus I'm missing those little musical cues when something was happening, again, it's here and there, but not enough. Not terrible, but not amazing.  And graphics - I'm a big sucker for traditional 2D animation, not cell shaded 3D graphics like this one has. It's awkward. But I can understand that once again, budget issues wouldn't allow for traditional animation, or perhaps Revolution thinks this look sells more. I've always adored cutscenes from original, because some of them were like something out of Don Bluth movies (and if you don't know who he is, do some research), here for obvious reasons, it isn't like that. And don't get me wrong, the game isn't ugly, but it feels phony. Also, there is almost nothing going on in background. Remember the rich and animated backgrounds in original? Compared to traditional animation, it's just cheap and once again, takes you out from the overall experience, but compared to other things, it doesn't bother me too much.  In the end, I'm happy for Revolution that they can continue doing what they love, it's better to get something than nothing and frankly, as I've sayed, it's at least an average game. I just wish it was better, and I'm still hoping that one day we'll get that Broken Sword game that will be just as awesome as the first one was.",

            "review_text": "Back by nostalgic demand, this fifth installment of the franchise is something of a return to form, albeit one that is as guilty of replicating the faults of previous games as it at revisiting the strengths.  Abandoning the 3D worlds and returning to a 2D style, reminiscent of the first two installements, helps the game recapture the appealing artwork style that enhanced the atmosphere of those first two adventures. Not to mention the return of Barrington Pheloung on soundtrack duties. Meanwhile voice work is largely of a good quality, spear-headed by Rolf Saxon's now iconic performance as George Stobbart.  However, it's the story that really starts to let things down, with the plot taking some silly turns that push the player out of the narrative, keeping you at arm's length from really engaging with the events unfolding on screen. There are also a handful of puzzles that are frustrating in a way that stops you feeling like you're really experiencing the thoughtful adventure, meaning that you spend ages pursuing an idea that seems right, receive no confirmation that you're making any progress, and then feel lost, only to realise that you were right to begin with... and not in some sort of rewarding 'I'm a genius!' fashion, sadly.  It also feels terribly anti-climatic, though that's been a problem of every single Broken Sword game, but, for fans of this series, this is a much appreciated step back in the right direction, and undoubtedly the third best game in the series, though that's both high praise and something of a back-handed compliment.",

            "review_text": "Done in 8 hours. Yes, buy it.  I could have used just that tiiiiiiny bit more of polish, most notably for me on speech transitions -- characters will wait for their animation to be at the right spot to start talking, and since there's a LOT of dialogue in the game (GREAT voice over work) that's a crapton of little delays during the whole affair.  Backgrounds are gorgeous, I understand some people not liking the '3D' look of the characters but I did like them. Callbacks to previous games are nice, but you don't really need to have played them to enjoy this one.  The last hour or so I found to be streched a bit thin puzzle wise.. Really 1 thing to be done at a time, and only one specific way to do it, could have used more hints on close solutions and the like. Did use the hint system just to get to the end because my patience was running out. Lots and lots of looking at George walking (slowly) around to try and retry actions. Ugh. Still not a big thing, but noticeable.",

            "review_text": "Based on the german version with 5 hours played and around 30% completed.  UI:  Well, let's be honest the UI (Main Menu) isn't beautiful and looks like some alpha/beta version. The ingame UI is the standard backpack inventory which should be well known to every gamer that likes point and click adventure. Sadly there seems to be no option to open the menu with a mouse click/wheel action. So you have to move your mouse to the icon on the bottom left side of the screen.  When hovering over a usable object the UI will present you with the right (=only) action you can perform. In addition to that you can inspect every useable item to get a response from your active character.    Voiceover:   The german voice actors are really superb. George got his old voice actor and Nico got someone who almost sounds exactly the same as her usual voice actor. If I hadn't known beforehand that Nico got a new voice, I wouldn't have noticed it. The other characters got pretty good voice actors as well and those that made an appearance in a previous installment of the Broken Sword series seem to have their original voice actors as well.    Graphics:  The backgrounds are beautifully hand drawn and look amazing. Seeing those backgrounds with George and Nico really took me back to the old days. Sadly the animations aren't on par with the backgrounds. Don't get me wrong they aren't bad but compared to those backgrounds they just lose. Currently the supported resolution of the game is only 1280x720. But they promised to deliver a 1080HD patch.   Puzzles:  The puzzles so far have been good (=fun) and till now I havn't encountered an illogical one. The puzzles range from dialogue puzzles to item combination puzzles to the likes of reconstructing a destroyed message. If you're an experienced adventure gamer you'll probably have no difficulties solving those. But I still had fun and enjoyed them.   Story:   A painting is stolen from a gallery and during that a man is killed. Nico and George happen to be there and are trying to solve the robbery/murder. While doing so they discover that the painting has a special history and that it wasn't just a regular robbery. During that they meet some old friends and visit different countries.   Bugs:  Well I havn't ecountered a real bug till now but there are some things like e.g. really hard to spot items or a big item where the mouse courser has to be at a specific spot to make it useable (like a whole blank page) which could frustrate you. Other than that I havn't encountered anything.  Conclusion:  I'm loving the game but I'll be honest here and tell you that I'm a fan of the 'Broden Sword' series. So I might be a little biased here. Revolution Software delivers a good (definetly better than 3 (ugh) and 4 but not as good as 1 and 2) sequel to the Broken Sword series and every fan should get it asap if he hasn't already. Every other adventure game fan should ask himself if graphics (UI/Animation) is really (!!!!) important to him and if so he should maybe stay away from the game. All those that value gameplay and story more shouldn't wait and get this game. With that you'll support one of those developers who still make adventure games.  Warning: The second part will be released at a later date (January). If you buy the game now you'll get the second episode as soon as it becomes available. So you'll probably have to wait till then to experience the full story. On the bright side the game will be complete with the second episode and the wait isn't a long one.",

            "review_text": "Very happy to see Broken Sword back. I loved this game series as a kid. My parents bought the first game for computer when I was 8 or so. We played it together, and we had a blast. I remember being stuck on the Goat in Ireland. In the original game it was a very tricky puzzle to solve. We loved that game, so to see a modern iteration, with HD graphics and superb voice acting, it really makes me truly happy.   We got the second game for PS1 one weekend, after I had injured my leg and was laid up. Once again, we loved it. Another masterpiece. The third game lost us, we couldn't get into it, and the 4th game seems so incredibly rare to buy, I didn't know it even existed until I heard about this game being the 5th in the series.   I've played about 2 hours of The Serpents Curse so far, and I am really enjoying it. The humour is as sharp and witty as ever, superb voice acting by Rolf and the rest of the cast, which we shouldn't have expected it to be any less than perfect. Good to see George and Nico back in action, and its also good to see some characters coming back, like Seargent Moue and Laine. I'm sure as I progress further through the game, it will surprise me with more cameos.  Its also good to see the game return to its Point and Click roots. The main reason I never played the 3rd game was because of the controls. It wasn't familiar, and so I assumed the 4th game followed the same convention.   So if you're thinking about buying this game, and you enjoyed the first 2 games or even any of the game in this series, you should definitely get it. Especially while its 20% off.",

I contributed to the Kickstarter and the result of that campaign was a great, albeit half-finished story. The quality of the animation, sound, music, interface and backgrounds are fantastic. During my play through, I encountered one crash that I was able to workaround after a quick read of the forums. There are also some scenes where the character's lips don't move even though dialog is being spoken and I noticed one clipping issue where George walked right over the edge of a dumpster. One choice the designer made was to force the characters to fast-travel to certain locations. On one hand, it would have been the logical choice for the player anyway, but to me it felt like I was being rushed in order to keep the narrative going. The plot is extremely linear and there is absolutely no opportunity to wander or simply explore the surroundings. Despite these minor flaws, I do recommend the game and I'm looking forward to the finale.",

            "review_text": "Finally, George and Nico are back. There’s always something special about my favourite American tourist and French journalist stumbling into conspiracies, mysteries and dangers that threaten the world if not stopped in a timely manner and “The Serpent’s Curse” is no exception. The adventure unfolds once again in Paris, City of Lights, Love, Art and Death. George, currently employed by an insurance company, and Nico, still freelancing for La Liberté, meet at the opening of an exposition at a rather small gallery which is suddenly interrupted by a gun-wielding pizza delivery boy, stealing one of the many paintings and fatally shooting the gallery owner. The hunt for the thief/murderer and the stolen painting eventually uncovers a a threat for humanity itself and leads the dynamic duo to a place of biblical mythology.  There are many nods to the serie’s origins and beloved characters from other parts do – as is traditional – make rather surprising re-appearances during the course of the game and prove to be as helpful now as they were when you first encountered them. The game play is that of a classic point-and-click adventure and easy to handle, though on occasion not very exact. In the German version, which I’ve played, I noticed several translation errors, most notably the flower shop owner’s mouse over which identified her as the “intercom”. However this doesn’t affect the game play negatively at all, so I suppose there’s really no reason to complain. The game’s riddles aren’t that difficult and the new Hint System actually gives the kind of hints which enable you to solve the problems on your own rather than clicking your way through to the solution or googling a walkthrough.   I love the game’s style which is as close to the original comic style as possible while giving it a modern 3D look. The music is amazing, too, and a certain flowery tune has been stuck in my head for a while now. The game has many humerous scenes and examining items or hotspots can be quite entertaining, as always when George’s (or Nico’s) opinion is requested. Of course as always, the game is well-researched and rather engaging.   Unfortunately there are also a few downsides. The game is indeed rather short and I feel somehow that the – for lack of better term – ‘philosophical’ part of the storyline could have been expanded on. On precisely two instances, I had problems with the game not working properly: both times the game could either not play or exit a cut scene. This appears to be a bug that has been around for a while. It is quite annoying and I therefore advise you to save your game, and save often, as the auto-saved file is likely to give your grief in these instances.  Nevertheless, if you love this genre, George &amp; Nico and brain teasers, this game is for you. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Even if you haven’t played Broken Sword before, you will find this entertaining. ",

Note on the game page: 'The game will be released in two Episodes with Episode 1 releasing on 4th December. Episode 2 will be delivered as a free update to Episode 1 in Q1 2014.'  The main menu UI feels stiff (there's plenty of room for polish here), but the game itself should be familiar to adventure gamers out there. The graphics is gorgeous, a mix of 3D characters with 2D painted background. Feels like playing an animated interactive movie. Voice acting is top-notch as in every other 'Broken Sword' game, and there will be plenty of familiar characters in this one too. The story is as you can expect from a 'Broken Sword' game, there will be plenty of secret society stuffs and magical artifacts.  Can't wait to play the 2nd part of the game and will update this review until then.  [Part 2 Review] Somehow part 2 felt short. Wished that they had include more alternative solutions to move forward with the story. Some of the solutions some times a bit too hard to guess. Also there is a part of the game where you can get stuck, and you can't rely on the autosave to restore. Beware of that.  In the end, this is just another adventure game with its usual linear branch. I wish they do more branching and do things similar to Indy 4 adventure game.",

Couple of things with I am dissapointed with however -  the repeat locations become very frustrating, and the first part of it (0-50%) is far too short.

Apart from these minor set backs the story is in depth and invigorating, the matte backgrounds are beautiful and the updated 3D character animations and the voice acting (as always, particularly George) are enough on their own to draw you in. A must have game for any adventure lover - I look forward to playing the second half..under the assumption I will not be charged extra to do so.",

I YouTube'd the ending, out of curiosity, and am glad I didn't bother getting there myself. I'm a big fan of BS1 and 2 and I backed 5 on Kickstart. I'm glad that point and click adventures continue to get made and I've got my fingers crossed for a Beneath The Steel Sky 2, but I found Broken Sword 5 to be rather limp and flat. I can put up with some silly puzzles if the writing and humour are there, but they weren't. It was all pleasant enough, but I think the game played it very safe; there was no cheeky spark or wit. I found myelf playing the game with the sound off, while having one eye on whatever was on the TV in the background. That was when I realised I should play something else.   (Mild, but possibly helpful spoiler!) And acknowleding the infamously unfair goat puzzle from the first game with... an unfair goat puzzle? You establish that George isn't an action hero, and that the game isn't a third person action game, so why can he suddenly do certain very physical things mid game that he couldn't do before and with very poor signposting? The game breaks its logic to have a laugh about the logic breaking in the first game. (spoiler end)  Lovely backgrounds weren't enough to make me care about the story or its flat delivery. It's the first BS game where I didn't care much about any of the characters either. Currently the game is overpriced too. Might provide a pleasant and undemanding Sunday afternoon for someone who's bored and happens upon the game during a sale. Alternatively, try the superior BS1, 2 or a good book.",

So yeah don't be put off by this Broken Sword it's not a bad game at all I enjoyed it on the whole, I'm just comparing to their previous standard set, so bottom line: Good game in general, just a bit short for me, one or two more different locations before the end featuring more of Nico would have made it more satisfying come the credits.",

Some of the enigmas are good but most of them are unispired and in some cases just stupid. Another bad thing is the fact that some objects you have to interact with are just too small to be visible on the background, making you frustated on an enigma when all you had to do was interact with it (there's a point when you have to interact with a notebook, and it is literally two pixel wide on a game that is 1080p...).",

Everything also seems optimised for 420p, with the hand drawn pre-rendered backgrounds looking far less sharp than the glaringly obvious 3D character models... Which don't really fit with the style of going back to the game's roots. The few 3D mashup cutscenes were also jarring, considering this new / old combination style.   Puzzle wise, everything you need is usually within your immediate environment and they require little to no thought. Some of the solutions are also pretty absurd, with the attempts at humor being a letdown this outing. I remember actually being challenged by the original games, which is sad. Also, did I mention the backtracking? Don't expect many new environments. The things you can't interact with on your first visit signify multiple visits to the same location.   All of the usual charm and the bones of an interesting story are all there, but I'd avoid this until you can get your hands on the full version, or at least at a Steam Sale discount.

Then the fourth one came out and I only played it once and there was some bimbo blonde instead of Nico, and then Nico shows up with this weird voice actress and just doesn’t look like herself and it’s probably the weakest episode in the series, so no wonder Broken Sword gets quieter than ever. But somehow, even without my knowledge, the guys do a crowd-funding of this one, and, as it should, it drives nostalgia like a new muscle car. The dorky humor of both protagonists is back, it gets the classic 2D point and click treatment and the logic of your tasks is mostly within reason. The game doesn’t do anything special or revolutionary (hah, the irony of that, considering the studio), but we all know how that turned out last time, so that’s all cool. The weird cell-shady 2D/3D aesthetic took a little time for me to get used to and frankly, the animation is sometimes hilariously bad – namely mouth movements and occasionally the way the characters are stood when talking to each other. The puzzles are sometimes dumb as all hell, though that may be intentional in an attempt for subtle humor (whether that works for you or not is another thing).
