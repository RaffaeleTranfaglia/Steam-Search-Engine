            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game, truly. But after completing it I have to mark it as a not recommended. Here is why. Hopefully the developer can use this information to fix the game in the future, or maybe for their next game.   I'm going to use the GIMLET system the RPGAddict uses on his website to rate this game. Here we go:  1: Game World: The game takes place in a world where there are vampires. That is about all I could gather via the game. There is some back story somewhere buired in a document, but in game you learn nothing. 1/10  2: Character Development: Characters level at about the same pace as a standard RPGMaker game. Nothing new here, for good or bad. 5/10  3: NPC Interaction: Minimal, and what little there is makes no sense when it happens. Also there are bugs where it will show people talking to the NPC that are not in the party (which shows up in flashback scenes if you go off the beaten path). 3/10  4: Encounters and Foes: Starts off ok, but the developer seems to LOVE the paralyze status aliment. Expect to get paralyzed early and often. Also, paralyze never wears off, so until you can afford cures, paralyze is a death sentance. There is one early enemy that if it gets lucky enough to paralyze the wrong person (which happnes 1/3 of the time) its a game over, as you will be unable to kill it before it uses an attack that ko's the entire party. Endgame enemies also spam paralyze, silence, confustion, etc. Come prepared to want to punch something on your desk when you get to that point in the game.  Bosses come down to luck, as a couple of them have attacks that can paralyze the entire party. If it hits all 3 of your members, its a game over, as it will *never* wear off. And don't get me started on stun and how that has no cure either, as even the item that supposedly cures ALL status aliments but KO doesn't cure stun.  In summary, expect major balance issues, and random battles that are tougher than bosses, and bosses that come down to luck on whether or not you beat them. 0/10  5. Magic and combat: The 'innovative' combat system was spam attack until everything is dead, though that does change when you get the overpowered skills. One will try to paralyze all enemies (which makes random battles a joke then). Another skill adds doom and paralyzes the enemy, and never misses (except on bosses). Cast that 3 times, battle over. 2/10  6. Equipment: Despite 5 accessory slots, I never found a single accessory in the game. Armor is a joke due to how little it blocks, as you gain DEF at such a slow rate that having the best armor give +50% DEF means nothing. Also, why is there nothing to boost the MAT of the spell casters? They don't care about the ATK stat. As it is, I was better off attacking with them as they did less damage with their spells by the end of the game. 1/10  7. Economy: Broken as can be. Early game you can't afford KO revival items, but if you get past that and to the second and third zones, you can easily afford the best weapons in the game (which, sadly, the best weapon costs the same as 8 KO revival items)! After that, battle is just spam attack until they are all dead. 1/10  8. Quests: A couple side quests are hinted at (monster arena, trials), but that's about it. The main quest is as random as a squirrel on energy drinks and has no logical flow to it. 1/10  9: Graphics, sound and interface. The one strong spot of this game. The graphics are nice, and the sound is nice too. The interface is a little odd, especially in crafting, as I often accidentally started to craft as I had no idea I had selected an item yet! Also, when you go to equp an item, the stat changes do not properly show, so expect a little guessing there. 7/10  10: Gameplay. Plays ok. If you can handle the old school Wizardry and D and D games you can find some fun in this. Myself, I kept going as I wanted to see if this went anywhere at all. And while some people rip the opening of the game, many old games of the 80's and 90's start off much worse than 'I wanna go on an adventure!'.   On another note, the dream sequences need to go. They add *nothing* to the game. If they were meant to add something, it needs to be explained somewhere in the game, as I saw zero point to them. 5/10  Total: 24/100. It has decent graphics, tries to introduce you to a new game world, but needs more direction and better balancing before I can recommend it. Add in more on *why* you are doing what you are doing. Better balance the enemies. You don't need to spam every status aliment under the sun to make a battle tough. You don't need 147500 HP to make a boss tough. Also, add a tutorial please. I went about 2 hours before I knew what focus did as it has no explanation.",

            "review_text": "The art is really good and the UI is outstanding, but the rest doesn't really follow. The combat system is a mixed bag, it's intereresting and clearly some work went into it, but it's confusing and very unbalanced (so in the end you just spam the overpowered skills and combat gets boring). The story and characters are somewhere between 'mediocre' and 'trash' for the most part. Shallow, unoriginal, and just not engaging.  There is some real potential from that dev because some parts are way above average for a RPG Maker game, but overall it's not worth your time.",

It has  -Great arts -Mouse control with a normal user-friendly menu -battle system more complex than FFXIII :D -nice humor in some dialogues -puzzles and sidequests  Though the storyline looks pretty hectic, it is really funny and doesn't force you read 1000000 dialogue windows with boring 'darkness coming - save the mankind' stuff.  Also I had no lags about which other guys are complaining. Win 7 and 3 y/o pc.",
