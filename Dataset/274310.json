            "review_text": "Pre-emptive warning: I haven't spoiled any major plot points, but there are some tonal spoilers for one of the game's endings.  I err on the side of recommending this game, but I can't claim that it isn't very deeply flawed. Its main failing is that the story is about a lot of things, but the ending is 100% reliant on whether or not you 'win back' your love interest. Personally, I thought it would be most satisfying to play a character initially very deeply set on reconnecting with his ex, but gradually coming to terms with the breakup and, in the end, letting the ceremony go uninterrupted. In this playthough, I had been successful in almost every aspect of my life: religiously keeping a journal, participating only in activities I believed in, and treating everyone with kindness. My character's future was promising. So, what ending did I get?   The one where I'm suicidal, nihilistic and alone because I couldn't bear the pain of losing my ex-girlfriend, who I'd had every intention of getting over on the way to her wedding. This is the only ending possible if you fail to 'win her back', regardless of your other achievements or the way you've roleplayed your character. The game as a whole could be massively improved by the removal of the framing device at the beginning and end, as, for many endings, it fundamentally doesn't make sense and stands contrary to the story's themes. There's a fine post-credits scene, but it didn't negate my confusion at my character's hysterical response to making a perfectly fair, mature decision that, in my mind, caused him no great pain. It was a very 'Huh?' moment for me.   As for the rest of the story, it's pretty good. Extremely tonally uneven (I found myself going 'Really?' probably a dozen times) but not at all bad when you look past that, and I genuinely enjoyed most of the campaign. The trip was gruelling but satisfying, with more than its share of close calls and poignant moments, and it felt like I was coming to the end of a long journey when I finally arrived at the ex's wedding location. It's not realistic, but there's a realness to it -- something humbling about the situations you're faced with, an earnestness in the way the game presents love, friendship, and hope. I guess that's why I felt degraded by the ending... I mean, how can my character be so nihilistic when the past month has probably been the most interesting in his life? He's learned so much, experienced so much, yet the game gives me a pitch-black failstate because I didn't adhere to the arbitrary goal. It's not only unsatisfying, but also troubling philosophically. I guess I would recommend this game with the cliche that you should focus on the journey, not the desitation... or play with the LI in mind. Either way.",

The gameplay is full of different directions/choices that you can take, full of characters, and with a good story behind it. Also, I can't really consider the different sad endings a bad thing, because it is way better than having only one ending, and, at least, you still got the chance of getting that good happy ending (no 2nd meanings).",

Always Sometimes Monsters is a declaration about life, about how our choices are all we really have, and about how those choices, no matter how small, can reorient our life in ways that we can never predict. In life there is regrets, happiness, anger, wishfulness and countless other human feelings. Always Sometimes Monsters shows that while experiencing these feelings is inevitable, you will never be able to travel back and reshape your life with different choices, so you have to make the best of what you have and never sink into regret with the decisions you’ve made in life, or you will never be able to move forward in the unique journey that is your life. 10/10",

A very beautiful game with an amazing soundtack, storyline, and development crew. I will forever believe this game is one of the few that actually made me rethink my life choices, and video games usually lack the ability to do such a thing.   Always Sometimes Monsters is definitely worth a playthrough.",

You have a lot of choice over what happens in this game. It would have been nice to be able to go back through  and do more once you've completed it, but there are 9 save file slots so if you save at certain points you can do that anyway.

It's not perfect, true, as some parts of the game feel slow and not so interesting, and despite telling you to make choices, sometimes they are worth nothing - independently of what you choose, the game will just tell you 'oh, sorry, it has to be this way because of reasons'. However, that's not enough to make this game bad, in fact, it's quite the opposite. Despite its flaws, it is still enjoyable, so, if you're feeling like you want to try something different, give it a try. Just one last thing: This game will punish you if you decide to rush through it.  My final rating: 8/10 ",

I told the game, 'I am beating your system and successfully keeping my character from ever doing anything monsterous or ending up in too bad a position!'  Then I realized that it was me all along. The person always sometimes being a monster was me as the player gaming the system to give my character a good pool of money she wasn't supposed to have to dip into. So I went 'Well then, let me be evil!' and outright used Cheat Engine to give myself thousands of dollars, because if I was going to feel like the game was judging me for my actions I might as well go all out!  I'm recommending the game because it has a well-written story that kept me interested until the end, but let you warn you going in that it can be a slog. The game is full of unpleasant characters and situations that always try to go worse for your character. Even if you try to keep your hands as clean as you possibly be can a good hunk of the game characters will still treat you like dirt (although, to be fair, that is realistic for folks who are trying to turn their lives around after hitting rock bottom). And if you try to keep your funds up the honest way you'll quickly find that the minigames you do for work are dull as ditchwater, in a deliberate commentary on how mindnumbing minimum-wage jobs can be by the developer. Don't play this unless you don't mind a story that treats you like that! But for me personally I found it a fun challenge to try to hunt down (in most cases just having money isn't the answer, my cheatiness mostly just kept me from having to do unpleasant things for food) the 'good' choices through any given scenario when they weren't spelled out for you, and I imagine that other people would have an equally fun time seeing just how monstrous they could become!",

It so perfectly captures what it is like to be a human all in one short, what took me, 13 hour video game. The various choices with which the player is faced are identical to the choices a person will be faced with throughout their life. Towards the end the player is made to think about the various decisions they've made and this forces the player to think, 'if that were really me, how would I feel about my choice.' This is also a great game for someone with identity issues because certain questions/choices in the game make you think about your own life and your own beliefs. Overall, this game is great for anyone; and everyone should play it! Major props to the people at Vagabond Dog for almost making me cry at that ending! P.S I should add that for anyone looking for major exciting gimicks this might be a tough game for you to enjoy.

It gives an experience where, based on race, gender and sexuality, your experiences change. However, this isn't all it provides. The story itself is gripping and amazing, with lots of different paths and lots of different consequences for your actions. I will admit that the story is somewhat stream-lined in that it's city to city to city, with fixed cities, however there is still plenty of room for diverging paths. On top of this, it provides an experience where you're often wondering whether or not you will be able to get through it; not because the game's that hard, but because the story twists in so many ways. On top of this, it also has some interesting moments when characters delve into philosophy.  There are some cons however, the first being the potential for grinding. I'll give you an example. I was in a factory, loading boxes, told I could keep going until I was finished. The counter is 2 digited, so I assumed it wouldn't be too many. I loaded 101 boxes before giving up, with no indication that there was an end or not. As well as that, the jobs can be a bit boring/monotonous, but I suppose that's part of the game so I can't judge it for that. Also, I whilst I found Easter Eggs winking at the fourth wall clever, the heavy-handedness of this at the end was not to my taste.

I also think there should be more variety in story arcs making the game have more possibilities and more outcomes, more things that could go wrong, more things that could go right, more life changing and journey changing decisions that affect you greatly.  Aside from the story, Some money gaining tasks seem to be tedious and no matter how long you take to do them for some reason you always make it to your destination on time regardless of how long you take doing whatever it is.    Although i do like this game i feel like it's substance and content are for particular people, you'd have to be indifferent about a lot of things within the game to play it contently otherwise you're going to struggle to enjoy or play the game the way you should.

I love the idea and the execution is...fine but not flawless in my opinion. I think it's best I list a view points that could be of interest to potential buyers (NO spoilers!): - my first playthrough took me about 9h30min - you can't create your own character by choosing what they look like but you have several different characters (and significant others) to choose from at the beginning of the game - the story and characters are what drives the game - you really should be someone who enjoys these 'choose your own adventure' kind of games - you should also be someone who's into these kinds of stories (about ordinary people and their daily struggles mixed in with a sappy love story) - the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive after a while - besides some mini-games (which range from being kinda fun to annoying), you will spend a lot of time walking and talking - the game has a high replayability if you care enough about the characters and story to make you wanna see all the different outcomes and paths As there are so many different paths to play, you might want to consider checking out a playthrough on Youtube or so if you are still unsure on whether to buy the game or not. Might give you a good idea about the game's atmosphere which you really should get into if you hope to have a good time playing. So all in all, I decided to recommend this game as I love these types of story-driven, choice-making games in general and commend the developers for giving a game like this a chance. And once again: I think that if you can get into the story and characters enough, it'll make up for gameplay and you'll have a good time seeing how you're character's story unfolds.",

In the beginning of the game, it felt really weird and I felt as though the game didn't know which genre it wanted to be. After getting past the introduction; however, that is where the real drama happens and I was pleasantly surprised by how great the quality of the narrative is.  Basically, you are trying to get to the wedding of your ex in the next 30 days, but you are broke and have no family or any other means to help you get to where you need to go. Fufilling jobs, getting favors, and doing side missions, all the while keeping your stamina needs up are key to winning the game. There's also a choice system as well, and depending on your actions, you can change the ending of the game.   Honestly, Always Sometimes Monsters felt as though I was binging a Netflix series. The game is just beautiful in terms of how immersive the storyline can be. I made myself the main character and my partner as the ex and things got real pretty quickly!   Also, I have to give the creators a round of applause for allowing not only interracial relationships but also same sex relationships as well.   Pros: +Excellent narrative with real customization options to make the story your own. +Game play that really keeps you on edge, clock ticking anxiety makes it exhilarating.  +Mini-games are really fun and quite symbolic to life as well. +The soundtrack is really good! Very memorable soundtrack.  Cons: - The choice sections come up really fast. I wish there was a delay or something before the choices come up, because there has been numerous occasions where I would hit the space bar to progress dialogue and accidentally make a choice that I didn't want to make!!! Please somehow fix that!  Overall, I would most definitely reccomend Always Sometimes Monsters. I just finished the game and I'm still emotional at the ending I got. Definitely worth the time and money. It's like reading an interactive book. Highly, highly recommended! ",

There will some MINOR SPOILERS, but I will mostly refer to the begining of the game, but ever so vague. Well, let us begin :)  Story: You are a character that has his/her life is in shambles and loses his/her boyfriend/girlfriend after the prologue of the game. Soon enough, you recieve an invitation to your ex's wedding ceremony that will occur in 30 days. It is your job to go get your ex back. Or is it?   Graphics: It's pixel art so what do you expect? Kidding aside, it suits the game quite nicely in my opinion.   Music: I love the music so much. Many songs will repeat, but you will never get tired of it, at least I didn't.  Gameplay: I did not say this before, but this game will not appeal to everyone because all you practically do is read. I see this game more as a Visual Novel rather than a game to be honest, but it is a really good one at that. There is a lot of text in the game, but with good reason. This game is all about choice. A lot of games that are out now have 'choices' in them, but this has to be the best game to deliver choice thus far in my opinion (Yes I have played Mass Effect 1-3 and Witcher 1-2 and I love them both if that means anything). Every choice you make, whether it being in dialogue or in action, it carries weight. What I love even more are that these choices are very subtle. There is no moral meter, light/dark, or red/blue. All of the choices are grey and does not have a big sign showing 'Make big decision here!!'  There are also various minigames to play to break the reading which are actually quite fun.   Pros: +Story +Music +Gameplay  +CHOICES  Cons: -Gameplay (I put it here twice because there is a lot of reading, but it didn't bother me)   In all, I had a great time playing the game. I believe that it was worth the $10 (got it for $9 though). The story is very engrossing and can sometimes give you the feels. In the end, we are Always Sometimes Monsters.

You are in control of a main character who isn't clear cut good or bad and the choices you make aren't always so simple to make. Do you ruin another person's life to save another person life? Do you object taking a reward or do you take more than what someone says you can take? Do you stab someone in the back to get ahead or let your own life crumble to make someone else happy? The game often asks those kind of questions and expects you to answer. If you can accept that not every story has a happy ending then you probably can embrace this game cause chances are you probably won't get the 'Good Ending' on the first try but if you keep trying you should be able to. The story and the journey to find out how the end plays out are part of what makes this a good game and a different experience from other games out there.  I like how the game allows you to choose the main character and love interest in a way that isn't as simple as click this box for male or this box for female. Also this game does allow you to have same sex couples too for those that don't want to play as the straight couple. I wish there was a way to customize your character but there are a few varieties to choose from. For some of the major characters you can see their motivations and see the reasoning behind some of the things they do for better or worse as the game goes.   Some of the games drawbacks are that there doesn't seem to be a run button(You will wish that you can run sometimes), the choices while sometimes in the grey area of right and wrong they don't always have positive or negative impacts on the world after the fact and don't make you like it mattered. Some of the choices do affect game though and in the end you have to answer for your choices and actions(Think last chapter of the Walking Dead videogame season 1) Some of the mini-games are fun and are nods to classic games(Like Frogger and Pac-Man) however most of the jobs that you have do to earn cash are boring and repetive (I guess just like real life).  For this price I feel the game is worth while and you will be playing this game for several hours to try get the good ending for you and your love. Just be prepared to know that people are always sometimes monsters.",

The boxing part, and near the end. The boxing was tedious and difficult to the point I needed two different guides and multiple tries. And near the end, no spoilers, but the money grinding was annoying. (Like I'll say, this can probably be avoided through choice, but for those who are going for a 'good' ending, it was hard.) I played this a while ago though, so maybe it's been patched.  Now as for the game itself, appearance wise it's pretty good. Characters are fairly well written, great dialouge, and the story is the best. I see quite a few people complaining about working the jobs quite a bit, but the great thing about this game is choice. Those people chose to work, just like in real life. I worked in the factory twice, and for very little time at that. You don't have to adhere to the rules, but just like in real life, there are consequences.  The game lets you choose your character, and your partner. Lets you choose to be good or bad, steal or give. Choice is very prevalent, and I personally love that in a video game. There are a few endings to the game, so no your choices are not in vain (most of the time.)  Overall this game is one of the best I've played storywise.

Despite the risk of sounding tacky I'd describe ASM as a deep dive into the wide spectrum of humanity and life. It was funny, sad, clever, delightfully philosophic, beautiful, simple in a complex way - and genuinely thought-provoking at times. Regardless of the medium, I do enjoy stories and anecdotes that make the gamer/viewer/user reflect some element of their own life, perhaps questioning it or, on the other hand, feeling reassurance over it. Or maybe just cause that, either warm or melancholic, 'Yeah, I can relate' feeling.  The freedom of choice contributed to a great atmosphere throughout and I found myself quickly immersed each time I played. Also, unlike in other multiple-choice-type games I decided not to reload and replay each fork on the road and opted to just flow with it instead. It felt right not to see what might've been and instead just experience it uniquely as it happened - kinda like going through life itself.  As someone who dabbles with writing stories as their dear hobby, I must say: hats off to the developers for their vision and unique approach! Video game experiences like this are few and far between!

Okay so the stuff after the credits is just minigames.   Absolutely love it. I got this a while back, but never played it. I ended up deleting it from my computer until I saw someone play the beginning and decided to reinstall and play it. I'm glad I did. I don't remember exactly when, but I think I started around 5pm and played until about 11am, near the end of the game. I just now finished it, and I'm going to be replaying it from the start soon, after I see how the ending is affected by a certain choice at the end...   As for an actual 'review,' here we go: Always Sometimes Monsters isn't like whatever you're thinking it is. The game opens on a scene where you meet someone in a dark alley as you're attempting to quit your job as a contract killer. If you choose to listen, then you're told a brilliant story of the concept of choice, and an interesting tale of what it means to love someone.  You'll be spending a lot of time doing odd jobs and making choices. In fact, those are the two main things in the game. There are some minigames, but they're all very easy and simple. Which is good, it keeps your focus on the story.  The themes and choices in the game can range from incredibly dark to light hearted, though much of that is determined by you.   I can't give this game a high enough recommendation. If nothing else, the humor and view points presented in the game make it worth playing through the end. My only complaint is that the in-story twist and the out of story twist are both too obvious, but that never really takes away from the experience. Though it does make me want to go back to that one choice and see what happens. The inclusion of the developers is a great touch, especially the Dubstown building.  Again, I can't recommend this game enough. I absolutely love it and I feel like anyone who plays it will come away with something, even if they don't like Always Sometimes Monsters.   Lastly, as just a note about something, at the very end of the story, 'his' was said in reference to Sam, even though she was female at the time.",

The main problems are very sensitive and annoying movement controls - huge problem on the   hacking levels and vents  , but also they brilliantly decided that F12 would make you exit to the menu and lose your progress with no confirmation dialog, anyone who's used Steam for a time knows F12 is screenshots. Thanks, I got to watch the   wedding scene   all over again after being a few seconds from 'winning' with what I'd call a perfect ending (  girl + journal  ) because I decided to take a screenshot for my wife!   I can't rate graphics due to the style, but I did witness the off characters walking through walls instead of doors, walking over desks (like the   P.I.'s office  ) and other sprites, occasional graphical glitches, but nothing severe.  Additionally, on the note of glitches, on my first playthrough I did everything exactly the same as my perfect playthrough, but at the   Casey/journal   dialog, I was blamed for a lot of nasty things I didn't do, and I utterly lost no matter what I chose in the   casino level  . Those things weren't mentioned in the second playthrough, except they accused me of   rigging the election when I didn't  , and I otherwise won. So it's clear there's som save corruption going on there in both my playthroughs.  Negativity aside, the story was great and touching, however considering the emphasis on choice, and less emphasis on graphics, I think the endings could have been more diverse which would have given more replay value, but they were good. I especially loved the diverse character choises, but it would have been interesting if the characters you chose could effect the playthrough, like if you chose a large/muscular character you could choose the   security uniform choice and/or be blocked from choosing the vents on the hacking/election level  , but that's just my opinion.  Overall, I give the game a 7/10, it really gets you thinking, and really pushes your feelings and motivation/choices.  Explained: How to Get Perfect Ending - [Spoilers]   First I need to say, the perfect ending is getting the girl and the journal/book deal. Ultimately, this is easy.  Obviously the first tip is to be a good guy, all the way through. When you are playing you will see two pictures on your [ESC] or pause menu, you and your lover. As the game progresses, your lover's moves further away or closer to yours depending on your choices, at the beginning of the game your lover's picture will be close to yours, roughly the 75/80% mark. There's no way to tell what is the actual 100% mark, unless you have the same characters as me and look at my placement (mine didn't move any since I arrived at Salt City, aside from the tux). Unfortunately the 100% appears to be the necessary requirement for the girl and the deal as another save thats slightly lower, maybe at 95%, was a game 'loss'.  DO NOT BUY THE TUXEDO  When you buy and put on the tux, you will see your lover's portrait move roughly 10-15% AWAY from you, meaning the tuxedo is negative on your final score (maybe it makes you look pompous/money hungry?) and will ruin your ending. This is the one choice I am certain hurts your ending because I tested it being so close to the end. With the tux, she chooses her fiancee over me every time unless I save him by giving the journal (paying debt won't work) and ask him to cancel the wedding in the Casino, without the tux I pay off the debt, get her back, and ger the journal for myself.  Quite simple actually, and the hint (the portraits) was staring us in the face the whole time.  Some other notes: 1. Couple score has nothing to do with the ending, it's a code saying what two characters you picked. It was the same for me on all three my playthroughs with the same characters all through the game. 2. Fate score has nothing to do with the ending either, and appears to affect chance at winning lotto, casino games, and other chance based stuff, may also affect the speed on the race. I'm not sure what changes it though, as it seems erratic, do something good, goes up, do something good, goes down.  ",

I found the characters and the story are both engaging and surprising easy to become invested in. All the different choices give the game excellent replay value, as well as constantly provoking thought on a multitude of ethical issues.  The game isn't wihtout fault, random one time mini games can be a rather jarring change of tone, and particularly frustrating when you fail and don't get a chance to redo them. Plus the pace drops significantly when quests run dry in a town and you're left scraping up money for transport to the next town, which can be rather tedious and ends up kicking your immersion right in the balls. Even with those minor issues I still think this is an amazing game and highly recomend plaing it to anyone who has yet to do so.",

However, as far as the main story goes, I feel that many of your choices don't have too much of an efffect, and sometimes I felt too railroaded. I don't intend to spoil any story-points, but I felt a little cheated by the ending.  Beyond choice-making, the game has a few minigames to play in order to earn cash. 99 percent of them felt like grinding in an old RPG without any of the fun of a battle system. As I stated before, no battle system is okay. However, I would expect the minigames to be somewhat entertaining if they're going to be replacing it completely.  Overall, this game is worth checking out if you enjoy throw-back pixel-graphic games and an interesting story that makes you think.

This game has very varying gameplay, very great character choices, but it can be quite confronting.  Sometimes when you play the game you will be faced with a difficult choice, and what you choose will not only affect the storyline of the game, but also the gameplay. So for example, if you choose to work in a tofu factory instead of a meat factory for temp work. If you work in the meat factory you will get more money, which will help massively in the rest of the game, but the gameplay will be a lot more boring, as you cannot leave until work is finished. But in the tofu factory you can leave anytime you want, so if you get bored of the gameplay, you can leave, but you get less money overall, which may affect your game. Also making a choice may also affect your morality. If you make a 'good' decision, as opposed to an 'evil' decision, things will turn out very differently. If you deicde to do something, it might mean you cannot do another thing. You might end up missing out on oppitunities and experiences. So experiences require you to do boring tasks, while other require you to do exciting and interesting things. It's really up to you.  The character choices are quite good. You are allowed to play as a homosexual couple, an interracial couple or a heterosexual couple. Obviously you will experience different things depending on what you pick. The game will even let you be transgender! This is very important if you want to have your character as close to yourself as possible, or if you want to try and understand the situtation that others are in. It will not make you completely understand the complexity of another person's mind and experiences, but it will at least give you a chance to empathise. Having a character that it like yourself will (in my case at least) make you feel closer to the character and become more involved in the story.   Despite all this great stuff, the game is quite confronting in many places. This can be seen as a good or a bad thing. It can be seen as a good thing to make an impact and to get you more emotional about the story/game, but it can also make you feel very uncomfortable to play. If it does make you feel uncomfortable, it is just a game, that you can turn off, and leave for as long as you want, before you can continue playing again (if you wanted to continue playing). The game has some slurrs mixed in to the dialogue, and some harsh statements as well, they don't come up extremely often, but often enough to make a bit of an impact. I have probably not experienced all the harsh statments myself, as I have not done that many playthroughs, but be warned that if you pick a gay couple, a woman, or a person of colour, you might run into some slurrs and/or harsh words, so to avoid confrontation I guess you could play as a straight, white couple and a man, but don't feel obliged to. Outside of the character choices, you will still hear some words, but not as often.  This is a pretty good game, not just in the basics of the characters, the dialogue and the choices, but it is quite beautiful, even with the style. It also has some pretty good music. The storyline is the classic 'must get my lover back', but you can also choose to just ignore them and focus on yourself. The only big problem with it is how tedious it is to start a new game, as you need to click through a lot of text boxes at the start, but it can also be quite fun to replay, as there are so many ways to play the game.",

Always Sometimes Monsters casts you into the role of whoever you want to be: straight, gay, lesbian, racist or not racist. If you are a fan of getting very involved in a character's story, down to every decision they make that ultimately decides the course of their fate, then this game is for you.Do you do what is morally right, or do you do whatever it takes to satisfy your personal needs, selfish or immoral as they may be? As with many games of this genre, the 'gameplay' is more or less a vehicle to your personal choices of how you decide your character should react in a given situation. There is walking to and from locations, there are even little minigames spattered throughout the story, but none of these quite embody what this game is truly about: choice. Choices that are seen as shades of gray, not black or white. Everything you do has a consequence, but it's relative to your personal view of what is 'right' or 'wrong'.  The fact the game exudes this quality, on minimal animation and somewhat restricted graphics, is nothing short of amazing. I've spent the past 8 hours playing through one possible outcome of this tale, and all throughout I knew I could have taken the story in a different turn of events. And the thing is, the whole experience was ENJOYABLE. Doing mundane jobs to make ends meet on day to day basis, while ultimately preparing to embark on a new journey and unfold more of the story is what this game is all about. It's a perfect life simulator. Life isn't fair, but sometimes you have the choice of accepting the hand that is dealt to you, or demanding a reshuffle and seeing what you can do to change it. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who doesn't need 'next-gen' graphics to enjoy a game, and who enjoys a good story. Because after all, it is a story you write yourself, and your enjoyment will ultimately come from your very own decisions that you make within it. And sometimes, despite our good intent, we become monsters to gain what we want. This game displays that beautifully. One of the most thought provoking games I've played in years.   ",

Your choices begin right from the start with the most unique character generation I've seen in a game in a very long while. You choose not only your character, but your character's love interest from a wide pool of character models that include various ethnicities and genders. And yes, you can pair your character with a member of the same sex. Elegantly implemented inclusion. Your choice of character model and their partner have minor effects on dialogue and how people see you--but for the most part it seems options and conversations pan out relatively the same. Note: I've only done one complete play through as a white woman involved in a lesbian relationship.   Most of the traditional gameplay you'll find is contained within short mini-game segments that range from complete cake walk to incredibly frustrating--boxing mini-game, I'm looking at you. These mini-games only serve to supplement the CYOA story, and are brief interludes. The various jobs you can choose to do in order to earn enough money to accomplish your immediate goals can also be considered mini-games, though they are little more than menu procedurals and repetitive tasks--don't expect to have a burning passion to do these jobs for any longer than you have to, which is the whole point. The jobs are a means to an end, both to the player and their character.  The game's greatest strength is its story and offering the player options to choose their own path through the narrative. As with all CYOA stories--and the same could be said about most video games--the game only has a few set paths for you to take that lead to one of a few endings. You shouldn't expect the freedom of an open world, but you should look forward to a deep story about choice and humanity you can pick your way through. Many of the choices you'll be presented with will be binary choices, but whether one choice is horrible and the other decent and reasonable is left up to the player to parse out for themselves. What the games does well is packaging many of these choices in such a way that the options available may not be readily stated, but are allowed by the system should you chose to go that route. Your more questionable choices will be called out later in the story and choosing to regret those choices or feeling justified in what you did considering the circumstances is up to you--the game does not pass down authoritarian judgment. I have some gripes about some of the choices to be made and the fairness of those outcomes, but that wanders far into spoiler territory, but let it said there will be some scenes where the consequences for your actions could not be seen beforehand and it may seem unfair. The game seeks to tries to not be judgmental of the player's choices, but at the same time has its own agenda to push--which may or may not be okay with some folks.   During my first play through I didn't get the ending I thought I was heading toward, but upon reflection of the choice I made through the game and through establishing my character's backstory through some key choices, I understood why I ended up where I did. While extremely bittersweet, I couldn't deny the effect the story I had chosen for myself had on me. I am currently going through the game a second time, wanting to give my character the ending that they deserve. I am running into content that I missed out on in my first play through because of the choices I made then. The game at least warrants two play throughs.  The story and choices aren't without their heavy-handed moments. Early on the choice of temp job you have is between working at a slaughterhouse and a soy processing plant. The game actively tries to make you feel bad for killing the pigs, but throws in the incentive that you'll make more money quicker, but with a limited run. The soy processing plant will make you money more slowly, but if you have the patience to stomach it, you could make more money than you would at the slaughterhouse. There's a commentary on sustainability in there somewhere, but I digress.  If you're looking for a story that will dive deep into the underbelly of humanity and make you consider questions of choice and desperation and love, Always Sometimes Monsters provides an incredible experience. What it may lack in relative freedom, within the confides of its system and its Choose Your Own format Monsters provides a tightly crafted and satisfying feels inducing experience worth the price of admission.",

This game tells a story of someone who has lost his or her love, and you decide whether you fight for it or leave it be. By making me make so many choices this game became a lot more personal to me, and there even are some lines of dialog that hit me deep. How everything plays out is in your hands, whether it's a dark or bright ending is your choice. This is the biggest strength of this game, since it feels so personal.  I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack edition, since I don't think it's that good. It's okay as background music to this game, but nothing out of the ordinary.",

I think I got this game in a bundle at some point. I installed it today not knowing what to expect since I hadn't yet looked into what this game was past the name. What i got was what I can only describe as a Super NES melodrama. Not that its a bad thing, mind you. Sometimes always monsters is very unique. Without going into spoilers, this plays like an old adventure game. You'll walk around talking to people and interacting with the environment. The graphic style looks like something from the 16 bit era. The music is pretty cool too. This is mostly a semi interactive visual novel, though. I don't believe the branching paths branch all that far in that from what I've played so far, It seems that the main character is locked into either doing certain things or losing the game altogether. Maybe I'm wrong.   All in all though, Always Sometimes Monsters is pretty good and worth checking out. The 10 dollar price tag does seem a wee bit high so grab it on sale if you can.

I was positively surprised by it.  Character choice is interesting and new, although at first I didn't quite understand what I was meant to be doing. This later turns out to be the absolute purpose of the game, I guess. You're down on life, your love has left you, and you know nothing as certain as that you have to get her back. So you go on a long, sometimes brutal journey to reach him/her, making ethical decisions on the way, deciding how to make the days count. The game can at times be slow, but it gripped me from the start with its writing. Events happen frequently and keep the pace just fine. I honestly cared for some of the characters and found myself sometimes going back to a previous safe just in order to amend a bad decision I made. Although I imagine going with your guts at first and sticking to them is also really great in this game. And probably makes more sense for what the developers intended.   Here your choices really give the impression of mattering, and you have a large impact on the lives of the other characters in the story. Be good, be bad, you can be always a monster, sometimes a monster - you get the idea.   Can really recommend this game. Worth several playthroughs I reckon, because one playthrough is definitly not enough to see all the options there could be if you had only done something different. Always a few other people to side with, or other decisions to make that determine how you feel about the person you made the character become in the end.  Ending is probably a bit deterministic. From what I can see so far there is about three or four different endings, but they dont necessarily rely too much on all the things you have decided during the journey. I enjoyed the ending nonetheless, although it wasn't the best written part in the story. Something a character in the story says comes to mind 'are you prepared for your happy ending?' well we might not even want it. Or something like that.  Anyway. Graphics are charming. Music stays in the head but is always well fitting. Few minigames to break the old mold, some of them pretty fun. Real interesting concept. Can recommend wholeheartedly.",

But that's exactly what this game is about: Life.

I really wasn't expecting my character to get really depressed and go insane because he lost his girlfriend. I thought i heard him say during the game that it would be worse if he stayed home and didn't do anything. I was expecting if I did get rejected that my character might live an ok life without the girl. Not going insane and becoming homeless all over again.  Secondly, I really didn't enjoy myself 75% of the game  I feel like if there is some part where you are supposed to enjoy it, it is at the end if you get the good ending. From some of the other 'your descions will impact what happens in the game' type games that I have watched and played, I've enjoyed myself more. The main parts of those games are enjoyable and captivating. The only enthralling part in this game was the things in Salt City you had to do. Besides that Dubstown and Beaton weren't my peice of cake. However I do understand that Dubstown had to miserable because you had to start from the bottom to get to the top.  At the end, I think what i want is a neutral ending. Something where i'm fine not getting the girl. Basically do away with the whole gun holdup seen at the beggining and end of the game.   BUTTTTTT, All in all this is a pretty great game. Great soundtrack. The deign great most of the time(some characters are drawn worse than others). Deep characters. Great plot. 8/10",

And some points were pretty hilarious, like when I broke into a doctor's mansion to recover evidence of his teddybear fetish for blackmail.  Unfortunately, there were many points in the game where I was unsure of what to do. I would spend a good half hour or more wandering around town trying to find something, ANYTHING to do to pass the evening so they game would FINALLY let me start a new day. Othertimes it was very redundant. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious to get a job butchering pigs ALL DAY LONG... but when I've got to do that for three days in a row, it got pretty dull. I guess work is work, and that's reflective of real life. But in the end I felt it sort of forced my hand. As recommended, I named the main character after me, and the ex after my ex. But I really had no desire to travel across country to go to her wedding. I mean, inviting me to her wedding? That was a 'dickish' thing to do. I'd rather work hard and get my life back on track... But butchering pigs was pretty dull, so in the end I bought a bus ticket, just so I could pull out a little more entertainment out of this game. Because there was literally NOTHING else I could do at that point.  I also wasn't a huge fan of a lot of the dialogue. There was a lot of swearing, trash talking, etc that detracted (I felt) from the game. Maybe that's just me, but it felt overused. Also some of the dialogue and cut scenes were... long and without much substance. Maybe that's another way this game tried to mirror real life.

I really hate to say I don't recommend this game. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into it. It's only $10, and a lot of people really enjoy it. You might really enjoy it too. Who knows?

Because I played the GoG version of this game already, and I just felt like increasing my game count on Steam when I got this off the latest Humble Bundle. Also because Steam requires me to play the game for 5 minutes before I can post a review. Don't let the lack of hours here influence your opinion, please. I'm sure my review below will show that I know the game. This review was also orignally going to be MUCH longer, but it turns out that Steam doesn't like it when I write too many words.  ASM is a game made in RPGmaker, which already earns it negative points because RPGmaker is an awful engine, that is all about your choices, expect not really. You're allowed to pick your character from a handful of characters in a room, and then you can pick your LI from a handful of characters in another room. Yes, you can choose to be a gay man, or a lesbian, because this game wants you to think its ~progressive~ when the entire game is written to be pretenious. The game has you going from town to town and sometimes experiencing flashbacks, trying to earn money and fix the 'main problem' in each town so you can get to your LI and try to stop her wedding. Of course, you also get dialogue choices that allow you to say 'Nah, I'm over her', but they don't matter and I'll tell you why soon. The game has four 'towns' for you to deal with, with the first town having the most content. It's an awful place that lets you see first hand how choices don't matter at all. You did Option A? Ending A happens. Did Option B? Ending A still happens, but with a teensy-tiny variation. The only time where the game isn't sniffing its own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is in the second town when it decides to correctly say Republicans and Democrats are both terrible people who are in corporate pockets.  There are also flashbacks, as mentioned, about your college life and the life you had with your LI. These flashbacks, for me, only confirmed that my old college friend and my LI were both huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who I would refuse to deal with if I had the choice, which I don't, because this game provides as much 'freedom of choice' as a Fable game, but at least Fable can provide variations in the endings for each choice. Anyway, when you meet your LI, it turns out they didn't want you at the wedding, but your friend, who is marrying LI, invited you. The same friend that your LI told you to screw over and the same friend that your LI called a creepy little stalker. Turns out your friend managed to get a publishing deal even after you screwed him (guess your LI only wants to go with whomever is gonna get the deal), and the LI's father decides to confront you on your choices in the game, even through it doesn't matter, because all you can say is 'I regret it' and 'I don't regret it'. You are also asked for the reason you're around, and I reconfirmed that I was around only to say goodbye to my LI. You're forced to go to Vegas and gamble because you probably only got $1000 to your name and you need $15000 if you want to buy a tuxedo and get the best 'ending' for you and your friend (otherwise he dies or you lose your book deal).  Wedding happens, I let the girl go so she can get married, and yet despite me saying repeatedly that I did not want to get back with my LI, I turn out to become a bum because she was my TRUE LUV and without her, despite the fact that I could easily get a job and find someone else, I'm just a useless sack of ♥♥♥♥.  So I replayed it, this time going for the girl, slightly changing my choices, mostly taking the bad ones, dealing with that AWFUL boxing minigame in the third town, telling the parent I regret all my choices and I want the girl back, and then I win her back. Woo. Now my friend is the bum because she was his TRUE LUV even though he had his own book deal he could finish, and he was doing pretty god damn fine before he got with the girl.  This game doesn't respect your choices. It doesn't even care about them. It's a game about you being in true love with a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ (or huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its a guy), your friend being a prick, and everyone you know being useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, except for the cowboy guy in Town 3, who was the only person in the game worthy of any respect. I was tempted to play a 3rd time and make all the worst choices, because I suspect so long as you say 'I regret', you want the LI back, you make sure your book deal is safe and that your 'friend' lives, you can get the 'best end', which is you getting back with an awful person.  I regret the money I paid for for this game on GoG and regret the dollar I gave to Humble Bundle, since it included this piece of crap. 3/10, and that's only because I'm feeling generous. I wish Steam would increase the character count for reviews so I can really get into how awful this game is. Now to remove this piece of crap from my computer again.",

It's obvious that two dudes with too much time on their hands, and too high of an opinion of themselves, decided to open up RPG Maker one day, rope in some folks to do all their art/music, and release a turd.  The beginning has some nice ideas, but in the end, the game is just thoroughly unenjoyable. It's not fun.   If you like poorly-thought-out minigames, grinding chores over and over, save scumming when you bankrupt yourself just to get a slightly un-♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending, and writing on par with a seventh-grader's English assignment, then you'll enjoy this game.

It looked like it was going to be a thought-provoking, deep experience where people would be able to compare the different choices that they had made and the outcomes that resulted from them. I was wrong.  Though on a first playthrough it is easy to believe that the choices that you are making change the story, a second playthrough (or even a bit of research) quickly prove otherwise. At best your choices make a minor difference that lasts about as long as the next scene. At worst, there is literally no difference at all. Once you discover that the choices in the game don't matter all that much, your second realization is that the story is rather bland as well. I'll avoid discussing the ending for the sake of those who are reading this review but still wish to give the game a chance but I definitely suggest not getting your hopes up.  As far as the story goes, there were several parts that entertained me and (while still having the belief that choices affected the narrative in a major way) seemed promising. On the opposite side of that, there was plenty in the game that drained the fun out of it. The vast majority of the jobs in the game were an absolutely terrible grind. This makes it so that earning money is less of side quest and more of 'you know, I think I'm going to skip eating today' moment. Call that realism if you'd like, though I prefer to enjoy myself the entire time that I'm playing a game.  Overall, the game was okay up until the discovery of an extremely linear storyline and downright bad after it. It had potential to be a great game if the developers had put a little more heart into it.",

The game is LOOOONG and for bad gameplay reasons, since the story is relatively short, issues like movement and dialogue speed make the game feel sluggish, there are some nice story beats every now and then but ultimately they fail to deliver.  The game promises a choice driven experience which is completely false, your decisions are inconsequential until the final moments of the game in which it boils down to the traditional choice structure that you've seen in a million other games.  I have to give credit where its due, the game starts with promise when choosing the main character and the love interest, but it falls short just a couple of hours into the game when it becomes a snorefest of doing chores and getting X amount of money to get Y or doing X thing for Y to get something in return (which usually translates to money or quest items).  The humor wasn't to my liking, some people may be into it but it felt pretty immature and cheessy. I would also have liked an option to get over your love interest, the whole story hinges on the presumption that the player wants to get back the ex, since there is no way to make your character get over him/her, this makes him/her (i.e. your character) feel unidimensional, stupid, and boring.  Also the game developers appear on the game, their inclusion felt like it didn't fit at all and they wanted to give themeselves a semi-important part on the game, appearing on every single city and even on the epilogue, they felt out of place in the game and the wall-breaking wasn't to my taste.  I can see what they (i.e. the developers) were trying to achieve with this but I felt ike they didn't succeed , nevertheless there are some good ideas which could be rescued and I'd like to see them expanded like documenting a journey or dynamic character interaction based on your main character, so I'll be looking forward to the next game they make, but if possible I'd skip their first stab at accomplishing their vision.  I seriously can't recommend this game there are many other things I didn't like but most of the reviews I've read also cover those issues I had with the game (e.g. save scumming, bad endings all around, incoherent story, dumb stamina system, etc.), if you're planning to play a similar game with a great story and even developed on the same engine I'd recommend playing To the Moon, both your time and money would be invested better in that game.",

I love indie games, I'm a fan of retro graphics. I'm a huge fan of storytelling type games even if it has minimal gameplay.   But this game has a very weak narrative that just doesn't make sense if you try to analyze any of it past the base level. All the 'twists' don't make sense. It feels forced and contrived at points.   Also the moral choices feel about as subtle as a bat to the face over and over again. Most of the choices were extremely obvious, back away from this situation or somebody dies. But the 'moral choice' was always much longer in terms of gameplay time which meant more boring 'minigames' and by the time I was halfway through I just wanted the game to end to see how the story finished.   Also quite a few of the moral choices weren't obvious in terms of the game forcing you into the situation first and then asking you to reconsider. I'm already there man, and there was no dialogue to just say no from the start so might as well see how this plays out.   I got pretty tired of half the music looping after about 15-30 seconds.   It felt like any message they were trying to deliver was basically drowned out by all the archetypical stereotypical characters they presented in the game. Yes, they weren't trying to say 'all drugs are bad mmkay' but it felt that way. Yes, they weren't trying to say 'religion will set you free!' but it felt that way. The writing didn't express the author's intent as much as it did the characters moral values which were always extremely black and white. The authors definitely wanted a grey moral area but I felt it lacked the execution to do so.

Damn near nobody cares about us; they're all out to get their own.

            "review_text": "The game is story-driven and you have to ignore the fact that RPG Maker is not the best engine, I got it. But I couldn't enjoy the story and the characters whatsoever (just the old lady, the old lady is adorable).  The characters are very poorly written. There's a lady who had a problem with drugs and she's supposed to be your friend. But why? I don't know! And you have to make a decision to save her. But I had no sympathy for her at all! And that's how I saw all the characters in this game: all of them are very shallow (including the protagonist). With no sympathy for the main characters, what's left? A monotonous game, full of tedious and repetitive jobs. The soundtrack is also very repetitive.  I just don't recommend it.",
