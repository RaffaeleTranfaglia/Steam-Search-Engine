Kabukiman, Toxie, and Lloyd Kauffman himself, appearences from Lemmy, Matt and Trey of Baseketball fame, you'll soon realize the gameplay does not deliver.  I played this for a short time, and the only thing it did for me was make me want to purchase Troma films. Maybe that was the idea, who knows.",
