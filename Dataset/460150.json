It is really cheesy, but I think cheesy is kind of cute =) I wish there was more to it, it took me about half an hour to play through, I do like short novels but not for this price. And I wish I could connect to the character more, more backstory to WHO you are. I know it really tried through dialogue, but maybe a little more would really help.  Voice Acting: The lady in the beginning the receptionist, her voice is cute =) I know my voicing was dramatic, and it was done to suit the theme, like in anime (which I am used to VA anyway) Visual Novel = Drama :P  Music: Yes. I love the music, soundtrack suits the scenes, but I wish there was more variety.   Worth 3.99? Eh. 6/10 I'd try it. 6 endings. I    ran away with Tara woohoo &lt;3 love forever  ",

            "review_text": "this game only has one story line. It is very boring, and when it says 7 different endings, its not really what you pick half the time that influences the outcome. No matter what dialogue you pick, it ends up being the same dialogue, there is nothing fun about this game. I honestly expected a better game 0/10, definately do not buy, go find another game.",
