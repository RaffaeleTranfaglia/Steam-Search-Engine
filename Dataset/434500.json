            "review_text": "BATTLE PIXELS its like upgraded version of well know Tanks game. Gameplay very simple, same as from original Tanks - need destroy enemy units and you win round. Great 16-bit retro style and soundtrack (I like it very much). But keep in mind, its hard game, I am failed a lot of levels! Need more practice for me :) Also, the things what I dislike are no support my resolution and force enabling fullscreen after complete levels. In overall nice indie game and worth $1.59 USD for sure.",
