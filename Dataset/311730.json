Even after reading the warning about the game not having online play available at launch, I reserved a bit of optimisim that it would still be fun to play, regardless; after all, I had played many previous editions with no online support and enjoyed them nonetheless.  Having now played the game a little bit, I cannot recommend it.   The game itself looks great, and the move execution is the same as it always has been, which is to say, not the best out there, but certainly good for the game. The inclusion of so many characters is a nice touch. Those are the upsides.  Now onto the litany of problems:  The arcade mode is dismal. The training mode offers nothing new over the previous iterations. There are times when the game hiccups a bit - I'm running Dual GTX 970's 32gig of ram, i7 processor and an SSD - there is absolutely no reason this game should ever hiccup. I pre-ordered this game for quite a bit more than it is now selling for, and I received in return almost nothing, and now, shortly after release, they make the game cheaper. When I took a look today at the DLC packs available I could not believe my eyes - $65 for a set of 'costumes' for the characters? Is this some kind of sick joke? Tecmo wants more than the price of the game itself for add on content that used to be accessible simply by putting time into the game? And to add insult to injury, there's more than one DLC pack?  If you're thinking of buying this game, don't. Wait for it to inevitably be moved to the discount so that at least you won't have to pay full price for the utter disappointment that awaits you.",

Let's discuss what I liked about it: I felt that some of the fighters had some 'weight' behind them, you could register the impact they were making on the environment. And I liked some of the soundtrack.  That being said, the game is a shambles. Framerate issues, visible delays in audio during cut-scenes, loss of sound during some video sequences, no achievements, no steamworks integration, not even online multiplayer at launch.... that really isn't acceptable in 2015 (it wasn't even nice in 2014 mind you). On top of that, considering the time it took to get it onto PC you'd expect them to use the XBone or PS4 SoftEngine, not the PS3 port, but no luck there. You're stuck with the port.   I imagince once online multiplayer is patched in I might update my review, but until then I'd suggest you look for other, more appealing and online fighting games, there are plenty on Steam to take your pick!

I expected a functional online RELEASE, not beta.    Let's me get this straight. It exceeds my expectation. Althought I have extremely low expectation to begin with.  Controller support were ok. I have F310, which means it supports XInput and DirectInput, both worked well with some config in game, which means covers 99% of pc controller. 'Not all controller are test', They are probably being cautious.  PC Specs are higher than what graphic should require, but it's not night unplayable. I have GTX970 plus i5-3470, it worked pretty well except a bit lower framerate in cutsence and menu, but it runs stable 60FPS in game, that's what it matters.  It's not good, but not horrendous either. The 'NO' in the recommend section is to judge this game as a PC FTG alone--No netplay in 2015 is not acceptable. I might change it if Koei showed their effort in supporting this game. It's enjoyable if you are a DOA fan like me, just make sure to know that you are not paying for the most bang of your buck at this moment. PS4 still a golden startard for DOA5 right now.",

I bought this version as DOA is my favorite fighting game of all time and I want to play it when I travel on my laptop. Here's a few details about the difference between the two versions:   Graphics  Don;t be so quick to dismiss the PC version. The graphics are basically equal on both versions (But I get a better framerate on my laptop). All this noise about the soft engine and some items being equivalent to the ps3 version is totally crazy. MAYBE if I bring my laptop downstairs and pause both versions side by side I'd see a difference....no guarantees. Giving this game a bad review due to the lack of the soft engine is like hating a hamburger because the bun has 2% less sesame seeds.    Cost  PC version is way cheaper! The PS4 version (which I bought from PSN) is really weird. You have to download the demo, and then buy the story as DLC for $13 (which I regret doing...the story mode is beyond useless). Then you have to pay $50 for the 30 characters. That was $63 compared to Steams $40 AND I got a million costume packs for the steam edition. All the ps4 costumes are expensive as hell.   ***Quick side note - I bought the story mode on PSN because I thought you needed it to get trophies....but there aren't any on PSN either. Very strange as I thought every playstation game was required to have them.   Online  No debate here....PS4 has full online with the cool share button features as well. No steam online for 3 months which would make this a terrible purchase for you if you only play online. I mainly play local competitive or arcade mode so I'm not missing out.    Random thoughts     The loading time on the PS4 is surprisingly good, but not nearly as nice as having the game installed on your SSD. Game is extremely fast on steam!    I have the wireless 360 controller for windows and it works flawlessly. No strange button maps here.     I'm using a laptop with a nvidia 770M (Which is low/mid range compared to desktop cards). The game runs flawlessly @1080p and I never see any slowdown.     People still care about steam achievements??? They're so useless O.o  Anyways... I do agree about the online functionality. Hopefully that gets fixed sooner than later. But all these other complaints seem really unnecessary. Go out and try the PS4 version if you really want to see the difference in graphics. The game play is identical, with the exception of the better loading times which makes a big difference for me.    ",

            "review_text": "If you want Dead or Alive 5 just as a fighting game, and can wait patientily and practice for the next 3 months for the release of the online mode, then this is definitely worth getting as it now stands as probably the best 3D fighting game on Steam. We have no Tekken (yet), SoulCalibur, or Virtua Fighter, so as it stands the competition is near non existent. That is unless you count games like Naruto, which while good, are not really what I would call true competitive fighting games.   Dead or Alive 5 as a 3D fighting game is more than competent. It's fast. It's flashy. It's just fun to play. Nothing wrong with that.   Sure, this being Team Ninjas 2nd game to be ported to Steam, they are still showing they have a LOT to learn. I mean as far as ports go, this one is far from perfect. But it is not as broken as some say. It is missing some stuff. But the core gameplay is at this stage is excellent.   What is missing? The Danger Zone and Crimson stages which are PS4/XBOX One exclusive The Soft Engine Some PS4 particle effects Online mode (coming in the next 3 months) Support for keyboard configuration  The only 2 things in that list I find a bit unacceptable would be the lack of online, which IS being patched in, and the keyboard configuration. Hopefully the KB configuration will be patched in later. Though I find for a 3D fighting game, that a controller works much better. And this game has controller support. But the other 3 things? I'm not going to whine and say this game sucks because of the lack of those things, like some people are doing. Why? Because I actually have enjoyed the game so far. And is that not what matters?   As for the game itself, Dead or Alive 5 is like a much faster and flashier Tekken and Virtua Fighter. A game that focuses mainly on hand to hand combat. It includes a basic fight system that consists of a punch, kick, grapple, and reversal button. It allows movement in all directions, with a basic side to side 2D movement as the primary, and an easy sidestepping as the alternate. Each of the 30+ characters has a wide array of moves and combos, and varying styles of fighting as to not have too many 'duplicates' among characters. One of the big features of the DoA series is the reversal button, in which if you time and aim it right can reverse almost any move. But timing is the key. So people who master this move will obviously have a major advantage. The nice thing is that DoA very easy to learn. But DoA is also hard to master. It's a game you can play both casually and competitively and have fun either way.   Stages are the next big draw for the DoA series, as DoA is one of the first 3D fighting game seires to include multi-tiered fighting levels with breakable walls, or other hazards that knock players into new parts of the stage. And it looks absolutely fantastic when doing this. Like starting the fight on top of a balcony and knocking someone over the edge into a courtyard below, or smashing someone through a wall into the next room, and more like this.   And of course, the absolute biggest draw (though some will be ashamed to admit it) for DoA is the costumes. And there are tons of them. If you did not preorder the game, you still get a massive assortment of costumes to select from for the 30+ characters. Yes, the costume DLC at this point is ridiculously overpriced, but I guess fans are going to pay what fans are going to pay. But none of it is required to get the most enjoyment out of the fighting portion of the game.   Anyways, this is not really a review, but just me rambling, and looking for a way to give a thumbs up to this game. If you want a solid fighting game and prefer to game on your PC, and can wait a littloe bit for the online mode, get this. If you would rather have the soft engine, some better particles, and 2 extra stages (which are not even that great), by all means give the PS4/XBOX One versions a shot.   I'll probably do an actual review for this once the online mode is up.",

The gameplay is solid and I have spent hours on trying to unlock all the costomes available by playing the arcade multiple times. It is fun and I enjoy the gameplay. The characters are not too complicated to pick up and play. The girls are still sexy. So far the game is great if it wasn't for the many things that is wrong with it in the first place, which brings me to the bad. The main problem right now is that there is still no online play, the game has been on the Steam Market for many months now that it still doesn't have online multiplayer. Supposedly there was a beta test a while back but it soon got taken down and TK announced there was going to be another delay and this time without a timeframe. My second issue is that there are problems using controllers for this game. Using any controller seems to have problems with mapping. For me the Right stick button seems to be the START button.   So overall I will still give this game a thumbs down and that's because of Tecmo Koei's fault. They seem to have abandoned this game, I assume in retaliation over the nude mods that appeared on PC just a few weeks after the games release even after TK said no no no to that kind of modding. So I highly doubt we'll ever see DOAX3 on PC or any of the previous titles that's for sure.  So overall I will only recommend this game for people that are huge fans of the game but don't buy it at full price.... buy it half off or less.",

            "review_text": "Dead or Alive on PC is currently not in the best condition of its console coutnerparts, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game..  PROS -32 playable characters each with their own unique fighting style -Several Costumes for each Character Unlockable just by playing the game. -Several different fighting arenas ranging from a Chinese Temple to the frozen Arctic Wastes -Beautiful Stylized Visuals -'Physics'  CONS -Missing Content from Console Versions -Lack of Soft Engine -Various Technical Failings -Lack of Online Multiplayer (For 3 Months) -DLC is already in the game (Disk Locked Content)  STORY MODE   Yes, there is a story in here behind all the bouncing breasts. It revolves around Kasumi hunting her clone &amp; a fighting tournament set up by the evil corporations known as DOATEC (DoA Tec - Get it?). The story mode starts off going through multiple different characters &amp; then later you start playing one character for several missions at a time. It will then switch you between characters, etc, repeat process.   The story mode is set up fairly well. I haven't finished it myself just yet so I'll update this part of my review at a later date for the rest.  GRAPHICS  The graphics look great. Arenas are well designed &amp; stylized in their own unique way. The character models are another story. Yes, they are smooth &amp; good looking but they are also very mannequine-esque. They don't show any expressions &amp; when they talk in cutscenes they barely move their lips. It's like every character has had such severe plastic surgery that all their facial muscles are all dead.  The other thing is that this game is running on an older graphics engine, so the PC version is currently inferior in graphics to the PS4/Xbone counterparts. This may or may not change depending on what Team Ninja decides to do with the PC version.  The game still looks great though &amp; runs at a smooth 60 FPS (30FPS Cutscenes). The graphics can be changed slightly in the config to increase/decrease shadow &amp; monitor resolutions. The game even supports 4k monitors &amp; while I myself can't experience such a luxury just knowing it's there is pretty awesome.  You can also use SweetFX to make the graphics look better.   AUDIO  The voice acting is good, some voice overs are very cheesy. Like Helena's accent feels like she only sounds like that to fulfill some erotic roleplay fantasy. Other voice overs sound great &amp; sound like you'd think they should from a dub perspective. You can always change the voice acting to japanese if you don't like them in English.  GAMEPLAY  The game plays like a typical fighting game with a controller. You punch, kick, grab &amp; throw your way to victory. This is a 360 terrain fighter so you're not restricted to moving only left/right. It's been a while since I've played a 360 fighter so I've had to get used to it again. I think the last one I played was Soul Caliber 2 on the GCN.  You can also knock your enemies into different areas of the arena which triggers a cutscene &amp; shows them taking extra damage as they go through the transitions. They aren't as extravagant as the ones in Injustice but it's nice to see a good throw across the map when you can.  MISSING CONTENT  The game is missing 2 levels that are in the console versions of the game. While this does not break the games core experience it should be noted that they are in fact not available currently in this version. I myself do not own the consoles but from what I've heard the missing levels are something that is worth pointing out since they are supposedly the best &amp; coolest levels in the game.  There is also no online multiplayer for 3 months after the launch. This alone does make it inferior to it's console counterparts especially since all the console versions launched with multiplayer available.  Then there's the graphics engine which makes the characters look better. While this doesn't break the core game experience it does take away some good visual features that this game should have in it.  DLC  The DLC is also not available seperately &amp; must be purchased in packs which will cost you around $60 for each pack. Currently there are 2 packs available. I'm not sure why they decided on this set up for buying the DLC outfits. It very much feels like they are ripping you off with the huge price point but you do get each outfit for less than a buck a piece so it may not be so bad.   All of the outfits are ALREADY in the game which just pisses me off even more. You can preview them in the character select menu so you're basically just buying keys while already having the content on your computer. That alone is some BS.  TECHNICAL ISSUES  There is also an issue with the Steam version where if you change your Gamer tag you have a chance at losing your save data or having issues when it loads.   Also, some controllers are not supported or supported controllers have odd button mapping placements. I've read that people using Logitech F310 controllers are having the most issues. Swapping to D-Input mode will fix it, though.  OVERALL  The game has flaws with it's DLC (Disk Locked Content) &amp; missing features. The core game itself is good, though. It may not be as pretty as its console counterparts but if you don't have a console &amp; still want the DOA experience then this is worth the purchase price.   Reccommended for anyone who doesn't own a console.",

Usually i'd wait till it was on sale as I paid £30 for it, but absolutely no regrets as it brings back memories of playing Virtua Fighter and Tekken but with a load more sexy girls to choose from :)  The DLC costumes look amazing but they are extremely high in price.

Outrageous DLC ( 31 costumes for around 30-40 pounds?!!?!? ) most of them skimpy and purchase driven by 'LUST'.... HECK the game didn't cost me 30 pounds SO WHY ARE YOU OVER-CHARGING for costumes?! No sense at all. They say it's like 30 costumes BUT TAKE A PROPER LOOK : it's the same costumes BUT different characters! LO! Nurse uniform, school bloomers etc. Re-used. Why oh why anyone would buy it?! Just let us buy it individually for lower price ( sic )  NO online more ( gotta wait around 3 months )  Couple of DLC's are missing and 2 levels ( plus gravure mode )   Not all Gamepads are compatible   Team Ninja gave warning to Modders that they shouldn't really make 'naughty' mods because of 'morality'? OH REALLY? Your game is already immoral enough with skimpy clothes and 'bouncy' breasts physics which you have boasted about in the past! OH I GET IT! You don't want people to create 'skimpy' outfits BECAUSE YOUR OVERPRICED DLC'S WON'T SELL.  Hypocrites much?

I recommend this game for fans of the series, or the genre, who do not own one of the next (current) gen consoles. If you have a console, get that version.

Since DoA is more a T&amp;A-viewing game than a fighting game the DLC outfits which just show characters in less clothing make up a lot of post-purchase revenue for the developers. Right now, the price of all available DLC costumes exceeds $1000. No, there is no unlocking them with play time or achievements, either. Why would any PC player actually buy these instead of modding the game for user-created outfits (or the infamous nudity mods)? Team NINJA loves console players because they don't have this option; therefore, they find it appropriate that they 'punish' the PC players for  failing to adopt a 'moral' tone  [www.vg247.com]  for their mods.  Moral? MORAL?! Have you even once looked at the characters in this game? Saying that PC players should be punished for being 'immoral' is just a pathetic cover-up for 'we don't like that PC players don't have to pay us to see more skin'. What a joke.  Knowing that their Steam platform sales were awful, the Devs switched from the $40 base game to a freeminum model to try to at least get $5 here and there instead of the $40 they were charging beforehand since release. The fact that this happened a few weeks ago (Oct-6-2016) without any additional support that was promised on release shows that this is merely a cash cow for apathetic swine. Don't worry, though. No one has a right to complain since it's a 'free' game!  I can see why the devs hate the PC community since we can just mod the game to get those DLC outfits anyway. Do not support these developers with a single penny.  As an actual fighting game, it's still playable and decent enough, maybe a 6.5/10. I could probably enjoy it in small samples, but it lacks the depth of other fighters such as Street Fighter or SSB.",

So get the free version, make sure you can set the controller up right, THEN think about buying the game. Now, on to the review...  If you're looking for a deep fighting game to play off line every now and again, the game will deliver. Every character has a huge list of moves you can learn and practicing will definitely improve your game. The graphics are good enough. The game is perfect for stereoscopic (e.g. 3D Vision) users with the action taking place right at the range where eye triangulation works best and a small modification will push the interface out of the screen to prevent most of the depth crossing.  A lot of folks are complaining about overpriced DLC. What they are missing is that the DLC is totally optional. There's a couple of fighters (and those DLCs are actually reasonably priced) but the rest are just costumes. What's more, the modding scene for this game has provided a huge list of additional costumes you can have for free.  That said, there are plenty of valid issues with this game. The controllers are the biggest issue but you can now dodge that bullet by trying the game out before you pay. If you're looking to play with your friends over the network, look elsewhere. There's no lobby system in the PC version. It also has stability issues. The game saves enough that crashing isn't too painful but still....  So yeah - if you want to have some fun with a single player fighting game and would rather fight with buxom babes than watch somebody's head get ripped off and the blood drank, this is a good one.

The DLC available for this game is ridiculously over priced. There are currently four packs available in the store at the time of me writing this review. Even the cheapest DLC pack will cost you more than the price of the base game, and altogether cost over $200(not including the cost of the base game).  There are features missing from this version that are available in the console versions. I won't go into detail about this since the other reviewers have mentioned it enough.

Most of the outfits are locked, unless you buy a DLC pack. So basically you should pay 110euros to unlock content that is already within the game.  The fights are quite easy. You can get past the enemies by just pushing buttons in random order. There is no online play. In 3 months, it should be added in but by that time, this game is already forgotten. Features that are in console versions are missing, but the game does look good anyway.  Nice to watch boobs bouncing and the game really temps you to press a screenshot in poses key after the match is over. All in all, really little content for the cost. Don't get this, except from sale. Maybe.",

Don't let the CPU specs fool you, even the weaker AMD quad cores can run it perfectly, don't even worry about. I think they exaggerated the requirements, not cause they actually require that, but because they wanted to trick us into thinking 'wow do you see those CPU requirements!? This game MUST be next gen!' in order to trick the stupid people. Kind of like what they did with CoD Ghost, but the only difference is that that game runs like ♥♥♥♥ ON PURPOSE (to make people think only good PC's can run it for a true next gen experience), and this game runs great.  I run it at 1080P 60 FPS 4xSSAA with 4K shadow resolution and it couldn't look any better! Lots of people don't know this, but not even the next gen versions (PS4/XB1) have anti aliasing, you can see all the jaggies, even on PS4, so that is ONE HUGE upside to the PC version, believe me.  PROS - optimized - solid gameplay, deep counter combat system - sexy females - Possibly good online netcode? Well see in 3 months, but at least this gives me tons of time to practice up and actually learn the game being a street fighter player and all. - great graphics and sound track - PC players ONLY, we get 28 free halloween costumes that console players have to pay for as apart of the base game, meaning even after the promotional period ends, the costumes will be there for people who buy the game later down the line.  CONS - No PS4 particle effects - No SoFTFX feature - Lack of 2 stages that are on PS4 and XB1 for some reason",

The second is the negatives.  Dead or Alive 5: Last Round is one of the smoothest and most intuitive fighting games you can play on PC. The fighting system of DOA is maintained with the balance of attacks, throws, and holds that work like rock/paper/scissors. The game is balanced in such a way that it's almost impossible to ever get juggled infinitely as the counter hold system allows for plenty of opportunity to punish aggressive opponents and the games physics(?) just don't allow for 1-combo kills.  The roster of characters is solid. There should be at least one or two anyone will like. It isn't hard to get in start doing cool moves. The tutorial and command training sections provide the proper information for beginners trying to gain a better understanding of their favorite characters.  There are a ton of costumes for all the characters, and more can be purchased through DLC.  Plenty of modes for single-player, including a story mode that continues the plot of the previous games. The plot is written like a B-movie action film, just so you know.  Negative things:  You may have read some of this already on the Steam page or in the forums.  - Online mode isn't available yet. Developers are estimating 3 months until they can offer the feature in an update. I will update the post when the online feature is enable to testify whether it works and how customizable it is.  - The effects of the game are PS3 quality instead of PS4 (honestly isn't noticeable without direct comparison).  - 2 Stages are missing from game that are in the XBO/PS4 version. An odd exception, but they could be included in the future update.  - Controller support has a strange issue right now where gamepad triggers don't register, and instead of mapped to the Start/Select buttons, and Start/Select functions are mapped to analog stick buttons.  - No Steam Achievements, trading cards, or cloud support. Again, could be part of the future update. These elements will matter differently for different people. I personally don't care except for backing up my save.  - Speaking of saves, apparently there is an issue if your Steam name has special characters in. Changing your name may cause the file to be unusable. I don't know if just changing back to the original name prevents this or it just gets locked either way.  If you like fighting games, I really can't recommend this any more highly. If the negatives scare you, throw this game on your wishlist and wait for the online update later this year.",

Even some of the characters that do have similar moves have their personallity to them that really showcase that at least some thought was put into them.  There are quite a few modes in this game, Survival, Tag Team, Story, Command Training, Combo Training. All fun and unlock extra items for each character you beat a mode with. This is a minicon in the pro section but honestly it's not that big a deal. Due to this being the '5th' game in the series it has evolved quite a bit but there is a tutorial mode that goes indepth of all the mechanaics in this game. It helps new players get use to the game quickly. The thing is that it is LOOOOOOOOOOONG. Its not really a bad thing just be prepared. Stages are dynamic and vary when it comes to hazards, Music is freaking incredible, and it brings me back to the my childhood since Dead or Alive 2 was one of my first Video Games Cons:  I got this game the day it came out knowing I couldn't play it cause my Surface Pro couldn't run it. Once I got a laptop that could run it though, i had an issue where the game would not read my keyboard or my controller. This happend for about 6 months. I did get it fix but i honestly don't remember what i did to fix it. I now have a differnt more powerful laptop that has NVidia 940MX and 12 gigs of ram. And game runs great.  I wish the game had Cloud Save data or saved data through my account. Maybe its me and i need to set something up but each time I had to reinstall the game, whether it was due to a new laptop, or fixing the controller input sistuation i just mentioned, I would always have to start over, it usually wasn't that big since i haven't gotten that far it the game but its still annoying when games like Sonic Generations can save data regardless of which computer it is ran on and a game that is 18 months old can't do that. I mainly bought this game for local play. My family loves Dead or Alive non stop and it is always a blast. Playing Local is fine. no issues there. however it is playing online that is really annoying. I bought this game 3 times. once for my self, once for a middle school buddy of mine, and once for my sister so that way we can still play together even though school has started up. My buddy and I tried playing online only to find out that you can't just play with your friend. you can only play regionally or world wide. A new update dropped yesterday so maybe they finally put it in along with the new player but My friend and I had to search for each other regionally to fight. Thankfully we had no issues finding each other but it is still a problem that should have been implemented when the multiplayer dropped.   Overall in terms of the gameplay it is a blast and it is just like the older DoA games just updated and more fancy looking. If you don't care about playing online with people and want to do it locally then I do recommend getting this game. Just be sure you have a computer that has at least the base settings needed to play otherwise you may have the input problem that occured with me. If you really do want to play online, then i would suggest getting it for a console. The online, from what i have heard, is soooooooo much better there. I may be blinded a bit by my childhood when it comes to this series but I don't really care. In Terms of gameplay and local multiplayer, I do recomemend this game.",

The DLC prices are absurd as well.  I will clear the negative first: This is a port of a sub-optimal version of the game. The online has been a mess for a long time. The DLC is absurd.  Despite the negatives being very clear. The game itself is very fun and I have spent a crazy amount of time with it in total. I owned 2 versions (on Xbox 360) of this and I spent little time in snapping a third up even despite knowing it was a less than ideal version being ported over.  I am not a fighting game player, not at all. I am terrible at everything there is to do in fighting games, I cannot play Tekken or Street Fighter to save my life but with Dead or Alive, the design choices mean that you can get into it really easily but still see where the rest of the game is beneath. Another thing is just how much weight is behind everything you do in this game in comparison to other fighters. 2d fighters are obviously flat, Tekken you're treated to a puff of red smoke on hit but with this, a good hit feels like a good hit.  The character designs are great also, though its as comedic as you might expect from Team Ninja. Yes, there really is an option for boob physics. Stick it on OMG mode for a couple of rounds, laugh, then stick it on whatver the basic setting is and forget about it and focus on the gameplay. I have some screenshots up, you can add in shaders and fiddle around with them to make the game more vibrant than it was originally.  The long and short of this is: It's a sub-par version of the game that's ported, though it runs well and you can add shaders if you want. The DLC is stupid. If you aren't fussed about this and actually want a really fun, easy to get into fighter on Steam that you can pick up and put down when you want, this is your best option in my opinion. Just don't expect much from the online.  It's well worth sale price.",

Its a fighter that does not take it self seriously even though hard core gamers want it to be Serious,  the story is based around kasumi who is Battling DOATEC and Mist. Who is battling the clones that Donovan has Created with a suprised Appearence from His Son Rig.. who know body knows is his Son. basically he does not remember what happened and why.. Play the story to find out more.  Controls for the game which I like the original One over this one. Its a Little more confusing at times when you can Land a Hold Throw or if its a Block. there is the Normal Throw Button but no Jumping thats only if you do a Combo set will it land a Jump before that you could push a Jump button and it would Jump in the past games.   My Favorite characters in this Long Series Running is Kasumi, AYANE, Hitomi, Honoka (of Course!) and TINA.  there are a Ton of Characters the Player can take his or her Time with.. Fighting Games are mean for the player to Learn and get down every single move. Takes Time and practice. but with the Dead or alive series. Scratch that you dont need to Learn that much to get good at this fighting game.. Its There for those who want to get in to a Fighting game..  There are some not major Errors with the arcade port. It does work with AMD radeon R9 card for those who have it. Its Fine. There will be some Errors if you dont optimize it via the AMD CCC APP. other then that. Its Very Smooth Experience. you will find you self just playing a game and Having fun for once.   Now most gamers of today are upset that there is no online use.. will for me and there maybe more like me out there who Remember back in the day the Online was a after thought. It was never marketed or Focused on. So for me i am not upset at the Online being missing because I bought this game just to play it when ever, i want to Load it and Just get way from it all.   i can Recommend this game for those who have stress in there life. or maybe had a bad day.. you can pick up the controller and let all the Anger and hate out of you.. and keep it on the screen.  For this game i am just glad its on PC.. Now hopfully we see more from Team Ninja in the future.. maybe a Dead or alive 6 7 and 8 to complete the saga of the Dead or alive series.  who knows Does kasumi Die in the series or does she find Peace? there are alot of Questions to be answers. this why i keep coming back to the series?   Also the Errors come from a Frame buffer issue which most every game today has.. Due to Holding a video card back from doing its actual Higher Frame rate which is Past 60 Frames on a Single GPU.  there are some Texture Errors on Nvidia cards. and Sometimes on the Intel HD 4600 Card it self. how ever i never saw any of these With the AMD Video card.",

Good stuff in this game for me: + Solid mechanics where each fighter feels rather different and not just a variation of robotic movement like it feels for me in MK series + Good combo flow. Meaning that you don't need to memorize some weird directional dodging jumping all over the screen in order to do some weird teleportation jump like in other games. What I like in DOA5 - combos kinda grow up in your head as logical continuation of what your character is doing on a screen. I absolutely love this! + Very helpful feature of displaying combo list right there on the screen during fights and it changes depending on your input so if you have fast eye - you can hit up combos from there too + Very good looking ladies in both normal cloth and swim suits. + Rather fast paced combat. + Plenty of game modes + You do not feel that you control robots in there. Again - fluidity of animation and combos is amazing in my opinion. My other favourite fighting game is King of Fighters 13 and it has similar great rythm there. + Rather big story mode + It is free2play now from what I understand, so it shouldn't be a problem to pick this game and give it a try + Very good looking feature of sweat and dirt! That's very arou... exciting.  What could be improved maybe in next entry in this series - From what I understand there are no lobbies in MP, however when I fight against AI there is constant beeper that game found some other human being to play against. Tbh I don't care about pvp in fighting games and this is very frustrating to hear these beeps, but maybe lack of lobbies is not end of the world as other people paint it to be. - Could be nice to get a bit of blood too.",

It's not pushing any boundaries graphically, it's actually fairly low resolution in a lot of places, last gen assets (PlayStation 3 port, content from PlayStation 4 release completely missing).  Combat is good, I feel at home straight away having played every major release since Dead or Alive 3 on the original Xbox. Online functionality is extremely limited to just 'look for opponent' with nothing to do in between (no online lobby of any kind). And now it's Free to 'Demo'.. So what's on offer?  4 fighters. Versus, Survival, Practice and Online modes. That's it.  Team NINJA and KOEI had a great opportunity on their hands here to make this series absolutely endeared by all if they just bit the bullet and made the entire thing Free to Play. They have *so much DLC* on the store, and while I am against them prostituting their female cast with all these skimpy costumes, they could've set a very high standard for fighters on PC and lived off microtransactions for half a decade... But no.  In my opinion this is the best fighting game franchise ever. I love the countermoves and movesets in general and most characters are fairly varied but not 'supernatural'. It feels fairly down to earth for a fighter. But I cannot recommend the PC version - Stay far, far away from it, it's absolute dognuggets. If you have a PlayStation 4 consider buying it for that, if not... well, don't buy anything here. Download the free demo and try it out, but know that there's a way better version for other platforms and that content from that version is never being brought here. Ever. Because Team NINJA and KOEI are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and don't know how to handle PC releases, or they're just stupidly stubborn Japanese developers who can't admit fault because it would be shameful. Or both.  1031€ in DLC... Now, I know the entire point is for you to pick a 'favorite character' and buy outfits for them, like with League of Legends skins or heck even Counter Strike weapon skins but that's just not how it works in a fighting game. Pricing is ridiculous and if I can't have all the costumes I'll just not have any at all.   Come back to me when you don't have a fragmented piece of garbage on offer - I like my fighters to be complete, out of the box, with all features included. Until then I'll probably continue playing the free version because this is not worth anyone's money.",

We can now discuss why I recommend this game to people who have either never 1) played DOA before or 2) have no access to console gaming. I have access to a PS4 but I dont touch it at all, last time I used it was a month or two ago maybe longer to play GG Xrd and that was fun but didn't last. Since I primarly play on PC now having a 3D FG like DOA was a big suprise and I jumped at the chance to buy it especially at $25 from a 3rd party website. I have to point out that I actually enjoyed it a lot. I never played 3D games so it was a nice change of pace and I recommend it to anyone who has not met my two previous requirement.   The fighitng is fluid, because of how the game has a rock paper scissor Mechanic which is quite easy to grasp but quite hard to master. Strikes &gt; Throws &gt; Holds &gt; Strike this triangle system of combat makes it easy to understand but doing a hold is quite difficult to master because of how there are High, mids, and lows, This means a hold has to be well times and well placed to be effective but this is the beauty when you see a character or opponent do the same strings all the time it becomes second nature at some point to hold and counter and thats the fun in it all. This is a simple battle system with large potential to be unique and I enjoyed it very much.  All in all buy if you want to and have good specs not min specs. Like mention before the min specs might cause framerate issues and Team Ninja is just not that good when it comes to porting but for my PC that was high end it worked out like a charm. Also yes the DLC is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but I know that and am okay with it hell I bought from a 3rd party for a cheaper price and it lost me the pre-order outfits but I'm ok with that because the game already comes with some pretty good outfits in general.",

            "review_text": "I am surprised at how many negative reviews are for this game. But alas here's my review for it.   First off, I would like to point out. The game is a lot cheaper then it is on Console. A total of 35 bucks to be exact. Definitely better then a lot of games where u need to pay over 50 dollars for a game.    The gameplay itself is very smooth and i rarely had any framerate drops if any at all. It is very enjoyable to play as the characters with the smooth mechanics, not to hard to master anyone if you know what your doing. I saw very little issues in the gameplay itself. and i rather enjoyed the game, as i didn't have to worry about petty achievements that Playstation Network and Xbox Live have forced upon us in this day and age. and personally i find a game more enjoyable and fun, without achievements. and when the gameplay is rather smooth.   and like any DOA game. the designs, animations, graphics are really beautiful for this era. and i really like the designs of the characters. the story too is really good even if a bit corny at times.    Rant: As some may or may not realize, it had to go through the greenlight system to get Approved which is not cheap, thus why the DLC bundles are so expensive and cost more then the game itself. and Unlike PSN, Steam has never once sold Individual DLC for specific characters, thus why they're all in bundles. So its understandable why Tecmo Koei put them at the prices they are, so they don't go bankrupt. This way they have more chances to make more games in the future.    While i am disappointed they removed the 2 extra stages and the soft-engine that the PS4 and I think Xbox One use for the game, i believe they removed them for stability reasons. So gamers would have less issues playing the game. as this would cause issues with the Vram, and Hardrive space. causing more bugs then what little bugs are already in the game. This would especially be evident on low-end PCS, and not everyone has a High End PC that is meant for gaming. so this was probably done for that.    Regarding the lack of why we did not get online mode or the achievements immediately which by the looks of things we will be getting fairly soon. importing a game into a PC is not as easy as it looks. as certain things would cause stability issues as I mentioned before. so they had to mess with things so they can put these features into the game later on down the road, of course they will not be there immediately. as this is new to Tecmo Koei. their mainly known for console games, this is one of their 4 games they have put on Steam and are still learning. So given that i say online and achievements are secondary when it comes to gameplay, enjoying the game, and the story mode.    Finally. The game does not suffer any crashes as far as i have experienced so this is another Plus for the game. As Koei did not half-♥♥♥ it like Bethesda did for Skyrim. thus less crashes for the game.   Rant Over.   Now the only NEGATIVES i really have with the game is the occasional glitch or 2. but that is minor compared to everything else in the game. Sure u can't customized your keyboard gameplay settings or your gamepad if you use one. and for some people who use Low-end Laptops or PCS in general. they may suffer Lip-synching problems but if you keep your PC well maintained this will fix this somewhat.  I personally use Ccleaner and Smart Defrag.  Overall the Game gets an 8 out of 10 in my book. Would i recommend this? Yes. to any Fan of the Dead or Alive Series, this game is honestly a fun and enjoyable game. and i would recommend it to fans of the series.",

            "review_text": "!RANT MODE ACTIVATED! As you have probably heard, this game doesn't have online, and won't have online mode until sometime June or July, so if that's what you're looking for, don't get this game. The game is ported from the ps3 version, not ps4 version. The game looks outdated as hell, the only thing that isn't from the ps3 version are the shadows, which is equivalent to the ps4 shadows (ERMAHGEHRD SHADEWS... Just... no.) and the fact that it is capable of higher resolutions (4k resolutions.) If you want more in depth about what it's missing, watch totalbuscuit's port report on it. It is also missing cloud saving, steam achievements (for you achievement hunters), and controller vibration. Oh, and once you start playing the game, don't even think about changing your username, or else you may have trouble accessing your saves. WARNING NOT DIRECTLY ABOUT THE GAME BELOW Now that I'm in a full rant, I figure I should bring something else up; Team Ninja has requested that the pc community to play the game in 'good moral and manner' which I can understand... to some degree. In my interpretation of their full message, they are threatening us to not mod their game in a bad way or else they will not put more on the computer. Well, I'm sorry, I have a problem with that. Sure, it's their IP, they hold the rights to it, but someone also holds the rights to your favorite childhood toy. Did that person have the right to say 'Don't you ever put a single drop of paint on that model, or I'll take it away from you.'? No. Once you (or your parents) purchased that toy for you, it was yours. Yours to do with as you please, and games, in my opinion, should be seen the same way. I understand, that these types of mods are not what Team Ninja want their game to be known for, but it should be seen as a compliment that people want to even take the time with their game to mod it. People wouldn't mod it unless they wanted to spend time on it.  As I type this (crazy long) review, there are already nude mods being put out for the game, which I don't believe Team Ninja will like. And, while I do feel bad that Team Ninja may not produce any more titles for the pc, I feel it is more their loss than ours. It was a weak threat, they haven't really produced many games for pc yet anyways, so it's not like the pc gamers are losing much, more like going back to the way it was before. Also, if Team Ninja can't even produce a decent port for the pc, then I really don't mind them not putting more games on the pc and wasting my time.  To finish off my long tangent, I'm disappointed with Team Ninja, that they would threaten the people that are spending money on their game, and not even pull through by producing a port for the pc that's worth it. I cannot recommend this game unless it gets patched (though I doubt it will) so that it can at least be on par with the ps4 version, if not better (also, patch, not ♥♥♥♥ing DLC. That would be ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t grrrRRRRRRRRRRR! (QUICK RUN BEFORE THE RANT COMES BACK!))  If you got this far, thank you for reading. Happy gaming.",

            "review_text": "As it stands right now, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that likes to play their fighting games online since this game is lacking that feature at the time of this writing, and according to Team Ninja, it will be patched into the game in about 3 months from now (probably after EVO 2015 maybe?)  That being said, if you don't mind the lack of online mode and just want to play offline or practice, this is a pretty good port of the arcade version of Dead or Alive 5 Last Round with the console modes added in.  The game does a real good job teaching you the basics of DOA with it's in-depth tutorial mode. Everything you need to know about the system mechanics from the different stuns and stagger states, to the power crush system are all explained in this mode that will get you up to speed if you're new to this game, or an old veteran who has missed out on the last couple of games.  As for the graphics, I personally think it looks better than the X1 or PS4 versions since you can supersample from a higher resolution and remove the need for anti-aliasing altogether (if your hardware supports it). The end result is a real clean looking image that you can only find on the PC version of this game.  The game runs at a locked 60 FPS on my system with no issues (i7 2600k, 16GB RAM, GTX 780). You'll only see it drop to 30 FPS during cutscenes and match introductions. This may have been something left in from the PS3/X360 era as those scenes needed to look better than the in-game graphics for that generation with underpowered hardware, so they increased image quality at the expense of the framerate for those specific scenes. It may be jarring for some people, but it's something I can easily brush off since it doesn't affect gameplay at all.  Now for the problems that I've had with this game include the issue of not natively supporting Xinput devices such as Xbox360 controllers and joysticks. The problem is that this game uses the outdated direct input method to detect controllers and that leads to some compatibility issues in getting keyboards and controllers working properly.  I use a MadCatz TE joystick and a Hori RAP V3SA joystick. Both of them have messed up button placements when used with this game. The face buttons are in a weird scrambled order where the A and the B buttons are on the top row and the X and Y buttons are on the bottom, which makes menu navigation odd, but not impossible once you get used to it. In game, you can reconfigure the different attack buttons to match whatever configuration you like, that is not an issue in this game at all. I can set my buttons to the standard 3 buttons and be done with it once I'm in game.  If you're a keyboard warrior, you may have more issues than a controller user in this game as the keys used in-game are all locked to a specific configuration. If they decide to patch the input issues, hopefully this will be fixed as well and let keyboard players reconfigure their controls to their preference.  Ignore the DLC, it's all cosmetic stuff that they won't split up for some reason. Not everyone out there who plays this game wants to pay $120 for extra costumes, especially for characters I rarely use or don't care about. I guess Koei Tecmo would rather make $0 instead of an extra $5 or $10 per user by not offering the costume packs a la carte.  The verdict? buy it in 3 months when it is on sale for 50% or more unless you really want to play a solid 3D fighting game on PC right now and don't mind the lack of online versus mode. ",

Good points - largest player rosta, 34 characters to choose from with a large range of different fighting styles like Jeet Kune Do, wrestling, mma, drunken master etc. etc. I really like this where as most other games don't have the range of difference in fighting stlyes. The fighting for me is the closest thing to Tekken out of the PC games available and this is what I grew up playing. Story mode takes you through a twisting story where you get to try out all the different characters a great way of introducing you to the game and finding the characters you like. For local games you can play 1on1 or tag which allows for a bit more variation and some unstoppable combos when swapping through your characters.  Not so good point - The graphics and selection of settings aren't as good as they could be but that's what happens with a console port I don't think the appearance is enough reason not to buy the game but if you had been waiting a long time for a higly polished game then you wil be dissapointed.  I bought this in the steam sale so the price was reasonable and my only expectations where from watching the trailer on steam so from that I am very happy with this game.

So when I found out that DOA 5 was headed to the PC market, I didn't hesitate to pre-order myself a copy. I'm glad I did. A couple things that many people will find disappointing. 1: No 'Soft Engine' and PS3 particle effects and shaders, as well as no day-one multiplayer support. I can see where that would irk some. However, the game looks beautiful and runs great on my machine. The character models are very well rendered and animated, and the hair system looks good with collision detections and very minor noticible clipping through the shoulders, I'd say hardly at all. The beads of sweat on the body and dripping down their faces after a match is a very nice touch and looks great. Characters animate how you'd expect them to: Women are lithe and agile, and the muscle-bound men feel like they have a pressence even though they are all animated at the same speed. Ok so no multiplayer for three months. You have PLENTY to do in the meantime. The story is pretty good so far at the point I'm in, and there are tutorials that you can master and get bonuses as well as a series of combo challenges. The controls are great, haven't played it on a keyboard since I've been using an XBox 360 gamepad. My only complaint is that the analog stick for movement has a high latency in this game and really requires you to jam it all the way forward or back just to move, so I suggest using the D-pad. Speaking of controls, they are very easy and intuitive to pick up even if you've never played a single DOA title in your life. All characters (and it's a pretty big roster) share countless moves with each other which means you don't have to lean every single move of a character. And each character has individual moves unique to them for you to master. As I said about the story, it's not bad. Each chapter is filled with a few single round fights relating to that character and each chapter is a new character. I don't know if the game gets progressively harder the further you progress, or if that is just me playing characters I haven't trained with. There are music tracks to unlock (and can be set to a certain theme for individual characters and such) as well as costumes for characters. There are several modes of fighting outside of the story mode. Time attack, Survival, Versus (tag or solo) and arcade (also tag or solo matches) with multiple difficulties ranging from the easiest to one that will test even the best players.  A couple of things I want to note about the engine this game uses. And is practically manditory to mention in the DOA games. The breast jigglage has been toned down in this game versus previous games to a more realistic physics model. Also, even if it is on the ps3 engine, like I said earlier, that game is just beautiful to see in motion.  My last comment in my review are about the stages. There is a good selection of stages, all unique and varying, and many of them are multi-tiered fighting rings with multiple environmental hazards ranging from electric fences to exploding cars and even a tiger jumping through a flaming ring to maul your opponent.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fighting games, as there are not enough top quality fighting games on the pc besides Street Fighter 4, Street Fighter x Tekken, and Mugen.  Sorry for the incoherance of this review, it's 4:30 am and I haven't slept yet. I hope I was helpful to you all.",

I'd say get it if you are a hardcore DOA fan who really needs their fix or if you're looking for a good 3D fighting game on PC. Just be aware of the missing features.",

Anyway this game is great to play even though it's still lack in many things right now It's still need to be patched Looking forward about more features for this game in the near future Want my advice? JUST BUY THE MAIN GAME WHILE IT'S ON SALE! (Things that i hate about this game? only those DLCs! OMFG 60 USD!?! i can buy other big game with that price.. and it's just a bunch of outfits)",

This pc port is not the ps4 version, and this does not include a majority of costumes/dlc, 2 extra stages, LR Physics, particle effects, destructable clothing. In simple terms. Incomplete port thats just the ps3/arcade version. As a fighting game, its solid, fast, and intense with a large selection of unique characters with their own styles and gameplay mechanics. So if this does not bother you that you are not getting the full experience, and you dont ever plan on getting a ps4/xone, then you will still enjoy this game.  2. Buy it on ps4 or xone. Dont bother with the pc port since its inferior in every way, both graphically and in features. As someone who bought dead or alive 5 on ps3, dead or alive 5 ultimate/ last round on ps3 and dead or alive 5 last round on ps4, and have been a long time fan of DOA, you will feel cheated out of the pc port and theres no lobby. Avoid at all costs, buy a console instead.",

Unfortunately, there are too many negative reviews that complain about things unrelated to what they thought about the gameplay, like DLC price, lack of Soft Engine, etc.  I can say from experience, that this game might be quite hard to set up, for me, I have to do a somewhat complicated routine involving third-party software and unplugging my keyboard every time I want to play, but if you want to play, you will find a way to play it, if not, you can refund the game. For the DLC price, a good solution is simply not buying it, since it's just cosmetic items, and I don't really think that we're missing out on anything without the Soft Engine, the graphics are fine without it. Surprisingly, the game runs well on PCs way below the minimum requirements, (I've run the game on a PC from 2007 with an Nvidia GeForce 8800GT and an Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 @2.40 GHz with no lag or anything) the only thing I don't really understand is the lack of new stages, but whatever, I don't really care about that.   TL;DR , try the game, it's fun, can run on almost any computer and it's currently 50% off, at 21.99. If you don't like it, you can always get a refund.",

This is the first entrance Dead or Alive has had on PC I believe and I think it definitely has its problems such as extremely high priced DLC which I dare not purchase as well as no online but it has some fun single player content such as combo challenges, survival, time attack, arcade and a story mode. If that's not enough to satisfy you it also has an amazing cast of characters, female focused which can be a negative depending on the person and some strong male characters as well. The story isn't the best however, which is to be expected since gaming isn't heavily dependent on the story and more on the mechanics which this game accels at. Rock, paper, scissors is how this game works and it's not a Tekken clone as well. It feels lighter and faster and with the counter system long strings can be broken which helps balance the game. Anyways that was my opinion. I feel like it's a good purchase as to why I used my hard earned cash on it. I hope this provided some insight to you fellow gamers.",

But think about it, this game was a console game and unless you have a console, this being on PC is already pretty decent! Sure you might argue that one should give their best when porting any games to PC, with PC gamers being the largest gaming group compared to consoles. DLCs are just accessories, not mandatory for the game to run probably, Don't like the controls? Adapt to it, no point crying about it. In fact fighting games are meant to be played on controllers/joysticks not keyboards. For me who never got to play a single DoA game since the first one, it being on PC was a dream come true.   Then again, the price tag is not really worthy of a port like this. It should be around 20-30. MAYBE future updates will bring stuff to PC, but unless you are a huge fan of the DoA franchise/fighting games and you DO NOT own a console, or you just want to play DoA on the go, say your laptop, this game is not really worth it. As for me who never got to play a single DoA game since the first one, it being on PC was a dream come true. I will eventually get a console to play it but not for now.

People complaining that 'it doesn't look good' or crying for the sake of crying don't know what they're talking about. As of now (March 30, 2015), the game is incomplete. Sure, it doesn't look as good as it could, but it doesn't take away from the gameplay.  Gameplay you ask? Well good thing you asked! The online is...offline. Right now, you can look at this game as essentially just the base game. Sure, the boobarus look nice, and the effects do in fact look pretty spectacular. No reason to complain in visual or gameplay department. It's what you expect. Pulling off holds during an enemy string or combo feels great. Grabbing during an enemy hold to punish them is amazing, and stikes are..yeah you know. You won't get this feeling from fighting the AI.  The game just feels like good port of the game, and from the standpoint of a long time player, it isn't good enough (missing content). HOWEVER the standalone game is good if you have never played before or have no idea what DOA is.  Even so, I have faith that this game will be revived once the modding community gets to work, as well as the online up and working. I will/may update the review once/if the online play gets implimented.  +Boobs +Fun rock, paper, scissors character fighting styles +Sweaty boobs +Decent AI for non-PVP players +Pantsu shots +Roster +Costumes  -Online feature isn't up yet. -2 removed stages (from next gen systems) -Making me unlock all the titles and costumes again (personal gripe, but whatever) -Costumes are overpriced as usual.

I can't speak much for the more competitive side, but I can say that it would take a very considerable amount of patience to master characters based soley on the sheer number of moves and possible combos. Online mode is not very active and I'm told has some issues as well, but when I tried it the game worked fine.  The story is pretty dumb, but was fun to play through.  There's a lot of fanservice with costumes you can't turn off so keep that in mind when playing the game around friends.  Finally, the game is near impossible to play with a keyboard and controller support is iffy, which you'd think would be the priority in a fighting game of all things but ended up being by far my biggest gripe with the game. I'm not sure why or how this happened but be warned that you may need to jump through some technical hurdles to get the controls to feel proper, and may not be able get the buttons perfectly mapped even if you have a controller.  All things considered this was worth the price (ignoring the ridiculous DLC). I don't play a lot of fighters but I'm glad I bought this one. The newer console versions of this game are definitely better than this port though, so I'd reccomend those first over this version.",

Basics are easy to learn, combat is fluid, each character seem to have a ton of combo moves, which I like, and the game runs very well.  The time I've spent in game have been in story mode. at first it was a little confusing, because characters and placeses kept bouncing around the globe, but that was because I wasn't following the dialogue, so it took me a moment to know what everyone was doing.  The thing I like, is the on-screen moves list which changes depending on your input so you can immediately see what you should be doing instead of guessing. This also eliminates the need to constantly pause the game to look at moves list only to fail what ever you were trying to do, and going back to moves list to check how it was supposed to be done.  Graphics. Oh boy, I know I'm rattling up a wasp nest but, what ever fidelity soft engine would bring, would most likely be nice-to-have instead of mandatory feature in order to be able to enjoy this game. Characters look great, textures on them are good, lighting is spot on, no unnecessary and distracting effects. Tho, textures in background objects could be of higher resolution, during cut scenes, in story mode.  To me, releasing a game that starts, runs and generally works great, is more important than features. Features can be added later, bad release is alot harder to fix (PR wise).",

It's missing 2 stages and some graphical effects from the PS4 version and at the time of this review there were no online components (though they are to be added at a later date). A few other hicupts; no cloud support, no steam achievments and no controller vibration (though I played on an arcade stick so this wasn't an issue). On top of that there are a few documented problems such as having trouble saving if you have non alpha-numerical characters in your steam ID. Despite all this I would still reccomend this game to fans of fighting games. Dead or Alive 5: Last Round contains every feature (online aside) you could want out of a fighting game, including a few features I haven't seen before such as making exceptions to random rules. The fighting mechanics feel very nice and are both deep enough to keep you playing and easy enough to be fun for more casual players. The framerate in fights plays at a very solid 60fps (on my mid ranged laptop) although the introduction animations seem to be at a much lower framerate. Graphically it looks very nice too. Although lacking the improved skin textures and extended particle effects of the PS4 version it is still a great looking game and I didn't miss these effects at all while playing. Graphical options are somewhat lacking featuring only resolution (up to 4k) and screen settings (fullscreen of windowed) AA, shadows on or off and shadow resolution. The lack of options is a little dissapointing but as mentioned earlier it seems to run nicely on a moderate rig non-the less. Overall I would reccomend this game to fighting game fans and fans of the DoA series who don't own a PS4. The missing features, lacking graphical options and lack of online at launch are deffinitely a problem but not enough to stop me from enjoying an excellent fighting game with a very generous amount of content.",

Dead or Alive 5 Last Roung is an amazing fighter: + that looks gorgeous + and has a fast, fluid and suprisingly in-depth fighting system. + Not to mention the almost complete lack of loading times.  It does, however, have a couple eye-brow raising quirks, too: - Like no key rebinding - and the over-bloated and over-priced DLC packs that have a suspicious tendency of copy-pasting costumes between characters.  - Not to mention costumes that should have been included in the game were cut out and put into those same DLC packs.  So, if you have a controller and don't plan on buying any extra costumes, then you have no reason not to buy this game. It looks great, runs great and will provide tons of entertainment. Even if you are a keyboard warrior, don't fret. The default keys are arranged in a kind of logical, if somewhat cramped way, which does not take long to get used to.  Honestly, the only reason not to get this game is if you can get it on the consoles instead.",

While Dead Or Alive 5 Last Round doesn't quite live up to the expectations i have come to expect after the 4th game, it's still a much welcome addition to my Steam account. The graphics are more or less the same as the previous game, which is disappointing but not too bad. The fighting styles are ever so slightly built upon and some new characters are introduced.  All in all, if it wasn't for simply adding a number from 4 to 5 in the title then this game wouldn't be worth getting. But it is. At least once the update that adds online play comes, because without it should actually be advertised as in early access.  EDIT: I'm not happy with this game after all. DoA4 was a REALLY great fighting game on the X360. But DoA5LR just doesn't live up to it. Online part is a cornerstone for this game and it was bad that it was delayed to begin with, but to this day there still is no cloud support, a feature which a game such as this desperately needs, and for that reason, i cannot recommend it anymore, i thought they would have fixed it by now but no.  Is this the end of DoA? Who knows? I hope not... i hope they can straighten up for a decent DoA6. But one thing is certain, this is the end of the short-lived DoA5LR.",
