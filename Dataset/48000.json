The young boy's journey through the darkness and the many threats hidden throughout it is a breathtaking experience. Beautiful artwork and a physics system that lends itself very well to the maze of masterfully crafted puzzles makes every mistake a brutal consequence, but encourages a learning attitude. A near perfect, and emotionally moving game I would play again in a heartbeat. 4.5/5",

            "review_text": "We, as gamers have grown, but you know what, so have games! And they seem to be evolving on many fronts and in many different directions. Playdead the studio behind the Xbox 360 title LIMBO, has given us an example of how far games can go as an art form. No, this is not 'just another platformer'. Anyone who dives into LIMBO's arty, black-and-white world, will surely find a good reason to stay. The gameplay itself might be a tad reminiscent of other puzzle-flavored platform classics such as Another World, and even recent titles such as Super Meat Boy and Trine. Heart of Darkness also comes to mind. Even so, LIMBO has a feel of its own.  The central character, a small pale-eyed kid, awakens alone in a murky forest, surrounded by massive trees and a few wondering animals (maggots, tiny butterflies and so on).This is what marks the player's first step into the sinister world of LIMBO. No fancy story, no complex sci-fi universe, no pompous character outlines, no feeble voice-overs... just the tranquil sounds of the deep, black forest. However, as soon as our tiny hero sets out, those tranquil sounds soon transform into a range of rather unsettling noises. Stepping into LIMBO is rather like entering a bleak world of shadows, with but a few flickering light sources that barely manage to outline the silhouettes of nearby objects and creatures.  The creepy forest is no place for a little boy, so it's best to help him get out of danger as soon as possible. LIMBO's perilous dim environment will have you facing dangers around every corner and almost every step could lead our petite hero into a perfectly laid trap. If he isn't cut by exceedingly sharp bear traps or sliced to bits by spinning razor blades, he'll mostly likely run into a blood-thirsty creature. The game throws the player into a series of tough situations where the main character has to fight for his life against overwhelming odds. The game often requires you to get out of these situations by thinking and reacting swiftly, otherwise the cute little boy may get chopped to bits or eaten by something unpleasant.  What's unique about this game is the way it progressively throws different problems your way, without warning and yet somehow always leaves enough time and space for you to solve things on your own. Each step forward tosses you into bigger dangers and tougher physics-based puzzles, in turn may lead to even greater challenges. That's right, physics play an important role as you attempt get out of a range of difficult situations. The puzzles rarely feel repetitive, which was a Godsend. There was an obvious effort by the developers to constantly present something new and unexpected for the player. As a result, the game becomes a joy to play.  It's even more fun to watch and listen, because of its stylish graphics and equally effective audio backdrop. Again, this game doesn't feature fancy graphics, epic soundtracks or a massive cast of top-rated voice actors. Every time a melody starts swelling in the background, that usually means you're in trouble. The ambient music is a perfect match for the game's distinctive art style.  This independently developed title deserves a spot among its many triple-A counterparts, largely because it succeeds in grabbing the attention of both hardcore gamers, as much as those who prefer casual gaming. This highly appealing indie game craves more content though. Well, just more levels, really. Nothing more. It ends to damn quickly. And that's about the only thing I could find wrong with it.   LIMBO may seem like a small ripple in a giant ocean of games, but from where I'm standing, this tiny ripple could easily steer us towards new heights, as games continue to evolve as an art form. It immerses players almost effortlessly thanks to its sleek design and delightfully subtle lighting effects and creepy-looking shadows. LIMBO represents a skillful blend of puzzle-based gameplay mechanics and unique visuals. There isn't an aspect of this game that feels redundant or flimsy. Even though the game left me hungry for more challenges and an altogether lengthier experience, I still see this one as a classic that shouldn't be missed out on.",

The game in motion is a sight to behold and if you enjoy any kind of black and white art this game will most likely satisfy your chiaroscuro fancies a plenty.  The puzzle platforming itself is nice and varied and entertaining throughout and though a game such as this doesn't lend itself to much replayability the initial 5 hours or so it takes to finish the game are well worth the modest price of the game if you enjoy the genre and the beautiful if macabre setting and art direction. Even if you don’t but appreciate a well crafted interactive entertainment it’s a must play.",

            "review_text": "By now you've probably heard about the highly renowned platformer Limbo. The game has won a bucket full of awards since its release, and rightfully so. Artistically, it was one of the pioneers of the black and white, minimalistic silhouette design; it went on to inspire a plethora of copycats. Though often duplicated, the experience that comes from playing Limbo is one that's unique, and it could never be duplicated even if one tried hard. Originally launching in 2010 for most platforms, the title found its way on to steam in the middle of 2011.   There's no real outward story to speak of, but rather a series of events that the developer, Playdead, have left gamers to interpret for themselves. A small boy wakes up in a new, unforgiving, and sometimes treacherous land, but it soon becomes apparent that he's chasing after someone. The landscape begins as a forest, laden in thick fog, but later turns into a crumbling city. You may think that at some point you'll come across even the tiniest spark of color, but alas all is gloom here. Be prepared to meet some characters that are like you, stuck in the void as they bombard you with obstacles, but most that you meet will be dead; ususally by apparent suicide.  The world of Limbo is filled with platforming puzzles and hazardous traps that will undoubtedly keep you on your toes. While taking in the haunting scenery, you may find yourself victim to stepping on a well hidden bear trap, or not quite making a precision jump that ends with you landing on a bed of spikes. Maybe you think you need to push a box further into the water, only to find out that you cannot swim, and subsequently you drown. Death will come many times over for you, though favorably the checkpoints in this sinister land are forgiving. Much like its aesthetic design, the controls are also simple; you can jump, walk, climb, and move some items.  Truly a haunting, gloomy, and at times depressive experience, Limbo is an amazing platformer. Even those like myself that may not be enthusiasts on the genre will find themselves enjoying this bleak adventure. There's no tutorial, given the simple design of the game. There's no text, the world and its events are left up to your perception and imagination. Despite the lack of narrated story, the game stands strong and immersive. It's one title that you won't forget for years to come. Highly recommended for platformer lovers, enjoyers of the bleak and depressive, and those seeking an unforgettable event.   Rating:  5.0/5.0  - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.",

            "review_text": "Limbo is a platformer developed by Playdead and their first game, it released in 2010. I played it back when it released, but I decided to give it another chance due to the release of their new game Inside. You play as a young boy, who has gone quite literally through the depths of hell to find his sister. You do this through solving puzzles, killing a few insects, and having more guts than most grown men. Limbo is a spectacular game. The game is a very basic platformer, with only a jump, activate, and move button. The keyboard controls, like for most platformers, just don’t work well with the kind of movement you do in this game. So I would highly advise playing this game with a controller, unless you hate yourself. As far as enemies go, they are really few and far between. You will encounter a few insects that you later interact with in the game. And you will also see other kids that are malicious towards you. I really enjoy the gameplay for most of the time. Only issue I have with it is that some of the puzzles are a bit too complicated, and require you to backtrack and find objects. This may sound normal for a platformer of it’s type, but some of the parts are extremely spread out. I know it sounds nitpicky, and it really is. Throughout the game you are just looking for your sister, so there is not much of a story. But when you come across the many open and industrial places, you can definitely infer that something is seriously screwed up about Limbo. I would also say this game is easily one of the most depressing games I have ever played, nothing good ever happens to the boy. And as I stated earlier, he really does go through hell to accomplish his goal. But I can’t really go into further details about this game’s story without spoiling many of the game’s great moments. The game graphically, while very simple, is quite simply amazing. It has incredible shaders and so much dark but intriguing imagery. It really is one of the prettiest games from an aesthetic standpoint, even if a lot of it is just darkness. The sound in this game is also fantastic. From the ambient sounds in the open moments to the noisy bits in the factory. It really is all around solid stuff, and reminds me a bit of Aphex Twin’s early works. I tried hard to find stuff I had issues with in the game. But there was really so little wrong with the game, it’s a true work of art. I would definitely recommend this game.",

I say this, because the game is so incredibly absorbing that it feels like I've spent a wonderful age in that little black and white world.  The game has you play as a lost little guy, trying to save the day, while pretty much everything is trying to kill you.  The style of the game is what sets it apart against other indie games, the wonderful noire-esque artisty which is so easily parodied. It's awesome. The puzzles are of an appropriate level too. I've heard complaints that some were too hard, which forced people to give up. I agree, some were a bit tricky, and I had to close the game for a few hours to work it out, but I don't see that as a problem. If a game can confuse you that much, and make you reflect on it, that is a success.  Everything about the game is brilliant. Highly recommended.  -Nilesy",

            "review_text": "Really good atmosphere and general artstyle could make this game rise above the others. Unfortunately, I feel that when compared to other puzzle \\ platformer games, visuals and sounds are really the only thing that Limbo does well.  There are a few puzzles that are very smart and challenging, but most of the times you'll find the solution right away and you'll have to push some block or run very slowly to the solution. It's boring and irritating to have to spend so much time to solve a puzzle that you could have solved right away... and it's even more irritating to die while solving it, because you jumped a tenth of a second too early ( timing is really the essential skill in here) Other times I felt deaths were a little cheap, with objects that are virtually unavoidable on your first try, since you can't \\ won't really see them hanging out in the darkness.  Also, the story. This is very much a personal opinion (as the rest of the review, btw) and I know plenty of people like open ended stories or having to fill in the spots. Still, this is way too much if you ask me. There are so many websites arguing about what this game means, and that's because nothing is explained at all. You wake up in a forest, run away from a spider, then other things, at some point from other humans, then machines, then you find a girl. And I know lots of hints can be gathered by visual imagery, yet these are the only elements that one can know for sure about the plot.  Overall, this game is very short, unexplained and with a gameplay that can be both frustrating and boring. Yes, there are things to be loved here, but I'd suggest thinking twice before buying it (basically if you want something short, visually appealing and interesting, this might actually be for you)",

For those interested, this game is all basic puzzle solving; the only controls are movement, jump, and an action/interact button. There is no combat.  Pros: +Unique and awesome scary atmosphere +Simple but entertaining puzzles +Not hard, but not so easy it's boring. Good difficulty imo. Cons: -Game only lasts 3-4 hours  For the squeamish, you do see a child die in gruesome ways; but since he is just a cartoony silhouette, it's not all that violent.

So when I saw it on sale, I knew I had to buy it on Steam. What's neat about the game is that it progressively gets more elaborate and difficult. So while you start out by moving things to new places, without giving anything away, by the end of the game you have to be a master in timing.  Be warned, this game is impossible to beat without dying 654894651684 times. Trust me I counted. But seriously, if you hate dying a million times trying to figure something out or are easily frustrated, you should probably stay away.  In conclusion, if you like to figure things out without any hints or tips, then check this game out. I enjoyed it quite a bit and while I passed it in a relatively short period of time, I am looking forward to going back and getting some of the achievements and hopefully dying a lot less.  -VR",

After all, it's the visual art style of the game that raised the interest among players.  With roughly 2 hours of playtime, the game is extremely short for a game of this genre. On the other hand, it doesn't try to stretch the playtime by repeating the same puzzles over and over again.  LIMBO certainly isn't a bad game, but if you are expecting a brilliant platformer with loads of playtime and replayability, then you might want to look somewhere else as this game most likely isn't for you.

It's an atmospheric platformer with a minimalist approach to just about everything. When you start the game, you're just shown a little boy in the middle forest, and from there you take over. The main character can only move around, jump, and do certain actions if they're near certain objects such as pull a lever or press a button. There isn't much of a story and it's mostly left up to interpretation but I'm sure that was done on purpose.   If there's one thing that I can truly appreciate about this game it's overall look of the game and the atmosphere it's able to give off. The devs did such a great job making you feel alone as you travel throughtout the game. They did a good job making me feel anxious and even scared as I went through some levels. HOWEVER this is game is far from a masterpiece, it isn't perfect. I was enjoying the game very much until the later half of the game when it changed its approach on level design. They start introducing new gimmicks such as gravity which really put a damper on the game for me personally. It wasn't difficult, but it didn't mesh well with what the game did so well in the first half.  I got my enjoyment out of one playthrough which lasted me about 3.5 hours. I don't feel the need to go back for another playthrough unless I want to get the achievements or eventually forget how the scripted events go. I would recommend getting this on sale unless you are 100% positive that you will do multiple playthroughs for this game since the game is a bit on the short side for 10 dollars.",

        {
            "review_text": "Limbo is a physics based puzzle platformer, but a first glance at it casts a message as a game full of grim and creepy images. This isn’t a horror game at all as this game is focused on platforming and solving physics puzzles, but Limbo has a distinctly dark atmosphere that suits the style and theme when playing through.  There isn’t too much in terms of story. A boy wakes up in a forest, and as the game description states, tries to find his sister. There is no dialogue at all in the game, as the only things that expand on this story are the various interactions with other people and creatures as you keep moving forward in each level. The story does get resolved later on, though that is something that will be revealed along the way as the game continues.  As a platformer game, the boy that you control doesn’t have much in terms of abilities. All the boy can do is walk, jump, and perform actions on other objects. As the game progresses, new level objects come in to play with different game mechanics to utilize. In the beginning, most puzzles tend to be simple platforming challenges. Later on, more difficult physics puzzles start to appear, requiring some puzzle solving compared to the easy solutions in the beginning. Toward the end, the puzzles are much harder and more involved, also requiring some good timing as well. Throughout the game, trial and error is a core aspect of solving the puzzles. You can definitely get away by being observant and thinking about each puzzle logically, but the harder puzzles require jumping into hazards to see what things do or to get a clue on how to solve the puzzle. The difficulty starts out quite easy, and becomes quite tough near the end of the game that the puzzles require some thought and coordination. Limbo’s simple platforming gameplay gives way for the interesting and well crafted physics puzzles, which require some deaths to successfully complete each puzzle.  The art style for Limbo is one of the biggest motivators for the general tone of the game. The entire game is done like a black and white movie, complete with some film grain and blur to enhance the effect. The 2D design of the world though is quite beautiful in a way, with black silhouettes against gray shaded backgrounds. There is plenty of detail with the background scenery having softer blurred designs while the game objects sport hard, yet rounded shapes. This black and white style does heighten the creepy nature of the game a bit, evoking a feeling like watching old horror movies. The grim, grisly nature of Limbo is evident throughout the game, with many things hiding until they pop out to kill the boy. Early deaths are quite gory and violent, with the boy being dismembered or mauled in several ways. These things work well with the black and white style by simplifying details while still capturing the harshness of the world. These bloody deaths actually happen less later in the game, as more focus shifts on to the puzzles set in a more isolated man made environment. Overall, the dark style of the game works well with the art style for a creepy and bleak world.  Keeping in tune with the dark themes of the game, there are no distinct songs in Limbo. Instead, the game uses an ambient soundtrack that heightens the mood and conveys game information. The sounds of each environment sets the backdrop and the tone, while subtle changes in the music sends a message of what is happening in the game. In addition to the ambient soundtrack adding so much in terms of tone and gameplay, the sound design is very well done. The sounds for the hazards sound distinct from the music which helps players recognize obstacles, while the sounds for deaths sound quite gruesome. With the ambient music and well designed sounds, the eerie atmosphere of the game is heighted more as each action unfolds.  With heavy dark and grim tones, Limbo delivers some fun and somewhat challenging puzzle platforming wrapped up with a unique style. Each of the various aspects of the game work together to deliver this kind of foreboding atmosphere. As the game’s style is draws you in, the gameplay smoothly runs through the world with difficulty arising later on. Limbo works as a great experience of a game, both in the style it achieves, and the puzzle platforming gameplay that offers some good challenge with its crafty levels.",

It was only thanks to the generosity of a friend on Steam that I gained a copy to try and complete. But I haven’t been a fan of platformer games for some time, so would I enjoy  Limbo ?  In a mysterious, monochrome world, a boy awakens in a dark forest. He sets out in search of his sister. But in his way are the various denizens of this world, from giant spiders to parasitic worms, and even other kids…  There are four words that sum up  Limbo : dark, artistic, minimalistic, and frustrating. Easily, the best part of the game is the presentation. It’s dark and moody, the graphics are just right for the macabre style, and the whole atmosphere is enhanced by a dark and appropriate soundtrack. Music and sound effects contribute to an eerie and intimidating atmosphere. It’s like  Silent Hill , but, if anything, even darker. While at first glance it appears to be a kid’s game, it is anything but. I dunno what the rating is, but parents, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. This is a violent and dark game. Bleakly beautiful and beautifully bleak, but definitely not for kids.  The gameplay is another matter entirely. It is hard, even by the gold standard of Nintendo platformers. The gameplay consists of avoiding death and figuring out how to progress by trial and error, or as the publishers once called it, ‘trial and death’. And you  will  die. A lot. In manifold gruesome fashions. But figuring out how to get by the latest obstacles or adversaries will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Unfortunately, I tended to get more frustrated than feeling like I accomplished anything meaningful.  The game comes across as the illegitimate offspring of  Silent Hill  and  Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysey  (which, incidentally, was recently re-released on Steam). While the difficulty feels right for such a game, I just wish it wasn’t quite so hard. And the payoff in the minimalist story doesn’t quite work.  That being said,  Limbo  is pretty good. I like it mainly for the presentation more than the gameplay, but the gameplay itself has its own charms. It’s just a touch too hard for my liking…   RATING: ***½  ",

Here are my thoughts on game:  Pros: + Outstanding unique visual art with black-white filter + Amazing sound representation + Fun puzzle levels  + Very original + Simplicity and minimalism put in right way + Achievement support + Takes less then 100MB of disk space + Multi-platformer, including Android and iOS  Cons: - Gameplay is short (2~3 hours)  As you can tell from my ratings, I really enjoyed playing Limbo. It is kind of short, but still worth its money. If you like puzzle games, you should definitely buy it. Great game :)",

            "review_text": "Limbo is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle platformer with a hard edge. What story it has is largely implicit—the game contains no dialogue. You simply wake in a dark wood, apparently a child, and set off to explore the dingy place in which you find yourself. But the genre of the game is certainly horror, though without most of the usual tropes. You are fragile—easily hurt, unable to swim, essentially defenseless—in a hostile and trap-ridden place. You will die many times. And the game does not divert your gaze from your death but rather renders each different mode of your demise in somewhat disturbing detail.   The artistic style of the game simultaneously keeps this from being too macabre and contributes greatly to the eerie atmosphere. The game's graphics are entirely silhouettes in shades of grey. Yet the landscapes and objects feel very detailed. Beautifully done lighting effects give the impression of a layered world mostly in shadow. All this makes for a beautiful noir environment well worth admiration in its own right. This game is more immersive with black and white outlines than much I’ve played that had expensive 3D-graphics.  A subtler strength of the game is the way its physics feel naturalistic—you are acutely aware of the weight of objects and the force of gravity. I doubt that the game’s engine is particularly remarkable in this regard, it’s an aesthetic effect. Great attention has been paid to the visual details of motion. But I think it also comes from player movement: in many games you play as a character with outsized physical capabilities. Even in shooters and platformers where such isn’t part of the story your movements are subtly superhuman (think of the lateral jumping featured in most platformers). Not here. Here you have a painfully tiny lateral jump and a rather slow top speed. Here objects don’t just slide easily into place but are dragged only with great effort.  The largest complaint I had with LIMBO was that it was too short. Though the puzzles were good, and admirably varied, not too many were very difficult. If one is adept at this sort of thing one could easily complete the game in just a few hours. They are an excellent few hours though. The puzzles are crisp, things to be grasped, not just fiddled with. For a little while LIMBO takes you to an unsettling, engrossing otherworld. And I’d very much like to visit again.",

The 3 fourths of the game is really good but the last part of the game really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. To me, a puzzle game is too hard if I constantly going to a walkthrough to find answers and even then the gamplay to get it is frustrating. The begining is great with good puzzles mixed with dark game play in a mysterious world. Then the end fourth of the game is just mindless hard puzzles that just made me want to scream. It also sucks that that this game was more focused for controller then keyboard but only for one thing. One a controller you get a button for jumping whereas with a computer the jump is the up key which is really annoying. That could have been a simple fix with the spacebar or, better yet, allowing the player to pick the controls but no such luck. I know its an indi game and for an indi games its great and I'm so thankful that I got it for free. Still, it seems their new game, Inside is a 100 times better then this game. I will choose fluid game play mixed with intrigue over hard puzzle after puzzle any day. I'm glad to get the game for free but I doubt that'll happan again any time soon.

LIMBO's uniqueness and uncomfortable 'the silence is speaking' vibe makes you fill in the empty spaces yourself as you explore this dark place. As you can only see contours of objects for the most part and cannot speak to people you get this unpleasant feeling of isolation. You are completely on your own, so in order to survive you need to come up with clever solutions in this realm of LIMBO, which is rewarding once you get it right :)  This unique and unsettling atmosphere, the great design, and the phenomenal soundscape makes LIMBO a true one-of-a-kind experience.

More about the puzzles; They are quite unique and the sometimes disturbing or gruesome solutions for them are not what you'd expect. This in combination with the perfect matching atmospheric audio (Which are even a must to complete some puzzles. Dont turn them off!) can/will give you some moments of scare. But that only makes the game feel more alive.  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that you can not set the audio volume lower.

The game is cartooney, but while there is no gore or blood, you will still see your little hero die. A lot. Buzz saws, spikes, traps, giant spiders, you name it. The game is not difficult in terms of controls etc, you only use the arrow keys and Ctrl to grab stuff, pull levers, etc.  But. it. will. screw. with. your. mind. (in a hilarious way)  There is a checkpoint on every corner, so dont worry about getting frustrated. If you die, it is because you didnt know yet, or because you messed up and jumped off the cliff. The puzzles are clever and original and solving them is - while not too hard - very rewarding.  If you still have doubts, there is a free demo somewhere, but seriously, there is no need for that. I completed the game and I had a lot of fun watching my friends complete it about 4 or 5 times in total, last time yesterday, after owning it for over a year already.

I normally hate 2D platformers/sidescrollers because of the oversaturated market, but this was actually a good game despite its flaws (which was the inherited overhype). I think what made me respect this game was the excuse for having such a simple artstyle. That gets so abused today, but I liked this. Maybe the simplicity is what makes it what it is? At least the story anyway. The dystopian world could do with more details, but you don't always need details to send a message. Many take a really obvious explanation to the ending, but I like thinking of it much more philosophically; something everyone can relate to sometime in their life. This makes the game so much more powerful, and particularly interesting, and I believe it to be the very best way to enjoy it. Play it by yourself on a lonely evening and ponder about life as a whole. 'I swear, when did I experience something like this?' was the thought I got after every chapter. Truly wonderful.  The game as a whole I don't think is commendable other than that. The format is classic, which doesn't make it worse, but I don't understand the sacredness of it. This is just how a game should be felt like playing I think, a real game for once!",

I was ultimately very disappointed with the game. Several times during my playthrough, I commented to friends that had I purchased  Limbo , I likely would have refunded the game without hesitation.   Positives:    + The graphic style is unique and the developers succeeded in creating an atmosphere that makes the player feel isolated and uncertain. It reminded me a bit of how  Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions  used the noir graphics. From an aesthetic standpoint,  Limbo  is a treat. The game runs at a constant 60FPS (locked) at 1080p.  + The game length (about 3-4 hours on a first playthrough) is just about right. I didn't really want to play it any more than this (more on this below).  + The checkpoint system is generous. Given the instant-death, trial-and-error nature of the puzzles, it is necessary.   Negatives:    - The trial-and-error nature of the puzzles is more frustrating than it is motivating. Successfully overcoming the objectives doesn't feel rewarding and oftentimes the solutions can only be discovered by dying repeatedly. Cheap deaths occur regularly, often from unavoidable hazards intentionally obscured by the shadows.  Limbo  seems to go for the 'gotcha' and it ranges from irritating to frustrating. There is one particular puzzle (about 2/3rds through) where the game provides a paradigm to follow and then a second later rips the carpet out from under the player by shifting it so that the same action results in instant death. It isn't clever. I enjoy games that challenge me to think, and failing in games like  Portal  or  The Talos Principle  felt fair and motivated me to try again.  Limbo  left me wanting to press on simply so I could get through the game. After 3-4 hours, I had enough.  - Movement feels floaty. The best comparison I could make would be  Little Big Planet  as that also features wonky platorming, but  Limbo  is worse. For a game that oftentimes requires precise timing/jumping, character movement is oftentimes sluggish.  - The game lacks any graphics options and in general the settings are extremely bare-bones. Before playing through  Limbo  I thought this was at worst an oversight, at best an attempt by the developer to emphasize the experience rather than having the user worry about tweaking framerates and texture levels. After playing, I am inclined to think this was a conscious decision done not in the spirit of emphasizing a certain aesthetic but rather to scold the player for daring to want to adjust or customize the experience to their liking. Maybe that's unfair, but given the 'gotcha' moments experienced in the puzzles, it combined with the lack of options to give me that sort of feeling.   Conclusion:   Had I paid for this game, I would have refunded it. Given that it was offered free for a limited time, all I lost was my time.  Limbo  is a game that has a unique aesthetic that is tarnished by the worst sort of trial-and-error puzzles, I would  not  recommend this game.",

LIMBO is a puzzle-platformer with very simple controls. It doesn't give you a tutorial or hold your hand. It drops you in a lonely and hostile environment and let's you figure out for yourself how to advance and how to survive. The controls are tight and the puzzles are creative and challenging without being too frustrating. You'll never be scratcing your head for too long and finding the solution to a puzzle is always satisfying. Some may complain about the trial and error process of dying and retrying. I felt that this helped to enrich the dark atmosphere with a genuine sense of peril which is very important to the game. From beginning to end, the player feels a sense of helplessness. Even though our protagnist is silent, we can sense that he is lost and confused by his hostile surroundings. This makes the need to solve puzzles all the more necessary to the player as these small victories are what drive the player to move forward and discover the secrets of this strange and beautiful black-and-white world.   10/10 ",

Also, many puzzles require you to die several times before it's even possible to figure them out, which is frankly insulting. You should be able to figure out any puzzle the first time if you are smart. Charging in suicidally just to determine what the pieces are really ruins the otherwise brilliant atmosphere.  As with all puzzle games, solving the harder sections is very satisfying.

There are puzzles where you might have the right idea but because you make one wrong move in one part of the execution you fail and might think that it’s not the solution the game wants you to reach. It turns into try everything and then try again 50 more times and when you couldn’t care less it gets old fast. In a better puzzle game like Portal you can fail time after time but at least you know immediately if the thing you’re going to try might work.

Add to that the basically nonexistent story and storytelling, and it fails miserably as a game. But I get the feeling it's not meant to be seen as a game, but rather a piece of art, which it succeeds at brilliantly. The grim, oppressive atmosphere ingame is absolutely phenomenal and the artistic nature of it wanting you to come to your own conclusions is a massively refreshing change of pace.

There aren't many things to do aside jumping, grabbing something and dying to figure out where to jump and to grab something else towards to. But the biggest nitpick I have is the fact that the game doesn't show you how much progress you did. After the last puzzle I was confused if that the end. It came way to sudden. A possibly better solution would be when there were a huge meadow which lessen the stimulation curve to a appropiate tune. To come back to the progression-tracking: Becuase there is no clear line or cut you're almost forced to play it in one session or never return to it again. And a two hour session is very exhausting to play for an atmospheric / puzzle game.  But despite all these little things it's generally a neat game, but nothing more.

There are going to be so many deaths from the trial-and-error puzzles. But there are plenty of checkpoints so it doesn't feel like wasted effort. Still, what were they thinking by putting in an unrealistic achievement for completing the game in one sitting in 5 or less lives? I know this game pretty well and finished it in under 2.5 hours but died many times over some truly unfair challenges -- like trying to do a perfect jump arc over a moving, rotating saw, in pitch blackness. First-timers will be killed by traps that they either don't see or they don't recognize. And this game deliberately confuses you with an art design that doesn't distinguish foreground from background and interactive objects from set dressing. So, you see, you can enjoy this game with the understanding that failure is okay and that you'll eventually make it through to completion. Doing a perfect run is for the few.

            "review_text": "I wasn't sure if I should've recommended this game or warned people away. Personally, I hated the game.  Let's be clear here, I was very conflicted while playing this. In the first few sections, it was creepy and intruiging. The art style, while a bit dull and at times inhibitive to the gameplay, is rarely seen in visual media. The deaths were shocking and gruesome, and game paid little attention to them. My favorite moment was the giant spider chase; I never thought I'd be so terrified in a platformer. It's creative and morbid, two game concepts that often work well together. Once I got to the factory, however, it seemed like everything changed.   Gone were the organic horrors and the inviting atmosphere. The absence of a soundtrack was refreshing at first, yet quickly became boring in that there wasn't another source of tension. There was of course the constant threat of death, yet it was almost encouraged in order to solve the puzzles. The only source of anxiety came from the puzzles themselves, which felt more like a spot-the-difference than a mental excercise. I found myself constantly checking walkthroughs, simply because I couldn't discern which objects I could interact with. This made for an increasingly infuriating experience. And since the puzzles were the only source of stress, every section that wasn't a puzzle was just boring. There were very few chapters in which I felt a sense of achievement after completing them.   The ending is it's own seperate conclusion. [SPOILERS AHEAD]  I've read many reviews that say the game's story is deep and meaningful. And that may be true, but it won't feel like that when you finish it. If I hadn't read the single-line description before playing it, I would've guessed that it was a cut-and-paste love story, where a boy goes through the death-ridden landscape of Limbo to get the girl (it's actually his sister :/ ). Except... she doesn't look to be in any danger. In fact, she looks almost oblivious to the hellish obstacle course right next to her. So what does that mean for you? Were your efforts for nothing? Were those trials even real? Was it a metaphor for the mental obstacles in your own mind? The traditional happy ending raises more questions than answers.  [SPOLIERS END]  Throughout my whole playthrough, I was consantly reminded of Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road'. It has the same sense of silence, the same dreary atmosphere; the monochrome landscape would feel right at home. 'The Road' also has deep themes and meaning, although its a little easier to infer and understand since its primarily in first person. With Limbo, we don't have that same sense of immersion or insight. The ending is the only real bit of story, and it doesn't really explain anything. I tried to find a theme that wasn't along the lines of 'effort is meaningless' or 'death is to be accepted', but couldn't find anything outside of an emo's diary. I fully admit that the fault may be mine, and that most people might be able to see what I can't. It's the nature of artistic indie games.  Bottom line: would I recommend it? I left it feeling wholly unsatisfied. It was maddening to play, and the ending was severely underwhelming.   As a game? Hell no, at least not at full price. The game only lasts about 2 hours and there's very little replayability. I got it for $2.50, so wait for a sale and you might find it more fulfilling than I did.   As an artistic venture however, go for it. It's very difficult to take a piece of art and merge it with entertaining gameplay. It doesn't deter from the experience much, but it might not be what you expect a game to be (if you've ever played a TellTale game you'll see what I'm trying to get at).   All in all, it's not worth $10, but its not worthless either.    [please do not comment what you think the meaning is. if it's there, i want to discern it for myself. thank you.]",

Although i agree that this game could be a little longer, i beat it in 4 hours, being stuck now and then, figuring out how to progress. Beside the hidden eggs, there isn't much replay value, except a secret zone and beating the whole game in one sitting with 5 or less deaths. If you play again and memorize the game in 2 hours, that run will take another hour. So, you will need at least 4 hours to beat the game, and at least 8 to 100% it.

Everything else is bland, and the physics-bending interactables aren't fun. Reversing gravity, fun, but when you keep having to do it, or only do it once for the whole puzzle, not fun.

It just makes it very, very overpriced.  Every single moment in this game can almost become a piece of art. The atmosphere is very strong with it's brooding visuals and haunting soundwork. The puzzles can be challanging, though simple. And exploring this strange, scary world is gripping. But not gripping enough to get you to come back. Because there is nothing to come back to. Once you see the full story and comprehend it, it's not that special. And there is little need to come back to this, as atmosphere of this type combined with platforming is a interesting idea that many people would love to experience, but few will ultimately go back to this, instead of a classical platformer.  'Limbo' is a interesting piece. It's absolutely worth checking out. But I'm not comfortable with the price tag, as I've paid far less for games I play a lot more. And honestly, I've never started this thing a second time. And I doubt I'll ever do, except for to show it to someone.  But hey, it's raining Steam sales often. When it does - get it. It's worth it.

The atmosphere within the game is intended to invoke feelings of solitude and helplessness.

Although only white and black is used and most of the screen is black for almost all the game, the game still manages to draw you into the unique world that is Limbo.   Puzzles: Range from unique and satisfying to beat to just boring and tedious to complete. You will be dying a lot on your first play through and sometimes the game forces you to repeat tedious tasks. It seems the game missed an opportunity here for epic puzzles. Interesting game mechanics are introduced throughout the game but it never really seems to take off.   Game length: very short game (took me only 4 hrs). I rather have 4 hours of fairly interesting gameplay than a longer more repetitive game so I am ok with the length. Since it was such a short game however I would have expected more interesting puzzles.   Controls: you will be using 4 buttons. up, left, right, and ctrl. Sometimes the controls feel sluggish and the character seems to respond slightly slow to commands which can make percision and jumping tasks slightly difficult. Also, since up is both climb and jump, occasionally you will be jumping off of a ladder withtout wanting to. It's also a pet peeve of mine when you can't move left or right when you jump. You can press forward or back and jump to perform a jump in that direction, but you cannot press up and then move left or right. Small greivance, but that could have been helpful to have in game.   Story: There doesn't seem to be any. You're a boy stuck in some kind of horror world. Some people want to kill you but you're not really sure why. I suppose you're trying to escape the place but i am not sure why you're there anyway. I guess you're trying to get to your girlfriend? Really lacking here.   Visuals: that's really where this game shines. It manages to create a unique atmosphere and hold your attention for the few hours that you will play this game.  Verdict: 3.5/5 It is an average puzzle game with a few interesting puzzles and a great atmosphere. Give it a go if you have 3-4 hours to spare.",

While most of them were not that bad and solvable just by looking at them, I felt that many of the puzzles that were to be completed during a set period of time were made in a manner for the player to at least fail once to then understand the gimmick. I hated that ♥♥♥♥. I don't find that to be a good game mechanic, but more of a poorly made puzzle. Overall though this short game I feel was worth the experience of beating and I would recommend this game though probably just to those who enjoy puzzle games. There really isn't much of a story to make people play otherwise.  7.5/10.0",

LIMBO shares a lot of similarity with another puzzle platformer, Braid. They're both of the same genre and boast an extremely unique art style. For all its mental stimulation and beautiful aesthetics, LIMBO is indeed a 'masterpiece' in its own right.  My assumption is that the developers approached this game with a minimalistic mindset. The player is only given five actions keys: to move and to use. The only colors are black and white and their different shades and the only sounds are ambient noises. Soundtrack, dialogue, and text are nonexistent.  While clever and engaging throughout, the game is ridiculously short and offers little to no replay value.

It's as if the climax is already over and the rest of the gameplay is the falling action. I spent most of my time pressing levers and buttons of machinery equipments without the pressure and excitement of something chasing me down, like the feeling I got after I first encountered the spider. I would prefer the second half of the gameplay match the tension and excitement of the first. The background music (mostly silence) fits the atmosphere of the game well.

Limbo wants you to think, and then do what seems logical, given the limited information you have of your surroundings. This is a game about going into dark places, facing your nightmares, and learning to persevere. I advise to keep this away from small kids, or let them play only with guidance.

From then on it's just pure platforming and puzzle solving. It's not the most exciting game in the world, and i had to take breaks from time to time because quite frankly I got bored of it, but soon enough I'd give the game another shot. One thing i didn't expect was the difficulty of this game. I died more times than Kenny from South Park in that game, but i kept on for reasons I don't really know. The puzzles were really hard to solve by the end, and i needed a guide to complete the game. The ending is hardly satisfying though, and i felt like the game was a waste to play because of it, but then i realized it was that strenuous journey to get to the end that made LIMBO a worthwile game. It was beautifully crafted, and I was sort-of proud to be able to complete it. I felt like I was really in a trance, and at the end i just woke up from it.  It's not the best game, and some people won't be patient enough to play it all the way through. But in the end LIMBO was meant for one purpose, to transport the player into a trance, and see if the player could get out of it. It does a decent job of it 7/10",

But what really gives Limbo it's charm is it's simplicity. The black and white fuzzy screen gives it a subtly disturbing look. The story, if one even exists, consists of a boy looking for his sister in Limbo. Now, without knowing what Limbo is, you can't fully enjoy the game.  Limbo is the place that Christans believe is the 'checkpoint' of sorts between death and heaven. Where especially young people are suspended for an extended amount of time.  Which makes the game all the more horrifying.  One thing I didn't like was the ending. There wasn't really a twist, or a suprise ending, but it was dissatisfying. I'm sure that that's how it was meant to be, but they could have certainly teased more than THAT.

The atmosphere of the game is awesome in my feelings probably because I enjoyed quite much some 'killer robots coming from the future' movies in my youth. I consider it excellent and rather prefer the discovery increase its enjoyement. I bought it on sales but mostly I may not bother to add a little more bucks into any games I really feel like I will enjoy even before I get to buy them. Money matters are never simple to manage and it's often problematic in terms of having chances to try good games for anyone who enjoy variety which can never be labeled as a crime in my opinion. Critics that are discriminatory about letting people try even if they are not performing good scores are pretty much annoying and at the same time I can understand that in some kinds of games there is a need to preserve a good competitive high level. I'm adding these extra comments because I think it's important to have a various knowledge about games to judge if a purchase is worth it. I'm not that good at riddles but like to try then find help, I like action games and fighting games. Anyway, very good game in my tastes here.",

The puzzles themselves are very unique and entertaining. This game is very detailed while you solve puzzles there is allways something moving or doing something in the background. Even if the idea is to solve puzzles this never gets boring even if I try a puzzle a couple times. The graphics are very basic , it is a 2D side based game. There is not much colour in the game and that also makes it interesting because , in my opinion, this has something to do with the story itself.  Overall the gameplay is very good and smooth , the graphics are better then Mario so I will give this game a 9/10.",

This game is a horror-themed indie puzzle game, and its probably as indie as you can get. Its a strange experience of wanting to experiment and try doing something, but at the same time you are terrified to try doing it because of its disturbing and dark feeling. So, here's what I can say about this game.   Pros  + Disturbing, making the puzzles even more exciting. + Simple puzzles that won't take hours and in in forcing you into having to find walkthroughs. + Easy to understand controls. + Great visual effects that don't require a powerful graphics card to run, nor hurts your eyes after a while.   Cons  - Controls can't be customized. - Resolution isn't changable, either.  I understand the reason for these cons is because its a straight console port, but it would be nice to update it with these cons being fixed.  Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, and personally recommend anyone who is a fan of platformers or puzzle games to buy this.",

Pros: Artwork, audio, puzzles and mechanics, free! (at least it was for me)  Cons: Controls and artwork sometimes adds to the difficulty, wrecking the immersion. Lack of options (couldn't go 21:9 and can't change controls).  This game started out very well. You are told nothing, and wake up as a boy in some 2d dark forest land. Nothing left to do but go onward. Incredible artwork and audio that fully compliments the narrative kept me interested nearly the whole way though. The surprising game mechanics that were mixed up with creative puzzles to solve felt mostly rewarding.   However...  For a game that relies so much on control and timing dexterity I found myself more than once cursing at the controls. The lack of ability to change those controls (on PC at least) was further irritating, as was not being able to take advantage of my ultra wide monitor (no biggy though). The artwork, which started out as a real gem slowly began to irritate me as I progressed through the game. It can be difficult to know what is a black wall that you cannot pass, and what is simply a dark black shadow representing an art asset that you can walk through, or even interact with.   I thought this game would be story focused due to it's rad beginning, but it sort of rapidly changed to increasingly difficult puzzles to solve with confusing story elements to which there is no resolution due to it's incredly lack luster ending.   Overall, I didn't pay for the game, so it's incredible as a freebie. But if I had spent $10 or less on it I would highly recommend it, and so I do. I hear there is another title (INSIDE) just released from the same Studio and I do intend to pick it up. If it's just as good as Limbo (or better, which I think it will be) hopefully it will offer some follow up to the bismal ending of this game.

It's like back in the old days where you had to read the game manual before playing the game or else you wouldn't know what the controls are, how to play the game and or what to look for.   So, in Limbo, you control this kid(or he looks like a kid to me....) in a greyscale world. Jumping, solving puzzles, and running is all you do here. There are secrets too which you would need to use your wits for, I haven't found all of them, but if you do, you will get to enter a secret level which apparently you will do in complete pitch blackness - that's all I heard/read. There's probably a greater meaning in this game than just problem solving, jumping and running but I'm not smart enough to get that....hee hee hee...  So yeah...game starts in fullscreen, no resolution options, or any detailed graphics/sound/gameplay options(the game was relatively smooth sailing for me anyways, full optimus support so my 980M was in use whilst playing this game), you can't re-bin your keys either, so you're stuck with the arrow keys for movement and control for use whether you like it or not. If it were, I would have re-binded it to WASD and the use key to e, as I'm used to the usual wasd controls for movement in games and e being close to the movement controls so I can have my other hand doing something else or resting......  The checkpoint saves are also very well placed, so it's not like if you stuffed up you had to go alllllll the way back to the start and start from there, which would have been much rage I'd reckon for some players.....hehehe.....but it's also not too much so that you just restart right of where you stuff up, but rather maybe a couple or so more scenes before.  Yeah...overal I suppose I liked the game, wasn't too fustrating to play nor too easy to the point of me not even trying to play so you have my thumbs up!

At the end   not being certain if you and your sister died from a car crash and you have to face your fear of spiders, bullies, review the problems of moving from the country to a big city, or if you are the one dead and stuck for ever in Limbo, or if your sister is waiting for you so you can both have eternal rest, if it is a happy or a sad ending, whatever you think, it will be stuck in your head for days.

Took me only 4 hours and I'm an idiot, so it's short, maybe get it on special, but the art design and MOST of the puzzles are really inventive. It's a bit arty and the story wont spell it all out for you but that's not the point. Only downside I would say would be getting my head around the puzzles when they expand off screen. Ie you need to do something in one room, move a crate to one side, then flick a switch two screens over so you can pick up the crate on a fourth screen. Given that the entire game was one screen, one puzzle, this brought in late in the game really through me for a loop, but apart from that I liked it, if you like puzzle platformers, the atmosphere in this will creep you out a little and suck you into its world",

We knew little about it, the art was simple, no soundtrack, and yet it surprised us in ways that very few games had before.  I would have dreams of walking in a dark forest, with the only source of light would be just beyond the pines, but it was still there. The forest would always be eeriely lifeless, nothing but the cold dirt underneath my feet, void of even the smallest insects, they don't exist yet. And yet, the only way to progress is to set trail in a world where nothing but you exist, however, a noise could be heard just beyond sight... a branch falling? Something falling? How about another person or thing?  In a world that only you exist, there lies another being, prodding it's way through the overgrowth, searching for another. Is it looking for a companion? or is it looking for prey? Either of which are frieghtening in it's own ways. But everything is silent once more, has it gone away? Or is it sitting silently hopeing to catch the sound of your own footsteps? Suddenly you become very quiet and self aware.

It is completely worth collecting all the doodads and doing the hidden stage because that level in particular was a thoroughly original and intense experience that this game's endless derivatives still have yet to match.

            "review_text": "Started playing on Monday night and I've just finished it. I'm a very slow player and I needed a lot of time to solve a few of the puzzles: that being said, all in all, I've needed about six hours to complete the game. They were six truly fabulous hours.  First of all, I think I've been a bit misleaded by the tagline and by a few of my friends' suggestions: I don't know why, I was expecting sort of a soft game? With a bit of retro atmosphere, black-and-white pleasant backgrounds and, I don't know, a playful kid lovingly prancing around in a fond search for his sister? Yeah, well, no. Limbo is macabre, is dark, is scary and truly isn't the right game for someone as jumpy and nervy as me. I had to stop a few times to calm down and I closed my eyes during at least half of the deaths. Of COURSE it's black and white, you really don't want to see SO MUCH RED on your screen.  You won't be able to play this game if you're arachnophobic; you won't be able to play this game if you're scared by deep waters and, likely, if you often suffer from vertigo. I think you'll better be careful if you're against gore and if seeing a child - yeah, I know it's a smallish cartoonish cutout, still a child - being hurt is going to unsettle you. By the way, the last warning goes for me, too.  Even so, this game is one of the things nearest to perfection I've ever played with. The graphic! Graphics are wonderful, from the wonderful font choosen for the title, from the menu and the first background up to each one of those black silhouettes of monsters and enemies and traps, each one perfectly in tone and easy recognizable despite the surrounding misty darkness. The soundtrack, soft and barely there, carrying you on through the scariest moments and keeping you on your toes! Each one of those marvellous, problematic, complex, truly original puzzles: you won't be able to get bored, there're no dead times, there's no pause, no slowing down up to the very end.  I've a lot of PROs and just a few CONs, so, let's go on.  PROs: - Detailed, interesting, original graphics. Wonderful. No colours at all to distract you from beautiful lines and marvellously designed backgrounds. - Themed atmosphere. All the atmosphere you'll ever want in a game and more. You really need to play Limbo in a dark room, I've jumped so many times I think I've drilled an hole in the chair. - Useful and pleasant sounds/soundtrack. There isn't a clear music going on, more a kind of soft, vibrating sound sometimes taking consistency and sometimes leaving everything in the deepest silence. Sounds are a completing and essential part of the whole experience and you'll need them to solve more easily a few puzzles. - Complex obstacles. Like I said, each one of them is original and interesting; they're disposed by growing difficulty and different sceneries will have different themes going on. Loved it. - Well-built animations. They're sometimes lovely and more often unsettling and always wonderfully rendered. You can interact with lots of things in your playground and your character will react to each one of them in a different way. Truly not a sloppy work. Really, it's the care poured in each detail which made me fall in love.  CONs: - Total lack of explanations. Like, I've got it, really, you want me to explore and discover, but I'm not asking for much - thirty seconds of an introductive sequence to try and get me understanding your choice of controls? I come from a time when double clicking the Up Arrow got you jumping higher and clicking it for a longer time got you... nothing. If it's a deliberate way to skim out less expert and/or older players, I can understand it, but low blow, guys, low blow.  - No warnings. Like, at all. And I think that's a game which would need them deeply. I usually buy new games without reading any review, to preserve the full surprise effect, and this time the tagline was a bit misleading. Please, warn me about the HUGE SPIDERS - I like spiders, but I don't like them when they're trying to skewering me - and the fact that I'll be DISEMBOWELED at least a few times during the game, and all of this while I'm a child. - No introduction. You know that you're searching for your sister because you've read the tagline. And what if you got this game as a gift? Or if you're playing it at a friends' place? I think a game has to start with the first scene and end with the last one; here, if you haven't read the tagline, you won't be able to truly understand the last scene. Which is, by the way, ambiguous and wonderful.  This is the kind of game you play and play and play again trying to beat your own best time - and your own death count. I'm surely restarting it right now.   9/10.",

First off, the name LIMBO is absolutely stupid for this game. I have never theologically seen Limbo represented as a place of such ghastly mechanical doom, which seems like attempted and failed artsiness.  Secondly, part of me wanted to hate this game from the beginning, because games that attempt to be art typically fail at both. I've played Ico, Shadow of the Collosus, Heavy Rain, and other 'art games' and generally feel that most fail spectacularly at being both games and art.  This game commits sins by offering puzzles that are so pedantic at some points that you will want to find a way to punch the developers in the face. At the same time, when you best a puzzle or survive one on the first try, the high you get is absolutely worth it.  So yes, it's a pretentious, pretentious game. It's only mildly entertaining. But it is a begrudging recommendation from me nonetheless as a fair way to spend half a day. ",
