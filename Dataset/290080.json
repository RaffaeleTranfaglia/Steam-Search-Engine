With engaging survival aspects, no target physics-based combat and a unique formation system - along with numerous other features - LiF is not for the faint of heart!",

I woke up on the shore of an island and soon found my place in the world with a small tribe that will one day be called the Southern Veil. We become allies with the neighboring town of the Sweetcottons before we are even able to erect a palisade wall. Soon after we gain these close allies we are rode upon by members of a place called Killian's Keep. They tell us that we must pay them a tax of straw. We refuse and militarize ourselves.   Not soon after the taxes are imposed we erect a wall around our small settlement. I become the town blacksmith and I am known as one of the most skilled blacksmiths of the land. We then begin construction of a wooden keep surrounded by stone walls. Once these walls are complete we are invaded by the Huns. They used our wooden walls as cover from the arrows fired from our stone walls and soon created a ladder over our wall and slaughtered us. This was not the end.  We grew larger, gained another close ally known as Ciderwood, and began to raid them back. We first struck Killian's Keep, coming in through a weak point in their wall and killing masses of them, then we come back again and again and we successfully slaughter them every time. Every time we raid the Huns they are never home so we wait and slaughter them every time they attack us or one of our allies.   Now we are a huge militarized force with all of our allies only a moment's notice away from aiding us in combat, and we are the same for them. . . I began as a peasant and am now a warrior.

            "review_text": "After 224 hours of playing this game, running a server, and checking up on it from time to time, I can honestly say that I do not recommend this game. While it is unique in that it has a medieval theme amongst a sea of zombie survival shooters, it is executed poorly.   Essentially, this will more than likely never be a finished, final product. Rather this is a testing/launch base for a F2P MMO with microtransactions. As the months have gone on, it's become far more evident that they are abandoning the 'Your Own' model in favor for yet another subpar MMO.   The loss of potential for this game saddens me, because what is actually here is pretty good, the crafting is deep, the combat unique (Buggy and clunky, but fun nonetheless.), decent looking character creation with the option of either gender, this COULD have been amazing, had they set their sights on completing this project before moving onto their MMO.   If you're not a fan of PVP, then really, I hope you like crafting shovels and digging, or hunting terrible animal AI over and over again. In the beginning they had promised some sort of primitive mob for you to fight, or some kind of NPC enemies, but they seem to have decided to not break off from that, to once again, save it for the upcoming MMO.   Now, please understand that I am not saying that the MMO is going to be bad or terrible, I cannot judge the MMO as I have not, nor have I any interest in playing it, this is my review of the LiF: YO experience, one that I am disappointed in.  Also, don't judge this game based on the epic trailer narrated by Sean Bean...there are no monsters to fight.",

            "review_text": "I'll start out by saying that the game has massive potential. The skill systems and crafting are wonderful. But there are a few problems that have been present for extended periods and make the game nearly unplayable for extended periods.   The method the game uses for saving changes to the terrain is very inefficient, which makes it very difficult to maintain a server for extended periods of time. And if you terraform below the elevation of the water anywhere on the entire map, it causes corruptions in the game database which results in ongoing lag. Leaving tree stumps after cutting down trees also causes server lag, and so does having too many trees on the server.   Each of these issues don't seem to be terribly important on their own, but they have all been present for an extended period and the game developers continue to add new features and have moved on to working on the MMO version fo the game rather than addressing existing bugs. Until the developers give the game the attention it needs, this game is not worth playing.",

While some of it is actually still true (harvesting of ingredients and carrying things on your back - though the tools look much better now), the upgraded graphics, new weather and season changes, etc. has made this into something utterly different from what I first perceived. If you've ever wanted to build your own house and live a simple life, where all your necessities come from nature and your own hard work, this is the game you've been looking for. - If nothing else, you can simply take in the beauty of the living nature with many different species of trees and wildlife co-existing in a world that's (yet) to be touched by human influence.

Or, if you’re feeling ambitious, you can create your own mega-castle! Work the land for natural resources, craft weapons and armor, and gain valuable player skills in order to stay alive. Life Is Feudal is an excellent game, it's in a early stage with obvious bugs but highly playable and already has a lot of content to offer. Devs have been tackling the bugs and fixing things as they arrive, and are very active on the community.  So far this has to be one of my all time favorite Sandbox game.",

If you like medieval times, and working for what you get I recommend this game.   If you are the type of player that wants to run around killing people without putting any time in, I would recommend you look else were. Not to say your play style is not welcomed, but game mechanics make players wait days, and weeks before they can craft their first sword. After that you have to wait a few weeks before you can actually use any good gear. Simply put if you want things to be done instantaneous you will not enjoy this game. It is very slow paced, but personally I like that aspect.  If you enjoy making friends, and working together with other people, or to role-play heavily then I would recommend this game. The game mechanics forces players to work together to create any mid to end game buildings or gear. All skill trades intersect with each other, and all of them need each other's help. Because of this set up you will have to group up or trade if you want to create end game gear.  devs are very good about updates (even if they fall behind) and are constantly listening to feed back and improving the core mechanics. The game is a bit expensive but I believe that it is worth every dollar.  Update after relise. Nothing much changed",

            "review_text": "I've been following and playing this game for quite some time now and it has certainly come a long way fromwhen I first saw it. With Alpha and Beta testing for the MMO server happening, this games final iteration is quickly closing in but I'm more than certain it's not the last.  It's the first survival crafting game I've seen that takes the right approach to encourage cooperation.  Just throwing zombies everywhere and a food and drink meter isn't enough, Rust or Dayz is a prime example of that. Sure it is technically feasible to build everything on your own, at a very basic level. The skill system makes it so that you can only become proficient enough in only a small handful of professions, trying to master all is impossible and will make you lose skill in others. This makes it so that everyone who plays can pick their role and that role will be valueable and needed. You then go find others with different skills, you work together, build together, fight together, survive. Eventually you get yourself a nice little village going and attract more people, it just goes on from there.  Arbitrary rating 7/10 This version is technically for private servers, the devs true vision is seeing this at an MMORPG scale.",

Progression is slow and painstaking, but in a way that is highly rewarding and meaningful.  MMO beta is just about under way now, which I am anticipating more than BF1 or Civ6 for 2016 releases. There are a fair share of growing pains in the 'your own' hosted server community, and some less than admirable server admins out there, but none the less this is an awesome game that you should play if you have any interest in RPGs or survival games.

This game is a very time consuming game, more so than Civilization III. I can handle playing Reign of Kings or Rust, but this game is too complicated and too slow for my taste.   Lets go over how its somewhat of a decent game, It reminds me of DnD (Dungeons and Dragons). The actions that your perform on a tree alone, show how indepth the game really gets. You can rip the bark off, see if its a fruit bearing tree, break a branch off, or chop it down. Its really a work of beauty to see that kind of detail in a game like this.   All in all, i think if i had a better computer for this, i would totally play more but after two hours, i gave up. Maybe one you guys will enjoy it.  This is a post release review, just so you know. Never played early access.",

This game has fully lived up to my expectations and more!  Not only is the game true to the medieval era, its also slow-paced and relaxing. :) Building a simple house might take some time(hours), especially if you are alone, but when are playing with IRL friends, or just guild members, you can really start building some interessting stuff, like we made a castle wall with a trench in front of it! Very good time-killing indeed. :D  In this game you can: - Pray to God, and bless others with Gods words! - Dance around on your enemies corpse (lots of emotes) - Hunt down animals, and then get rekt by a boar. Trust me, hunting is so much fun xD - Raid other bases, but beware of the consequences! People are nice in this game, until you start messing with them! - Do honorable PVP. Most people do not attack out of nowhere, but some do, and it makes for some interessting battles. - Trade with other people and guilds! Best way to get stuff early game, is to work for others, to get some rare ressources! Ask around in Global chat, people are always looking for someone to do their dirty work. :) - Tame your own horse, train it, AND MOUNT UP! It really feels awesome riding around the lands, on your sturdy steed ! - Craft your own weapons and armor, and look like a bad ♥♥♥ ! - Dig a mine. Remember to reinforce those tunnel walls, or else.... :P - Weather &amp; Season system! I love the season changes ingame, and the weather also seems to affect the harvest for your crops! - So much more.  So, just buy it already! What are you waiting for? But remember, your Life will be Feudal if you do ! :)",

            "review_text": "WARNING!!!! This is not a game for lazy people xD First of all! The bad reviews of this game are for two reasons: 1-on alpha the game had some bugs, low fps and low graphics; 2- (most of that bad reviews) - people who dont like games that you have to work on it to get something.  There are two types of games: games like CSGO,Battlefield,COD,etc (games where you start with all of your weapons and you just have to play it) and games like this one ( games where you have to work hard to have your stuff).  This game is for the people who loves medieval era, roleplaying, pvp, and work like maniac! Dont get me wrong this game is amazing and with a lot of potencial, but for you to have sucess you have to have a lot of time invested in this game and playing with your friend help a lot too.  So what you need to know. . . When you creat a character, you can choose what you want it to be (stats, professions, looks), when you log in to the game you dont have any tools just cloth and some food but you can get tools from the nature arround you and then starting to craft and raise up your stats and professions.  Crafting system: very complete i must say, you have a lot of things that you can create but you need to have the skill to do it.   Combat system: is kind of diferent that you should expect, it takes a little of pratice but for this game it works pretty fine. When you are try to do some damage every things counts, lenght of your weapon, quality and combos that you use.  Pros of the game: really hardcore miedeval simulator, roleplay, community, crafting and combat system, graphics are most better then the alpha version.  Cons of the game: Optimization, the devs are still working on this subject. If you want to run this game on ultra... well you can dream about it xD You need a really good graphics card for that, but in medium that what i use and i have a gtx760 i run the game at 130 fps +/- depend on the server, so its getting better.  I advice you to see some youtube videos, tutorials, streams and studd, if like what you saw, buy this game, its a really good game. Is that type of game that i was looking for so many years.   Tip: 1- If you can wait for some sales and buy this game always save some money; 2- Buy the game before MMO is realease, because when it realese the game porbably will be more expensive and if you have bought this game before mmo realease you got one character slot for free on mmo.

I admit, it isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy more slow paced, realistic, sandbox type games, this hits that sweet spot. Yes, it takes a lot of time to accomplish things, and yes you will need at least one or two other people to play with in order progress very far, but what results is a far more relaxed and social approach to the online survival/crafting sandbox genre.  This game doesn't hold your hand and can be very difficult to learn how accomplish anything at all, but once you do figure it out, everything feels like a massive accomplishment, which is rare in games these days. As a result, the time you spend in game feels far more rewarding than other games of this type and is well worth the investment to learn it properly.  As I said before, it isn't for everyone, hence the mixed reviews, but if anything I mentioned above sounds appealing, then it is certainly worth a try.",

Now with every new release and update there's going to be glitches. It happens, but the build team has been attentive to the issues and do work at fixing what's wrong.
