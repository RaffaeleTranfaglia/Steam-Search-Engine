Nothing new invented here; there are far better and cheaper platformers out there.   My main issue was with the controls, they were imprecise to say the least. If you want to jump to the next platform you have to really exaggerate the motion to successfully make it. There is no room for quick reactions that can save you from dying. I just like to have complete control of my character; losing because the controls are wonky is an automatic ‘thumbs down’.  I know the sequel has been Greenlit... but how? and why? Worth $0.99     Accidently Reviewed",
