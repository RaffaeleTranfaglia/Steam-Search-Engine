            "review_text": "Dive into the 4 Worlds of Karmaflow and be prepared for an amazing journey! While the gameplay itself is simple, the artwork, music and it's story are worth checking out alone. A lot of love was put into this game, and a lot of great artists participated in this too, mostly Metal musicians. I particularly liked the way story was told, just using music. Music is the main focus in the game (obviously), and it's executed very well, with tons of great Symphonic Metal tunes, although it may feel like the lyrics could be better at times, but the main composer was Dutch so I can see the difficulty in composing in another language.   My interest went up the hill after hearing about the cast, I didn't care how the game looked like, I just wanted to dive into it and see how well it was performed. Every close friend of mine also knows that I go crazy over anything with Alissa White-Gluz. The music alone is a good enough reason to play this game. If you like bands like Delain, Nightwish, Amaranthe, MaYaN, Epica, Tarja, After Forever or Therion, you'll love the music in this game. At the end of each chapter, there's even a duel between 2 singers and the great Metropole Orkest playing, it just feels like an Epic tale overall.  As for you, the main character, you're a Karmakeeper and your backstory is unknown. You don't know where you come from, what you're doing in these Worlds and why. These are questions to find out throughout the game. Now in these worlds, there's always a sub-story involving 2 opposing characters (hence the duet I mentioned before), upon reaching the end of the World, you choose who to help. These decisions carry on until the last minute of the game and believe me, some are really not an easy choice to make.  Performance wise, it still needs a lot of work. I gave up on playing this on my computer, and just asked my brother for his. Apparently a much better rig than mine only gives about +3FPS. Hopefully Basecamp Games are working on this and can sort it out, but this did not ruin my experience. Bugwise, they're minor, but in a lot of places. As I've heard, the game is way better than it was on release date. I've only found like 1 game-breaking bug in my 20 hours of playing. I'd say that's a very good ratio, plus you should always keep in mind that this crowdfunded project did not reach the goal, and they did finish it anyway.  As a brief conclusion, Karmaflow is the game you're looking for if you like both chill-out games and Metal music. It may be asking for a bit much, but I'd gladly pay 10 euros for it, I just wish the Deluxe Edition upgrade wasn't so expensive. Karmaflow gets an 8/10 from me, and if the bugs and performance issues do get sorted out, this game will become a really good underground gem that many will not play or even know about.",

            "review_text": "You know what. I was going to NOT recommend this game, but after actually finishing it and thinking it over. I will. I will recommend it, why?  Because regardless of all the bugs, dull level design and the one game breaking checkpoint I found, It's an incredible experience.   While the game is rather dull and boring most of the time, and the bugs doesn't help. If you manage to get passed all that and get to the end of every act, you are rewarded tenfold for your persistence. Because there is where the music starts for real!  By the time I got to the finale, I was tired and didn't want to play anymore. But when I finished, I was more pumped then an Olympic Athlete on shrooms outrunning Sonic.   The music is fantastic (Even more so if you like Metal) and is sung by some really famous singers, Tony Kakko being a personal favorite. The story is interesting because every Act ends with a dilemma that you as the Karmakeeper has to solve (Choose really). The choices you have to make a rarely black and white but rather makes you choose what YOU think is most viable when all the choices might sound questionable. It's a really nice change from the clichéd 'Good vs.. Bad' trope that plagues modern games today. Because of this it makes the characters in question more interesting and the overall story more compelling.  Karmaflow in a nutshell might be, It's dull as ♥♥♥♥, but if you push through that dullness, you'll never regret it.",

            "review_text": "A fun platformer with the twist of the story being told through a rock opera. Some great music that keeps you entertained with a cool story of life or death.  Your job as the Karmakeeper is to decide the fate of each world by listening to the Guardian and their counterpart to see whose side you should choose. You would then either extract karma to destroy or infuse for life. It's a cool little mechanic that also helps with solving puzzles you run into too.   There are five amazing looking worlds to experience with some fantastic characters to interact with and see. I thought the music was awesome, gameplay was well designed, and good looking design all around. It's a new twist on gaming I haven't experienced before with the story told through singing and I'd love to experience it again. Well worth checking out for a good platforming game, story, and some rock music.",

It's really challenging to come up with gameplay that would fit in with this theme. The developers did an alright job of it, but it's far from extraordinary.  The game suffers from some platforming issues. bad camera, and not really knowing where and what to do on the first time through. Even thou puzzles were musically minded, my involvement was shallow, The platforming is lacking in epic operatic awesomeness.   Bosses on the other hand are awesomesauce. Their only problem is that they are story driven A or B choice candy sequences.  If instead, my actions in the platforming lead up to what operatic choices I had available or vice versa, it would be a great start in blending the two. But it's still missing something at it's core as a game. I just didn't find it satisfying to play. I would have had just as full of an experience watching someone else play through it.  As a final note, I would be more then happy to watch a full film from these devs if even using a game engine. The musical work is impressive! I need to see more.",

At first I really tried getting into it, and the premise of having Metal bands on to convey the story really got me excited, but then I actually played it and the whole illusion just shattered! The game design is terrible, half the time you can't figure out where to go (i let some friends of mine try it and they said the same), the music is only here and there, and not a really integral part of the whole experience.  When it first came out it would crash, and now it has annoying sounds that pop up during play and it lags ALL THE TIME!! I just couldn't bear to play it anymore. Sadly to say, i had high hopes for this and i am very much displeased.",

            "review_text": "I was very much looking forward to this game. I was an early backer, so I've been looking forward to it for a while. Unfortunately, in the current state that the game is in, I can't recommend it. Some of the other reviews say that bugs are being patched out in updates, so if I see that some of the issues I had are gone, I'll happily change this to a 'recommend'.    One of the biggest problems is that the mouse lags  horribly  in the menu. After exiting the game, it was a shock to see my cursor move fluidly on my screen again.   Another problem to do with the menus is that there is no keyboard support for it. When it takes 5 minutes to drag your mouse cursor to 'resume game', you'd definitely prefer to tap the ESC button to return to the game. Hopefully that comes in the future.   Whenever you activate a new checkpoint, the game freezes for a couple of seconds. However, if you move your mouse while it's frozen, the camera will move after it resumes, meaning it is very easy to lose your bearings.   Some of the platforming parts are bugged. There was one part where I had to fly through a hole in a rock formation. Somehow I got wedged in the hole and had to restart from an earlier checkpoint, meaning I had to fight the first boss again ('fight' is used very loosely).   Some parts of the game are too dark. There's a part early in the game where I had to jump to my death several times just to try and see where I had to go next.   Some of the backing music is repetitive and annoying. This is more on a personal level, but the music in the early levels becomes very annoying, especially when you keep respawning due to having no idea where to go.   That's most of the problems I have with the gameplay of the game.   I have to say that I'm a big fan of power metal; I've listened to most of the bands that have members featured in the cast of the game. And even with that musical background, I found the songs in this game incredibly cringey. The music was fantastic, but the lyrics were just embarassing.",

This game is introduced as a Rock Opera Videogame but it doesn't mean you will non-stop hear Rock Opera song throughout the game.   You will mostly hear the Rock Opera song during the boss fight (Act 1 First boss (Conductor &amp; Muse) has a great song throughout the whole battle (Really, really entertained) but Act 1 second boss (Guide &amp; Shaman) only has great song by the end of the fight)  I would recommend this game to those who enjoy playing game 'Journey' (or something similar to it) and if you can get this game with a discount.  For a full verdict, I need to wait for Act II to come out first.",

            "review_text": "My opinion: I like this game.  Mostly because of the music - and that was the reason why I bought Karmaflow. I am a very big fan of symphonic metal, so I just couldn't get rid of that desire to buy a game, where my favourite singers participated for voice acting. However, as a person, who just can't call himself a real 'gamer', I liked the gameplay and worlds' design as well. Karmaflow can look kind of like an old-school game, and for me this is plus, not minus. Because it makes Karmaflow look like a fairytale with a deep sense. Again, for me, it is so. I was reading some negative reviews down here, and actually I can understand some people written them. I, too, was finding some bugs or just 'moments' that were driving me mad. But hey, I wanted the atmosphere of this rock fairytale - I got it. And so I even walked it through by the second time and drew some (fan) arts. I guess this shows quite well how (personally) I like it and why (personally) I press 'Like' for this game. But Karmaflow is not for everyone, it's true.",
