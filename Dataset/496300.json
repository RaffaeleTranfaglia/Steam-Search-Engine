            "review_text": "Wow. Just wow.   My friends might recall that I only very grudgingly gave the prior installment of Kingdom a negative review. For everything they did right (and boy did they do a LOT perfectly!) the game quickly grew stale.  I am happy to say that this release (which was free to any that owned the original : excellent play) fixes all of that. We keep the haunting soundtrack, the elegant mechanics, the nostalgic yet intricate retro art style but now a new layer of complexity has been added. Instead of a simple random map each game with the only point being to survive as long as possible, they have added in a 'simple, yet functional' (that phrase being the credo of the game it seems) progression.   Now you must rebuild a wrecked ship, protect your workers as they lead it to a dock at one end of the map and then set sail to a new, harder map. The progression provides a sense of accomplishment missing in the prior installment while the process of building the ship requires both a massive outlay of coins (requiring development of farms) and possibly the need to defend the workers/ship.  Added to that are a number of simple improvements and unlocks (like new mounts, a banker npc etc) that add some polish and ease of use, as well as a bit of replayability.  I very much recommend this title for your casual, staying-up-later-than-you-thought enjoyment.",

            "review_text": "The idea behind 'Kindgom' seems to be to control, expand and protect your land and its people. It's basically a tower defence game crossed with some resource management, set in a beautiful, almost oneiric pixel world. At first, the feeling one gets while playing is rather peaceful, despite the somewhat harsh difficulty, which comes in the form of nightly enemies who try to rob you of your kingdom and your crown, but also from having to figuring out how the game works. The game has an addicting part to it as well, with a very 'one more turn'- like symptom; always getting the player to think, 'oh, I will just quickly recruit those peasants', only to find oneself playing on and on without even realizing it.  There are multiple problems however.  First off, there is the repetitiveness of it all, which can still fit into the whole peaceful mind-set of the game, but there is no denying that the player is always doing the same thing over and over again. The fact that the setup of each kingdom is randomized changes little in that regard. Once you have found a winning strategy, there is little to no reason to deviate from it and the soothing and calming slow pace of the game tends to become tedious with the added repetitions, especially since you can't rush the different phases of the game; everything needs to happen in a certain order, if you want to survive that is. However, it is true that, contrary to the base version of the game, 'Kingdom – New Lands' offers more options, more buildings, more mounts, and even unlockable structures; all of which are a most welcome addition as well as a must-have for the challenges of the later levels. Yet, this raises another issue of 'Kingdom': the mechanics of the game, especially in regards to these new additions, as remain poorly explained. Figuring out what happens for what reason can be fun sometimes, but all too often this leads to encountering counterintuitive design decisions or glitches. For example, hermits are characters that can upgrade some of your buildings. Winning the last level without them is almost impossible. Yet, these characters wander of, constantly putting themselves in danger, screwing you over indirectly by denying you access to their upgrades: once they are gone, you can't find them again for the duration of that level. And then there are the drawn-out nights which are an infuriating death sentence over which the player has little to no control over. Those are nights that never actually 'end' for the scripts of your population because the enemies that spawned at night took such a long time to reach your kingdom. Thus, your economy grinds to halt even during the day. It gets even worse during blood moons, -which are basically 'boss nights'-, or badly timed artificial blood moons linked with the destruction of lesser portals spawning enemies. Even the workers refuse to repair your walls during those bugged times, and that might just as well be treason for all the good it does to you. But sometimes, reloading the game will fix that issue… but for that day only… But it doesn't stop there! Prairies, and their bunnies, are a great way to make a decent amount of money at the early stages, but how, when or why these prairies expand themselves is a mystery. Buildings seem to stop their growth… except when they don't… Cutting down trees should also increase the size of the prairies, except… not always! And you are stuck with vast stretches of muddy ground. It is unrealiable at best, and sadly this seems to be the permeated feeling of 'Kingdom'. The lack of control, -and I'm not just talking about unrebindable keys here-, is really what drove me away from the game. The fact that you can't order people around directly is cute at first, but all too often it ends up being infuriating since the players is at the whims of the IA. When you see your knights abandoning a wall, leaving unassigned archers and workers to their doom, how can one not sight in desperation? Archer towers actually become a death trap in that regard since the scripts of the game seem to order them to man the towers even amidst intense battles, even if this means facing a horde of enemies to reach them. The best part? These archers in towers are as good as dead as soon as flying enemies start to spawn. What is the point of a defensive building that is more a liability to the player than anything else? Also, when the defensive walls are built too close to enemy portals, the archers tend to walk right into them, and die. It's quite exasperating to have to deal with an IA too stupid not walk straight into death.  Tackling a challenging game can be fun, but only if it is fair and honest in its mechanics, which 'Kingdom – New Lands' isn't good at. And sure, one can push through the minor setbacks and annoyances, yet the reward for doing so is just more the same, with only the certainty of getting screwed over, sooner or later, not necessarily by your own hand, but by the obscure glitches or weird game decisions. Fun at first, annoying in the long run.",

            "review_text": "  Kingdom: New Lands is an amazing updated version of the original Kingdom; Kingdom: NL is amazing. This small, almost quaint indie game really is fun for the fair price of £10.99. the game is massive compared to the original content in Kingdom, I'm going to give you a short run down of how great this game is.(tl;dr at the bottom)  The game is fairly simple in almost all gameplay aspects, you make money, you spend the money and progress to the next island. I won't lie, when I got Kingdom I didn't like the look of the graphics that much, I got the game regardless, though they may look not look like the best, they fit with the game and it fits well with the theme of the game, which is survival and progression. The jist of the game is that you fight enemies called 'Greed' which will attack you at night, you build up during the day by making money and recruiting new people into your Kingdom, assigning them jobs such as archer and builder, surviving and then leaving the island to expand your kingdom into the next island. You might be thinking 'Does the game just rinse and repeat? What do I do when I get to these other islands?' Every time you leave the island, or lose the game on that island you'll unlock a new thing to explore and figure out what it does. There are a lot of guides that will help you if you get Kingdom: NL so if you ever get stuck on something, check the guides.   The mechanics in this game are simple, and after a solid 30 minutes to an hour you'll get a good idea as to what to do, I don't want to bore you as to what to do, put simply, you gain money, you spend the money to gain money, you survive and explore. I want you guys to figure it out and enjoy the game as it's meant to be, explore the game and enjoy it! I didn't want to spoil the game for you guys so I have to make this review seem very 'basic', sorry.       TL;DR 7.5/10 The game is fun and when you start, it's hard to stop. You'll either love it to death and play it quite a lot, or do a lot of long games and then get frustrated at it, but overall it's a good game that you'll be able to put a solid amount of time into it.  Kingdom: NL is a good Indie game It's a fairly cheap game (I paid for the original Kingdom, this is an updated version of Kingdom, I got it for free) A fun and addicting game, even if you lose you can be rewarded. This game isn't hard to learn, you'll get the jist of it fairly quickly, and if you don't there is guides. The graphics aren't half bad, to each their own. If you don't like the graphics I still recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Build. Expand. Defend. Oh, and watch everything you love crumble before your eyes.  When you spawn into your first land as part of the tutorial, you are a solitary king on horseback. As you ride past the massive stone letters introducing Kingdom, they splinter and collapse. The withered ghost of your predecessor leads you to a small hoard of treasure, an extinguished campfire, and a handful of unemployed vagrants in the middle of a forest, and as King, you wield the power of money to set the vagrants to work building your empire.  Kingdom is a resource management game in a gorgeous low-res sidescrolling format. You don't get the coins unless you run over to pick them up, giving a very personal feel to the dryness of many management games. And those coins will be needed to build defenses against nightly raid by Greed Trolls, an army of little gremlins who will steal your coins and equipment by night. For all the joy of expansion and natural beauty, there's an equivalent horror at the constant decay of your walls, men, and gear as the attacks grow stronger and stronger with the passing days. If the trolls should knock to the crown from your head -- 'No crown, no king.'   Kingdom quietly dances a fine line between total serenity and creeping terror. Sure, the one-button interface has the peasants doing most of your work for you -- but you must carefully manage your horse's stamina as you run back and forth across the countryside. Amassing coins is easy. So is watching all your ivnestments melt away the night of a bad raid. The end-goal of rebuilding a shipwreck and sailing away devolves from noble ambition to desperate escape...  Will you be able to keep your crown?",

Although I have only played it for a short amount of time I can safely say that it is a game that  anyone could love and play on and on.  There are many things I liked about this game, disliked about the game and what it has to offer and so I have come up with a small list of things that caught my eye in the game.  Good Points  -It pays VERY close attention to details -It follows the previous game but with more defined goals -Easy to pick up -Carefully planned out throughout the game -It's great for more relaxed,casual players -Great artstyle choice -And finally, Who doesn't like a game that you can play with one hand?   Needs Improvement  -Lacks a full storyline and is mostly bits and pieces (although this may appeal to you) -The artstyle may throw off some people at first glance -Costs a 'bit' too much for the overall gameplay and experience -Still no multiplayer :(  Additional Notes  Please do not mind the terribly horrific pun towards the end.",

            "review_text": "  Kingdom: New Lands is genuinely one of my favourite games of 2016. It combines city building, exploration and management elements of other games but instead of repeating the same tired formula that has been used for these games before, they changed it up a bit, in that it is a side scrolling game that does not require a bird’s eye view or a free camera to make it a city builder. If you were here to get a quick opinion on the game, all that you need to know is that the game is certainly worth the price and is not only a fantastic game but a fantastic experience as that’s really what this game is, an experience.   Gameplay Let’s begin with Gameplay. The gameplay revolves around you as the king collecting coins to build up your great kingdom. For the most part I found the gameplay to be relatively solid, the only real problems that I found with the system were that later on in the game you tend to run out of coins quite regularly, even with farms and traders. Other than that I enjoyed the gameplay (what little the game actually contained) quite a bit.   Visuals and Sound  Graphics and Music are next and both of them are splendid. The graphics in Kingdom: New Lands are visually impressive as they have taken a pixelated art style and theme, then they have really amped it up by giving little things like the water and fire movement. It makes the art style feel much more impressive then it would without these little animations. As for the music it suited the game very well, there were enough songs there to keep me interested and entertained. My favourite part about the music, is the fact that when the weather changes the song changes. It shows that the developers put that extra amount of effort in to make sure that their game was as good as it could be and I commend them for doing so.   Performance ARGHH! Another review that makes the performance section Obscelete, obviously from the pictures, the game is not CPU or GPU intensive at all. I mean if you're running integrated graphics from your older sisters uni laptop, then you might see some issues. But if you have anything other than integratted graphics you should be fine.....yes even you running the extremely outdated Nvidia GT 710.....yes even you can expirience this game in 1080p YES 1080p! What a splendid day for you isnt it?   Negatives Now it’s time to discuss my gripes with the game. Firstly, let me say that the world you’re in isn’t very big, it took me around 3-5 minutes to find the end of it. Now granted there are evil portals which normally cover up the end of the map but it would have been nice if the worlds were just a little bit bigger to really immerse me into exploring and adventuring.  The next problem that I have with the game involves your horse that you ride around on. That horse tends to run out of stamina fairly quickly which led me to believe that you would be given the option to upgrade said horse later on in the game, but so far I am yet to find anything that allows you to do so. This is a real pain as your horse is really slow and immobile, if they were to add in a stables earlier on in the game which you could use to upgrade your horse, this wouldn’t be a problem.  My final negative for today lies with the monsters in the game, each monster is the exact same as the last monster that you encountered, the only difference is that some will have masks on to protect them. I would have liked to see a larger enemy variety in this game as it is in dire need of it.   Overview Overall Kingdom: New Lands is a phenomenal game and a true follow up to its predecessor! It has fun (yet limited) gameplay, beautiful sound tracks and stellar visuals, it is only really let down by a few issues like enemy variety and the size of the world that you travel in.   -Joshua Upham",

            "review_text": "  About half a year ago I bought Kingdom: Classic and fell absolutely in love. It is simplistic yet very hard to beat. I probably lost more than thirty times before finally beating the game. The game is mostly randomly generated so it made for a new experience with every play. Although its mechanics are very easy to get the hang of, the game continuously throws twists and turns at you, making the journey the opposite of a walk in the park. If you are looking for a fun strategy game that does not take your utmost attention, then this game is absolutely for you.  I have just started playing New Lands and although it is closely resembling the first game, many new additions to Kingdom have put another spin on the easy-going sidescroller. I would reccomend this game as a absolute must purchase for anyone who likes a relaxing game to play in their spare time.   On the side of all of that, the soundtrack is phenominal and the game design is beautiful. This game made me love pixelized games and showed me that a 2D sidescroller can be just as good of a game as a 3D one.The Kingdom series is one of my favorite series of games I have ever played. It is a diamond in the rough.  If you are still skeptical of buying this game I reccomend going and watching Markiplier's playthrough of Kingdom: Classic on YouTube.

            "review_text": "Aesthetically excellent but outrageously tedious otherwise. I appreciate the attempt to make a game like this with very light one-button mechanics but the ultimate execution is pretty terrible.   This is a game of waiting, and long, mindless trips back and forth for hours with little to no reward for the 'effort' put in, and so many of the design decisions that led to this situation feel pointless, or things that were added purely to pad the game out. This is a game of a few, very small decisions at the start of each level (which are almost always the same each time), followed by often an hour or more of little more than waiting for coin generation, and endless marching back and forth across the map to collect those coins and make tiny, unfullfilling upgrades to unexciting pieces of equipment.  It's a grand shame that this new version does so little to address these substantially unrewarding mechanics and instead focuses on adding considerable late game content - content that can only be accessed by force-feeding oneself through this game's awful grind.  And this is with quite a heavy reliance on uncontrollable AI. It's been improved markedly since the previous version, but this is still a game where your success can hinge terribly on whether your archers feel like hunting deer that day, or which fortifications they may decide to defend. And that's before we even find out whether they'll actually hit any targets today.   My play time for this title is quite inflated because a game where you make no decisions and often have nothing to do is good platform for catching up on audiobooks. But then there are so many other, better games that fill that 'undemanding and pleasant' niche without being so throughly unrewarding in the process.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, this review is from a player who has already played the first version and so most points rasied are from that point of view and probably more relevant to existing players. However, new players might be interested in some opinions of the difference between each version. So, feedback:  The previous Kingdom base game was great, and the mechanics of the game, after some patching &amp; tweaking, worked well. The 'new lands' version however has disrupted the balance that the game previous achieved with the addition of a lengthened game spread over several islands. Issues include:  - Starting a new kingdom on each island from scratch. It is now quite repetative and tedioius, especially since the first 2 islands lack any diversity, such as; - Lack of additional mounts on the first 2-3 islands means your horse never changes to a better one (getting sick of eating grass) and makes the first point about camps even worse by dragging out how long it takes. - Lack of portals on the first 1-2 islands (though they are slightly smaller worlds I think). - The save system (or forced contol of not being able to actually save at will) was fine when there weren't 'levels' as it was more of a challenge based game (improving your survival count). However, now that there are levels, and considering how much repetative effort you have to go through to get through the first few islands/levels, the save system could do with more user control (ctrl+alt+delete when your crown is taken and returning to the game does not work as a work around). Being able to resume from the same island for example. - When you died, and before it was a matter of management, you aimed to improve your day count. But I find there is no motivation to imrpove your day count of the first 1-2 islands, making them undesirable to be repeated. - the advertising would have you believe that there are new features, such as new mounts (bears and elks and such) and new characters. The characters however do nothing but wander around you camp, and I never saw any of the new mounts (it even lacked the black horse).  Above is what I feel are non-personal points I feel need to be improved before I can give this game a better rating.  Personal feeback: I died on the third island from one tiny mistake in managing the freaking horses stamina (damn grass, and lack of better steed) whilst getting another camp going 'yet again'. After restarting the game back on island/level one I am not motivated to play this again (unlike the previous version). Again, this is due to the lack diversity and interest in the first 2 islands/levels. It's as if the levels have been gutted in order to save the diversity for the last levels. The only new thing on island/level 3 was more portals (though there was 1-2 on level 2).  Overall I still rate the first Kingdom version highly, just not this 'new lands' version yet.",

As for the gameplay it got better and many issues in the old version have been resolved in this version.  As i wrote in my last Kingdom review the gameplay is great and so is the music. The game is best discribed as a scrolling recource management strategy defense game. Collect coins by killing wild animals, building farms. Invest these in recruiting troops, towers and upgrading your castle. Defend your kingdom against the evil that comes from the portals and at the right time strike back with a vengeance at your enemies.

But by itself, its an interestingly addicting little game, especially if you happen to like resource management games in any capacity. Kingdom: New Lands has you acting as King/Queen in a brand new, unbroken land. You get two peasants(?) to start off with, a sack full of gold, and a ghost. The ghost points to things like walls or fires, and you build them. (The ghost doesn't stick around past the tutorial, so if you're worried about spending the entire game being haunted by a dead relative, you don't need to be.)  The first island is easy enough to get through, but beyond that things can take a turn for the difficult. I think in this regard, it can actually be EASIER to have some experience with the first Kingdom game, since you know what to expect. I played the second island and didn't realize that enemies can come at you from more than one portal in more than one direction until the second night happened. I lost my gold, my crown, and had to restart.  It makes things easier supposedly if you manage to destroy the portal with your knights, but that's something I've never managed to do. Either way, in 20 days winter sets in - and yes, the game does go through an active season change, its very pretty - and then your rabbits vanish, your deer retreat into the forest, your farmers can't bring in any new crops, and the only money you've got is from the little man with the donkey and your banker. It's possible to get a boat up and running and your kingdom fully armored by the time 20 days rolls around, but it gets harder on each subsequent island, as monsters can come on you from both sides, meaning if you want farmers that will be safe (since they stay in their own little hut at night, OUTSIDE the walls) then you have to extend the walls to keep them safe, which will mean extra coins for walls and catapults. It can be nerve-wracking, especially when it gets down to the wire.  But overall, its a good game. Mindless enough to enjoy running back and forth, but intense enough on the resource management that six or eight hours could easily pass without you noticing.",

I grabbedthe original on a whime during a sale, and I've spent so many hours playing it and this new version which I received for free (thanks developers!). Also, the developers are cool dudes. On the day New Lands came out, there were very active in the forums here on Steam responding to feedback and giving advice.  Great game with very simple mechanics but so much hidden depth and strategy and beautiful artwork. Highly highly recommend.",
