First thing developers should learn from this game is to break the rules, and to create new ones.  This game is a mix of current standard open-world game, shooter and fighting game (as in, Mortal Kombat/Virtua Fighter style), with a real interesting story, in a very well-thought world full of characters with real depth.  Also, David Bowie, the Legend, has an active role in this story. No need to mention the music alone is worth the price. No wonder he accepted to play in this game, it's kind of like his music was: daring, imaginative and rules-breaking.  Only thing I really dislike about this game is the save system. Without this I'd give the game a 11/10, so I'll have to go for a mere 10/10 instead.",

            "review_text": "Pros: great 1990s ~~cyber-world~~ aesthetic, great soundtrack, imaginative storyline, david bowie is in it.  Cons: hella dated game design. Controls are unplayable in 2014, can be kinda mitigated by Xpadder (check the Community Guides) but even then they handle awkwardly, it shouldn't be such a chore just to walk around effectively. Save system is terrible, but its annoyingness can be fixed by downloading an Omikron save editor. Inventory system feels clunky.  Conclusion: when is David Cage going to remake this game with modern controls and a non-masochistic save system?? Thanks.",

Becouse this game ROCKS, it's the first one with lip sync, first real city simulator, blends heroicly verious game types in one, has DAMN innovative story and is a bow towards mature players. THIS. IS. GREAT. No 'but''s or anything like that. Buy it. Or you will suck (that is a fact).",

            "review_text": "There is simply no questioning the artistic integrity of this dated action exploration roleplaying game. Graphically the fidelity has not held up well over the years, but taking in the voracity of its design, here is a piece of art that will leave a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of players for generations. There's no question that the purity of vision afforded by the influence of the incomprable David Bowie is a driving force in the emotional tangibility of this world.  Bowie provides several songs which serve as set pieces for the digital stage, and also cameos as a guiding character with the peculiarity and vision we expect from the creative visionary. Always a leader in many frontiers, the digital in particular, one might easily forgive the less than fluid manner in which different game styles are meshed in ways later perfected, but rarely with such passion.  A screenshot has the presense of a painted work of art, a feat rare when this game was released. It is unflinchingly challenging, with themes sexual and moral that will bring the jaded player pause. What are you doing and why? For whom? A question this game seeks to explore, where only you can provide the answer.  A rare game that suits its most notable collaborator. The daring and adventurous would be remiss in passing this game by. Do yourself a favor and study this piece, as it is of the time and timeless in its presentation.",

I would know because it is practically the only demo on that disc that I kept going back to. I was completely enamored with the demo. I for some reason felt the need to remember that David Cage directed the game. Turns out, this delicious piece of creative pie was his first in a storied legacy of near flawless masterpieces. The genius mixture of Adventure, fighting, and first person shooting gameplay is a formula that few others have even attempted to replicate. The adventure controls don't hold up very well, but that is a given for how early of a 3D game it is. I didn't even realize that David Bowie had contributed to the soundtrack until a decade &amp; a half later while I was looking at the wikipedia entry.",

Pros: - Good soundtrack - Very fun gameplay - Very good story - Really pulls you into whats happening around any character you play - Each character has a bio about them - Cool extensive investigative gameplay - The game doesnt hold your hand the whole way through  Cons: - Can get a little confusing and is a very fast paced story - In order to save you have to pick up secretly placed memory rings which I personally think is kind of stupid - The font can get very difficult to read sometimes",

            "review_text": "I played this game for many many hours when it debuted on the Dreamcast, and it is every bit as fun and challenging now, as it was then. THe highlights of this game for me is that it doesn't hold your hand throughout he whole playthrough, it makes you think about what your doing as if you yourself were the character, remembering pieces of information that you gather, and where you need to go to progress the storyline.  There are only two negatives I can find about this game, and one of them isn't really a negative considering the age of it.    The dated graphics (but considering it was released in 1999, you can hopefully forgive this one)    The controls on PC are pretty horrendous, but can be made manageable with third party controller programmes   Overall though, this game is a great 'on-sale' purchase, a blast from the past that you should check out.   Oh yeah, and David Bowie cameo's in it too. 10/10 ",

            "review_text": "A game from 1999 that isn't up to standard any more.  From the sexist fart with the messiah complex who gave you Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy, comes the very first Quantic Dream game, which doesn't play quite like the others, but kinda does. It's basically (very basically) an open-world RPG, but the progression is linear and there's not much point in exploring. The main part of the game is going from point A to point B. If any combat is involved, it's either a first-person shoot-em-up or a beat-em-up, both again very basic.  The game is best known for having David Bowie, which is only really of benefit to Bowie fans. He's in that elite of Phil Collins, Rod Stewart et al where if you don't like all their stuff then their non-single songs are gonna bore the pants off you (personally I'm a Phil Collins guy).  It might've been worth playing in 1999, but now, unless you're a Bowie megafan, there's probably another RPG in your backlog or being given away 'free' on Xbox or PS Plus that you'd enjoy far more.",

It just looks silly. The melee system is shoddy. Half of the time my guy won't punch or kick when I press the button. Also my enemy blocks non-stop while I can't deflect one hit. Dialogue options are treated like you only receive a set number of options, so while I want to ask every question to learn as much as possible, I'm only allowed a few. However the dialogue progesses on set routes, so somehow my character knows answer to questions I didn't ask! I always wanted this game when I was a kid, but I really should have let it remained on my nostalgic wish list.",

Unfortunately, it seems i don't have the patience any more for this era of game. The default controls are woeful, though you can WASD-ify them to make it slightly less awkward (no mouselook, though). I was still semi-interested in the world right up until the first battle. The FPS mode is very slippery and difficult to enjoy, but the fighting game mode is the real fun-killer, and this is coming from someone who played the hell out of the first three Mortal Kombat games as a kid. Perhaps it would be easier with a gamepad, but it's almost impossible to get your guy to do what you want with a mouse and keyboard. Given the savegames are all checkpoint-style and you have to go back 5+ minutes to replay the fight it's just not worth my time. The story seems like it could have been okay, but with controls like these it simply doesn't stand up to the countless modern games you could be spending your time and money on.",
