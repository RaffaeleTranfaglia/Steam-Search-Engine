            "review_text": "Try the demo!  Extremely nice to see game developers actually letting people play the first 5 days of their game. It lets you see exactly how it plays. The game becomes more complicated and difficult past those first 5 days too. The game is clearly pitched at the survival aspect, but the social management side is well developed and interesting as well. I feel like I am watching the first few episodes of Lost as I play the game, solving small problems, dealing with clashing personalities and figuring out what everyone is good at. Then of course you will eventually lose someone, probably, and you have to learn how to survive without their expertise.  Don't forget to use your items, I have absolutely been saved by them. Make sure you keep up with all the actions, maybe you will research a book which shows you how to solve your current shortcoming, or maybe you will find a location in the jungle that happens to have the very resource you need. You can get your group in a holding pattern and stabilise, but eventually you will have a lack which forces you to move on or perish.  Lastly, I feel like the game is replayable. You can work with your people a different way, or perhaps try to explore a different stretch of terrain earlier, or approach an unexpected encoutner differently. It certainly is not infinitely repeatable, but I will certainly get a second playthrough and perhaps even a third out of this game.    I have only encountered a single bug so far. After a character in my camp died, they no longer showed up at the evening conversation, but the others would still refer to them as if they were still alive. A small bug, but a little immersion breaking.   Either way, I still very much recommend this game if you liked Lost or would like a slower, more relaxed survival and social puzzle. Everything is turn based, so you can think about what you want to do.",

Not gonna lie this game is hard for the first couple of hours. However once you understand how the different stats work out for the characters, it becomes really easy to manage.  My first play through no one survived. Everyone died of dysentary except one, which he then later off'd himself due to depression. Yes, it is that detailed. It's like Orgeon Trail, you can say.   The story, and dialogue in the game is great and entertaining to boot, and as you progress in the map, it just keeps getting better.   The only real problem I have with it is the constant point and clicking. It may have hot keys, but I haven't honestly looked for them.  Honestly for the money and the time into the game, it's not that bad. It's pretty fun if you like simulation/Strat/RPG games. I'd recommend this to snag up!",

The game continues from where you ended in the demo (if you chose continue rather than new game) which I really liked as I didn't want to somehow sit through the tutorial again. ... Considering I killed everyone on the 14 day mark maybe going through the tutorial would have been a good idea.",

            "review_text": "Aaah, 'Dead in Bermuda', I tried to like you. I really did. You open with a nice 'comic book' intro that takes me right back to the Bande Designee of my youth, you feed me a little story about 8 survivors, all with their own personality, trapped on an uninhabitable island - and my job is to be the invisible hand that distributes resources and sets tasks to keep everyone from starving, or killing one another.  Great. Sounds right up my alley.  Sadly, a computer would do a better job at this than a human. See, with every character having stats directly linked to the tasks at hand, there is a right and wrong choice for each task. Why would I set my hunting 8 girl to hunt if I have hunting 70 dude? In addition, as the 'needs' increase the stats decrease... Hunger goes up by Y, Hunting goes down by X etc; It just means that before assigning tasks, I'm spending a lot of time in the 'spreadsheet' to pick the highest number after modifiers. It's closer to work than to fun, but the art was nice and I was curious to see your characters develop, DiB - so I stuck with you, to find out more about your plot.  Oh boy.  Oh boy oh boy oh boy DiBbie, what the hell?  So there's a bunch of weird blue skinned people who speak in riddles and tell you about a prophecy... something your characters have a quick 2 line conversation about how that's 'a little bit weird' and on we go.  I lost interest after having the silent guy send me to the nude woman on a shell who asked me to fetch a bone to refer me to the fat guy on a mound of food (that I had no option to steal while my people were starving, by the by) who insisted I brought him delicious food and eggs after that. Obtaining the giant eggs led me to blue-skinned tiger lady , where my only conversation option was 'No dude, don't kill me, look I got these wicked eggs' ...  Here's where I throw up my hands, DiB; You're a spreadsheet with pretty pictures and a plot written by a stoner who just tried mushrooms. There's no throught required, no strategy, and any zen-like relaxation from the pretty pictures and the character convo's is ruined by the completely unbelievable\\illogical events.  Sorry DiB. I through you and I could work out.  Now, I sorta regret not managing to weasel out of having started with a refund, but I tried to like you for too long.",

            "review_text": "A very solid group management/survival sim, with excellent artwork and enjoyable music. Though I will say the personality management aspect of the game is a bit of a rub. See, everyone has an opinion about everyone else in the group, which affects how well they work together, and this relationship goes up or down when they work together, seemingly at random. It's somewhat annoying that you can't predict/plan for people's random changes in affection for each other, which ways on group tasks even more than the characters' relevant skills do. I also wish moving around your camp felt just a little bit more responsive.  The game is fun, fairly challenging, for the style, without being overly cruel, and all in all a nice experience.",

You view the camp and assign survivors to tasks, balancing their skills against their tiredness etc., trying to avoid pairing up people who dislike eachother.  My problem is there's not much of a game here. Where you should assign each survivor is basically dictated by their prefab stats and who they don't hate. There's no real decisions to be made, no balancing act, just look at stat bars, plug your guys in, and hit next turn. Even researching and building are fairly linear.  In the end you're just fighting the negative stats (hunger, tiredness, etc) while praying the RNG gives you the resources you so desperately need.   It doesn't seem worthwhile to battle a frustrating UI and an irritating grind of constant negative feedback, just to get rationed out breadcrumbs of a story presented in the form of people kvetching at each other around a campfire.",

That is the opposite of the core enjoyment from these games, to solve a pussle as effeciently as possible. When you punish the player for keeping certain characters alive by killing other characters you defeat the point of survival.",

Unfortunately the second half of the game feels like a drag, once you've built all the basic work stations it's fairly easy to maintain your survivors and things become a bit of a grind. I still think it was worth my money and don't begrude the designers their due but if they bring out something else I'm going to be a bit more cautious and jaded about approaching it. If it looks even remotely similar it'll probably have to be a fair bit cheaper before I think about getting it.  The game still gets a recommend, though I'm not 100% sure it earns it for the regular price.",

For anyone that really enjoys survival/management games I would warmly recommend this.  The characters have their quirks and are interesting even though the focus is very heavy on the actual gameplay.  The only critique I have is that it takes a lot of time to look around trying to get an overview and to place character around. If a sequel gets made made sure it is easy to get a quick overview and add some faster way to move characters around, like for example holding right mouse button on a spot and then being able to scroll through the characters.",
