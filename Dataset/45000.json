SS has a lot to offer and gives you so many options (after you get access to different commanders who each have their own combination of towers/powerups) on how to approach each level. It even has multiplayer vs and co-op. Brilliant game with a lot of depth and replay value.  Only thing that bugs me is you can't fast forward.",

            "review_text": "Sol Survivor is yet another indie Tower Defense game. They really are spitting them out on an assembly line these days.  Sol Survivor is one of the better examples though as it takes great care to provide you with a multitude of different play-styles and tactics as well as decent multi-player component although it's a bit depopulated these days.  The rather long campaign provides you with the option of choosing which commander to play as which in turn changes which turrets and abilities are available to you. Everything from the standard 'Gun' turret to nuke silos and booster towers is available to you from the tower side and on the abilities you have simple damage abilities, slowing and stunning abilities and even an ability that permanently sacrifices the power you use to cast abilities in exchange for more resources to build towers.  The abilities are a big part of the game and where other Tower Defense games like Defense Grid focus on building the most minimalistic defense possible Sol Survivor is all about intelligent tower placement and well timed ability use making it a very thoughtful and tactical game.  Sol Survivor also comes packaged with some excellent multi-player modes which in my opinion is one of the most important things in a Tower Defense game. Unfortunately there aren't a whole lot of people playing this online anymore so unless you got friends to play with you might have a bit of a hard time finding opponents and coop partners.  Probably the most intelligent Tower Defense game on steam and definitely one of the best.",

            "review_text": "Great TD game. This game has a great tower selection system and simple and easy to understand. The game also has a large intresting amounts of mobs. The game has a great balancing system for players who like a challange and for players who want a kick back for a normal or easy time. One of the best features which you rarely see in a GOOD TD game is multiplayer with awesome VS. mode or just simple survival. The multiplayer also has leaderboards just like single player so you and your friends can team up and try to beat the boards. In conclusion Sol Survivor is an amazing TD game although I don't agree with the $10 price I think you should not let it change your mind I would highly reccomend this game if you enjoy TD games.",

The gameplay is excellent, the soundtrack is amazing, the multiplayer adds more than plenty replay value, and the game is a quite solid production with lots of potential for enhancement later on.  The only drawbacks I have with this game are the survival capping after the hour mark (eventually the mobs just start cheating and there's no way to survive after a certain point just after about an hour into the match but this isn't too bad of a thing, keeping games shorter than an hour and a half especially since in multiplayer there is no pause feature yet) and endgame, the brightness of the lighting can white-out the action.. also the grid is crucial for the game mechanics yet most of the time it is incredibly difficult to see.. instead of using bright green and red circles on a disappearing faint grid.. they could have made the grid a bit more visible.  Overall though, excellent game, I very much enjoy it and recommend it.",

The amount of customization in game modes, to turrets, to how money is distributed, this game can keep a goup entertained for a long time. And the addition of Survival mode was a good one, as it creates a neverending drive to do better. Take one friend, or take 3, it doesn't matter. The game will adjust to the amount of commanders there are so your game is always balanced for every situation. Good buy if you have friends, if you don't, go make some friends then buy a 4 pack.",

Even with it's awesome use of different Commanders with a specific mixup of abilities, all set in a sci-fi universe, i never caught on. In a moment of weakness i might say that the game had no soul, but i shan't.  The towers and difficulty seemed strangely balanced. When i upgraded a tower i never felt it was worth it. I never got a sense of the math behind it, and that is important in a TD game. The enemies felt even more lifeless then normal TD enemies. So even with sci-fi, commanders, lots of towers and abilities and also high replayability, i was ultimately bored with an uninteresting game.  What a shame.",
