            "review_text": "TL;DR: massively overhyped, it falls short of my expectations.  I pre-ordered this game because of the pre release information. It is (afaik) the first Unreal Engine 4 game that's actually released and - if trailers are to be trusted - it seemed to use that engine quite well to create a believable nightmare. This version however, seems to suffer from weak textures and visuals that would have been possible on the Unreal engine 3 as well. Besides that, there are quite a lot of users right now suffering from crashes and instabilites in the Steam forums. (and there is no way to change the game language completely - I am forced to use German text with spoken English, because the game simply won't become 100% English when set to that in Steam settings)  The game plays in a hospital / asylum / prison, which are all stuffed into the same building. Your character starts off with a smartphone (doubling as a map and a torchlight) and has to gather so called relics. Each relic is commented by some person with the comments being somewhere between annoying and a minor inconvenience - they just don't actually add to the gameplay or the atmosphere.  Then there is the actual game which has you run through corridors of ever-repeating models (the doors, the actual items placed around the rooms, ...) and visuals. This game seems like a cheap modification for UT3, but neither the visuals nor any other aspect live up to my expectations of what the Unreal engine 4 would be capable of.  In that maze of repeating corridors there are random ghosts (which - you guessed it - seem like clones) spawning in on you. While this might at first seem like a nice change of pace, simply because flickering lights and closing doors have been done before, it soon becomes exhausting. You have got one and a half way of getting rid of ghosts. The most effective one is to actually get rid of them by using a signalling torch similar to those used in road accidents (which you find on a regular basis in this madhouse...) - however, the next ghost might spawn in only a few seconds later. Then there is the possibility of running away. When actually choosing flight instead of fight, you will run in a ghost around the next corner, so it is not really an alternative in the long run. (Besides, it's a maze that you are running through, with your path clearly laid out - so running away from the ghost actually forces you to retreat into the maze and hinders your progress, rendering it - all things considered - unfeasible)  The story seems somewhat normal. There is this hospital in which patients die of 'mysterious' causes, start seeing things, ... - the usual stuff.  Although I have not yet played through the whole game, I already regret pre ordering the game. The gameplay has already overstayed its welcome, the visuals seem dated and the overall atmosphere just isn't as good as it seemed to be in the trailers. While I got it for almost 10$ it simply is not as satisfying as I am used to when comparing it to other games I got for this amount (and less).",

            "review_text": "As a long term survival horror fan, I feel like the community is being way too harsh on this game, mostly due to completely wrong expectations.  If you are truly interested in Daylight, but the negative reviews keep you off, please read this to understand what exactly this game has to offer before expecting anything else from it.   Most survival horror games can be divided into two categories: puzzle-based action-adventures (early Resident Evil, Silent Hill, ObsCure) and the recent story-driven run and hide investigations (Penumbra, Amnesia, Outlast).  Which one is Daylight? Neither.  Remember Slenderman? The one that was in early beta but still got popular due to its basic yet effective gameplay formula? Since it became so popular, we had a huge number of clones, remakes and spiritual successors with different interpretations of the story and the monster himself. I don't know about you, but none of them were truly my cup of tea - not even the full Slender: The Arrival game itself.  Daylight is, though. It follows Slenderman's legacy every step of the way, while trading the open forest for procedurally generated corridors, which works for this type of gameplay. If you don't know what Slenderman is, here's a simple explanation of its mechanics: collect documents, avoid the enemy and never look at him. Looking at him triggers his aggro and scariness ensues. Very simple yet very effective. Daylight uses the same mechanics with a few extra touches here and there which is enough to make the game stand out without overcomplicating it.  Its main issue is relying almost purely on cheap jumpscares, although even without them the atmosphere is quite unnerving. And as far as jumpscares go, Daylight can at the very least show some good ones. The ghost is well detailed, and the sound design is genuinely creepy. Bricks are expected to be ♥♥♥♥.  I understand why people dislike it. It's not as story-heavy as one would want, although IMO the ending was worth reading through the notes you find. Its scares are cheap and don't change throughout the game, the ghosts can be outsmarted and the overall experience leaves you wanting just a tad bit more... but if it's scares you want, then scares you shall get.  It's one of those games that you should force your friends to play and just enjoy them jumping out of their seats. Definitely far from a top-tier survival horror, but nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Know what the game offers and you shall be not disappointed with what it doesn't offer.",

Of course when you die and run through it again you are a 'little' more prepared for them. Though, if I have any complaints it is that it kinda goes the Slender route and you do a lot of running away as you collect items, but this game gives you a map! Not bad but it gets annoying when you don't have any flares to make the ghosts go away. Also, this game has a very interesting plot and it ends very well. The ending makes you think and you aren't left with any loose ends.  If you like horror and 'oh god I gotta get away from this thing!' kind of games I definitely recommend that you play this!",

I keep saying that this game could have been the next 'Outlast', but falls short of expectations. The hype for this game was the main selling point. This game was created on the new Unreal Engine 4 and should have given us more realistic and terrifying scares. The game is hardely scary and I actually stopped my let's play after one episode. There are points where the game runs at a smooth 30 FPS, but if I so much as try to turn my character, the game freezes or drops the FPS. The game is nearly unplayable as I have found many bugs in the game. My favorite bug is the movable crates. I try to move them to progress through the game and they completely clip through the floor! Thus, making me restart from the last save point. The saving mechanic in the game is very bad. You have no choice but to save when the game wants to. You cannot save wherever you'd like, causing let's players like me to make very long videos. Overall, I didn't finish the game and I probably never will. 3/10 Rating on this game.",

            "review_text": "Had Daylight been released before a game like Amnesia, it may have been an okay if not brief horror experience. However as a 2014 release it must be held to the more recent standards set by games such as Amnesia and even Outlast, trying to settle somewhere between the pure tension of the former and the roller coaster thrill ride of the latter, yet falls very short of either. Finsihed in less than 90 minutes and with a weak and thin 'story' I can not recommend this to even desperate horror fans yearning for a new release. Boring fetch quest mechanic, enemies destroyed with flares, regenerating health, unlimited sprint, bad attempts at jump scares and a total lack of tension all make for an ulitmately disappointing horror game. The only noteworthy thing about Daylight is the procedurally generated layout of the levels, however I will not experience this myself as I don't particularly plan on playing Daylight again. At least it was free with my video card.",

            "review_text": "Daylight is an Unreal Engine 4 powered survival horror game created by developer Zombie Studios that puts you into the shoes of a woman known only as Sarah. You’ve been abandoned in a hospital with no recollection of how you got there or how you are supposed get out. You’re prompted by a voice to use your cellphone that acts as a combined GPS and flashlight to find all of the memories within the hospital which come in the form of scraps of paper, notes, and pictures. With the assistance of tools like glow sticks that highlight items of importance like boxes that contain items, valves, and switches; and flares that ward off enemies you make your way aimlessly through the rooms and corridors of this abandoned hospital. First off I must address the elephant in the room. Daylight by Zombie Studios and Outlast by Red Barrels are indeed similar games and I expect comparisons will be drawn between the two. And as someone who has played through both; I’ll be internally comparing them and this will show within this review.  Anyways, what sets Daylight apart from other games within the genre is the way it handles environments, enemies, content, and encounters. Daylight features a procedurally generated world and is touted to be the same experience twice. The layout of the hospital and prison, spawning of enemies, items you need to obtain and even how you complete these objectives are set to be different for every playthrough. Although some parts remain the same, specifically rooms with switches and the storage / break room, the rest of the environments are random. During my second playthrough I found myself trying to remember where I had gone the first time and this caused me to use up the most precious resource, flares. Speaking of flares, these items are the only things that can ward off enemies so it’s important to use them sparingly especially when the game scares you into using them when you didn’t truly need to. This leads directly into sound design and my oh my did Zombie Studios do a fantastic job with that. Daylight executes perfectly in balancing your fear level. Much like a good horror film you reach moments of tension that put you on the edge of your seat, and soon after are lulled into a false sense of safety before once again being put on edge. As you make your way through the halls of the hospital and prison you hear the telltale sound of an enemy approaching from behind you and this happens at random. But what happens is when you hear the sound of an enemy coming up from behind you; the enemy might not be there. This caused me to erroneously use my flares and left me without defenses when the enemies did come.  The phrase silent protagonist does not apply here as you are constantly updated with the thoughts and feelings of Sarah, you can hear her breathe heavily as the tension rises and even gasps out and yells when trouble is near. As you collect these memories you will occasionally hear the guiding voice which has just the right amount of creepy to leave you with that unsettling feeling. As enemies approach your cellphone, which acts as a mini-map that displays key locations and all the areas you’ve explored begins to glitch and the map becomes difficult to see. Because the mini-map is in your hands there is a degree of difficulty in seeing it when you’re running which can cause you to walk into dead ends. Now normally this would be an issue in game like Outlast, but in Daylight if you end up cornering yourself you can run through the enemies. This broke the illusion for me, either Sarah is an Olympic distance runner with incredible stamina or the running is a little broken because this entire game can be run through including through and away from the enemies. While this certainly helped in my second playthrough, it completely killed the tension that is integral to what makes Daylight a survival horror game. This made the entire outside area a complete joke. Let it be noted that you can “die” in this game. Once I discovered I could just run away from the enemies I thought that it meant that nothing would happen if I stood still to let the enemies “get me”. Of my two playthroughs I only died once and it was only to see if it could actually happen.  The entirety of my first playthrough lasted roughly two and a half hours, much of this time was spent reading every piece of paper and discovering all the memories that I could. But my second playthrough was completed after just 38 minutes. The game stops you from running through by forcing you to collect a certain amount of remnants that are scattered out throughout the level, once those remnants are collected you must then retrieve the “sigil”, an item of important like a bible, or a teddy bear and bring that to the locked spooky gate. This is repeated four or five times and then the experience is over. It becomes a pattern that can be solved rather quickly and frankly it gets a little boring. The thing that would slow me down would be the layout of the hospital and prison solely because it is randomly generated.  On my first playthrough I ran into difficulties playing the game after reaching a waterfall area, if I was to look at the waterfall room directly my computer would completely lock up with the only solution being a hard reset. I got past this issue by looking at the ground and walking aimlessly until I found my way through that part. This was an odd issue that could only be replicated on my computer whose hardware was just a tiny bit better than the “minimum” specifications required. However, on my second playthrough I used a computer that had exceeded the “recommended” specifications and only noticed a slight performance drop during this waterfall area. The biggest issue here is that it if you crash or stop playing at this waterfall junction; you are returned to the beginning of that section which takes a good 10-15 minutes to get back to. I am not deducting any points here for this, but it was something I had experienced in my review experience. This review was using a beta version of Daylight so this must also be taken into consideration.  Daylight is a great example of what a small dedicated team can do. Daylight will leave you feeling uneasy and wanting more. With excellent sound design and great looking environments thanks to Unreal Engine 4, Daylight should be a game that you’ll want to play over and over, but because of the whole “find X number of items and proceed to the gate” mechanic you’ll only want to play it once. On a second playthrough the game becomes a chore and what was creepy and scary in your first playthrough become a joke. Although you won’t get too much replayability I would still recommend anyone who enjoys the survival horror genre should give it a try. Daylight releases on April 29th for both PC and PlayStation 4 for just $15.00.  75/100  Good ",

This game in my opinion, is very slow paced; Half the campaign is to get some teddy bear or key and raise it up in the air to open the next door and continue on and do the same. Don't get me wrong though, it gave off very chilly vibes and the dialogue was astonishing. On the other hand, the framerate I was getting on this game was a little lower than expected. When I play this, it feels like I'm playing a sort of puzzle or maze game. The game wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, but then again, it's very difficult to get me screaming.

It's not anything that's going to change the genre or something you *MUST* experience. It certainly delivered on anything advertised and *I* enjoyed it. The replayability of it is part of the fun, as I can't memorize the maps and such. Even dying and respawning, would change parts of the puzzles into different areas.  Now, for the more depth review. You wake up with a cell phone and some guy talking to you presumably through the cell phone. You get glowsticks that you can use which will highlight things you can get. You get flares that you can use that burn ghosts and such. Those are the basics, the puzzles are simple, I almost always had a glowstick out as they were very numerous, and only ran out of flares once at where I ended up dying.  Dodging the ghosts is simple, you can usually hear them and turn your back to them and walk past them backwards or whatever, it seems you must look at them for them to be able to kill you. You can run past them and a whole lot of things. No hiding places like in Outlast, that I could find. The game is ridiculously simple. You just progress by finding 'remnants' (basically information written by people), when you've found the required amount of remnants, you then need to find the 'sigil' which acts as a key to enter a puzzle area, where you are challenged with some little puzzle and more 'remnants' to find, and you progress to the next area that requires more remnants and a new sigil, etc.. etc.. until you beat the game.   You start over and it happens again, the rooms are randomized, the locations of the remnants seem to be, as do the sigil rooms, and locks, and the puzzles have some randomization to them. The graphics are nice, ths special effects are nice, the game is a simple $15 game that is designed to cause fear with an odd story that made some sense, but not enough to be important. Once I beat the game the first time, I don't even read the remnants or anything, I just run through the whole game.  tl;dr - Game is fun and scary, short, and simple. If your system can handle the graphics and you want a simple $15 game designed to scare you, it should work. If you're going in looking for an intriguing story like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Anna, you're really not going to find one here. Personally, I enjoyed it, the hype around it was far too high, for what it ultimately was, however I still recommend it, even at $15.",

In Daylight you play as Sarah, she wakes up in a hostpital and you hear a mysterious voice of a doctor that guides you to Daylight. So how is this game ? This game is not worth your time. Now lets go through the pros and cons. The pros: The atmosphere is amazing it really feels lonely and scary in these kinda places. Controls are fluid and simple to use. Unique approach to the horror genre. But thats all of it thats good about this game. Now about the bad. The game is a maze and the map on the phone barely helps so no point in using it you will have much more luck wandering around. The game is short you can pretty much beat it in an hour. The story is consisted of scraps which you have to find to understand the story. Boring objectives which are always the same. Overall Daylight is a pretty mediocre horror game which i cant recommend. Daylight gets a 5/10",

It's much like being caught in one of thoe Maize Mazes in the countryside in summer. At first they are ok but it soon wears off as you go around and around, looking at the same thing, over and over. Yet, with Daylight we get a story, which isn't much. I played this for about an 40 mins and basically I couldn't take anymore. The graphics are really poor, despite having everything set on max and having a good system to run it on. I was hoping that given that this was one of the firsr games to use the new engine we would see something different, but instead it's really rather poor. Granted the game is cheap, but seriously, there are much better games on Steam and elsewhere that deserve your money. Polygon rated this as a 5 and I thought that perhaps they were being harsh. In reality, they were being generous. This is quite easily one of the worst games I've played of this genre, come to think of it, of any genre.",

The game is linear and short, and there's no involvement whatsoever, you NEVER feel any empathy towards the protagonist or what's happening.

This is pretty scary for the first good 20-30 minutes. You're a random woman with no recollection of what is going on or how you got there, you're only guide being a mans voice through the hallways.This sets for a very brief tutorial, from the game having very little thing to interact with. The bases being glow stick and flare before letting you go into the hallways yourself. while you're roaming you find some pieces of paper explaining back story, and that's all really you get until the end. So if you're looking for a nice story you're going to have to play through several times.   The scares drop off quite quickly, though before that they're pretty good. Seeing as the shadow can move as it pleases through the dark, and enjoys popping in at your side so only it's face is in your peripheral, just standing there until you either turn towards it or freeze in terror. What really ruined the illusion was the fact that    You learn that she makes a specific noise when she's around, so you can easily walk back wards into her. This causes her to dissapate for a few seconds, letting you turn around and run.    This game looks great visually, Lights and things cast great shadows. Can't really say about textures, but I think they look nice. Sound quality is really good, whether from dripping pipes to running water and screams. Story wise it's pretty weak from what I've gathered in my playthrough, despite not finding all the papers yet. Though I will say I like the way they tied in the ending to the begining. Overall It'd be better if it was cheaper, and that the OST wasn't only 3 songs. Will recommend if you're looking for a look at the new engine, wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a game that will hold you for awhile.",

It's not that I get freaked out by video games from time to time. A jump scare is fun sometimes. It's not that this is necessarily a bad game. It could be very good in its genre. But outside of Code Veronica, this game has galvanized that I do not enjoy the genre. I don't get scared by the monster chasing me in the hall. I don't get scared by the popup ghosts. I just don't get scared. I get curious, I work through the motions of investigating or leaving, but that's about it. The genre becomes less of a game and more of a chore. I'm the one that's broken, but this game has showed me it's me.  As for the game itself, I can't give it a negative review. It has a good atmosphere that it's aiming for. There's plenty of backstory to fill in with all those papers left around. Graphically and audibly it was pleasing. Possibly I could appreciate it further in VR or 3D (this game seems to heavily support those kinds of options). As it stands, it seems to have direction and only climbing the boxes felt truly tedious.  The fact that the levels are supposed to be procedurally generated by some degree should lend some replayability to this game.  But, I've found this isn't my genre so you may want to shop around other reviews.",

It felt like I got to a point where a new ghost would spawn every 10 feet and I'd have to activate my last flare to kill it or i'd just have to run away. This always kept me on edge and hoping i'd get another flare soon.  On the negative side of things, I don't think this game does Unreal Engine 4 justice. Everything from the textures to some of the lighting just looks very mediocre. Instead of the in-game objects looking sharp and clear on max settings, they seem to just look fuzzy. I don't know if they just directly ported the PS4 version of the game with minimal changes or what.   The other thing is the player character's commentary about the area around you. Alot of it seemed out of place and even annoying at times. I understood the context that Sarah, protagonist, is scared of everything around her, but asking 'Is somebody there?' when it's obvious that no one is broke the immersion for me. That said, in the later levels, I felt her commentary was much more appropriate.  Watch some gameplay on youtube before you decide to buy. Otherwise, avoid.",

It feels like a very early alpha of some indie game. Generated levels is an idea that sounds cool, but in the actual game those generated mazes look dull, repetitive and awfully cluttered. If the devs were braver and added more glitchiness and weirness (think Memory of Broken Dimension) maybe it woul've been more interesting. But they chose to just throw a heap of horror game cliches in a weak attempt to follow Outlast footsteps. Unsuccessfully. Gotta be bolder with this type of game.",

'Alone with no weapon' was much better accomplished by the PS2 Project Zero games (AKA Fatal Frame) 'Jump scares' have been rather done-to-death 'Mysterious notes' appear in pretty much all games - although not as an objective 'Asylum' - so many games seem to be set in an asylum!

We always know a dark room holds osme kind of jump scare, or that a long look around a corner will always yield something. Great horror manages to scare us in spite of this, or turns these conventions on its head and surprises us.   Daylight is not great horror. In fact, Daylight takes predictability to entirely new levels. Before the first twenty minutes pass, you will have figured out not only which jump scares lurk in which dark rooms, but you will have identified the specific models that are repeated endlessly through the game's bland corridors such that every time you see a dresser with open drawers, you can know that as you approach it, each drawer will close of its own accord. Spooky? Not really. Especially not when it happens every single time you see such a dresser (which is entirely too often).  And then there is the design. Long, mostly blank hallways compose, well, just about the entirety of the game as I have seen it. Every once in a while there is a picture or cabinet on the wall. but each hallway ends in one of two sets of featureless double doors. One is a set of simple, steel doors. The other is broken paned glass.   When the game's very makeup is so utterly bland, and the only thing there is to scare you is a poorly lit hallway, the idea of Daylight being a horror game becomes more laughable than anything else.",

Good textures, sfx aren’t bad but the a.i. seems weak.. the storyline a bit wishy washy with an ominous voice over that talks some trash and relies far too heavily on drawing from other survival horror genres instead of aspiring to be creative or original. Sure, the level does change layout which is kinda cool but the execution is EXACTLY the same!: collect 6 documents while threat level increases, go collect the key/artefact and then go unlock the next area – repeat (After 3 repeats I deleted the game lol). What were you smoking over at Zombie Studios?!! Requiem, System Shock 2, Clive Barker's Undying, Doom 3, F.E.A.R., Bioshock, Condemned, Resident Evil 4, Dead Space, Amnesia, Slender and Outlast etc. tried to bring something new to the table and I’d have to be a little harsh in terms of a rating and full heartedly agree with Gamespot’s, “Daylight accomplishes nothing. Its attempt to expand on the Slender formula is only enjoyable for as long as you’d ever want to play Slender anyway, and it isn’t nearly as effective.”",

            "review_text": "Zombie Studios tried its best to bring hype to their horror game Daylight. They went as far as enabling Twitch commands in the game to have viewers attempt to influence the game with spooky soundbites and occurances (definitely inspired by the Twitch Plays Pokemon frenzy that gripped the internet a number of weeks ago). They delayed the game for a few weeks in attempt to make it scarier (given what is in the game now, they must have forgotten to put the monster into the game and had to buy time). It was all for naught.  The game starts with a young woman name Sarah waking up in an abandoned hospital to the strange voice of a man who spouts in riddles. The goal of the game is rather basic and unfortunately repetitive: collect a number of 'remnants' (items that glow in a weird yet cool fashion under the light of a glowstick), find a big magic circle and then move to the next level. There are four levels in all and not much changes outside of the level design. The more time you waste or the further you progress in your quest, you will run into the witch, the only monster and threat in the game. The witch's method of killing you is flying around, popping up in front of you as you do a quick turn and then shove you into a tunnel of red and weird rune shapes until you die or pull a flare out in time to banish them. Fortunately in my playthrough she did this only a few times and gave me some frights when she appeared. Unfortunately she's the only unit in the game and basically a creepy one trick pony. Outside of the witch, the only kind of scares that the game tries to use are feint scares. Items suddenly fly out towards you but do no harm. Screams come down the hall but there is no actual creature wandering around and making that noise. Besides the witch, the game felt like walking through a cheap haunted house that the neighborhood put together for one Halloween night to spook the kids. More silly than scary and no actual harm is done.   Daylight is apparently the first game released to the public that uses the Unreal 4 engine. But given the potentials of the tech demos of the engine, it felt like they didn't even try to create an immersive world and used it more for the sake of marketing. They bought expensive paint but went and fingerpainted what appears to be a red house, a green tree and a happy stick figure family. But hey, they bought that expensive paint! You should consider that!  Sarah's character was very hard to immerse with. She fills the atmosphere with her gasps and her occassional strange lines, which are very frequent. I kid you not, I was investigating a desk when Sarah yelled out 'Is anyone in there?'. Maybe she was afraid that the witch would pop out of the drawers and get papers all over the place. The problem with Sarah is how little she contributes to the story. She collects remnants, questions Mystery Phone Man of what's going on and then goes on her merry way to collect more remnants without any hint of defiance or free will whatsoever. It was very strange to see her panic and question every thump in the dark, real or not, and remain silent to the witch that constantly screams at her face.   Daylight was written by Jessica Chobot, who is best known as that woman who achieved internet fame for having a photo of herself licking a PSP. She worked for IGN and did a voice role as Diana Allers in Mass Effect 3 (although it's clear that she slept through her voice acting classes). Her writing comes in the forms of Mystery Phone Man's riddlespeak and the dozens of documents lying around about patients being crazy and workers suspecting something isn't right in the hospital. The concept of incredible amounts of notes in games started with Resident Evil and was recently enforced in Amnesia. But those kinds of documents either clued to upcoming puzzles, environmental obstacles and monsters or provided a piece of a story of things slowly going to hell. The problem with Daylight's notes is that they provide nothing but fluff and make the very short game feel much longer. There are no traps to be warned about ahead of time. There are no upcoming characters that you must help or fight off. Besides vaguely explaining what is actually going on, the notes do nothing to change how the game should be played.   I reached the disappointing conclusion to the game in just two hours. For $15 dollars and no significant replay value besides achievements, I feel cheated. Outlast had the atmosphere, Dear Esther had the writing and Amnesia had both. Daylight had neither. It's tradition under my household that a horror game is to be played at night. Daylight, amusingly enough from the title alone, should be just played in daylight. Or shouldn't be played at all.",
