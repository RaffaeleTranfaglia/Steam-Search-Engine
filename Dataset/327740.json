Expect some light RPG elements, lengthy campaign full of large exploratory levels, variety of creative and fun-to-use weapons, and fantastic visuals that perfectly captured classic Tron aesthetics - even today this game can look absolutely stunning at times. There is also some surprisingly not-awful first person platforming, and few quite fun light cycle racing sequences (which are also pretty short and not too hard, so they won't be hindrance to anyone who is playing this purely for shooty part). Old Monolith Productions quality, through and through! Killer App mod is strongly recommended as it adds support for modern widescreen resolutions as well as numerous fixes &amp; improvements.",

Using the disc as the main combat weapon is so much fun and feels so satisfying when you deflect an enemy attack and throw your disc for the kill.   Only announce is the Lightcycles and the game takes a bit of work toget going.  The opposing lightcycles have (naturally) inhuman reflexes which can lead to some onesided matches when they can pull of maneuvers that most people couldn't do  All in all the game is a lot of fun and should not be overlooked if you are a TRON fan",

The bugs are only an issue if you didn't take the time to look for answers, which are handily located in a pinned post in the Steam community for this game. The game is genuinely fun, and a genuinely good experience, and I played it before I had even seen either Tron film, so it's not something that only fans of Tron will 'get'. If you play it and don't like it, that's fine! Not everything is for everyone. But I highly recommend this title to anyone who thinks it might be fun. Because it probably will be.

            "review_text": "This game for me was one of those: 'its a great game, but...' Tron 2.0 is a really great concept with tons of fun gameplay and some really interesting mechanics, but it has a tendency to pick and then drop mechanics on the fly. Tron 2.0 is a interesting game with plenty of in-jokes that anyone interested in programming will love, but its story is pretty stale and it has the voice actor script of a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ b-movie. Tron 2.0 is a well made game with few bugs and plenty of gameplay time, but it was made in 2003 and it really shows.  Basically i'd recommend it if you're a fan of older shooters from the Quake 4 generation and if you're into programming but otherwise its a wee bit clunky for most people to pick up and play.  I can see why some people hated it and i understand why it was later retconned as 'non-canon' but i'd love for them to make sequel with alot of 'fixing up'. or hell even just a remaster or something, this games filled with unpolished gems waiting for some lovin.",

Unfortunately, whether it's the Steam version or the game in general, it's buggy as all hell running on Windows 8.1. Lots of crashes and control glitches.  I can't really recommend the game just because it still needs work to bring it up to spec on more modern machines.",

The atmosphere was very true to film with an immersive story that supurbly fit right along with the original films plot. Contains RPG style player upgrading and a robust multiplayer to keep any fan entertained for hours. Although an older game it runs excellent on current and top of the line systems and with the easily found 1.042 update and 1.1a steam compatable killer app mod it can also be played in wide screen on most modern monitors and TV's at most preferred resolutions. Now that it is also direct x 9 compatable means you can also play it in 3d. A MUst have for any Tron or First Person Shooter Fan.",

I know my Steam profile says I've only logged 55 minutes on here, but that's because I'm running Windows 10 and managed to get the game working; and to do that I downloaded and installed the latest tronlauncher.exe, the IZARC v381 and 3D Analyzer v234, all through 3rd party sites. Once downloaded, I reinstalled the game, placed all of the files in to the Tron Folder in the Stream Library -&gt; Common -&gt; Tron 2.0 folder and unpacked / installed all of the programs in to the same folder. Restart machine and the game has worked ever since. I had forgoten how damned challenging this game was and how often you absolutely NEED to quick save... like every 3 seconds doesn't actually hurt. This is an utterly unforgiving game, but once yopu get the gist of how the game plays, this will provide hours of screaming, hair pulling and psychosis inducing thrashing. Utterly worth it. Also, this game IS DATED (surprise, surprise) but then if you look at this game and how it looks for its age, the truth of the matter becomes clear - this was a work of genius far supassing the likes of Call of Duty or Battlefield with a fraction of the programmers and auxilleries involved. This is a game from an era when games were finished, tested and true to their source material and with some of the naration it utterly shows - Hey, they got the original Tron in to the game (Bruce Boxleitner) and it feels like he was enjoying the opportunity.  Still not sure? Well, then it's clear you don't have what it takes to finish this piece of FPS history. Find some frilly pants and accept your failure as a gamer. :D",

I played using the 'Killer App' mod, which irons out a few bugs and gives the option for widescreen, and I honestly couldn't tell I was playing a game from 2003 until I got a cut-scene (more on those shortly). This was probably mainly due to the visuals of the game, since you spend the entire game in the digitised virtual world. The game's biggest let down is a boring and predictable story, along with some appallingly acted cut-scenes (mainly from the game's protagonist, an utterly charmless and lifeless character called 'Jet', voiced wholly unconvincingly by Jason Cottle - a bit like his fictitious father, Bruce Boxleitner, did in the original film). The clunky cut-scenes are filled with characters that just can't seem to keep still or wave their arms around while they talk, something I noticed in the NOLF games, but for some reason didn't annoy me as much, probably since they were mainly comedic performances in those games. Anyway, by the end of the game I was just skipping the cut-scenes as I'd lost all interest, and just wanted to get it finished. The difficulty levels throughout are a bit inconsistent, and the array of weapons and powerups (filled with tech-puns) can be confusing, but it's a fun and fairly addictive experience overall.",

It’s up to Alan Bradley and his son Jet Bradley to digitize themselves into the system and stop the corruption from corrupting the computer world.
