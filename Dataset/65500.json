            "review_text": "Aura is a first-person point &amp; click puzzle/adventure game, similar to the Myst series. Differences are a 360 degree camera and an inventory where you can pick up and hold items to later be used in puzzles. Some of the puzzles are quite difficult, either because you're on the lookout for small details which are easy to miss, or they genuinely require some brains to piece together. Sketches are scribbled in your journal to give you some not-too-obvious hints if you get stumped.   The music, atmosphere and voice acting aren't comparable, but if you enjoyed Myst or Riven there's a decent chance you'll enjoy this game. I'd say it's a bit easier overall since, unlike either of those games, every single thing you can interact with is key to progressing in one way or another.",

            "review_text": "If you like awesome puzzles like those seen in Myst this game is for you. However it is lacking in any character development or the like but that is not what the game is about. It's about the challenge of solving puzzles that are solvable and this has plenty of those. My advice is to pay attention in the first world and after that you get the flavour for the puzzles as some of them are quite trying. I am currently in the second world and have been enyoying the puzzles immensely, however I am stuck on a doozy at the moment! I think I may even have to look up the solution as there are so many variables going on. It really is a pen to paper kind of game. Which I love playing! I hope there is a renaissance of this kind of game. The graphics are dated etc but still acceptable but at 5 bucks you will definitely get your money's worth if you like problem solving games.",

            "review_text": "The best way I can describe this game is it seems to have been designed and written by someone who saw some screenshots of Myst, and then had someone give them a rough description of it and Adventure games in general. The puzzles are simplistic and don't seem to relate to the story progression, which is rudamentary, at best. While the Myst series has extensive backstory that's hinted at and expanded on throughout which gives you the sense that you're only seeing a brief snippet of a larger history (and the end of it, at that). Conversely this game briefly mentions a backstory and then doesn't expand on any of it. The voice acting is pretty terrible and NPC interaction felt very mechanical. Myst had the right idea in keeping NPC interactions to a bare minimum, the technology simply wasn't there to be able to do anything with it, but this game was released ELEVEN years after and, while Myst felt like it was a decade ahead of its time, Aura feels like it was released a decade too late.  I was only able to get through to just past the statue scene seen in the sample screenshots above before I got bored. So perhaps it gets better after that, but I doubt it. There is a sequel, and even a third one on its way, so clearly some people like it.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because it was cheap and the trailer features a great landscape of some alien like worlds. The first thing I noticed is the graphics are not even close to the trailer. Reminds me of those games in the old days on 320x240 (with interlacing?). Point and click are not really my thing, but it's really hard to navigate around because the exit points are sometimes in inlogical places. The voices of the characters sound to be recorded by a cheap microphone (with some cracking noises). The game crashes when you click multiple times too fast or plug in your headphones. The game has no autosave, so be sure to save after solving every puzzle. In the beginning puzzles didn't make any sense so I had to cheat to find the solution. There are some great puzzles in the game, but I could not solve some on my own.  Graphics: Very bad Music: bad Puzzles: Some good ones  For the average gamer I do not recommend this game. Unless you are very patient, a good puzzle solver or really looking into the story of this game you might want to check it out (I'm only interested in the good puzzles and storyline).",

            "review_text": "+ The game looks great with nice models and graphic from videos etc, but that's it. - The game does not support 1920x1080 resolution or wide screen ratio and no windowed mode is available so it is stretched. - As the picture is stretched the control is much harder (With deformed perspective puzzle with forks is just impossible). - The controls do suck a big time. Depite the game looks 3D there are rather small clickable areas where you can move to next point without any transition animation (There is one but that one has nauseating way of movement). Imagine google photo sphere where you can move to other spheres by clicking in some places. - Active areas are small and there is no hint how to find them and the work only from specific points despite being in reach. - Most of the time you are lost what to do, puzzles often do not make any sense. - NPCs does not react to you at all when not in proper part of the quest. - NPCs might stop interaction in the middle of the quest without any hint if you did not do things in the order that developers intended. - No feedback / dialog with NPCs when quest is done. - Look from farther distance shows puzzle in different state than it is from close. - The location and use of frickin' leaf.  - The faces are ugly.  Would NOT recommend if you do not like playing step-by-step using walkthrough.  What should have been done differently to make the game not suck so hard: - More journal records with current goals described. - Arrows/markers on the screen showing transition areas. - Animated transition between screens. - Hint key that will highlight active items/areas on the screen. - Better (idle / quest end) dialogues with NPCs. - Windowed mode.  If you want great old adventure, try Atlantis instead.",

Unfortunaly the game was made in 2004, and it's currently 2015.   If you are the kind of person that still plays Myst constantly and seriously cannot find another Myst type game. Then go ahead and get this game.  Everyone else, I would recommend skipping this one.",
