            "review_text": "This is a fascinating puzzle game that is partially undermined by a middling user interface and missing feature.  The concept is creative - paint blocks to anchor houses and keep them from falling out of the sky. There are different blocks with different abilities (red ones float, green ones are bendy, etc.), and you have a limited amount of each color. The puzzles start out fairly easy, but quickly become mind-bending. I was able to solve all but one on my own; unfortunately I'm not seeing a guide to get me past that one, although it's thankfully a bonus.  The game is strong, but it could be better with one thing: the ability to step back to just before you tested your solution so you don't have to redo every puzzle from scratch every attempt. That probably added an hour to the 5 hours it took me to finish. Without that frustration, the ability to experiment more freely would greatly improve the game. The ambiance and story are cute, the puzzles creative and always providing new twists. If it were just a little more friendly to the player, it would be perfect, instead of just very good. (also, the physics of the drop seem to be a little random; sometimes doing the exact same thing twice would have completely different results. A little annoying, but not too bad).",

Some levels are difficult, some are tedious but all of them are logical, just be calm and think outside of the blocks. No pun intended ;) 100% worth the money!!",

The later levels can get a bit annoying as they require trail and error to solve and every time you try it makes you start the level over again even though you'd only want to change one or two things.  Over all the game is fairly easy so making you redo whole levels isn't a huge issue but one I certainly hope they fix if they ever make another game like this.",
