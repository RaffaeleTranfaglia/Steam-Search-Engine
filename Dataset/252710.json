            "review_text": "Note on my playtime: I keep the original version of this around at all times and have completed it over a dozen times over the years. I got this thinking it would be the same and I was sorely mistaken.   Compare starting a new game in this to starting a new game in the original. Within 10sec of you getting in control you'll see how horrible this version is. Just find and play the original. There are no improvements to be had here and this version is a dog's breakfast of Facebook generation pop-up trash. This is one of my favourite games of all time. The -original- is a masterpiece and I -would- recommend everyone play that instead of this weaksauce, tooltip-filled ambiance-murdering piece of garbage.  The original game had one of the simplest, most intuitive interfaces imaginable and it went hand it hand with a deeply immersive atmosphere and memorable story. How does the 'Gold Edition' improve on this? Apparently by filling all four corners of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen with bs tooltips, unwanted hints, permanent options/toggle buttons etc etc to the point that they may as well throw an ad banner on there. Then there's the constant bloody pop-ups and the stupid chapter intros. They've completely ruined the game. If you've played the original, this version is not playable.  As far as the 'improved visuals' go, there are none to be had. Seems they've just taken the original work and stretched it. Framerate is noticeably lower than the original during FMVs. They've cut out sections of the FMVs as well for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason whatsoever.   Just please, for the love of god, don't financially support this sort of dumbed-down ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of gameplay. This is an atrocity against the original masterpiece. Needs moar refund button.",

On this 'gold' edition they completely ♥♥♥♥ed up the interface and they tried to dumb it down to a level that makes me twitch. Unsuccessfully - this will never ever be a game for casual gamers or the 'hey I feel like trying a point &amp; click game' kinda guy, no matter how much they destroy the game's atmosphere with their stupid tutorials, pop ups and help icons.  In summary:  I 100% RECOMMEND THIS EPIC AWESOME ONE-OF-A-KIND GAME. Plus 1%.  I 0% RECOMMEND THIS RIDICULOUS GOLD EDITION. Don't support their views that they can make more money by ruining something that was never broken in the first place. You don't need the stupid achievements, you need to experience this amazing gaming and cinematic experience the way it was meant to be experienced!  You will fall in love with it.  - An old school nerd.",

Great characters, great art (so what if it's a bit pixelated) and music along with a gripping story and a true detective-style gameplay all come together beautifully, highly recommended!",

            "review_text": "**minor spoilers for the beginning of the game ** This game has a lot of positive reviews, and I must admit there are some interesting and unique aspects to it, but I cannot recommend it unless you get it extremely on sale and are very curious. This is supposed to be a point and click adventure game where you are tasked to solve a mystery, but what I found while playing it was that you wandered around trying to find things to click on while hoping that said things didn’t suddenly and inexplicably end the game for you. This happens a lot. “Oh, that’s the E-break to stop the train? Guess I should have left that alone, but it was so shiny and clickable!” The animation style is unique and it might appeal to some people. It looks old-fashioned, and since the game is set on the Orient Express, that’s probably on purpose. The gameplay consists of wandering around the same five or six locations while trying to “catch” people in conversation to further the plot, or sometimes people simply show up and talk to you. Often times I felt like I performed an action and had no idea why until the game explained it to me. For example, very early on in the game you come across a dead body. You have no idea who it is but the only thing you seem to be able to do with it is throw it out the window. If you do nothing, the game ends on your failure to act so I threw the body out the window and wondered what the heck was going on. Later on, the game finally told me who that was and why I threw him. I don’t feel like I’m actively solving a mystery when the game has to explain to me why and what I did after I already did it.  As I said, some people might enjoy this game. It’s a bit of a curiosity and it’s not a bad game per-say, but I could not enjoy it because I didn’t feel like I was solving a murder mystery (especially when I threw the body out the window).  ",

            "review_text": "The Last Express is one of the great swan songs of adventure games in the late 1990s when the genre was facing decline due to the rise of online gaming and other genres rising in popularity. Created by Jordan Mechner, of Prince of Persia and Karateka fame, The Last Express is set in 1914, during the final journey of the cross-continental Orient Express. The player is Robert Cath, an American doctor and occultist, who hitches an incognito ride in the Express alongside his friend Tyler Whitney. However, when you find friend murdered, you impersonate him try to survive the journey while playing all ends towards the middle to solve the mystery.  The game is reminiscent in its mechanics to Myst, in the sense that the player moves around scene-by-scene, navigating via mouse-over arrows. However, one hallmark of the Last Express is that it   is   real-time. The time actually passes in the game whether you act or not. Therefore, if there's something you're suppose to do but don't, you'll see the consequences. This feature keeps the player constantly on her/his toes, prompting you to explore, eavesdrop, examine.  Graphics consist of real-life photography, rotoscoped in the style of Art Nouveau. Aside from a few occasions of fluid action, the game plays at visible framerate. The surroundings are from an actual Orient Express train car as well, lending an air of authenticity.   Voice-acting and music score is quite astounding. Having played the game when it was first lauched in 1997, I've noticed in a recent playthrough how much I could still remember from the dialogues after more than 15 years.   The plot of the game, in my opinion, still remains one of the best even when compared with the storytelling benchmark set by developers like Telltale. The year is 1914 and the entire Europe is an armed camp waiting for spark. The train is full of the European high society of the time, which were after all whom the Orient Express caters to. Russian aristocrats, French socialites, a German businessman, an Austrian artist, as well as Serbian soldiers present a microcosm of the European society across various nations and classes therein. The player should tread between all these potentially dangerous people to reach Constantinople as well as to uncover the murderer of his friend. Dialogues are well-written, plot is well-developed and well-acted. Despite the multitude of characters from many countries of the period, the game doesn't resort to clichés in their representation and portrays them in fleshed-out, developed fashion.  The game gives you copious amount spare time between mandatory actions (or evasions) so you may employ these moments to explore the train through subtle means of breaking and entering, which allows you to see the sheer amount of detail invested in even the peripheral characters. Each compartment is filled with items pertaining to its occupants' private and/or public life, whether love letters or indicators of their intents. Even a chance passing past a compartment may turn up a chit-chat amongst the passengers.  The Last Express, despite 18 years past its making, is still one of the best adventure games ever made, combining fantastic writing with staggeringly beautiful art direction and sound.  ",
