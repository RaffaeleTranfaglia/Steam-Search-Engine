The mechanics (what's most of it from the previous patch that I've known, where units can level up,) changed dramatically. I don't blame the developers for their sudden change seeing as how most players take advantage of it and forcing other players to get a tie by running away.  It is a great game as it is with hardcore tactics to keep in mind if you really want to win a match; but as it is still in Beta and have no clue of the dev's goals or the game's heading whatsoever, the game can be a bit quirky.",

Currently there are only three armies to pick from, and limited maps, they plan to add more of both. Its promising but i dont see many people sticking aorund long term currently. When you have time play it for a while so you know if you are interested in it down the road when it gets more fleshed out.  Its also not very optimized, and seems to run about the same on a wide variety of machines (badly). Unfortunately due to the track record of the developers its probably going to stay that way. That said high frame rates are not required in a turn based game. ",

If you are a fan of the Tabletop you will very likely enjoy this game, though right now there are only three factions available at the moment, which are: The Wolfen, The Undead and the Lions of Alahan. It is free to play and everything that I have seen can be bought with the games currency so no pay to win. I sincerely hope the game will be expanded which is likely dependent on its success. So join and experience the world of Aarklash with your Mercenary Warband!",

Gameplay is fast (normal fight takes around 10-15 minutes), everything is simple and battles are fun. Balance is close enough to have fun games and I've not yet encountered an opponent I stood no chance of winning.  What makes the game good, is that almost every time you lose, you can point down the exact errors you did during the game. Game certainly is not difficult, but requires some thinking to win fights: Most obivious thing is often not the best thing to do. Thinking actually goes much deeper than it looks like on first glance. Good balance between skill and luck.  A strong recommendation for anyone looking forward to lightweight turn based tactics.",

It was the fact that I got parried or dodged. Then took massive damage from my opponents time and time again. I actualy laughed out loud so hard the whole house heard me and thought I was watching OJ running from the cops on youtube. And in losing so badly.. I got injuries. which to most dont seem too bad. but mine wanted me to have 9 cards to remove them? holy crap.. that's a lot of in game money for a beginner. So I deleted my company and made a new one... same thing kept happening. To the point where I'm scared to even buy a new unit. He'll just get injured and I'll have to get rid of him. So I'm stuck playing with the same starter army and no upgrades in sight. I think the game just hates me. If you're a strategy expert.. this might be for you and it might be great for you since it's such a pain. But if you're not a total copmlete badass.. you'll need real money to make it anywhere sadly. Which is why I have to give a thumbs down. I really wanted to like this game because there's not many out there like it. :(",

What has a pretty simple layout and dynamics, has become far more tactical than I thought it would. If you enjoy small group tactics and PVP, you will dig this game. Beware, it is in beta, so there are still some glitches.  It does seem viable as free to play atm. You should be able to cover the cost of injuries with the money you make during matches. So you can go pretty hard in PVP.",
