            "review_text": "Making this review for those concerned by Angry Joe's misinformed remark that  Dirty Bomb  is pay-to-win:  it is NOT .  1.  Angry Joe's Argument #1 : You need a get a high-end loadout card to do good.  Counterpoint : The cards you get aren't game breaking at all. They simply offer sidegrades to the default weapons. I've never lost a gunfight because the other person had a better card than my lead (lowest grade) Skyhammer card!  2.  Angry Joe's Argument #2 : To get the best cards, you need to spend $55.  Counterpoint : I'm just gonna quote  TotalBiscuit 's counterargument: 'You can buy any loadout [card] in the game for ingame credits no problem.' Not to mention Angry Joe's friend who was present during the video told him not to spend the $55. It was entirely unnecessary. The game never pressures you to spend a dime. The only way I'd feel pressured to spend real money is if they put in a skin that gives the overly masculine Skyhammer a super cute pink ballerina outfit (please!).   3.  Angry Joe's Argument #3 : To get the best cards, if you don't want to spend $55, you have to grind for hours to get enough to buy the card.  Counterpoint : Again, quoting TotalBiscuit: 'Grind? You play the game, thats the point of games right, to play them? Progression is something that happens as you play, its not the goal, the goal is to win.'  4.  Angry Joe's Argument #4 : The card system is based on RNG and it's a terrible system.  Counterpoint : So basically the card system is that you get cards from cases (that you get from winning games or using 2 games worth of in game currency to buy -- and no, they don't require $2.49 to open like CS:GO cases! &lt;3) that determines your mercenaries' weapons, camo outfit, and perks. The card you get is completely random, and the weapons are usually just preference since they're all on par with the default weapons. Angry Joe's anger stemmed from the fact that he opened a ton of these cases and got, in his mind, horrible cards. I personally think it's a great thing that someone can put $55 into this game and NOT get the most perfect card ever (even though there isn't 'best' card for any merc).  I hope I could clear things up for you Angry Joe fans who are looking to get into Dirty Bomb.",

My point is the game is playable for free to plays. My only problem with the game is the small player base, but give it time and ,hopefully, it will get better.",

            "review_text": "This is a free to play, (pay to progress - but only to speed up progress) fast paced and highly competitive first person shooter. Dirty Bomb features mercenaries tasked with retrieving or destroying objectives in return for credits in a London devastated by a - you guessed it - dirty bomb. There are currently five maps in rotation with several more in development &amp; testing, but they all provide a fairly balanced and fun layout to play with, and the new maps look to be getting even larger - which will be good hopefully!  There are three gamemodes currently; Stopwatch, Objective and the newly added / still in testing Execution game mode - Stopwatch revolves around both teams trying to complete the objectives for the chosen map faster than their opponent, after which they switch sides (attackers to defenders) and the winner is decided on the faster team.   Objective mode is simply stopwatch without the team switch, and as such one team defends the objective, the other attacks it until time runs out or all objectives are complete.  Execution mode is relatively new, and consists of 10 rounds where the teams attempt to win more rounds than the other, by playing the objective or killing all the enemies on the map. This mode has the added rule that when you die, and are 'gibbed' (stabbed so that a medic cannot revive you), you will need to wait til the next round begins to continue playing. Medics can revive provided you are not executed, alá the game mode title.  Enough about the modes, you probably understand the only thing you need to: objective - uhb-jek-tiv, play that and you win. Simple!   Onto the characters, or mercs. There are currently 14 mercs available for play, with the newest being Phantom - a stealthy melee oriented class who has caused some controversy as to what the game is aiming for. The mercs each have a subcategory which are as follows:  - [Fire] Support classes:   * Arty, whom can call down artillery with his targeting designator from afar and provide his team with ammo via ammo packs.   * Kira, who loves to light up the sky with her orbital laser strike, which she can guide around using the laser tool to cause maximum precision chaos from safety. She also deploys ammo stations to keep teammates well stocked throughout the fight.  * Skyhammer, one of the free mercs you get right off the bat, who has the ability to throw an airstrike marker to gib and demolish his foes, and also damage certain objectives such as generators and the EV when defending (Kira and Arty can also damage these objectives). Skyhammer will oft throw ammo packs like his fellow support class Arty.  - Recon classes:  * Vassili, the sniper-est sniper there ever was, Vassili was the first of the recon classes added to open play, and can be devastating to enemy pushes if he can aim and position well. His heartbeat sensor can be vital to knowing enemy movements.  * Phantom, the all-American hero in his own mind, this backstabber is aimed at executing medics and other squishy vital classes. His ability is a cloak that makes him fairly invisible. The cloak can be removed with Vassili's heartbeat sensor if the two come in close proximity.   - Medic classes:  * Aura, the shotgun wielding, heal station hero, who keeps the team healed and happy, alive, not dead. Her main ability is a healing station she can place nigh almost anywhere on the map which heals in a small radius, and can almost outheal all damage sources if placed right. She can also revive fallen teammates with the defib paddles. Aura, along with Skyhammer is one of the mercs you get for free!  * Sawbonez, the ex-military CQC SMG-specialist who throws large healing packs, potent enough to bring even the most deathly ill back to the land of the living, and doing it with style. Sawbonez - with a Z! - also holds the key to close range life and death with his defib paddles.  * Sparks, the super fast gal with a hundred names, and a wonderful piece of reviving and sniping technology. Sparks can reanimate people from afar with her REVIVR gun, which when charged is equally as good at reviving teammates as it is at killing enemies. Sparks has far less potent healing packs in contrast to Sawbonez, but they are no less helpful in a pinch.  - Engineer classes:   * Proxy, the savvy and snappy Brit who loves to sap the lives of her foes via proximity mines strewn across the map, Proxy is also an objective specialist who has a 50% boost to completing objectives (such as repairing generators).  The objective specialist is present on all engineer classes.   * Fletcher, who is the best. That's why he costs more! No but seriously, Fletcher is an engineer with an explosive surprise: sticky bombs! Create traps alá Proxy style, cover objectives or doorways that are important, or else use them as renewable grenades!  * Bushwacker, the man with the extra gun. Bushwacker comes equipped with a turret buddy who can be placed almost anywhere needed, but for best results, try placing them on flank routes or behind where you will be fighting, and get a nice crossfire going. The turret is fairly weak healthwise, but can pack a good punch with its firepower if placed right.  - Assault classes:  * Nader, the business lawyer turned merc who has a renewable (don't ask me how) grenade launcher which can spit little eggs of death! Or was that dess? I'm not bilingual I'm afraid. Nader can shut down areas of defense and offense if her nades are utilised correctly, and even if she dies, she comes back post mortem with an explosive surprise called matyrdom, where she detontates herself and any nearby enemies!  * Fragger, the traffic cop, uh no, sorry; the man with the second biggest gun! His parking tickets - no wrong again! His frag grenades will cause chaos and death if cooked for long enough, and his LMG does nothing to ease the enemy's pain (except perhaps a quick death?). Many soon find out why Fragger is called what he is.  * Rhino, now for the man with the biggest gun, Rhino is a monster of a man who can hold entire areas if paired with a medic such as Aura with his minigun, which doesn't run dry on ammo, and instead can overheat quickly if used wrongly. Rhino is the merc with the most health, and as such, should not be taken lightly.   Didn't realise how much I had written up until now, so TL;DR if you want it!  TL;DR: Dirty Bomb is a crazy fun F2P FPS, which has an alright business model where you can pay to progress faster (unlock characters quicker) and it provides a decently balanced game for the most part, where each character feels powerful, and matches that are all objective focused feel tense right down to the last second. Also, to mention one last thing - there is a certain movement to the game where walljumping is possible, which adds a layer or two to fighting. Thought it was worth a mention.  Great game, hope it does well in the future!   EDIT: Changed phantom's description due to patch fixes.",

Bringing up this new class FPS while still in closed beta for a long time, these guys are showing they are not joking around. And they made progress.  Some might spill their coffee while reading this last bit, but lets be honest... At a certain point, Splash Damage went downhill, leaving most of the servers empty. And now:  1) They fixed some overpowered characters 2) Edited maps, making them more balanced 3) 'sided' with Steam 4) 201% of the servers filled with players who long wait for this game's release.  Next step shall be fixing the current amount of bugs and glitches this game is cursed with. And most probably lead a large competitive side of the game like it's ancestor. Before the product release, no one was allowed to livestream the game, that also changed now. I know quite a couple of Twitch streamers who would love to stream this game.  Meanwhile, they played smart and opened the competitive scenario. They also brought the concept of cases and keys in order to unlock playable characters.  There are a few things that still need to change, including some overpowered characters.",

You have to grind to afford new champs (mercs), some mercs (nader) are very unbalanced. The game is absolutely full of SCRUB kids that have to cheat to win and along with that is plenty of spawn camping. Most of the time u have to unload a full clip into some ones chest/head for a kill, which is almost impossible since a cheater will kill you with a single across the map head shot. Respawn timers are long, you can be revived instantly but that assumes your teamates know wtf they are doing or you have a support on the team. Even if you are revived you are almost instanly killed as soon as you get up. Also, most maps seem unbalanced and favor the defenders. I'd rate it a 2.5 out of 5. If they did something about the cheaters id give it a 5.",

Main Issues I have with the game are the F2P model, super expensive to purchase one base merc, from 6 to 10 bucks. Secondly, the map flow is HORRIFIC, there are maps that cater to defense and some that cater to attack, like attacking on Trainyard, UGH, it consists of a Sniper in the back of the second attack point or someone on turret, and people dropping skyhammers every 5 seconds. The maps just need redesigning to stop battles from easily becoming stalemates to starve outs. Third, granted its fresh and is always changing, but the balancing seems to not be prioirty. They would rather release no characters than fix the ones they have, like Buchwacker and Rhino are Broken AF, and like Arty is very underwhelming (mainly due to semi auto being way underpowered vs auto). I can't recommend the game in its current state, it needs lots of love to its Balance, Map Balance and Design, Business Model and other small things propel it into the Top F2P games on steam.",

            "review_text": "This one is not even a close call; As the first person shooter market is stalled for years by now, I would say we were in dire need for a new and refreshing game to the genre. Dirty Bomb is a class, team based, objective focus FPS that brings a mash up of features and mechanics that just work well together, allow me to explain: - The maps are big, multiple staged, and overall well design and well balanced, offering inumerous ways to place with one, providing a different game everytime you take your Mercs into one. -The movement system is fluid and responsive, with each Merc moving differently from one another, and the wall jump mechanic is the the icing on the cake: so simple to use, really hard to master, a stapple that makes the really great players stand out from the best. -The guns and the gunplay are really satisfying, as they not only sound but also and look powerfull. The fact that you can't oneshot an enemy with most weapons lays a foundation to some quick, nerve racking firefights, making each kill a really satisfying to pull of. -The classes appear to be pretty balanced, each one of them occupying a unique place and, above all, they all fit usefull purpose inside the game. Not surprising since they all tend to fit the overall classic FPS archtypes of classes. -The business model is fair and the in-game rewards such as cases and in-game currency come at a really steady and generous pace, with quests refreshing really often, offering players a great incentive to keep on playing.  But the game is not without it's flaws, I shall explain those too: -The weapon variety could be way larger and the futuristing setting can lead to some creative liberty while designing them, so a little more inovation in this field could improve the game much, much more. -The sound design, while good, could use some improvement too. As some weapons clearly sound powerfull, others sound weak and tend to lack that meaty, satisfying *THUMP* that firing a weapon should always carry.  One can't help but grade Dirty Bomb as a really great, innovative and above all, a really, really fun First Person Shooter that bring a breath of fresh air to a genre that clearly needs it. I can't stop recommend it enough. Play it! Get Dirty! And remember, Don't be a D*ck!",

The characters arent balanced at all, the game has a brutal paywall, and an evil RNG system.  The Gameplay:  This is the only part of the game that is currently decent, and may be enough for some people to continue playing this game. The mechanics are like a combination of Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty. There are several different classes which all have special abilities such as calling in airstrikes, reviving teammates, and throwing grenades.   The movement is very fast, there is some level of parkour, and this game could definitely become competitive at some point. Using hipfire rather than aiming down sights is generally more effective.   The teamwork area of this game is currently entirely lacking. Though that cant be fixed, certain mechanics can reinforce it a bit more.   Character Balance:  There is no real change in playstyle from character to character.. Which is to say that it is near meaningless to play one class over another, and thats not balance, thats lack of development. The new Phantom character is ridiculously overpowered, and can easily kill someone without them having any chance to retaliate, even from directly in front of them, as has happened to me.   The Paywall:   This game screams for you to waste your money. To get new characters you need to save up from 30-50 thousand credits, and then you have to get a card to use him anyway which will be a minimum of 1000 credits, if you happen to get him in the first spin, which is unlikely considering the wealth of hardly different characters.   Of course, you can directly buy these characters for 7-10 dollars, which is ridiculously expensive for a single character, and even then you still need another card as a loadout to use the character.   And of course, there is a way to double the amount of credits you earn, which costs even more money. The average game after daily bonuses will give you around 600 on a win and 180 on a loss, from my experience.   And then the RNG:  This. Is the worst thing that exists in any game. This is how you get loadout cards for your characters, and the odds are stupidly low to obtain anything worthwhile. So steep that you have an 85% chance to get the lowest tier card! But of course this is solved by selling 'elite cases' which guarantee you a higher tier card.   All these systems combine to make an extremely Pay to Win game which, though the gameplay can be enjoyable, is thoroughly flawed.  And if you think its not pay to win, just remember that they made it such a grind so that you would be pressured to pay. Why else?   Give it a try, dont waste your money.",

Big thumbs down, not really pay to win, but you can sort of see it going that way in the near future. It quickly sours into a poor experience.",

The game has come a long way from the first time I played it over a year ago (I think it was closer to two years, as I believe I played it to take a break from Titanfall.).  The gunplay is satisfying, and fun. The sounds for the most part feel substantial and the movement feels fluid.  The graphics are good enough, and the characters are all unique enough that each person can find someone that they like.  The microtransactions do not feel required at all. That being said this review is written mere hours away from my plan to purchase the starter DLC on steam. I though tI was enjoying this game enough to support the developers.  But I can't.  Installation was simple, but launching the game itself seemed to be problematic. The Anti-cheat software used by Nexon told me I had unapproved software on my computer. I turned everything I have off. Leaving only Mumble, Steam, and Dirty Bomb running. Still flagged as having unapproved software. I decided to update my catalyst labs software for my GPU, still flagged. I next tried to update my razer and logitech software.   SUCCESS!  I get to play. Queue montage of me sucking at Dirty Bomb for the next day.  Today I finish a match and as soon as I type GG, I get a plain grey screen with the notice that my account has been banned for two day for using unapproved software.  Seriously.  More google searches will show that the Anti-cheat being used in this game constantly gives false positives, and there is even a thread on Nexon's forums that asks you to submit a list of software that causes the false positives.  For me this is a deal breaker, I love this game, but the Anti-cheat is enough to keep me away, and encourage no one else to play it either. If you give it a try, do try to avoid getting attached to it. I would play for a week or two before spending any money to make sure that you are not flagged falsely.",

Alot of people told me to play this. I am a big FPS fan. I love games like 'Counter Strike', 'Insurgency', and 'TF2'. This is basically TF2/COD/Battlefield/CS. It isn't anything brand new or genre defining, however the combat is tight and rewards accuracy. Also, in it's current state you need to pay absolutely nothing to progress in game. I have only played 8 hours (at the time of this review) and I have 2 mercs unlocked with in game XP. There are three free mercs on rotation every two weeks. The system of the market is really strange. There are loadout 'cards' you get for each class you unlock with unique passive abilities. There is more to it than that, but it's a little confusing. All in all it's a great title made by 'Splash Damage' veterans of the classic 'Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory'. I highly recommend you jump in and give it a shot :)  EDIT: I really, really, really, really, really, really, REALLY LOVE this game. However, as it stands having the classes behind pay/grind walls will be egregious and hurt the game in the long run.     This is NOT pay to win. I repeat, NOT pay to win!    If you think it is go play some of the absolutely atrocious f2p games out there. However, it just isn't inviting to a new player when you can only choose from 3 free classes a week. I think they should have all classes be free, there is enough incentive already to buy loadouts and skins. What sucks is 'Nexon' (I can only assume it is them in charge of the business model) is treating this like every other crappy f2p game they made a few bucks off of and drove into the ground. This isn't another 'TF2 Clone' (in alot of ways it is BETTER and that's coming from a BIG TF2 fan). They need to compete with upcoming games like 'Overwatch' and 'Battleborne'. The game is fantastic but I fear for its future. I want this game to succeed so badly, so I bought some mercs to support the developers but they are way too expensive now (10 bucks a pop). The combat, slight freerunning ability, and overall movement are just so fluid and tight it's remarkable. This CAN be the next big competitive game. I really hope when it releases out of beta they take these words into account. 'Splash Damage' are some of the best FPS devs out there, I want to see them hit it big again :)",

The game 'tries' to open then closes.  The team balancing / matchmaking is super unfair.

The loadout / upgrade system is quite annoying to consume and decide what to do with, from a user experience standpoint I don't understand why we need class 'cards' or whatever they are when really what we're focused on is the different skills and how good they are. I seriously think this is holding people back from investing in the game. They need to reorganize the ability upgrades and weapons to be a lot clearer / straight forward for the users.

I'm sick of slow shooters and Dirty Bomb just feels great. Movement speed is nice, damage is high but not CSGO / CoD high, there's wall jumping (albeit not extremely useful)  This game's gunplay is right on point. Meaty explosions, nice powerful sounding weapons... the feedback is excellent. Splash Damage, as usual, delivers strong shooty bits.  The netcode is good. Anything below 120 feels very playable without extremely annoying hitbox problems. I've played many FPS's that were ruined in part by poor netcode. This isn't one of them.  This game is updated frequently and developers communicate frequently with the playerbase. Problems aside, they atleast listen and update us frequently on changes.  Stuff that needs work:  Firstly, you don't get all the mercs in one go. You can't even pay for a total merc unlock in any reasonable $ amount. Mercs are 30k to 50k, and be prepared to grind weeks out just to get a single merc unless you can play several hours every day. The prices need a SERIOUS adjustment. Cutting credit costs in half would do wonders.  Next, the microtransactions are a waste. Credit boosters do not mathematically make any sense. 30k mercs cost $7, while 50k mercs cost $10. The packages you can buy also are poorly thought out, as if you already have mercs in any of the packages you actually lose out on value. Example: the starter pack has Vasilli and Sawbonez in it. I have already unlocked both of these mercs, so if I buy the starter pack, I lose out on a hefty amount of value. At this point, I have atleast one merc in every single bundle - basically, I lose out no matter what bundle I'd like which ensures that there's no way I'll pay for it. You can also buy elite cases with real money which is a waste because they are overpriced and there's no garauntee you'll even get something worthwhile.  NEEDS MORE MAPS!  Finally, due to this game's freegame nature - cheating is absolutely rampant. Check the Steam forums / nexon forums to see why. Since this isn't a paid game, cheaters do not worry about being banned as they just re-register a new account. The game's anticheat is XIGN which is infamous at slow updates. There is also no way of reporting many cheaters who use unknown characters.  In it's present state, I'll give it a 6/10. I'll address this later as more classes, balance, and maps are added. But, as it is in Beta and is Free-To-Play, I recommend it for all you FPS fans.",

It is fun to play with friends because you can work together and have a great time. The great part about this game is you do not have to spend a dime on it. It is better to spend money to achieve better loadouts, but in all the game provides you with cases that can give you every rarity. The chances of getting a good loadout in those cases are slim to none, but it is there to provide a free to play experience. I see a lot of people complaining about how hard it is to get credits, now the reason for that I believe is: if they gave you a lot of credits you would be able to buy all mercs fast and there would be no point to grinding. I would definitely pay for the starter pack to help out the developers because they deserve it, and I believe this game will go far.

Now Brink was a little bit of a broken, messy disaster when it first came out. It didn’t help itself by immediately calling itself a rival to Team Fortress 2, which went as well as the new weedy kid at school challenging the biggest guy in the playground to a fight, in a misguided attempt to assert his dominance. Splash Damage seem to have learned from their past mistakes and have worked to make Dirty Bomb a pretty fun game.  As stated before, Dirty Bomb splits players up into two teams. One team defends the objectives, the other team has to attack the objectives. These can range from blowing up a generator to blowing up a wall, blowing up a set of controls, or blowing up an entire building. In fact, there isn’t much variety there. Whether it’s the first, second or sometimes third objective, players will be detonating something. The most fun objective to attack and defend are the EV trucks. Attackers must escort it by walking alongside or mounting the turret while defenders need to disable it. Once it’s disabled, the defenders need to keep it disabled while attackers have to repair it. It’s strangely satisfying to call in a tactical nuke to blow the repairers away, especially with the fact that they get a warning before the explosion.

Dirty Bomb is a solid F2P shooter (with no pay-to-win features) that, although in beta, shows much promise when it comes out as a game. Most of the complaints I see have to do with balancing, anti-hack, and the browser history EULA.  As for balancing, the game is relatively balanced. Of course, with the release of a new the character Phantom everyone (rightfully) got uptight, but he recieved a nerf only weeks after his release. This game is still in beta, and with the current near-optimal balance, there is no reason to down-vote this game based primarily off of that. Any strat can be countered with another, and all it takes it good teamwork.  Regarding hackers, I have played this game for 20+ hours, and I have only come across one aimbotting sniper in that period of time. Perhaps I haven't played long enough, but I have failed to see hackers throughout my gaming time here. I have no issues with this and cannot say that the anti-hack system is not working.  Now, as for the EULA, that's a matter I am actually upset with. Like other reviewers said, it is infringing on you and isn't really effective. I guess it stops you from searching 'Dirty Bomb hacks', but that is pretty damn stupid because I doubt it is that effective. Be aware that this is a feature that you will have to agree if you install DB.  Otherwise, this game is very much enjoyable. As I said above, it has zero P2W features in it and is very fun to play, especially with good communication. Developers are constantly adding updates and hotfixes and are actually listening to player feedback. Get it if you dig a solid shooter.  8/10",

Should say I'm only playing it because Overwatch beta is down and TF2 has finally reached a state where I can't get a good framerate regardless of config tweaks, but I really hope it sticks around. It's like a fun version of CS. Map knowledge and aim are the main skills but the fast movement, jumping around and class switching add a lot of depth, and mean someone like me with not good aim can feel like a beast (for a little while).  I heard the competitive scene has died already because the game went pay-to-win, which is a real shame. They should do everything they can to fix that, because this really is a much better game than CS and deserves to be played.",

            "review_text": "Being Tormented by the Brink game they made earlier, and getting sceptical by NEXON backing them up, I really had my doubts about this game. But to be honest, this game is really fun, it's fast paced, Teamwork oriented, and salty players. A typical combo in the F2P world.   What i dont seem to have an issue with (which seems like alot of people complaining about, even Angry Joe) is the business model, From what I have seen past the 24 hours i've played, I fail to see where the 'P2W' comes in, all the mercs can be bought by ingame money, where you can easily get enough of when you pay attention to the missions (daily quests if you want to call it that) wich restarts after 3-2 hours after you've finish them. The missions give you credits varying from 500 to 2000 (correct me if i'm wrong, but the rewards are around that area). So the money isnt really the problem, and if you buy a merc, you're supposed to play that merc for a while.  Anyways. You can buy cases aswell as the merc, and in these cases are 'loadouts cards'.  What? you're not allowed to make your own personal loadout to the core? Well... no, not as in Call of duty or Battlefield, but it's not that far off. Different mercs use different weapons, from Sniper rifles to Shotguns.  But here comes the Pros and cons.  Pros: -Fast paced (if you enjoy face paced FPS, you'll love this) -Objective focused (who cares about K/D when you lose all the matches?) -Rotation on mercs every now and then (I'll be honest, i dont know when they rotate, but they do) -Different mercs for different playstyles (this is what i really love about this game, want to defend with a minigun? rhino, want to just be a boring sod and snipe? sure, go ahead. etc) -Really good map designs, Cant wait for more! -Teamwork requierd. -'loot drop' (cases drop every now and then when you're done with a match.) -Salty players (Who doesn't love a salty player going loco on you because he's bad and dont know how to counter your merc?)  Cons: -Nexon, I mean... we've all seen it, I just dont want the bad things happen to this game. -massively repetetive because of lack of more maps (there are currently 5 maps, I know I know, there will be more) -not a real anti-cheat system atm (but they will get there! hopefully VAC will be enabeled) -no real loadout (I am a man who loves to fix my build exactly how I want it, not by grabbing cards) -Grind and grind (for me, this is not an issue, the 'grinding' here is fun, you just need to play!) -Salty players (When the saltyness becomes almost too horrible, they wont shut up, they try to stalk you etc.)  All in all, this is one of the best F2P FPS (7/10) I've played in a while, I do reccomend to try it, but honestly; dont be arsed buying the starter pack. it's not really that good, it is as it says, a starter pack, you wont get anything special compared to others. AGAIN! the only Payment model they have for now is the 'skip-grinding-like-hell-because-you-want-that-merc'. Just like the model Leauge of Legends does, if you dont want to grind: Skip it with Real money.   ",

This is a evolution of that with elements that force you to play as a team.   I know its beta, but based on what I have played the game is seriously unbalanced.  Most people are playing the the fast mobile classes of Merc, bouncing round with shotties or high rate firing SMGs. Makes any other class kind of pointless at the moment. You really need to balance the quick moving, bunny hopping shotgun classes as they make a mockery of the game if you try to play any other class. Their health, agility and weapon mean you can empy a clip into them and they just bounce right up to you still with 50% health.  Guns are mostly peashooters take way too many bullets for a kill, and as there hardly any recoil to speak of iron sight aiming is a total handicap. You can get a guy down to 10% health after 1 whole mag of an SMG, yet a boucing shotgun player will nail you super quick.   As most, if not all combat is close quarters there is no role for the slower Mercs.  Card system is abysmal, and the selection of guns you get is tiny and you get what card gives you. Although you can swap cards (laodout), you can only do this between games in lobby, not in game.  Here in lies the clue that this will totally become pay to win, better card cost more money and take forever to earn in game, plus the fact that Nexon have a history of pay to win games.  Feels like a game that was going to get dropped as a pay for release, but they decided to squeeze it for some ££$$ instead.",

Now with the new update, you have to make micro transactions to get what you could have gotten with in game credits. The new update has totally devalued the in game currency.  -The maps are okay, the new one, gallery, features many jumps and hallways that lead to different bombs, A or B. With the new map come some new flaws with the map. The only mercs suitable for that map are those with close range weaponry like that of the healers or engineers. Long range weapons are ineffective, unlike the previous 2 maps, market and overground, which promote the use of both styles of play to win. Gallery is too confined. Dirty Bomb was a good game, and a week ago I would have recommended it to any age old CSGO player looking for a new take, but now I see it as a huge waste of time and effort for very little overall in game gain.  If you played the game before the update and got every card cobalt like you wanted, then this doesn't apply to you.

All the characters in the game are balanced, for example you could have a fast character but she will only be able to carry a shotgun and place mines every few seonds or you could have a slow character with an assualt rifle that can call airstrikes, but they can only be used every few minutes. This character named the 'Phantom' has no balance at all. He carries a Katana that downs you in 1 hit (in most cases) and he carries a submachine gun that is very powerful. He also has the ability to become invisible, and although you can still sort of see him, it doesn't matter because he will charge at you at knock you down rendering you helpless. I was in a match where there was two of them on the enemy team, and it took 3 or more team mates to be able to take down one (by the way teams are composed of 8 or less players) while the other 2 were dead. Needless to say noone in our team could get out of or even be able to spawn in our spawn base because the enemy team could just enter very easily and camp.

I guess a lot of people would argue the game is P2W, but the fact is that the default characters and weapons are all really good. Let me put it in a simpler way, the marketing model of this game is like League of Legends. The prices of the characters or the loadout cards doesn’t have that much of impact when you are up against F2Ps. Yes, gold cards are better than bronze cards. But it’s like the lower tier runes in League, it doesn’t have that much of impact while you are in the combat, and as you leveling up you can get it by just playing the game. And just like League, Dirty Bomb has free character rotation, too. So, it’s not like if you don’t pay you get to play the default characters all day until you make enough in-game currency. Maybe there are something that the developer could’ve done better, I mean, technically the game is still in beta. Regardless, I definitely had a lot of fun while playing it.

For example, most of the times if I see someone playing as medic they never really help out the team by reviving unless it's 1 or 2 times. Another problem I have is the majority of teams I'm on never play the objective they just sit and spawn kill or kill instead of taking the time to plant a bomb or deliver something. I know there is a difference between a slayer and a objective player, I'm a slayer myself, but it seems to me like most people care about kills instead of helping deliver an objective or playing the objective in general.

It's a great break from the modern day tactical army FPS and takes a dive into fast paced, hipfire, team strategy shooting. This is basically an upgraded version of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but better. I believe this game has what it takes to be the next big thing if people give it a chance.  The hitboxes, fluidity and balancing of the game feel great. Being in 100 ping servers, my shots go where I put them, the net code feels pretty nice for a free game. You will roll hard if you know what your doing and get rolled hard if not. Most negative reviews of this game are people who can't handle their own or don't know how to team play. You get rewarded well if you play properly with your team mates, and get punished if you try to be a lonewolf.  Based out of my gameplay through the closed beta, I give this game a 9/10 and I feel like the devs will be active in constantly improving this game after the Brink flop. I can't wait to see what this game can bring to the e-sports table.  Pros: -Free -Balanced Classes -Not Pay to win -Dedicated servers -Match Making -Class based game play -Feels / Runs great  Cons: -In this beta you need level 7 to play with your friends -You will lose if you have a bad team. -Loadouts have different affects making some more adventageous than others.",

I was not expecting this game to be so good. Especially considering it's free, and from Nexon.  Although yes, some of the mercs (Dirty Bomb's version of Overwatch's heroes) seem to have better weapons and equipment than others, you can do just fine with the two default classes.  Using the default medic class, considered one of the weakest classes in the game AFAIK, I can get to the top of the scoreboard pretty regularly. What I'm saying is that it all comes down to skill in the end.  Also all of the things that are actually useful i.e mercs and loadout cards, you can buy with either in-game credits or USD. Yes, there's XP/currency boosters you can buy with USD (and only USD), but that's really only useful for if you're a completionist and you want to get every merc in the game (which, again, isn't necessary).  The gunplay itself is very good too. All weapons are accurate when hipfired, the ADS function is only for zoom for if you're trying to shoot at range. And unlike most games, pistols are actually useful.  The game is also very nicely optimized. I'm getting more than 100 FPS on max settings with a GTX 760.  The community is pretty toxic, unfortunately. It's almost as bad as CSGO. Within these first 4 hours I had various insults slung at me for being a bad medic, and I also saw multiple instances of '♥♥♥♥ team, ♥♥♥♥ game'. That doesn't faze me though.  The only real problem I have with this game is the grind. New mercs cost 50K credits, new loadouts go for around 20K. You usually earn about 300 credits per game, though once it got up to 600 credits. So it obviously takes a very long time to get new loadouts, even longer for new mercs.  But honestly, this game is really, really, really good. Somehow it's better than most AAA shooters that I've played, and it's free. This is going to keep me entertained for a very long time. Splash Damage &amp; Nexon may have a masterpiece on their hands.  You have nothing to lose. Get. This. Game.",

It's fast, it succumbs you to massive amounts of information at starters making you feel like you choke on all the stuff happening around. Little by little you get the hang of it and if fast-phased class-based shooters have a special place in your heart, you'll like it.  The developer group's even the same as good ol' ET, so there is definitely some aim to deliver same kind of experience with more modern twists. Nexon is involved in terms of publishing and servers, but surprisingly there's no sign of pay to win aspect around at all. Sure loadouts might seem like that at starters with all the higher- rarity tier stuff being everywhere but that's the beauty of it, it's purely cosmetic. You can set yourself up pretty nicely with couple good merc purchases and grab functionally good loadouts straight from the store.

The sufficient variety different 'classes' of online characters makes it easy to have at least some form of balanced teamwork (where at least one player can perform certain roles on a team) without having to pick from a million different powers and abilities like some games do (cough cough Battlefield).

It's a lot of fun and I have been enjoying it a lot, but it needs a lot of work if I'm going to keep coming back to it.  For some idea of the type of game it is, the easiest comparison is that it's class-based shooter TF2, but with some of the speed of Quake and the class abilities of Battlefield  Ups: -Solid and varied level design -Numerous 'Classes' to play based on play preference -Swapping between classes on death lets you adapt to changing needs -Colorful with solid art design (none of that drab grey-brown) -Movement and shooting feel right, with adequate feedback and feeling of speed.  Downs: -Completely unbalanced classes and loadouts. *Cough* Proxy's mines *cough* -Loadouts as random drops - already problematic, worse once they want people to pay for 'random drops'  -Even after getting a loadout, it is circuitous to find out what the different passive abilities do  -NO INFO ANYWHERE about the different weapons. No stats, no nothing, just a name and a silhouette. -Level verticality is there, but traversing can be difficult -Matchmaking and team balancing is nonexistant. Played too many 3v5s to count. Losing one player means a lost match. -Teams too small for some of the maps. It's too hard to stay with a buddy and still cover what/where needs covering -Either hitboxes are wonky, or even small lags have serious effects on hit. Take your pick. -Spawn camping RAMPANT. Level design offers no protection to spawn areass  -One of the levels has a spot for attackers that let's snipers pick off defenders at their spawn. -Mounted turrets are a bit too accurate to be balanced, though it varies by placement. -Support characters not adaquately rewarded for their work. Score &amp; endgame XP does not reflect work put in. -TERRIBLE ANTI-CHEAT. The program is antiquated an buggy, and pulls false positives regularly. It also keeps no readable logs, and gives you no messages, so you have no idea what triggered it.  -CTD regularly, and for no apparent reason, but most likely due to the anti-cheat. Event viewer shows no errors, so I blame this on the anti-cheat as well. If anti-cheat is to be implemented, it needs to kick to the menu, not to desktop, and it needs to ID the offending program(s). The current system is unacceptably bad. ---And most importantly--- -VERY POORLY OPTIMIZED. I cannot stress this enough. It maxes out both my i5-3570K and my GTX670. The GPU usage I understand - it looks really good maxed out, but there is no concieveable reason why my CPU should be maxed. It runs at ~60% just in menus. There is something seriously wrong with the engine that it's using that much in menus, let alone 95-100% in game. Even the most taxing games these days rarely make my Hyper 212 cooler rise above a whisper, but this game has it howling.  I still recommend it because I am hopeful for future patches, but be aware of what you are getting yourself into.",

As a Scrum Product Owner who prioritizes the backlog for a development team in real life, I highly respect any design that encourages such open communication between the devs and the players.

If you just want a fun shooter, stick to the objective and stopwatch modes, it's the exact same thing but without 'rank'(which really means sweet f*** all). I've never done competitive mode personally and I don't feel any loss for it.   I've played around 57 hours as I've written this review and I've met maybe one hacker. Yes there are many people in the chat claiming someone is a hacker because they're butt hurt about being head shot but that's not exactly brilliant proof now is it.   Many consider the anti-cheat system rather invasive, I couldn't care less personally but if this bothers you then meh. They've recently brought in a new anti cheat system actually and while it still has the odd bug, it's been mentioned by friends of mine who play that it is in fact, better.   So to get to the actual game. I think it's fantastic, great fun. The best bit about it is that Kill/death ratios don't mean anything. You don't even see it until the round is over so no one can start railing at you for it. This is a blessing to those who actually chase objectives(which is what ultimately wins you the match) and support players who wish to heal and ress rather than focus on killing. All the different mercs have their own play style and you get to have the option of at least three every match which is nice as you can switch depending on what the situation demands making you actually think about what you're doing and what your team might need.   You can buy everything with money if you wish, but honestly the in game currency comes frequently enough that you don't really need to. Case drops are also pretty frequent so you can get a good number of load outs and trade up for better ones for those Mercs you like that bit more. You start with two free mercs and there are others on a weekly rotation so you can try them out.   It's free to play so really just give it a go and see if it's for you. If it's not, you didn't spend any money on it so there's no need to feel bad!",

Dirty Bomb is a game where strategy and teamwork wins games, so even if you have godlike aim and focus only on killing the enemy for that epic k/d ratio, you can still easily lose.

You can expect to die quite a bit in this game, as  most characters are pretty fragile , therefore going against the enemy team with your fellow teammates works very well, especially if at least one of you is playing as a Medic. The graphics are satisfying for me and the  map designs are alright and offer players a couple of entry points they can take.   It should be noted that while the game has unlockable classes in it,  it is not Pay-2-Win . Said classes are unlockable by points you get in-game and you only need few matches in order to save up enough to buy one of them. For those who are impatient, they can still make the purchase using real money. It also uses a CS:GO-like crate system, with the exception that you don't pay for any keys here. You can find crates mid-game or purchase them for dirt-cheap using in-game currency. Upon opening the case, a wheel will begin spinning and the player can win small perks for their class's loadout. One of the common perks you can get for Aura, your shotgunning Combat Medic, is being able to reload while sprinting, for example.",

The game pits you in a map with a set of objectives to complete (Plant a C4 on the train controls, escort a vehicle to the valuables) if you are on the attacking side. The defenders have to stop you. You bring three mercs into the match with you (players begin with a medic and Skybro as default, and then they have a free rotation of three mercs for people to try out) which you can swap between during the match. You can upgrade your mercs with  loadout cards  which are acquired by opening cases. Cases drop randomly after a match, or you can buy them with credits. It costs nothing to open them, and you can trade up lower-rank cards for one of the next rank! A common misconception is that the game is pay-to-win,  which is not true at all . Any cards past Bronze rank are purely cosmetic and offer no additional powers.  Competitive is pretty dead, but using Quick Join to find games in one of the three gamemodes (Execution, pretty similar to CS:GO's Bomb mode, Objective, Attackers vs. Defense, and Stopwatch, a longer match where the teams swap sides and race to finish their objectives faster than the other) is sure to pair you with a (not-so) balanced team.

            "review_text": "A fast, action-packed, team-based 1st Person Shooter.  With it's different classes and the fast movement speed, the ability to do walljumps and the hip-shooting, it feels like a mix between Team Fortress 2, Call of Duty and a little bit of Mirror's Edge. There's no mode like team-deathmatch. Instead, the game is very objecive-based. Teamplay is an important factor and you won't win a match without a good combination of medics, mechanics and fire supporters. You can play both casual matchmaking and competetive mode.  Dirty Bomb is free to play, but NOT pay to win. You get 2 mercs (classes) for free and 3 different ones are always on free rotation every 2 weeks or so. Real cash can be used to unlock new mercs or to buy a case that gives you a random loadout. However, all these things can also be bought using ingame cash. The cases are pretty cheap and while saving up for a merc takes a while, you always have your 5 free ones, so there's enough to choose from without spending a single cent and spending cash does not give you any unfair advantages.  Definitely worth a try  EDIT: After reading some of the other reviews, a lot of people seem to be concerned about hackers. I won't deny that there are quite a few, but it's not as bad as most reviews say. The latest update improved the Anti-Cheat and if you only play Casual, which I do, you won't really see a lot of hackers. Still more than in other games, but that is to be expected in a free game. In my about 45 hours of playing, I have encountered 4 or 5 hackers so far.  Yet another edit: Development is a bit slow due to Splash Damage being a rather small studio, but they seem to be getting their ♥♥♥♥ together recently and have just put out a HUGE overhaul update. If you want to give Dirty Bomb a try, now is the time!",

I've played good games, bad games, great games and game that make you want to shrivel up in the corner and pee yourself into oblivion.   Dirty Bomb is by far, one of the best if not the best free game I have played in a long ♥♥♥ time. The game mechanics are smooth, the characters are great and the community is full of top-notch people. Teambased competative gameplay with objectives and maps that have been fantastically made I would highly reccomend this game to anyone.

            "review_text": "This game should be re-named to: Call Of Battlefield CounterFortress 2.  But in all seriousness this game, for free to play, is amazing. It provides you hours of fun and entertainment, and despite what most believe, this game is not in any way pay2win. Everything in the game is unlockable through the ingame currency and no class at this point in time, gives you the upper edge over another. The game is very balanced between all mercs, making the game lean towards needing skill2win.  Any loadout card above bronze is purely cosmetic, providing different skins for your weapons, so silver, gold or cobalt provide no upper hand to players. Bronze loadout cards are able to be purchased with the ingame currency, allowing anyone to get a loadout they feel with enhance their playstyle. The only complaint I have in this game is the fact that it is TOO reliant on team cooperation. When you spawn, you have very minimal ammo, unless certain frequently played classes give you an ammo pack, an ability that you have 3 packs of and a pack recharges every 5-10seconds. This means anyone is able to recieve ammo easily and there should be no problem right? Well, not exactly. Most people completely refuse to share the ammo only their class has, and only after 5 minutes of asking constantly will they give you the ammo. Same goes for medics. Most of them don't even revive and they run in, thinking their class is designed to be the one to kill everyone. They never place down health kits or their healing station, putting your team at a huge disadvantage. WHile I understand this is more of the communities fault, I really think little changes like increasing the amount of ammo you have when spawning by a clip or two would fix the ammo problem, but I am unsure as to how to fix or balance the lack of cooperating medics.   Now with all that aside, Dirty Bomb is an astounding game, and for a game still in beta, it is pretty solid. I have not had this much fun in a game in quite some time, and look forward to following the development and progression of Dirty Bomb.",

            "review_text": "Dirty Bomb is a fast paced free to play class based fps game made by the creators of brink and batman arkam origins. It is a good mix between tf2, counter strike and call of duty. The tf2 in this game is shown whenever you chose your class, all of the classes have their upsides and their downsides and they are all evenly balanced apart from the phantom but i will get onto that later. The counter strike in this game is the fact you need to learn your guns and understand how to control your recoil that said their is virtually no recoil but if you can control it you have yourself a long range accurate machine gun. The call of duty aspect of this game is that it is easy to play and get some kills but it is hard to master, which is very different to most valve games as they take the approach of difficult to play and nearly impossible to master.  The reviews for Dirty Bomb are mostly positive and the only negative ones I have seen are complaining about the pay to win aspect of the game, The lack of security against cheaters and the OP phantom class. Firstly this game is not pay to win, The cards you pay for just add side perks and just change things about the guns. I have never lost a fight to someone with really good card I have only ever lost due to my accuracy, surprise and more than one enemy attacking me at the same time. Secondly the lack of security for cheaters is %100 true. There is no way to report cheaters but I have so far put 7 hours into the game and I have never once encountered a cheater. Finally the OP Phantom class is true, I have played many an objective game just to rage about the ridiculously Op phantom. The phantom class has the ability to turn invisible, a two hit kill melee weapon, good body Armour and two of the best guns in the game! Despite this annoying class the game is still fun to play but I really want splash damage to balance out the class.  There are many different classes in Dirty Bomb, My favorite are Fragger and Skyhammer. They are all well balanced and if you have a team with a lot of diversity then you have a better chance of winning. There are fivemain bases of clases: Stealth/Sniper, Support, Assault Rifle, Medic and Engineer. The stealth/snipers are: Phantom, Redeye and Vassili. The Support are: Rhino,  Thunder, Stoker, Nader and Fragger. The Assault Rifle are: Skyhammer, Arty and Kira. The Medics Are: Sparks, SawBonez, Aura and Pheonix. And Finally The Engineers are: BushWacker, Fletcher and Proxy.  In Dirty Bomb there are 2 game modes. Objective and Stopwatch and there is also Execution but that's not out yet. In Objective you have to complete the objective within the time limit. Its the defenders job to make sure they hold you back long enough so the time runs out. In The Stopwatch mode you have to complete the objective in the quickest time possible, Then next half you swap teams and the enemy has to complete the objective as fast as possible.  In conclusion Dirty Bomb is one of my favorite fps games I have ever played. And I would defiantly recommend downloading it from the steam store even though its only in early Beta.",

I'm almost 80 hr deep and have no intention to quit, in fact, i want to play more! For your next question the answer is no, this game is not pay to win. That isnt to say that there is no in-game puchases with IRL money (how else do you expect the devs to make money...?) Skyhammer and Aura (default unlocked mercs) are still incredibly useful and part of the 'meta' currently. After about 50 hr of play i threw down $15.99 for the deployables bundle but this is not necessary if you dont mind a bit of grinding. Also the best loadout cards you can get are available at Bronze rarity. All-in-all deffinately install the game, i mean it IS after all, free to play.

            "review_text": "Remember Brink, that game that everyone though it would be amazing, and then was such a majestic piece of sh#t on release, nearly unplayable and extremely lazy? Turns out the devs didn't kill themselves out of shame, and instead came out with this neat game as apology.  So, what IS Dirty Bomb? Weird, that's what it is. As usual, I'll start explaining the BAD stuff of the game, and then move onto the good stuff, and the stuff that could improve.  One of the biggest problems that this game seems to have, is it's lack of identity. It seems that the devs were not sure where to make this game a 'Moba-shooter' or a 'Team-based shooter', so they mixed things up. Kind of badly. Let me explain: In games such as Team Fortress 2, you need to switch from class to class depending of the situation. Can you do that here? Kinda. You can only change into one of your three pre-selected classes. And how many classes are there? Arround 15 or so. What's the deal? And that's not even the worst: Only 2-3 are free, you HAVE TO BUY the rest, either with real money, or ingame currency, which ain't as easy as it seems to get. Three of them are constantly being given for free for a fixed amount of time, like it's done in Mobas, but it's still a bad choice:  You CAN'T have a Team-based game were the classes are behind pay-walls.   Another insanely big issue with the game, is the spawn-camping. And this one is quite pathetic, IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN TEAM-BASED MAPS LIKE THIS! And I can tell you, I made A LOT of community maps for Unreal Tournament 2004, Spawn-camping can be a pain. Here, the devs did not even try: You usually spawn right on the open, and the enemy can most of the time, camp there all day long. And kill you. And wait. And kill you. And wait. And kill you again, and again.   The third issue I have, are the loadouts. They had a neat idea: Cards that have a pre-done loadout for you, with skills and such. I really like it! What I DON'T like, is how it has been done. You can either wait for Case-drops or buy them in the store, when open they work in a similar way as the cases from Counter-Strike Global Offensive, but while there they're just cosmetic items, here they change the gameplay. You might get a different gun for a character that kind of works the same, but also skills that benefit you. The thing is, this is completely random. I think the game would benefit more from a Loadout in the style of Team Fortress 2, a game that it seems the devs of this game took some inspiration, and have the guns separated, which can be dropped, crafted or bought.  The game also tells you that 'It's better to run and gun, not to aim down the sights', and that it's a 'faster shooting game', stuff like that you know. And I think that's bullsh#t. It IS faster than other generic and mediocre FPS such as Call of Duty and Battlefield, but calling it a 'Fast FPS' is being dishonest. If you want to play something FAST, go play Unreal Tournament or Quake. Dirty Bomb does NOT get close. At all.  Another little issue I see, is how OP some classes seem to be. Specially Kira. She has a laser that insta-kills and shoots down from the sky, which she can also control. In some maps, you have to escort a 'tank' to certain points. You know how much time it takes to repair it, AND HOW FAST THAT LASER INSTA-KILLS IT?! Same with Air-strikes, they're WAY too powerful, and can be used WAY TOO MUCH. Makes other classes look like complete push-overs.  The last issue, is a smaller one, but a pain in the ♥♥♥ anyway. If you hit the 'Quick Match' option, the game MIGHT drop you into games of the United States when you're in Europe, and the same thing in reverse. That's dumb. Just have a Country-Selection option for f#ck sake, I don't want to play with over 150 ping because they ignored simple details.  So, does the game actually have good stuff? Yeah. And it was quite enjoyable for a while, gotta say. The guns look good, the graphics are quite beautiful, the gameplay is fun until you get spawn-camped for half an hour, and classes work well until people start abusing them. But the thing is, the game is still on Beta. If you really like this sort of game, then I recommend it to you. If you don't, stay away until the Beta is over. You'll be thankful you did, and you'll have way more fun (if it does ever finish the Beta).  Oh and, one last thing... You can take screenshots, but other people can't see them. What's that all about, is the game censored? Because I only expected that from EA.",

Various playable characters for an kind of playstyle. 2.

Great sound and voicees. 4. A case system that doesnt make you waste 100 on 25 cases. 5. Very cool rarity system. 6. Very nice learning curve.(I personally like it when games have this) Now on to some things that need to be added/ Improved (This stuff will most likely be added/ fixed) 1.

Alternatively if you don't like those games, this one is better anyways! The game is fast paced to keep you constantly excited, and every game focuses on working with your team to complete the objectives. Every map is brilliantly made and allows players to use what they know to really change the tide of the battle. Sticking with your squad is important in this game, so its great to play it with friends, and even if you're not the community is amazing and I've walked away enjoying every single match.  Flaws of the game? A few characters seem a little overpowered but once you try it out, you'll realize that people are just good with that merc. Each character is uniquely made and there is a perfect setup for anyone. Lag has never seemed to be an issue and the mechanics of the game are simple and easy to learn. This game doesn't have a large learning curve, its straight to the point and there are no dirty tactics that will make you hate the enemy.  If your not convinced by my review, just try the game out. It's free! Also, unlike counterstrike, crates you receive to unlock are immediatley able to be opened and you can buy more with your in game currency. Characters are also purchasable with in game money, but if you hate to wait then you can always buy the characters with real money. Either way, its great and the game is constantly getting updates to keep you involved and bringing you back to see what's new. Enjoy the game!",

Learn why these games aren't worth your time, and don't spend a cent on the lesson.  Setting aside the ridiculous 'loadout' based character advancement, the exorbitant fees that you'll be spending to try every character or play a favorite consistently, and the flagrant imbalance of some of these skills against non-paying customers (we get it, Nexon, that's the model, but you keep doing it so we keep pointing it out), Dirty Bomb's gameplay is just a ♥♥♥♥♥how compared to other titles by the same studio. That's okay, though. It doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon.  I'm sure it's possible to get good at Dirty Bomb. I'm sure that 300+ hours into Counter-Strike probably gives you a moderate skillset for engaging with the springy, strange-shaped opponets of this game that can run at twelve mph, turn on a dime and maintain their footing and landspeed when hit with explosions and bullets, but as someone who doesn't have that skillset already, the game fails at teaching you what you need to know.  Sure, they'll tell you about setting C4 and disarming C4 (which, other than 'standing next to a car and doing something to it' are the only activities in the game. They don't teach what constitutes reasonably effective tactics against foes that absorb a dozen bullets before going down, or run laterally just as fast as they do forward. Yes, the game is about a dirty bomb that went off. It's also, I assume, about the lives of the mutants that now roam the streets.  Seriously, though. There are better free games out there (TF2, anyone?), where even starting out you're capable of doing something to help the team. If you aren't willing to train yourself for twenty hours a week in twitch targeting and circle-strafing, you can look for fun somewhere else. The 'competitive' (Read: unemployed) players will love this one. Everyone else, give it a pass.",

Despite some of it's flaws, I loved the game. Now Dirty Bomb, it simply polishes and brings out the best in what Brink should have been and also what the developers are more than capable of doing.   PROS:   - Graphics are amazing for it being a free to play, which will be a huge hit in the free to play gaming community, considering there's not many free to play first person shooters who achieve this.   - Playing Style: Now, I'm not the best player in Dirty Bomb. But it feels smooth and really easy to control. You'll have to fix the mouse sensitivity, however that shouldn't be an issue - fixing it, I mean.  - Customization/Game Modes/Progression: These days most free to play games have these basic game modes in which are common and overused in my opinion. DirtyBomb has an objective for almost everything just so you can support your teammates in some fashion or another. Not very many free to play games have that. Customization, this game is said to implement it. I've not seen it yet, however if it's anything like Brink, which obviously it's at least simalar in some fashion, then it's more than safe to assume customization play a huge part. Progression in Dirty Bomb is amazing. When you level up, you'll be given crates, keys and cards. They'll play a huge part in the game as well. I won't explain that part because they can explain it to you better in their videos.   CONS:  - Published by Nexon  - Makes people worry whether it'll be pay to win or not  - Since it's published by Nexon, this may also have an issue with hacking considering Nexon is known for Combat at Arms. Which wasn't a bad game, just the people who ruined it were bad individuals.   - Also, maybe it's just me. However in game, certain maps. I've been running into bushes as if they're solid objects. I believe that's a bug that needs to be addressed!  Would I recommend this game?  Hell yeah! Despite who it's published by, I believe the game deserves you to at least try it and then judge it based on that. Not who published it. Because they didn't make the game, SplashDamage did. Might I add, they did a wonderful job in my opinion as well! Continue the hard work, SplashDamage! I'll continue playing as well.  - Gun Haven   ",

What's more is that these credits are earned very quickly, and there are often events such as double xp and random loot drops, which ensure that evey player gets the same opportunity to see what these top-tier items are like.

To sum it up, at least to me, the game feels like a combination of TF2 and CoD, and with that, the game is obviously action packed. If you've ever wanted to try out such a combination, then I recommend you to try this game, it's free after all.  However, the game does have its fair share of issues as well, some time back a new class was added, called Phantom. It's considered ridiculously overpowered in game compared to the other classes, and most of the time the people using the class are ruling the scoreboard, despite not racking any support/gamemode experience points. However, it's most likely going to be nerfed in the near future, but just adding that as a remark.  The game has a card based loadout system, for every three matches, you gain an equipment case. You can unlock it for free and you get a random mercenary out of it of a random grade, most likely a lower tier card that only has one or two augments. Even if the augments don't help all that much, it can be extremely infuriating to keep getting low tier cards every single time. The chance to get a card that has the maximum amount of augments, which is three, is 5%. You may also buy 'Elite Cases' which always drop a grade that has three augments, and those cases cost five dollars each. Other reviews have probably mentioned more about those.  Also, every few games you run into blatant cheaters, especially aimbotters. From what I heard, it's even worse on the competitive mode, so it might be the best idea to avoid that.   Then, probably the most important thing, which is the actual balance between the attackers and defenders. From what I've seen, the game seems to heavily favor the attackers, and I'm unaware if that's the public opinion or not. That could also be a result of bad team balance that also seems to happen a lot, there's a ton of players that have no idea how to properly play the game, immature players raging in the chat and so on and so forth, common issues in games such as this.   You also can't party up with your friends to play quick matches, you can only do that for competitive games. To play a quick match with some friends, one of you has to already join the server ( either via the matchmaking system or via the server browser ) and then the friends have to join him by right clicking their friend's name in the friend list and joining them that way, which is rather cumbersome in my opinion.   However, the bottom line is, it's a free game, so of course it's a good idea to give it a try, especially if you're a fan of first person shooters.",

The claims about balance issues is there because people haven't put the time in to understand the system on which the loadout cards are done. Right now, credits are easily obtained through normal gameplay. You can gain about 12k from a victory, while getting 7k for a loss, and that's a full game where you joined in from the start. With your credits you can purchase Loadout cases for 1k each, which comes with a loadout card. You then use these cards to upgrade to the next tier. So 3 iron cards, equals to one bronze card. Then 4 bronze cards to one silver, then 4 silver to one gold. Essentially, per win, you can obtain a single bronze card. Put the math in and in about 3-4 hours you can have a gold card.  Balance issues aren't really a decent claim from users. Due to this being a 'class' based combat system, each one excells at it's own. Frag, the assault class, destroys anything at long range except for a sniper. Aura, the healer, is great for a fast paced close quarters engagement. She boasts both shotgun and SMG loadouts. Proxy is the shotgunner, and fast paced runner, she's a CQB ONLY! class... Balance has no issue at all, once you know the strengths and weakness' of each class. It's like TF2 people... Each class per situation. There is no balance issues in that regards.  The game is indeed in closed beta, so performance is an issue. I say that as recording/streaming gameplay seems to be problematic as the game doesn't agree with on-the-fly x264 encoding. I was attempting to stream and my CPU was taking a ♥♥♥♥. I can, however, stream everything else 720p without a problem or a single FPS spike.  Give the game a shot. I reckon you'll like it. It's certainly a different take on F2P shooters.

            "review_text": "P2W? HA, for once, I think I feel the need to coin a new catchy way of describing a free-to-play game, and I feel that 'PtD', or 'Pay/Play to Diversify', is a fair title to bestow onto the game. Alot of people disagree, so Im going to make a 3-stage case for why this game isn't p2w, but rather a game that rewards above all else, player skill.   With only 6 hours of gameplay, I have a purchased mercenary and a max tier loadout for them that boats an alternative weapon to the defualt, and 3 augments that further improve the performance of my hero. I did get fairly lucky with my case drops, as I have, on average, gotten a case every fourth round, but I have gotten two irons and 10 leads in my 12 cases. That being said, I passed mutliple cobalts, golds, bronzes and silvers as I opened my cases, even watching as the marker lands on a bronze rhino loadout, only for it to snap foward and land on a lead kira loadout. This leads me to beleive the cases have been set to tease the player, in an effort to frustrate them to the point of buying an elite case to ensure they get a visually augmented bronze loadout. But, that expensive, hypothetically P2W loadout has no statistical advantage over a regular bronze loadout, which costs only 9k in-game points.   I must also point out that certain mercs cost less than others, those mercs have fairly weak or even repetitive special abilities, and offer very little diversity to the game. As such, they have been priced accordingly, and within your first 6-7 games, you could buy one of those mercs. I warn you that these classes offer primarily the option to equip new weapons, and it is the weapons they physically weild in their hands that make them a viable early game option, as they abilities take a bit of luck and far to much teamwork for a fast-pace game to make use of something like a hearbeat sensor, or an artillery strike over an airstrike. But, if you fancy yourself a crack-shot, how would you like to be able to one shot kill anyone, assuming you can hit them in the face? Theres a cheap class for that! by game 8 I had Vacilli merc with a lead loadout that gave me spare mags, and I suddenly leveled up so quickly, I bought more cases than I had mercs to equip, and I had to tradeup to a bronze for vacilli, and now I am outperforming rhinos and phantoms, despite their dps advantages. This game doesn't force you to gridn for hours to get a new merc, you can have one in about 2 hours.]   Finally, I played a match with a couple of younger players, and they had literally golden loadouts for phantom, rhino, and fragger, the fragger player had a rifle that could 2 kill a player at close quarters, the phantom player had some rather bad augments, and I felt bad for them as they got a really bad golden loadout, but the rhino player was rather problematic, as they were walking behind or beside the EV and provided cover fire for EV and their teammates to push to the objective, But they only made it half-way to the objective. I swapped to vacilli from skyhammer and flanked the EV convoy, shot the sniper, the grenade launcher lady who's name escapes me at the moment, and swapped to the machine gun next to me to spray down the reinforcements as they turned the corner to back up their now dead teammates. In a matter of moments, I unwittingly had earnt myself an ace, against much more expenive mercs and loadouts, simply becuase I played the map better. But earlier that very day I was struggling to deal with auras who used the springy augment to wall jump all over the place as they shot me down with their shotgun.   But I warn you, for all the glory, this game is early access in every sense of the word. The turtorial isn't comprehensive, the playerbase lacks communication skill needed to make this a truly competitive game, despite having a competitive mode, and there are problems that make certaint classes worse than others. For instance, there is very little to no bullet penatration, which sometimes breaks immersion, well, that and dead people twitching after you've already 'finished' them. I mean really, how long is that guy gonna keep sliding back and forth???",

It's free and doesn't feel terribly pay 2 win, however if you want variety in the MOBA-style character choice, you need to spend a LOT of time playing, or fork over some cash. I did buy the ultimate starter pack which gives 5 basic characters, 2 cases (much like CS:GO) that contain loadout cards. Which are basically trading cards that define your 3 perks, the guns you use, and the fancy skin you wear. It's different and feels like unnecessary RNG but collecting the cards is pretty cool.  However, much like MOBAs there are rotations of free playable characters for 2 weeks at a time, whether you have them unlocked or not. Originally it was pretty random, but now they try to offer one of each type of class (Soldier, engineer, medic/support) per rotation to offer at least a slight chance at a decent team composition in random games. However, some combinations just seem ridiculous. This week is Snipers, Mini-gun toting heavies, and Turret-camping engineers. And there's lots of 'em. It makes it nearly impossible to enjoy a game when the moment you step foot towards an objective a wall of Rhinos (the heavy character) comes out and they all turn you into swiss cheese in a second flat. Some things need rebalancing, there's only 2 game modes and about 5-6 maps I believe. There's not much to the game now.  It seems like a very decently put together frankenstein of decent features in a lot of other games, but it just doesn't feel like its pushing any boundaries. I want to say 6.5 but I'll give it a 7/10 because it is quite fun when you get a team that work together. But very few do.",

If you enjoy games like TF2, CS GO, Quake and Unreal Tournament, you will absolutely love this game. As a person with 1.7k in cs go and plays lots of shooters, I immensely enjoyed this game and will continue to do so.  For the devs and people who are interested, I suggest making the game a non-free game (if it is ever possible), to filter out the toxic community from the game being free. Getting exposure from F2P is great, but obtaining a loyal, competitive core community is what really keeps the community thriving (as we can see from the example of cs go).

You can spend the time to earn coins to buy more classes, or if you don't want to spend the time you can just as easily buy them. Don't let Brink make you think this game will be terrible. This game is good, REALLY GOOD. For me, its great to take a break from CS:GO and play this game. Even if you are mainly a CS:GO player this game is fun. If you really want a class and don't want to grind for it, just sell a CS:GO skin and buy it. You earn coins at a good rate so even if you do not want to buy classes with IRL money, you can just as easily save up coins. Another thing I like about this game is the ability to open cases. I don't have to spend money to open these though. Overall, a great game to play with friends and even alone. Cut on some music, start up the game, and begin the fun that is Dirty Bomb.",

Im not so happy about having ony 2 classes to start out with, and only 3 into battle, kinda not fun to have to pick so limited. The game is fun, balanced, and i recommend getting. [NEW] So I have been playing the game for about 2 ish months now, and I only have an accumulated 90k(spent on characters) and that will buy 3 minor characters, and 1 major character 10k to go for 2. Big thing with this game is to release an OP merc, have the rich dedicated fans buy them, then nerf them till they are almost useless. IMO, this game requires a ridiculous amount of grinding to get characters that are honestly rarely better than the other post-nerf. Ranking up in this game is beyond dificult...and i mean, its beyond stupid to have almost 2 days of hours and still at rank 7. I guess its supposed to mean skill to be max rank, but if im to be purely honest, its just constant grinding for everything unless you feel liek dumping cash into this game which doesnt help you much anyway. If you arent into pretty much playing 2 characters for the first bunch of hours, then absolutely grinding all the time to stay with the recent units/mercs, having elitist, hackers, and no life level 40's, then dont play",

I loved that game. Especially the movement, which isn't as good here. What they do bring from Brink is the great level design and multiple objectives. Games are diverse and fun, being very fast paced. Maybe they will add more customization options, as in all the content here is a bit light.  I'm guessing that's on purpose, so they can release it as F2P and add-on later. However, the customization options are extremely light, compared to Brink especially. In Dirty Bomb, you can pick a character and a load-out card. That's it. The load-out cards have different perks and weapons. It's a simple system, but I'd like some appearance options. It's too late for Brink body types I'm sure.  Matchmaking and ping seemed decent to me, consider we are in a closed beta game. There isn't a big pool to draw from.  In all, a decent game that could be better. It's not the best, but hey it's new. Great level design will make sure you have fun, now if only they'd add more, well, content.

The hackers.. omg the damn hackers are unreal in this game, to make matters worse they have no way to report them other then go to their forums and do a bunch of nonsense, which is very time consuming and 99% of people are not even going to take the time to report people because of that.  To make matters worse you got hackers calling hackers, hackers....like wtf? Are you serious right now?  Spawn killing in this game is a thing... Like seriously, if you get an unbalanced team, and trust me you will, they'll end up trapping you in your spawn and killing you for 20 mins, and there is nothing you can do about it because your team literally rage quits and if you leave you get a penalty timeout for competitive.   Oh to make matters worse, if you’re on the team that kills all the players, or that whole team leaves you have to sit there and wait whatever time it is for the clock to stop ticking before you win the match. Oh... And if it’s the first half of the match you still get the joys of fighting the imaginary team in the second half.   The whole queuing system is terrible, you get into a lobby and if they don’t ready up it kicks everyone out and you have to start all over again, this can happen several times. If someone doesn’t ready up why in the hell does it not just kick them and find someone else.. Like seriously?  Queuing up for Competitive is fun, you have to click accept like 50 times before 10 people finally all accept, did i mention it gives them 1min to accept? So you have to wait one minute and if they don’t accept.. You get to start all over again.   Oh did i say hackers are everywhere? Like seriously.. EVERYWHERE, they're not even controlled or dealt with them just hack hack hack... All day long, with no worries of being banned.   Pay to win? It definitely has that factor to it, basically you can buy elite cases that give you more perks and buffs over other players, in my book that’s paying to win. You have a chance to buy them with the credits you earn in game, but those are just basic cases and chances of getting Silver, Gold, Cobalt drops are probably 0.001% chance. But if you pay, you can get them. So yeah.. Pay to win for sure.   Here is the sad thing, it’s actually a really nice game if it didn’t have the extreme downfalls that it does as mentioned above. The pay to win i can handle, but the other stuff in the aforementioned is not excusable in anyway.   There is so much more I can complain about in this game, but I'm not about to write a Mary Poppins book to entertain people. Download the game try it yourself.   Don't say I didn't warn you.",

Wall jumping, long jumping and just general jumping fun times to catch your enemy off guard.  It uses league of legends champion system, there are mercs which you will make your 'squad' out of. you take 3 into battle. The mercs can be bought with real money or in game currency, weekly new mercs are choosen to be free, so along with the 2 free mercs they give you you will have others to choose from. You can change the equipment (Guns, melee weapon, little perk abilities) they get with a loadout card system, after a few games you will get a case, or buy a load out card off the shop with ingame money or real money. these cards say what weapon your merc can use and what ability they have. There are several tiers of cards, bronze being the big one you will care about the most because it gives you the most power. anything past bronze is cosmetic and just for show. you can combine these cards to create a different card for merc of your choosing.  Store does exactly what you think it would do if you've played league of legends or any other general free moba, you can buy mercs to use forever, set load out cards. or elite cases which have a higher then normal value roll for loadout cards, generally granting you will some flashy things.  TL:DR: Fast team based objective first person shooter with a card system. No issues with microtransactions.

            "review_text": "I rarely make reviews on games, and when I try to atleast think about it this game pisses me off.  This games has a POS money grabbing scheme even in this early of the game's stages. They decided to try and cash in on the League of Legends in which you have a free Merc rotation every week. If you want a Merc that you dont have you are spending 6 - 10 per merc. This would not be such a bad thing if it was not so much damn money. Its more than they would charge you for a LoL Champion, at least in that I know I will have fun with the character and if I dont I can get a full refund in a short period of time. Now in the game they have of course in game purchases to buy Merc Cards. Every Merc has a large variety of cards ranging from Basic - Cobalt. Each higher tier has better equipment and special skins. Each case will run around 1000 in game currency, at first glance it sounds like its not too bad, but you only earn on avg of 100-200 creds per game IF you do well. That will be a avg of 10 games to get a card. Now of course they have a way oyu can spend cash to get a increased rate of earning money, not bad at first thought but charging 3 dollars for doubling your credits gained for ONLY 6 HOURS is beyond reasonable. But of course this is where the extra unneeded monetization comes into play. You can buy a Elite case to open to get a chance for a Silver-Cobalt card. Now with these cases you only get Silver, Gold and Cobalt, with that said its a RARE chance to get a Cobalt and a Uncommon one to get a SIlver. For spending 5 dollars on ONE case this is rediculous. Unlike in CS GO and DOTA you can get a case/key for 2.49 and if you get a item that you dont want you can atleast sell it back. Game companies like this are feeling like they can rip off people like us so they can make a profit. Even though this may sound like this is going to far to rip into a F2P game like this but they could have taken a WAY better course into the game than this. For instance LoL has been a great game for years for being a f2p model, but it doesn't tease you with buying a case and getting a merc card to a merc you dont have so you have to spend that 10 dollars to play him or trade it up in the end not being worth it. They could of went down the road of WoT (World of Tanks) where most of the game is available to you from the start and you can just hop in and play every tank (except Premiums) for no charge. But include the option to be a P2P member and get the increase money output and exp.  Now lets say you were ok with all this and just think you can play with out paying a single dime doing this rediculous grind, the game has a pretty solid gameplay to it. The game feels fluid, the combat is great for people who play CS GO and etc. Its unique to the FPS genre with this Merc setup with this MOBA esk feel when it comes to the mercs. But after saying the gameplay is good, this game is not worth the time or effort to put into it.",

The one issue I have with this game is the crappy servers, it is hard to get a game where you join and your team has 5 and so does theirs... Its like 7 vs 3 or 4 vs 6... Something is clearly broken there... Also I hate that when I play a whole game and get disconnected then join back ALL MY EXP IS GONE!

This game is amazing, but people are blinded by the false information that this is a 'pay to win' game and it has micro transactions. GUESS WHAT? IT DOES! And is that a bad thing? It can be, but I believe that this game does it right. Sadly you can't just go crazy with your in-game currency and buy a bunch of equipment cases while expecting to be able to buy all the charecters. MANAGE YOUR MONEY AND ITS EASY TO GET NEW MERCS. I personally have spent money on this game because I want to support it and I love the game. But I feel liket eh community is bashing the game to much because of problems like unballanced teams in competitive. What would you rather want; 2 hour queue times, or 5 minute queue times and a little bit of unballance. Think of the unballance as your chance to improve how you play the game. Ive just dealed with it and played against really good players and now I can confidently say that I can beat these players and carry my team. I want more people to realize the fun that can be had with this game and not have it be trown to the dirt because everyone just stops playing it for games like Overwatch. The one thing that is going to keep this game's community alive is the fact that it's free, which makes me kind of angry because we are going to lose a lot of the 'veteran players' and the 'competitive aspect' of the game. I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. Excuse my ranting...

Dirty Bomb is a refreshing and very enjoyable FPS game, brining some new ideas to the franchise and putting a spin on Objective based maps and missions. With the addition of loadouts it gives you something to work towards, though sometimes it was difficult. With a variety of characters to pick from and unlock, there's always a play style for you, and with the free rotation the game gives you a chance to experience new characters for free whilst in the rotation. Quick tip: Pay attention to the Dirty Bomb facebook page, they do giveaways often!  Positives: Balanced combat and enjoyable gun play. Beautiful art style and great graphics. New ideas brought to the table (Which are well implemented) Great design. The gameplay is fun, with a variety of gamemodes.  Negatives: Not all the gamemodes are accessable yet. Some characters have to be fixed on occation Proxy's god damned mines. The addition of Micro-Transaction (Because it's expensive)  Conclusion: Either way, Dirty bomb is one of my favourite games this year by far, it's making a huge scene for a good reason. The gameplay is enjoyable, great design, balanced combat. What else can you ask for. Oh AAAANNDD It's free!  Without debate I would give this game a 8.5/10, there are some things that have room for improvement.",

Pay to win  Its a first-person shooter, right?, well thats true but the class based system allows players to further customise there gear, classes and play style with each character unlocked. This is good and is very relatable to other free-to-play games on the market like the Titan of TF2 or the 'mini' MOBA of L O L but, it has rewarded with players the best of both worlds. For example it has classes such as Team Fortress 2, sure but the classes ARE later unlockable by playing enough and getting the right amount of Credits to actually unlock them to play, which, is a system used in League of Legends to get skins and characters. Although it is Pay to win with some characters it isn't completely dependent on you spending your hard earned Dosh but rather if you WANT too. Also London, Everyone loves London.",

One match will give you around 200-1500 credits, and it takes 50 000 credits to buy an agent. The rotation gives you 3 players each update to try out, but all that means is that everyone is playing the same characters (especially at low levels).    I truly want to like this game, but it feels like purchasing credits is the only way to actually have fun. When it feels like you have no choice in the way you play, and each match gives you basically nothing towards buying a new character, you will start to feel frustrated. No one wants to grind for weeks just to unlock one character, that's outrageous! If winning a match actually meant something, I might be motivated to play.   Otherwise, the game is fantastic. The characters are fairly balanced, each one gives a slightly different experience, and the jumping mechanics are phenomenal. There is nothing wrong with the actual game, it could be amazing if it weren't for the fact that you are given very little variety as to how to play. This is after I've purchased around 8 characters, I still feel like I'm only playing a demo, and very slowly working towards purchasing the full game.",

No real form of matchmaking for people around your level so you can go against people who have an ungodly amount of hours put it. Leveling past 5 takes a stupid amount of exp so catching up to others takes forever. The way you get weapons is through cards which is 100% luck for what you get. So if one lucky person gets lucky to get a gold card and you just keep getting lead cards, good chance you're going to get stomped by that person with a gold card.  Another thought to compared to the TF2 model, i'm not a fan of having to unlock most of the classes in this. They all cost a crap ton(30k-50k) and on average you make 150-200 each round. youre talking a ♥♥♥♥ load of playtime to unlock even one character. You get dailies where you can get 1800 a day but still, it's going to take a lot of time to unlock even one character   It's not pay2win per se but the model they use is too luck based",

As per usually with sub par developers it is totally OP. For example, 3 'Stoker's' can pretty much ensure that you cannot get to the objective let alone repair/set bombs. The fire spreads around corners so forget taking cover. However this isn't the only problem with Dirty Bomb. Here are some more:  No way to play public matches with friends. Yes you can join them on a server, but it is unlikely you will be on the same team. If there is more than 2 of you then forget it.  Way too many cheaters, at least once a day you find one despite the 'anti-cheat'.  Kill someone, they drop but can easily be revived with full hp. So you shoot them again while they writhe around on the ground, this can take a full clip, in which time they can be revived from across the map, full hp, and ammo, while you are reloading. It should never take more than 1 or 2 bullets to finish off an unconcious person.  Load out card nonsense- have a bronze card you like but want it in silver, gold, oe cobalt? be prepared to spend lots of money trying to get the card you want. So there is no point to doing so as all cards are the same except the color of the uniform.  Match Making is broken, at least 50% of the time you will be in a team of 6 v 7. You will get hammered, or you leave to find another match. The people that do stay will enjoy a k/d of 10/20 (on a good day).  The sniper class is broken, so easy to rack up kills as 1 shot does all. No scope shaking, just point and shoot and they are dead.   The new update for 'Sparks' means she can get 1 shot kills with her heal gun and revive team mates from across the map with full hp.  So just get 1 Sparks, 3 Stokers and enjoy dominating the game. It all feels a bit pointless but hey it's a free game so go nuts if you don't believe me.",

Pros: - Fun F2P (Hard to find these nowadays) - Good Graphics - Good and funny voice acting - Intresting maps - Cool Features such as placing a C4 on a generator to unlock a shortcut for you and your team - Really good mercs  Cons: - PAY TO WIN. - Making money takes so long and mercs cost so much - To many in-game items that cost real money such as boosters or cases - Did I mention Pay to win?   The real Con about this game is you can Pay to Win. Many people dont really see it but its very obvious. If you dont want to spend the time to buy Operators, then you simpaly pay TEN DOLLARS, which is insane, to instantly get one operator. I can see how you buy operators for around 2-5$ but 10$ is crazy. Also, dont get me started with the cases. The chance of a Colbat rarity even with the cases that cost real money is outrageous.  You also have to pay 3$ I believe for only a 6 hour money boost which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since theres no option to use the in-game money to buy one.  Overall, this is a fun game but its really annoying to get any Mercs without either spend 10 hours for just ONE or waiting for your favorite one to go on rotaion.  ",

I'm just gonna cut to the point, this is Brink+Any generic shooter, It was interesting at first it really was and it seemed...promising but behind their 'Loadout Cards' is just a pay2win mainly in the augment area, sure you can get loadout cards and all through other means but the only way to effeciently get them is to pay for them and the augments to them can drastically change how a character can be played in such a way where put one and one together and you'll end up unstoppable.  The classes, well their alright and all with their own unique style but the weapons at least for lead and start set carry little impact to them, secondary machine pistol just means throw stones at them till they kill you, while shotguns are great damage but when you take a shotgun shot in the back or even in the front at point blank they shouldn't have half health left. Sniper rifle...well it does high damage but with the problem of having varying character speeds you'll be struggling just to hit any fast paced character and you'll have to believe in the force to even manage a shot on them, A BODY SHOT no less than pulling three lottery tickets in a row and getting a headshot. Significant loadout and maybe some class tweaking needs to happen.   The maps and game modes are also so ♥♥♥♥ing short with just giving you an overall time limit to it all, and say if you're playing any EV missions and your out of time but hugging the tank like a koala hugs eucalyptus, say if you die right there boom rounds over barely even a grace period of a second before round lost. In general it feels like each map is just a partial cut of an overall one that just feels smaller than small, where you only do two objectives and that's it game over good guys win and go home gg.   ------Few other little nitpicks-------- - Why would you give a medic a damn shotgun and a deployable health station? I've topscored so many times just from me killing everyone and healing myself. (Needs to be nerfed in some ♥♥♥♥ing way) - Level max servers don't kick people that level up out of the level range which can cause some problems for little level one timmy who is fighting level seven XxCunt♥♥♥♥♥♥SlayerxX in a max level five server. - Again weapons need some heavy balancing act as the submachine guns for proxy as well as others were on par if not better than some of the assault rifles.  - It's tried to be soo unique that it's just a generic FPS with little gimmicks.  ------In the simplist way of putting it, this is a Baconator with two week old meat, burnt bacon, one slice of cheese, on perfect buns. Stale old and it can be enjoyable if you really want to regret your time spent on it later------  ALSO SERIOUSLY WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES IT ALREADY HAVE A COMPETITIVE TYPE OF SETUP TO IT, IS THIS THE STANDARD FOR SHOOTERS???!!",

Each class comes with two abilities standard. Each class costs about €5 or 50000 ingame credits. You can get about 100 credits per average match, so do the maths yourself. The most disgusting thing is not that the classes are locked, it's that the loadout of the characters are locked. You can't choose which guns and perks you bring along. The game has this system of 'trading cards'. These decide which guns and perks you're bringing. The problem is that which card you get depends entirely on an RNG. You can even buy cards, whithout guarantee that you're getting something you like or even are able to use (since the classes are locked).  So, it's an ok game, but just don't spend any money on it.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

By the time you complete all three, you'll have played quite a few matches and gotten the rewards from those as well) 3) F2P model is quite decent. It's not pay2win, and while a bit grindy there are things that lessen the pain somewhat (free rotation of 2-3 mercs, cash rewards for first 3 levels and credit-rewarding missions) *added bonus: Credit-rewarding missions refill every 3 hours rather than once a day, and are only replaced when they've been completed (so no worries about having a 90% completed mission replaced and missing out on the reward)  So basically, Dirty Bomb in its current form is a fun objective-based online FPS with a decent F2P model.",

Matchmaking is unbalanced, For example, I am only level 5 and I have been matched up several times with people that are lvl 20 and up, they have access to much better guns/ classes and have much more experience, and really for them it would be a sinch to beat all the low ranks on the opposing team, unless we spend a good ammount of money we have to slowly grind to get the credits needed to get new classes better than the default ones, and trust me it is very slow if you never win a match. I have yet to find any aimbotters but damn, sometimes I feel the need to question it.. also from what I have seen in alot of matches, alot of the community playing is very toxic.

Let me also state that I have been a part of the alpha since before it was renamed from Dirty Bomb to Extraction and then back to Dirty Bomb. My 3.9 hours stated is all I could bear to play anymore since the release of Open Beta.  The core of the game is essentially a faster, feature-light version of Brink. Now, I loved Brink, especially it's smart movement/parkour system combined with the three different body/build types. Dirty Bomb, however, doesn't have any of that. That said, is it fun? Sure, but only if you don't have any other shooter you prefer to play, and there are shooters-a-plenty out there in the wild. I suppose you might enjoy this more if you are a fan of Quake... Personally, I find it to be nothing more than 'okay'.  I had a several paragraph long review, but apparently Steam doesn't like that. So, I'll be short and sweet... The monetization used in this game hurts and hinders the core experience because you cannot have custom loadouts and are instead forced to use pre-crafted loadout cards that can either be obtained by gambling or by purchasing specific cards. The rate at which you earn in-game currency to purchase all of the outrageously priced goods that are instrumental to the enjoyment of the core game is incredibly slow, and is only sped up by the completion of 3 missions that are only refreshed every 3 hours and only reward 3 times the amount of currency you would normally earn as a result of a match.  After playing 4 hours of it, plus several periods of alpha tests under both working titles (Dirty Bomb and Extraction), I don't care for it anymore. I once had high hopes for this game... Then I played it the first time and gave my honest feedback some 2 or so years ago, and it really has not changed much since. I just don't care anymore.",

The price of each individual merc, should you decide you want to spend money on this game( and it really doesn't offer enough value to warrant spending money on it), you're looking at $16 for a bundle of 3 mercs.   Don't get me wrong, for a free to play game, it's pretty good. It's just that it's so bare-bones without shoveling buckets of money into your computer that it's not really worth playing for more than 3 hours.",

You start with Aura and Skyhammer, who are pretty good mercs, but, if you wish to have access to all weapons in the game you can forget about it. The system is geared towards milking as much time or money as they can out of you as you unlock weapons.  The Randomness of what you get out of cases is designed to be a big factor to frustrate you. The loadout card system stop you from being able to choose your rewards, or even make your own kit out of your favourite weapons.  In order to get that one unique mix of equipment you want, you will need to rely heavily on luck. Or if you're a particularly lucky person, you can buy cases for 1000 credits. Or, you can buy any specific bronze loadout card except silver and gold exclusives for 17 thousand credits each or so  In average from my experience you can get around 200 credits per game discluding missions. Most missions are easy and you'd be able to get, on average 2000 credits every three hours providing you don't skip any missions.  I just realised I've typed 3 paragraphs just to describe the marketing of the game, and that is just how much the company focuses on currency.  If you plan on not making any purchases I can promise you that the zero dollars you paid will definitely be worth it, the time you will spend to start enjoying it, however, I cannot promise you anything.",

Other than that this game is pretty solid. The only gamemode where random people know how to play was only there for a weekend and no longer is avalible.  All of the classes are balanced really well (with the exception of the Rhino and Phantom) and all of the abilities blend in really well with the game's mechanics.  If you've heard other people say 'The game starts you out fast', they arn't kidding. You actually have an option to play the tutorial. The downside being that the game only STARTS you out fast. When you start, the game gives around 10k per game until you reach level 3. From there it turns to only around 200, which would make trying to hire other classes a real grind.   Also this game throws around beta like it's excuse for critizism. THIS GAME ISN'T IN BETA, its fully operational and has 6 maps for 2 current game modes. The only things that are in beta in this game are the new gamemode and the maps for that gamemode. They don't allow you to test classes for feedback, hell they don't even want your feedback.  My reason for not recommending this game is becasue its a grind to try new characters, it doesn't understand the point in the beta, and you CANNOT PARTY UP (unless you are playing Competitive).",

Can very easily become paying money for duplicates, it's the worst. -Hit detection is wonky -Seriously, Nexon.  The game could be good, but it won't. I'll happily eat my own words, but I know Nexon. I know the ♥♥♥♥ery they pull, and I watched it on previous games I cared about and the while the core game mechanics might be cleaned up and balanced throughout the beta, Nexon will pull the slimiest moves it can to make a quick buck.

Pros  -Shotgun is not just like shotguns that you can spam and win it actally takes skills and perfect timing  -Maps are good and are created jsut to match the parkour kinda jumpy stuff in dirty bomb if your a good player i assume you know all this.Other than dome that is.  -The mercs are all fun and well balanced.Even Rhino(the fat minigun guy) takes skill  -Merc abilities make the each person play differently with different roles.  - Not very Pay 2 Win. There are some elements of p2w however they are minimal and can be countered by just playing the game for a little while. Everything you want out of the game seems to be gettable by just playing the game.  Cons -Devs will try to fix bugs and stuff.Yes they fix those but always causes another bug or ♥♥♥♥ to break.  -Toxic community 1.Show off high lvls mock low lvls(This makes low lvls sad and most of them quit the game b4 they even reach lvl 20.)P.S i know some friends who quit and play paladins cause of this.  2.The higher level players don't care about balance and will do whatever they can to stop you from balancing the game.And number 1 also applies here.  3.This ruins the games good potential R.I.P dirty bomb  -Unbalance all the high level players will stop you at all cause from you balancing the game so they can win this hapens alot to me most of the time i just get off the game and listen to music and relive stress.

First off I'm sure most of us remember the fun we all had playing games like Unreal Tournament (especially assualt mode) and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. The latter was able to expound on so much more than just simple objective/defend based gameplay that Unreal Tournament popularized. Enemy Territory was able to give incentives for working together with your team by leveling up certain stats, the Objectives were multi-tiered in the sense that not only were there more than 3 any given map but there were numerous secondary objectives that when kept active (or destroyed) would give a certain advantage or a different entrance for attackers/defenders. This kind of dynamic map objective based gameplay was IMO what made the series so appealing for so long. You had the tendency to have certain groups of players go for secondary objectives that would increase the momentum of the attack or vice versa.  There were other kinds of map designs that were really intriguing as well such as that Tank driving through the streets to bust open a Bank level. First off the fact the map relied on you having to strategically make sure the Tank was not only functioning and running but had to clear obstructions while dealing with close quarters guerilla fighting in a city. So. Much. Fun. Thats what makes a game have permenance. Maps with dynamic give and take that allow for many kinds of play styles and team play dynamics.   The classes in that game were very defined and had very specific pros and cons but always in balance would help a team if there were enough of each class.  This game Dirty Bomb gets everything wrong with map design and the objective gameplay, not to mention the class system. The maps are so flawed that there are tons of ways of exploiting kills just by either camping, spawn camping or various other oversights that seem completely foreign for a developer like Splash Damage. On top of that every map has the most arbitrary and useless objectives that usually only amount to 3 max that offer up no change up in the map play style, offer no incentives to play again. Every aspect of the map remains the same every time you play it even after objectives are completed at most itll spawn you somewhere else. Boring. The class system is as cryptic as it gets. Sometimes youll have a player with a ridiculous weapon setup and a medic kit? sometimes you'll have someone who drops ammo. Theres one other one. Nothing is distinct, everythings feels completely off balance and tacked on.  Honestly just boot up ET:Legacy and keep the nostalgia and memories strong of a better time when games and map designs were actually good....this was close to erasing that for me.",

Similar to what occasionally happens in Chivalry, etc.  -The community started out rough for me.. A lot of tools from CoD it seemed. But it's improved in just a few days and my last six or so games were very honorable. More mature of an audience. :D Makes me happy!",

The system rewards with ingame coins, which you can spend on characters and fancy stuff. In addition there are cases (hello there CS:GO) which can be bought or earned by leveling up, which contain some exclusiv stuff or well you know ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff.

The only way is to do a Private Match but in my opinion that's boring. You can also join a friend but the servers your friend gets put into are (obviously) nearly always full. Then I have to admit, that there are so many players that know where I am even though I haven't been spotted or am spotted. These guys might be hackers or the 'Detected' system is totally bugged. And they one final thing that lets me freak out about these 30 Dollars spent on this game is the following: Now if I try to join a match or if I want to play a match and I am already in the game, the game crashes without saying anything. It also happens sometimes when I watch my profile and even when I only started the game. I contacted their support but they just gave me some little tips (which didn't work at all). Now the only thing they say to me is that they're working on fixing this problem. But nothing changed the past 2 months.   Let me tell you: I'm really not a hater. I love FtP-Shooters and that kind of stuff. But when a game I recently spent 30 Dollars on is not even playable for me anymore, then I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

The answer to that is this games weakness, and strength. This game can't decide whether it wants your money or not. Paying real currency towards the game won't get you much, but will give you an advantage. Don't be mistaken though, it won't make you a better player which is great, but at the same time, if you don't pay the game you will save lots of money, but other players who pay will have a slight advantage. This punishes both sides. I don't know if devs will read this, but please don't let this game die. It has a lot of potential, so if you make real currency purely cosmetic, not only will you extend this games' life, but you will also make both sides happy.

            "review_text": "I loved Splash damage's Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and now they deliver again with Dirty Bomb.  First of all, it is a breeze of fresh air that the different characters(mercs) aren't all whites with American accents. There is a big diversity with Africans, Asians and characters with European accents. The shooting and movement feels just as tight as the best FPS games. Graphics are decent and detailed and the maps are all different from each other. The things below are my beef with the game.  But it takes a long time to unlock a merc, and when you do, you must spend credits on it for it to unlock 'loadouts' for the merc, just to be viable with it. All new players only get the classes support(drops ammo, airstrikes) and medic at the start. These support/medic mercs must also have credits spent on them to be viable. For example faster reloading, warning sound when you're near an explosive, more rapid healing and repairing et.c. You get maybe 200-500 credits per match and better loadouts cost 17k credits. New characters cost 30k or 50k credits. Since at the start you just have the core starter mercs support/medic, teams with a lot of newcomers will mostly just have those 2 classes while cash payers or veterans will have access to unlocked snipers, grenadiers and engineers. The more diverse team has more options and an advantage.   You can gamble for or craft new stronger loadouts with lower quality ones that drop during the matches, but with crafted ones you get completely random perks/bonus that might not fit your play style at all. So even if the character is on free rotation, you don't know if it is fun/fitting for you cause you haven't invested in it's perks yet. They're not letting you experiment properly cause they want you to buy credits/mercs/loadouts so bad. So I strongly recommend to buy The Ultimate Starter Pack DLC. Which will spare you a fair bit of all that pain and let you experiment more freely. It's definitely worth it for such a solid game.  There is currently no options to customize your mercs appearance yet, like beards, hats, hairstyles, glasses, clothes. You get a random color with the loadouts you unlock but why does it work like that? Why not let people spend cash on choosing colors or new appearance to lessen the cash milking of players just trying to experiment a bit?   What make the game most frustrating is ending up on the attackers team. When you're on the attacking team you have to interact with objectives, objects that are always camped and spammed with sniper-fire, air strikes, air lasers, mines, grenades etc.. The attacking team is constantly running toward their suicide trying to get close to the objective. Attackers often get their respawn further away from the objective than the defending team. They have to have a diverse team and much more teamwork to complete the objective. All of this make people drop off the attacking team and quit, making it even worse when it takes time for a new player to be deployed in.  In my opinion, the attacking team should have more spread out, more simultaneous objectives so they can get more tactics options instead of tunnel vision zerg rushing to their death at a heavily defended objective/chokepoint. This would force the defenders to use more teamwork and to keep multiple balls in the air at the same time.   As the defending team it takes no teamwork whatsoever to camp spread out and aim in the objects direction. You get lots of points and kills as defender but it really takes almost zero skill and just feels like you're griefing. But if that sounds like your cup of tea, you should always join the defending team since nothing stops you. And nothing encourages you to be attacker. Too bad the maps seem to be set as they are but I hope they get updated.   A great example of a free2play team based shooter which should imho inspire dirty bomb is LOADOUT(before they fired all their developers...), a thirdperson shooter where you don't need to hope for new perks, you easily buy whatever you need from the game store with in-game currency without grinding, the game encourages you to try and experiment with different weapons, skills and tuning them in different ways. The devs get money from people buying appearance options like new clothes, hats, beards and taunts. People even pay 45$ for some of the most expensive customization options, just to support the game and stand out.   Dirty bomb should be more lenient on letting people experiment, have less grinding and change how match objectives work. The game needs some improvements, and I hope Splash Damage can make it the truly flawless gem it can be. It is already really tight and I recommend it for anyone interested in multiplayer, FPS and class teamplay.",

It's got a great sense of humour and has great mechanics, evading the trap of harsh hit-box clicking and instead opting to allow players plenty of health to skirmish with.  Although in BETA mode, in my first hour I have encountered very few bugs and all the imbalances can surely be ironed out in later development. As of right now, this game is highly recommended.",

I haven't had this much fun playing a shooter in a while.  Dirty Bomb places a lot of emphasis on teamwork: certain characters (objective specialists) can take objectives much faster than others, health regenerates, but not very fast, so medics dish out health a lot, and ammo is very scarce, meaning support characters are always dropping ammo. Communication is just as important. I've played with a few teams who all had mics, and we absolutely de_stroyed the other team. The only callout that really matters is a Rhino's location though.  The loadout system is a little confusing, but the basics consist of getting a randomly generated loadout with a selection of guns different than the default. But, just like in TF2, the default weapons are more than capable of dealing with enemies (except the semi-auto sniper, but maybe I'm just good).  I've only come across one hacker who was blatantly aimbotting, but my firend and I told our team and the other team, and we all bullied him until we were able to kick him. This has to be my favorite part of Dirty Bomb: the community. I've ecountered very little salt, and everyone has been pretty nice about playing. This is a relief for me, as I've spent to much time around CS:GO Gold Novas.  Overall, its a very fun game which is a blast to play with friends, and is fairly balanced as well.",

            "review_text": "Despite the MetaCritic Score of 63/100 you see above, which does not make any sense of how much fun you can enjoy Dirty Bomb. In fact, scores are much more preferable to single-player experience games instead, and this game is still in Beta so it got rooms to improve over time  I can just go ahead and tell you in the most plain and simple ansnwer, is Dirty Bomb fun ? Hell Yes !! But I wish the game have more Maps,Modes and Mercs in the beta.......to launch sooner Please note that new contents will launch out pretty slow but they're quality content so I think its fair that the developers really want to make sure everything works properly before they're official out, although there are patches but a stable base of content is what its all about   The maps in this game have been designed really impressive both visually in and competitvely to play, there's main objectives and sub-objectives for you to play, if you're not at a certain skill level to play main objective against the enemy team, but you can assist your team by doing sub-objectives, these mini-objectives can really add some advantage points in both offensive and defensive play  Lets talk about Mercs and gameplay Gameplay is fast and a hella fun, you can basically hip-fire most of the time if you want to because the recoil is very managable, but when you want to shoot from a distance then aiming down sight becomes useful. The damage models of weapons is designed in mind to play as a team and trust me, there's no such thing as one-man-army in Dirty Bomb. I'm not saying that the weapons are that weak, but there is more than just using your guns, its called abilities  Speaking of abilities, there are ranges of Mercs you can play with, they all comes with different play styles and roles There's Engineer Mercs where you're the best with Objective, you arm/diffuse C4, repair Objectives faster than other Mercs Medic Mercs are....well.....keeping you and people bascially, not the best with Objectives or Mowing down enemies but its fustrating to die in this game.....so it make sense to keep people alive rather than stay dead and watching the enemy team kicking butts while you waiting to respawn, right ? Support Mercs generally are slighty more useful than the rest...in combat, they give you ammo and agressive death-from-above airstrikes, a friend you can always have in team And then there's Combat specalist, big guns and knives just to kil, and kill, and kill. They control the flow of the fight and have very agressive play styles  Dirty Bomb business models is not really hard to understand, majorly on Mercs and Loadout Cards (Cards that gives each of your Merc a set of different guns, mini-perks boost to gameplay [like Burn Cards in Titanfall] and if you're lucky enough, there are also special skins on rare sides)  You can buy Mercs for 50,000 credits each from your hard earned in-game cash, or use real life $10 if you want them instantly without have to grind them for so long, same would apply to Loadout Cards but slightly cheaper Even tho you don't have to spend a real-life dime to earn all these, you can just play regualry and will earn a good amount of fortune over time.  This is not a Pay-to-Win kind of game, I can just tell you straight that, no matter if you got the rarest Loadout Cards, only get cosmetic elements out of it besides mini-perks. Or if you have all the Mercs, especially the powerful ones ,you won't win all the time; they all have their strengths and weaknesses to balance out the game and like I said, there's no such thing as one-man-army in this game When there's new Mercs coming in, there's usually free rotation (similar to Leage of Legends) and you can try out new Mercs for a week or two before you decide to buy or not Also crate drops when you play regularly, and open them for a random Loadout Card To many useless cards ? there's a crafing feature to a higher value card for your favorite Merc You will lose some in-game money when you craft a higher value card : More rare card = more 'tax' money  Hey, it is what it is  I highly reccommend you focus your money on Mercs you want first, then Loadout Card once you want to invest your Merc as your playstyle and cosmetic the least BUT, if you got money to burn on everything that the game has to offer, well...nobody stopping you lol  But hey there's nothing bad about it either, just learn a few things about the game first then its your freedom to pick and do whatever ways that fit you, thats all i'm saying. Plus, Dirty Bomb have the most honest commercial and trailers I've ever seen, the game hides nothing and steals nothing from you at all, all out in the open and I like it c:    I really wish you would earn more credits each match, but you can earn slighty more thanks to daily missions and random bonuses if you do well in game (doing Objectives, kills more and Supports)  Speaking of doing well, there's 3 main rule that can help you play better and earn better cash : 1. O.b.j.e.c.t.i.v.e 2. Play your role (Use your abilities) 3. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥   Words from Splash Damages themselves lol  Its easy to learn, but hard to master   So yea, even in Beta I still have so much fun, and this game really have alot of potential (very) There are few things that needs to improve and minor bugs to fix but these are not ruining the experience that much, Splash Damage surprisingly holds the candle really well for a Beta, and fair to say at least I really recommend you play this game, it cost you nothing to try but when you digging yourself in and invest whatever you feel cool to it, it's gonna be a very rewarding and competitve experience  And and more thing before I finally end this review : Play it Dirty   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  P.S Sorry if my English is annoying to read, it's my second language anyway :P",

Doesn't get punished for it since yeh, takes a long time to kill people, even people with high skill can't really punish that unless they are playing sniper.  I want to commend them for making every class viable though. It feels like they all have their own role and everyone is useful in one way or another. Unlike CSTrash where 3 weapons are viable.  I'm looking forward to a legitimate FPS game since there hasn't been one since Bad Company 2, hoping this will be the one x).. But they have a LOT to improve on. Do i recommend it?

The ones that one-shot you with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mg that is supposed to be really weak. Then you think well ok maybe i can just kick this guy and maybe ban him. Nope. The kick system is a little hard to figure out and plus half the times when you press the vote button nothing even happens.  Also now its harder to get better loadout cards since they took away the upgrade system, which was almost the only way to get better loadout cards without spending a fortune on different cases in which the percentage for getting a gold or cobalt is so small its almost impossible. Now you have to craft them in which 'craft' wouldn't be the first word I'd use. More like sacraficing most of your cards and A LOT of your money just to get a single loudout card. Another thing is now they are ripping every part of you off just to get money. You start out with two mercs: Aura (medic) and Skyhammer (regular soldier). If you want more mercs good for you! Just 10 dollars per merc! Want better loadout cards for that new merc? Cool! About another 5 bucks please! You can also get them with 50,000 credits in which would literally take FOREVER unless you buy a credit booster in which you would still need A REALLY long time to get that much which means you would have to buy the 18 hour one which is 7-8 dollars. Yep.  Finally the team divider is the worst piece of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever witnessed. Sometimes you get one team that is full of people ranging from levels 1-10 and team two 25-71. Other times there is one team with one or two people and other has 5-7 people. So yeah overall this game could definately use some better things added and until then I will not waste money on this game because it is really not worth the money yet or give it a better review.",

A lot of bugs, some persistent, some fixed and reintroduced in later updates.  Poor optimization, frequent fps drops and lags (reported even by users with hi-end last-gen Intel cpus and Nvidia gpus).  Laggy and jumbled menu.  Very limited selection of weapons and abilities (some are useless, some almost essential) in the form of 'loadout cards'. Yea. Card games are popular. Let's implement it into a fps gaym.  Absolutely awful matchmaking producing mostly grossly unbalanced cringe-inducing matches you've ever played in a mp fps gaym.  Not enough content and forever beta ie. if they earn enough money already why come out of beta and lose all the excuses for a buggy mess anyway.  And btw. you will not find the fact that this gaym's presented as a beta anywhere on the store page.   But after you download and launch it, there you go. Beta. What a nice surprise.  Did I mention the terrible RNG system?  You may like this gayme if you're into gambling, roulettes and such.  And for the love of God stay away from the forums as it's a dirty cesspool of depraved raging bestiality promoting insidious pc homosexuals.  But if you from some reason you'll feel the need to visit that terrible place, be very careful about your choice of words.  Because apparently in a game about violently and mercilessly murdering people with meelee weapons, firearms, explosives etc. it's forbidden to express yourself with words some egoistical big-headed moderator deems not fit.  It's understandable - after you virtually murdered thousands of people, you certainly don't want to hurt their feelings with dirty bombing words.  So consult a moderator about the appropriateness of your post before you publish it unless you want to get banned for any arbitrary reason by a lying, moderation privileges abusing treacherous coward.  And last but not least nekson employees and their friends writing absurdly positive reviews.  But that's been a common thing with steam for some time so no surprise here.  Edit. I completely forgot to mention one of the most baffling things about this game.  After you've spent lots of hours / monies to unlock all the merc you want and ofc all the best loadouts for all of them when you're about to enter a game, your selection is suddenly limited to only 3 with just one loadout per each - at least let me change the loadout in-game, I just can't see this being anything else but another unnecessary obstacle/restriction on the way to fully enjoy the gaym.  And the most rage inducing thing about this particular issue of mine is the measly time of a few seconds you have to pick 3 mercs and their respective loadouts after map selection is confirmed in the server browser menu.  Did I mention the menus not being of the most responsive kind?  It just seems to me like an arbitrary limit imposed on the players.  Maybe if you could pick any merc you've already unlocked by grinding/paying $10/each you'd damage the perfectly crafted levels of balance in most matches.  Edit. 7th October 2016 - 780 players online. So if you still from some inexplicable reason want to play this gaymeh, do it now because its plug is going to be pulled very soon.",

Game modes can be long winded for some that can steer you away from putting long sesions in.  The key problem though... Its a F2P game and thats good for the playerbase, As of current though me and many others will not continue to play for the time being as theres no customisation, sure theres various things that make your character slightly different, but theres no purchaseable asthetics that can just make you look better.  With practically no visual customisation at this point, the game gets stale, and its not just a case of looking better than someone else, its to support the future of the game too, because some of us like grinding to get all the characters with in game cash, and in this game that will take quite a while.  Brink managed customisation, So why cant this? theres a lot of options this game can take with customisation, not just stickers and reskins of characters, cant be that boring.

In addition the balencing on the characters is not amazing, and you can tell that some characters are just worth playing more than others. This can kind of work as an analagy for Dirty Bomb®. Sure, it's not terrible, It's just that there are better free, class-based first-person shooters out there. It would be better if it had a certain niche to fill, but it just doesn't. Maybe in time it will have added things that will make Dirty Bomb® stick out from the others and balence a few things, but until then I can't reccomend it when there are just flat-out better options.",

            "review_text": "This game does quite a bit right, but the Pay-to-Win elements really hurt it and make it difficult to recommend.  The card system is an interesting one that has a lot of promise--you take in three different cards (that you unlock through cases that are random drops / can be bought for 1k in game credits) and can swap between them during the match to find the most appropriate merc. The problem lies, however, in that to use most of the mercs they need to be either on rotation for free or bought for an obscene amount of in game credits or real world cash. You may have high level cards for the mercs, but you cannot use them unless you have the merc unlocked.  This becomes a major problem for gameplay balance. Enemy team have a sniper or two because they have unlocked them through hours of grinding credits or bought the merc? Unless you have done the same you better hope your team has brought a sniper. Same goes for the merc with the turret and the newly released sticky bombs. Many of the maps have long shooting lanes so a competent sniper can grind an advance to a halt.  This particular Pay-to-Win structure also falls apart because even if you grind enough in-game credits to buy a merc it does not mean that you will be able to fight toe-to-toe with similar mercs due to the card system. Buying cards isn't too expensive--it takes 4 - 5 matches to get one. The problem lies in that the system is totally random and the higher level cards grant different abilities and give different weapons. Lower level cards may not have any added abilities at all. One again, this can be circumvented by buying in-game money with real-world money.  These systems are a major disappointment because the maps are a lot of fun to play and the gameplay is quite good. The movement is fluid, the guns feel decent if not a little weak to shoot, and the class and card system is genuinely an interesting thing. Splash Damage is one of the few developers that really structures their games around teamwork and that's still the case here. It's just that the Pay-to-Win structure actively works against that so you can have a team that works well together and still lose the majority of the time due to not throwing money down to get access to more varied mercs.   I'm curious to see how this game pans out in the long run. It's fun when it works right with evenly matched teams, but once you get people who have paid money in the mix it gets ugly quick.",

You just need to play a lot and use the ingame currency that you're rewarded to buy a 'chance' at them. Also, if you spend IRL money you're buying for a 'chance' at a good loadout card. I think the game may have potential, but for now I still don't think it's worth your time unless you're broke and are bored of other f2p games.  EDIT (#2): The game is highly unoptimized.

Controls are great, Graphics are very nice and gives you access to basically everything to turn on or off in the Advanced Video settings, The gunplay is great especially with the choice of being able to turn off mouse smoothing. Very fast and action packed gameplay with 3 MP types but all I played was Objective just for the fact it was the only one I could play at the time. So, yeah it's a great game and has tons of replay value. But, you may ask, Why did I not recommend it then?  Well, you see. Because of all the ♥♥♥♥ing microtransaction in game. I get it, it's F2P. They need to make money somehow right? But $10 for a single Merc is completely insane and not even worth it. If I were to buy every Merc in the game for $10 a piece, I would be able to buy Overwatch TWICE. Not once, But Twice. A game with much more replayabilty and lacks in the microtransaction department for the sake of their fans, as well as gives you every character for free upon launch. But I can hear you groaning in the comments saying 'Oh you don't have to buy them' or 'They don't force them on you'. Yet I used 30,000 Credits on Cases and converted all the unusable cards into 'fragments' that are used to create new more rare cards, and it wanted to charge me MORE to create that card. 25,000 Credits in fact. Even if the Cards aren't necessary for the sake of playing the game but they do provide an edge over other players so wouldn't that be considered unfair for other players that don't spend real world money just to get a card that makes them better at a game? I just think it's a shady practice to load a fantastic game with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of microtransactions because well, 'We can'.",

            "review_text": "This is a bad game. Even after coming back to this game that fact still stands and it stands tall. Here are just few reasons why.  1. The games fps is normally quite low even if you have a decent pc and that fact rings true with a lot of players and in a fast paced fps you can't have that but the developers have not yet seemed to address this. 2. Obviously players who have played a game for longer will have an advantage over newer players, this is how to should be, but the difference should be skill based and not perk based like it is in dirty bomb. If you dont know how the gae play works then basically you can unlock cards which give a certain class different weapons, skins and perks. New players don't get these perks and and whilst you wouldn't think that a extra clip of ammo or a medic pack health boost would help you that much then you need to think again. 3. Like I said before the cards change a merks weapons and some of these cards are alot better than others. For example one merc called Aura is a medic who uses a shotgun. Having her use a shotgun makes her balanced because it means that she has to get close to an enemy before she can kill them, so people can shot her from far away without much difficulty, killing the teams medic. Now lets say that she has a card which gives her a sub machine gun extra healing power and a couple of extra clips for good measure, congrats you just made a tank who can revive team-mates and kill from all ranges. 4. Dirty Bomb uses a merc rotation system which allows players to use mercs that they don't own, whilst at first this make the games seem varied, it just makes all the matches the same for a week and sometimes everyone having the same merc is a bad thing. For example one week the merc Kira was on rotation and her ability is to summon a lazer from the sky to kill the enemys and also damage objectives. In modes where you have to push an objective she is hard to beat as she can destroy the objective meaning you have to repair it, normally this would be fine but when everyone can be kira, ♥♥♥♥ goes down. I played a game in which my taeam spent 10 minutes repairing the objective just for it to be destroyed a second later, this happened for the entire match repeatedly. This then happened again on the next server, and then again on the one after that.  I find it shocking that Splash damage are trying to get money out of this game when it is in this sorry state and they can say that 'it's still in open beta' but the fact that Spalsh Damgae is focusing on flashly cards tells me overwise.",

The game's competitive scene is a joke now. Everything competitive about the game went out the window the patch after Redeye's release. If you don't know who Redeye is, he's a merc.  The game uses a mercenary system. Think LoL. You buy a merc and you keep him / her. There's a free rotation but most of them are 50,000 credits. You get 100-250 points a match (roughly 20 minute matches, stopwatch is twice this) and a 500 bonus for your first win in each mode per day. In other words, you farm pubs and missions (every 3 hrs) until you can buy someone.  _____________________ Long story short, I was in a competitve team. We were mostly gold 1, and our shotcaller was/is cobalt. Bugs glossed over / hackers were too abundant to invest any more time into the game. I come back and it's a mess of nerfs and unrewarding play that punishes you for having any degree of skill.   If you're new, you'll have fun for a few days. Then you'll get a grip and quit.

I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.",

I hate this game... you literally only live for max 30 seconds unless you sit in a corner some where. After you die... you have to wait 20 seconds to respawn, and the only way to get better gear is to use crates(which hardly give you better weapons) or buy them for real money. Also, you have the choice to save up 50,000 coins to unlock a new character(which will take ages) or you spend $9.99 out of your steam wallet to buy one. The gameplay overall is decent no doubt about it, but for god's sake.... the respawn time, the lack of health you get, and how poor the damage is on default weapons is unbearable, and makes this game a complete waste of 20 minutes to download.",

You can buy them for $10.00 a piece...)  Inability to choose Merc weapons without using pre-sorted 'cards' that also choose the bonuses. (You can buy these for money)  End Game coin isn't dependant on match preformance... So no matter how many kills, headshots, assists, revives, or support you give in a game... you'll average about the same.  The coin bonuses are not worth buying... at most they double the end match gains. The norm seems to be an extra 100 coins.  So some quick math...  50,000/200= 2,50 matches...  Each match lasts about 15-20min 250*20= 5,000min  83 hours/Merc unlock?!?!?!?!  Not including card unlocks... They're forcing you to spend $, I think its a backhanded tactic.  Goodluck.",

Also free to play, meant limitations. You don't have full access to all characters, you get two starters and and whatever three guys are allocated weekly.

Do you like pay-to-win kiddies to spam instagib rhinos and grenades at you for ten minutes at a time while you can barely leave your spawn? If so, I recommend smashing your head against a brick wall until you fall unconscious. That is about how fun this game is. To sum up my 8 hours of experience, leave spawn, rhino in corner, die before I get a chance to react.  Leave spawn, mine in a corner that I can't possibly see, get instagibbed before I have a chance to react. Disarming an objective, and having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spamming grenade after grenade after grenade and loads of mines down the ceiling so you're instagibbed with no hope of revival.  This game is pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at its best. It could be fun, if they made up for the low time to kill by removing instagibs, or by making instagibs a crapshoot. But in it's current state, I have to say that this is among the worst first person shooters I've played this year. Do not recommend, 2/10. *EDIT* Having played more lately, I can safely confirm that my words still hold true. The game is FULL of spawncamping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, spammable instant kill abilities from mercs that cost $10 a pop, so definitely still pay-to-win, and an utterly inert and frankly brainless developer that does nothing to ban obvious cheaters. I've made numerous reports, and that's done nothing.  High health cheats that make it take three magazines to the dome to even down enemies, instant kill cheats that make assault rifles kill you immediately from across the map, and not to mention the constant aimbots that unerringly hit headshots from across the map with SMGs. This is the worst competitive game on Steam, and there is zero competition for how abysmal this game is. Avoid it at all costs.",

(( -Universally the game- sry dont wana wride this again. I made such a beautiful text where the developers would start crying BUT I HAD A ♥♥♥♥IGN INTERNET CRASH DOWN AND NOW I'AM ♥♥♥♥♥♥ true story:/ :C (maby I am gona write this again sometime) ))   -loudoutcards-  So loudoutcards are basically a good idea but there are a few problems who I want to talk about now. First of all I alwready done a review and it was about specaledition cards what I want to show you guys now:  'HowTHE ♥♥♥♥ can you give me a specialedition phantom card with with..  WITH A KNIFE!!!  Wy are people playing phantom 1 UNVISSIBLE 2 KATANA  AND NOW IF YOU GET A ULTIMATE SUPER EDOTION CARD WITH A KNIFE  ITS NOT WORTHIT PLAYING PHANTOM ANYMORE cause of depressions and stuff  but now comes the best: YOU CANT RECICLE THEM FOR ♥♥♥♥. NOW I HAVE THIS PICA OF ♥♥♥♥ ON MY INVENTORY AND CANT GET IT OUT (besides by deleteing it but ♥♥♥♥ no I ain't gonna do that) Plz splashdamage fix this it cant be that hard'  So what my wish was first of all : that specalcards are getting reciclebile And secondly that you give PLZ any phantom card a katana. I mean a phantom withoit one would be lika a proxy with out mines or a phonix without a healing power.  Now the next thing is that its way to expensive to craft a cobalt. And everybody just crafts goldcards. I MEAN THE POOR COBALTS DONT YOU HEAR THEM CRYING???? Sry:*D    -A MARKET FOR LOUDOUTCARDS-  Yup that sould realy exist. Even that your cards are in your steaminventory would be nice enough to make something like the dota or cs:go poker/market websites.  The game wold be more famous cause you could make money with it AND DONT SAY THAT DIRTY BOMB IS FAMOUS!!   -The teambase-  Yea, what should I say abut the teambase... Fist I want to say that there is sometimes just one high levl who decides between winning and losing. And sometimes look the teams like this:  Attack lvl Defend lvl  Bob 6 Pewdiefan 65 ♥♥♥♥♥destroyer 2 ThaPRO55 11 XxxSainxxX 9 _Snobdogg_ 43 [AMFD]Simon 11 6925-Trex 36 Bot666 3 Martinlutter 9 Gangster659 1 MichaelJack ∞  Yea besides the unlimeted symbol is it so many times like that PLZ FIX THAT   That is my opinion at 100 hours, lets see what I am going to say at 200 hours  king regards: Snowpainterwhite",

After a long haul of tweaking and fiddling from alpha to the current state of closed beta, the movement, weaponary and general flow finally feels satisfying and whole. (and as a sad refection on the industry, it feels more 'complete' as far as mechanics go than a lot of final release AAA's that hide behind graphics and rail-campaigns)  The hip shooting and sight aspect finally feels like it makes sense in what will become an instinctual way for the player with persistent play once the game is up and released. Kinda hard to really get into that skill-groove without a regular string of populated matches though.  Last match before writing this, I struggled to use double jump when it was to my advantage... not because it is hard, but because of all the bad habits we get used to, having to adapt the flaws and limitations of most other FPS'ers.   All of those unique mechanics that made us think tactically just, in an organic way... those things that made us love W:ET, ETQW, and wanted to see tweaked and properly balanced/supported/explored in Brink... DB is finally in a state where it can showcase its potential to everyone beyond the hardcore ET crowd of yesteryear.  Very much looking forward to the final release to play on more regular, populated servers.",

            "review_text": "I don't recommend this game until it comes closer to being done. Right now the game is horribly imbalanced, with some classes making others obsolete. An example right now is Fletcher and Proxy, Where Fletcher whose shotgun can tick you for 55 damage from across the map, has the defuse buff, and sticky grenades that can deny an entire room, as well as has 120 health. Compare this to proxy, who has 90 health, is a little faster but only has mines that have a much smaller radius and the shotguns she is given are extremely innacurate and do next to no damage even on a point blank meatshot. Theres just simply no reason to play her unless you just want a female model.  Another huge problem I've run into with this game is that the current anti-cheat is next to non-existant. Once I got out of the level five locked rooms, every other match had people with an insanely high level with all cobalt characters and topscoring at the end of the match. Even upon going into spectator watching them lock onto people through walls and twitch to perfectly trach someone's head made it so obvious they were cheaters that its damn-right embarassing that what little anti-cheat the game has didn't pick it up. My final point, is as of right now there are maybe six maps total, and only one game-mode. The dev team appears to be spending alot more time on making new mercenaries as opposed to making actual content for the game that within four games, you've probably played the same map twice. This, along with the above make it almost miserable to play in its current stage. Just do yourself a favor, hold off till its done.",

All of the UI is clean and easy to navigate through. The gameplay is fast-paced, but easy to follow. The graphics are smooth and exciting. I love the HUD while inside of a match, it shows everything the mini-map does. The map designs are well-done. Even in your first game, you will be able to follow through a map to each objective without much of a problem. Lighting in Dirty Bomb is amazing. The enemies don't blend in to the background like some shooter games, making it difficult to spot and aim (unless they're using Phantom hehehe). The recoil on the guns are nice and balanced. The crosshair by default is a clean dynamic crosshair to help the noobies with a dot in the middle, however, it can be changed to a single dot for the more experienced players.   My favorite thing about Dirty Bomb is the movement. It is clean and easy, but still allows players to learn something new to get better. Running, jumping, and staying on the move is practically instinct after a few hours of playtime. Wall jumping, however, is something that requires a bit of attention to the map design and takes a little bit of time to learn. I love it. It keeps it exciting.  My only complaint so far for Dirty Bomb is I'd like to easily be able to party up with Steam friends also playing the game and join a server together. Possibly even create our own private match to have fun in. Right now, partying with friends is only available in the competitive mode.  Overall, Dirty Bomb is an exciting fast-paced objective-centered FPS that does a lot of little details that make or break a game perfectly.",

So you start enjoying it, but after a while it goes stale and kinda warm, but i mean hey you still have a beer, right? And in the end a beer is a beer, enjoy it. Drink Responsibly, or not; your choice.   Pros: - Simple already known controls for most - Hi-viz graphic style - characters are well balanced  - not pay to win - quick match joining (93.6% of the time) - that last percentage was completely made up but accurate to my knowledge - ninja jumping - free  - fast paced   Cons: - empty updates not addressing community concerns - i have played the same maps, over and over again - hackers? still there through multiple different antihack systems no reporting them (EXTREME annoyance)  - no campaign or solo mission (not a con to me but to some it may be) - unbalanced teams may lead to spawn camping - only two game modes to choose (which in the end are basically the same thing)  This game has FUN written all over it, but not 100+ hours in. Same repetitive maps. Hackers everywhere. I would recommend it for the first 60 hours or so, after that you will feel the game drag on. Developers are not listening to mass consumer requests concerns and issues. As you experience more and more of the game you can start noticing that this game is in perma-beta like state.    Every video the devs post about updates goes like this : hey guys we are bringing you new stuff and working hard on having it finished but we are still not done yet so stick in there and next update we will keep you informed (about how we are not done yet)   But there are brilliant moments in game such as: - coming around a corner with a mini gun and just mowing people down - defusing a bomb with 1 second left on the timer - ninja wall jumping - whacking someone in the face with a cricket bat and hearing that sweet sound - you can be an invisible samurai weirdo   Overall it is a very objective based game, that requires teamwork to accomplish most tasks. The hackers really steal the light from this game. Devs arent pushing quality in their updates. Lots of characters to choose from but not many maps. Only two game modes to choose from. No competitive scene really. Casual run and gun that can really pull you in to try harder.    PS dirty bomb is not a beer.",

All in all, it's a good romp for a bit of mindless fun, the Free play structure is fairly balanced and not once did I feel I had to spend a dime, if they can balance up the weaponry and maps a bit while making sure to maintain a scorched earth policy against hack users, this game has potential to be around for a long time to come.

Graphic settings are well mediocre but what would you expect in a FTP to be honest, the gameplay is fun, some lag in servers but most likely on my part even though other people complain about it to so i do not know about this one?    Let me just say this if you want a game like 'COD' but a little more 'cartoony' this would be it!     Having no recoil is actually kinda cool in a game like this. I have noticed when using a gold tier loadout on the sniper card, It is a two shot headshot on people except when they are on turrets which does not make sense to me so i do not know if that is how it is supposed to be or not.    (Please note that I am only lvl 4 or 5) Getting credits at 270 or around that in a game even if you are leading the team is really low. There are missions that bring in 500-1000 extra, But it still is not that much. A character loadout card being around 30,000 or higher so it will take alot of gameplay to get that much gold for one character so in my personal experince this is the games biggest flaw i just do not agree with the pricing but it is not my place to disrespect the deveolpers on how they want to make the game.   [ALSO there is a Free rotation which changes the characters you get to use for free, so buying characters would be more toward playing as your favorites]    Right now there is only 4 maps if i am right? because that is all i observed so i could be wrong. the maps are pretty balanced so i have nothing to complain about when it comes to this.   [This is the point where I lost my focus and forgot everything I was going to say so have a good day!]",

They do not let you choose which mercs you want to become your permanent ones in the begging which leads to matches that are full of similar mercs. There is no weapon customization or character customization apart from the different quality cards you unlock ( mercs) by doing missions. The drops ( variants of mercs) from the common boxes is a joke. The servers are small.  The map design gives clear advantages to one side ( attacker or defender).

There are multiple ways to get to a location making it so the enemy has to allocate their resources carefully or they can be flanked and taken out. I've heard rumors of lots of hackers in the game but to date have not seen or expierienced any in my games.  The only negatives I can think off; Respawns are too fast. Makes it very difficult to plant C4's on the objectives when you respawn in ~5-10seconds and just a room over. The teams can be really unbalanced in terms of skill level, but that's not something you can really fix in Quick Match games, just be warned if you are a veteran FPS player you will get terrible teammates that have no idea what they are doing and this is not a game you can solo carry.  Overall, 8.5/10. I look forward to seeing how this game devolps further and am excited for what comes next.",

Ill go through the pros and cons but still its a pretty damn good game.  -This game is really intense. You have the possibility to jump on walls and win firefights like that or get faster to the objective.  -There are no Pay2Win mechanics in the game what is actually good for an Free2Play game. Dont play a F2P if its Pay2Win ist not good for you.  -There are alot of classes now and there even come much more, but they are not always very good made like aura. She is extrem fats and has low hp thats ok BUT her healing station is just too op at the moment. To get the health 24/7 when you are stading in it is too op and the only way to win against someone in there is to give im headshots only.  -Another bad thing is that you have a fixed loadout. Much very much people hate this. I have now a silver proxy (could make gold but i save the others) and she has this 1 ability I honestly dont need. To throw back grenades. First the grenade of fragger is an instant explosion and second i never meet one of them ingame. So the possibility to destroy single Loadouts and swap Weapons/Perks would be an awesome addition to the game (I dont want a golden proxy with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shotgun).  -Well also one bad thing is that there is only one Gamemode at the Moment (stopwatch is Objective 2x), but you can excuse that its an closed beta now.  -(this one is not very serious) WHY I AM DESTROYING THINGS IN A TOWN WHERE NOONE LIVES ANYMORE. AND WHY THE DEFENDERS CARE. ITS AN GHOSTTOWN  Also if there are some negative things its still much better than most of the games wich are out now (whole CoD, and everything after halo3) so i would defenitly recommend to get this game on steam or try to get it with an beta key.

(I was recently in a match with a level 2, a level 3, and a level 4 on my team and the lowest level on the other team was level 5. Needless to say, we were defeated horribly.) -A lot of people say Proxy is OP, and I agree with them. This game is too fast paced to look out for her mines. I suggest making them slightly louder and therefore slightly easier to avoid. -Create a mission with a large payout that encourages playing the objective. Something like, 'plant/defuse 3 C4 charges for 1000 coins.'  Also, this problem is so obvious it probably doesn't need saying, but something has to be done about the sniper, Vassili. He can barely help with objectives, which in a way makes it good for him to be on the other team, but he is simply an annoyance. I understand that his counter is probably another Vassili to counter-snipe him, but that doesn't always happen. I've been in rounds against two of them and it completely kills gameplay. I am really looking forward to execution, but it seems like the perfect mode for him and I don't want it to become Call of Duty. I'm not trying to say that this game is like Call of Duty (If it was, I wouldn't be playing it) and I have never actually played as Vassili, but I have gotten sniped in the head enough to know that it must be quite easy and to edit this review in order to express my concerns about the sniper.",

The maps are very well made, the classes have a lot of variations between themselves, but...man, that matchmaking...

I don't understand why most F2P games require a new account when they are on Steam.  Gameplay is dapper. I really like it, I have little to complain about. I haven't spotted any pay to win yet. Its very similar to League of Legends in the F2P design. You have a pool of free characters that switch every week.  Try it for yourself.",

Pros: Good cartoony graphics Great game-play Fun team-based objectives/battles Good servers  Cons: The loadouts/shop system could be better The server browser is laggy and buggy Some might think some mercs are too expensive  Keep in mind that this game is in beta, and I belive that the (extermely minor) cons will be eliminated soon, so download it, you won't regret it.",

Balance  Rhino, the tank class with the minigun, is a tank for damage and has an extremely high fire rate. While the damage for each bullet for the minigun is low, the fire rate makes it so that if you're standing out in front of a rhino for 2 seconds you're dead. Another thing about this class, is that it's exactly the same as the others with it's spawns. It can be revived, it can respawn just like every other class with no extra wait, and because of its health, takes longer to finish off at a distance, leaving more time for a medic to come and revive him back to full health.

The game also suffers from a medium gunplay and an absolutely horrible feedback in the combat aswell as your character (am i running or rolling on a skateboard ? I'm not sure...). After a few matches i already had enough... It's free and only takes 3go to download so you can try it for yourself, but i'd rather suggest you to go and buy CS:GO if you want a good team based fps for 9€.

At times, playing fast and getting out the skill for teammates (ammo/health/etc.), the object would stay in my hands for a few seconds, meaning, I don't have my gun out which then gets me stuck doing nothing, waiting to be killed in all the action. It might be a delay to go back or it might be a double press, anything could be causing it. I just hope that this one thing in particular gets looked at and I'll be happy.  So, for the conclusion.

I will start off the review saying that I am not a fan of the 'Free to Play' model for games....I feel that 'most' of the time, the games that follow this model are lacking in their finish and that it is just a cheap gimmick by developers to leach as much money out of people as possible...  They start you off with two characters for your squad out of 12. 3 other characters are cycled..weekly?...until you unlock the additional characters to fill out your squad... Each character costs either $6 or $10 or 30K-50K in-game credits, which you earn after each match....the problem with this is that in order to unlock all characters, you're looking at either about a hundred dollars or many many many game hours.  Then there are the loadouts...every once in a while you earn a box, inside the box is a card for one of the 12 characters...what you get is random, as is the quality of what you get...of course, you can opt to BUY a loadout...but again that is $6 per card, or something like that....  And we see where we are going with this...  If you want the full game, and you don't feel like wasting hours and hours [and hours] waiting for chance to favor you to get a modestly better weapon for your character (if you are one of 'those' type of hardcore gamers) it would be easy to spend WAY MORE on this game than it is worth.  Is this game worth $60? No, I don't think so. $20-$30, yes, maybe. The fact is, it is not a finished product; it is a work in progress...and that is why I hate the 'Free to Play' model; so many of the games are 'works-in-progress' that never feel like they are completed. But maybe that is just me showing my age; afterall, I grew up in an era where you had to go to the store to buy a videogame, on a disc/cartridge, and it cost $50-$60, unless it was old, or sucked, and had found itself to the bargain bin. But at least you didn't have to keep dishing out cash in order to have a completed product.  That being said...  ...this is actually one of the better 'Free to Play' games that I have played....graphics are decent, action is tight, the maps are objective based and well designed attacker/defender style, characters seem well balanced; overall, it is a fun game.",

It is a great game though there seriously needs to be some sort of automatic team balance aspect when a team is getting stomped, barely building a score compared to the other team on like 5k+ each. The unbalance teams really make you lose interest in the game even if it just a normal game. I dont know if the game has gained a big enough player base yet but I have seen a good few times were players between levels 14-30+ being matched with people of 1-7 where they stomp the other team and even one time where a team consisted the fast majority of 10-30-ish leveled players vs a team of 1-9 leveled players and the game made no effort to mix things up. There may be a vote to mix up the teams but there needs to be a automatic one cause people simply dont know how to make a vote and others like a team completely stomping another team will be reluctant to vote of course instead of having a fair game.",

You go in with your choice of mercenary and loadout card, which will give you a primary and secondary weapon, as well as 1-3 abilities. You use these abilities to support your team in offensive, defensive, and support roles, trying to attack or defend an objective depending on what team you are on. Luckily, random players without voice chat are pretty good about playing as a team and not running off trying to be a hero, or refusing to use their ability when the team needs it.  Oh, and if you forgot, it's free. Download it!  The main cons as of now are the small amount of maps (5 total), and on occasion, the game will be very laggy, with game breaking spikes of lag, for around 2 matches. This happens maybe 20-30% of the time. It is in beta though, so it's to be expected. It'a also worth noting you can pay for better loadout cards (I'm not sure about directly, but I know for sure you can gamble for them). However, you also can earn them without paying, and I have no problem staying competitive with the worst loadouts.  9.5/10 overall, and definitely the most fun I've had with a shooter in a long time.",

Earning credits is straight forward and simple like it should be, but lacks diversity in ways to obtain credits. Simply adding the ability to earn credit multipliers through killstreaks may change my mind. Playing the objective needs a more rewarding outcome. Possibly giving players extra credits for objective play would incentify those who like to lone wolf to get up close and personal in the action. This would also bring another avenue of earning credits into the equation. Ultimately, If I were someone that has any authority when it comes to games and game reviews I would give Dirty Bomb an 8/10 as a game, and a 10/10 as a Free To Play title.

Every single map is tailored to one team to win, for example if you're playing on Trainyard or Chapel then Defense will win about 90% of the time. While if you're on Terminal or Underground Offense will generally win garenteed. Bridge being the only reasonably fair map out of all the games leaves much to be desired as I feel like it's not based on how well your team is (I had some damn good teams be whiped on some of these maps) or how skillful your whole team is. The game's map design is lopsided. Generally Chapel and Trainyard being the worst as you have to push the objective right next to their spawn (Where unless they all die at once and well before the next wave) they come right back to fight you.   The good points about this game, it's fast paced, flanking feels very good as the maps have many routes to go about, there's light parkor in this game, and weapons feel good to use. While on the surface it's a good game, playing with almost garenteed wins or losses ruins the experience for me, making it more of a predictable outcome.

The game follows admirably in the developers' previous titles footsteps like CW: Enemy Territory and Brink, combining a bit of parkour with multiple character classes, each with abilities that enable them to complete objectives much more readily with a bit of teamwork.  The emphasis on teamwork and objectives means that public games can be hit-and-miss, but this is no fault of the game but rather the players themselves. Technically the game is great - a few minor bugs aside, it runs very well (though some have said it causes memory leaks, I haven't experienced these myself), looks quite nice and 'feels' good. The gunplay is solid, hit detection is on point, net code seems good and balance is quite good considering how many classes and abilities are in play.  Some have expressed concerns about Dirty Bomb being pay-to-win, which it absolutely is not. This is just misinformation. Players get cases by playing the game and as rewards for levelling, which contain loadout cards. These cards vary in quality from lead (most common) to cobalt (rarest). Though lead and iron loadout cards have only 1 and 2 perks respectively, bronze, silver, gold and cobalt variants of loadouts are identical save for cosmetic differences. All of these can be obtained simply by playing the game.  That said credit gain is a bit slow and it will take you a good amount of time to get enough in-game credits to unlock new mercenaries in order to utilize those loadout cards. This is presumably to incentivize real-money purchases and as developers have to eat too, I can't fault them for that. I've shelled out for the starter pack and for one of the merc bundles and do not regret it at all, as the game is genuinely a lot of fun.",

Summary: After playing this game for 50 ish hours, I wanted to write a review. I absolutely adore this game, I really do. What makes this game stand out is not only the speed (think of what Brink SHOULD'VE been), but the run n' gun style gameplay that was huge back in the mid 2000s (Soldier Front, Combat Arms, etc). Given the fact this game is free to play and I just referenced Combat Arms, some of you might be worried, and rightfully so. I've only seen one or two blatant cheaters - 170+ kills in a 10 minute Objective match as Rhino. The rest of who most people claim are 'cheating' are just really, really good players. A large amount of these players are Vassili, the sniper, and he's somewhat frequently on rotation, so I've seen quite a bit of calling out over that. Rest assured, it's not a huge problem.  Nexon is listed with this game, which will turn some people off. The reality is this - Nexon is simply publishing the game. Splash Damage controls the IP and what happens to the game, so don't look at Nexon and immediately write this game off - you're doing yourself a disservice.  Now, onto the payment model. Some people, as always, claim this is P2W. Here's how it works. For simply installing the game, you're given Skyhammer and Aura for free, permanently. There are, as of this writing, 13 mercs. There are three mercs on rotation at any given time, so that, from that start, gives you five mercs to bring into battle, of which you can bring three. Four or five of the mercs cost 30,000 in-game credits. If you don't spent any credits, by the time you hit level 5, you can afford one, which won't take you terribly long. The rest of the mercs cost 50,000 credits. I've been able to get this amount in 3-4 days of fairly hardcore playing. This system might remind you of League of Legends, and in reality, it is similar. Think of the 50,000 mercs are your 6300 IP champions and it won't sting so bad. Each merc can equip a loadout that decides what weapons and perks are brought in. You can earn cases by playing (each case, when used, gives one random loadout card for a merc you may or may not own) or by spending 1,000 credits. You can also spend $5 to get an elite case, which only drops the 3 highest rarity cards.  Don't buy them.  Here's why - once you get to bronze rarity loadout cards, it's the same possibilities for bronze, silver, gold or cobalt. The only difference is the camo you're wearing and the skin on the weapon. It's a good way to earn a cobalt if that's really what you're into (it makes your camo blue, which if you're like me, can confuse the enemy into thinking you're an ally for a second or two).  As far as the balance goes, there are a few weapons that shine, but it's the vast minority. Overall, the weapons are all balanced, tight, and sometimes a little too strong (I'm looking at you, SMGs). Luckily, SMGs are supposedly getting nerfed soon, with some rifles being buffed to really differentiate the uses between the two. Each merc has a fairly unique (I say fairly because a few mercs have extremely similar, albeit slightly different, abilities) feel, and trying out new mercs can take hours in order to get the right feel for them. Then once you've got a feel, you'll try a new weapon and the whole experience changes.  Onto the overall negatives: The maps sometimes feel constricted, even if there's 4-5 ways to approach the objective. That's, in reality, not a huge negative because if one approach is bottlenecked, you can swing around and flank the enemy, turning the momentum. As with bottlenecks, certain mercs (Nader) excel at holding a bottleneck, and that's another point I want to make - it takes a while to save up enough credits to buy one of the higher cost mercs, like Nader. On the flipside, if you simply play the game for fun, within a week you'll see some sizable credits. Also, there's no party system if you aren't playing ranked matches.",

            "review_text": "'A fast paced shooter where focus is on completing objectives rather than kill/death ratios. For my special taste when it comes to shooters, it's pretty much perfect.'   This game is fun, fast paced and chaotic. If you dont like that in your shooters, you might not have as much fun with it. The gunplay and movement is smooth and fast and you're almost always shooting on the run and it takes a bit more than usual to down your opponent. This makes it feel very much like Halo and the gunplay reminded me a lot of the old Quake games. However, when you down someone, they're not really dead. They're movin a bit, waiting for someone to help them up. There are many different mercenarys in the game and all of them can help an injured teammate back up again. Some of them are medics and have defibrilators, which makes it much faster to help a dying ally. Some of the characters even have special abilities that can be activated when downed, such as killing yourself off with a grenade, hoping to take any nearby enemies down with them.  The maps are diverse and all have different types of objectives. There are multiple objectives on every map and when one is completed the fight moves on to a different area of the map, making a completely different game within the same round. Graphically everything looks sleek and clean a'la Portal 2. Not the most inpressive of graphics but fits the game perfectly. You carry three different mercenarys with you into every map and you can change which one you want to use every time you die. All of them are good on different things and have different special abilities and weapons. You can also use different loadout cards for them, which gives small changes and improvements (there is no bullet damage improvement).  The free to play model is fair and you can buy everything with ingame currency as well as real cash. The only complaint I have is that the ingame price for new mercenarys is a tad bit high. Most importantly though, you can not buy power, since all the characters are balanced and the perks are easy to get after playing a few games and are mostly flavour improvements, which just makes what you play with come down to preference.  This game came out of nowhere for me and it quickly made it up to the top three games I played this year (so far). It's free so you should definately try it out.",

When you do get a fair match up this game shines with its rock, paper, siccors shoot gameplay where everything can be countered. The only problem is the fast paced map layout makes this really hard as heavys are slow and are the ones who usually lag behind the team.  pros -map layout is awesome -objective based combat is a nice change of enviroment  -graphics are okay but there good enough for a f2p   cons -fast gameplay counters the idea of a team based game -easliy defendable attacker objectives that can be spamed with arty/orbital strikes -op gun setups that rewarded by rng instead of having a decent progression system -in game rewards need a buff because right now I make under 1,000c a match which seems unfair beacuse the next character i want is 30,000 C thats a huge grind just for 1 character. and thats not the most expensive one too.  - xp earned in game is larger is you get more kills then if you supported your team with ammo and health the whole game. again team based gameplay seems like a gimmick.     final review    6/10- an above average tactical shooter,with good aspects intermixed  Edit 1: (After reading several postive reviews i decided to give the game another try)  Came back to give game one last chance beacuse of angry joes review on it being questionable and several postive feed backs that say the game is 'balanced'.  Well I came to the conclusion they were all lying after playing two games at player lvl 5 i was put with people who had max gold cards and all the best loadouts even though my highest rarity is iron. The ping in game was horrible and i spent most of the game lagging and teleporting around the map. (never had issues like this with any other game). The matchmaker put me in a lobby of people from aisia and i couldent understand a word they were saying + lag was terrible :/ (not hating on asians i have been to china their cool people).  So my new review is a 4/10 any saving grace this game had is gone, I cant see why the communtity balently allows themselves to be milked by this company and allow this unbalanced gameplay to continue. Sorry not comming back Joe was right this game is indeed pay to win.",

The graphics aren't ground breaking but the engine is good enough and the maps, characters and weapons are well made no glitches or dodgy coding.   The game has plenty of character humour, nice variety maps with fun choke points and lots of different weapons perks and loadouts to collect. Games last 10-20 minutes but the level design never gets boring because game play comes thick and fast. Dirty Bomb is a game that isn't dominated by snipers either and all the classes are balanced and work well because you always need medics, objective specialists and brutes to do their specific jobs!  Think MOBA style play with character and team selection but without the gold, minions or the nexus just lots of killing and objectives to attack or defend! Those giving it bad reviews I suspect either expected Counter Strike or Battlefield... or they haven't played more than 2 hours.

The games 'Create a Class' is done in a way of cards, the higher tier of card... the better. Yes, the difference is a lot. A full team of Gold or above cards is very hard to beat. Basic bronze cards are around 4 shot headshot. Or a mag to the body, so good luck with that.  Generally good all round, providing you are palying with people that have not spent money on the game.",

Accomplish the missions and daily play which give you 3K ~ 4.5K in game currency.   Q. How's the gameplay? A. kinda fast paced, team-play game with characteristic characters. Pretty fun.   Q. Is there any negative things? A. To be honest, there are few.   1. auto team balance system is kinda shabby. Sometimes one team get all veterans while another gets all of the noobs.  2. Sometime there's some cheaters. Actually, I saw a cheater for the first time in my whole 67 hours of gameplay time, so maybe there aren't much cheaters (maybe it depends on server) but everyone tried to kick him with vote kick system but it kept fail (probably because of the cheating) and everyone had to quit the match so the developers should work on that.   //One thing you should know There are NO tactical advantage on silver, gold, cobalt and some special loadout cards but only cosmetic.

Dirty Bomb succeeds by having a wide player community, with friendly players who don't mind giving a newbie a hand. The servers are lag free, another huge plus. Earning credits (The In-Game Currency) appears take a little longer than preferable, however the free rotations of your characters offsets this downside.

Then you start playing 4v5 FROM THE BEGINING and nothing is happening (of course the balancing in this game is top notch. COBALT vs SILVER 2-3 ... THX Nexon)...like its normal....After 3 or so minutes you get the message that the player left and of course your losing but that dosent matter cuz the match is counted as a official match....i mean cmon....he left b4 the game even starts...make the match void or something...losing ranks and games cuz of that is fckin ♥♥♥♥♥♥.....so to summerize...game suck , developers doing ♥♥♥♥ with the game, dont just put new maps ( who by the way many ppl are not even playing) or mercs out .....ask the players somethimes for their opinion...

'Every Merc has Pros and Cons, A medic can't tank. A sniper can't solo.'

Dirty Bomb is a free FPS, it is very fast paced and based on a class system, and a well done at that. Every 'mercenary' has their own special abilities to support the team or weaken the enemy.  This encourages teamplay, who would have guessed it? The teamplay in this is unique. When you get to play with experienced players and everything works well, this is a immensely fun game. Something considered a bad thing by many: It's free to play so SD has to make money somehow. You can either make microtransactions 6-10$ to get a new merc or grind your way to it. This grinding can get boring at times, so just stop doing missions and do what you want for some hours, playing classes you like in modes you love. There is nothing like P2W in this game. You can buy cases, which give you acess to more weapons, those, however can be gotten by just playing as well. The only advantages bought cases bring are rarer optical versions.  In conclusion I have to say that taking part in this Beta is fun. You really know what the devs are doing and want the game to become. DB is fun and rewards you for getting better.   Overall a great game with a simple concept, yet so well made! There is no reason not to at least try it. Definitively recommended.",

The only things lacking thus far is a private lobby you can practice in or a way to directly party up with a bunch of friends for a match.  When it comes to balance however the game does need some tuning, i don't want to say that the higher priced characters are OP, they assuredly are not, but some of them need some adjustments. Otherwise it's just newer players getting used to rarer classes and loadouts they haven't unlocked or played much against yet.   Since Dirty Bomb is a F2P title the obvious question will be if it is pay2win. My first impression of it certainly wasn't positive from watching AngryJoe's (later disproven) rant about the case drops and how much money one has to waste on the game in order to get something useable. So i'm glad that i took a look at it myself and found out that the game is actually surprisingly fair with giving you cash and case drops for loadouts and unlocks. Sure you often won't be getting many maxed out bronze or +tier loadouts from them but crafting what you want to use isn't that hard actually and neither too time consuming to farm up, especially not for a f2p title.",

Unfortunately however, this is yet another example of a great F2P game held back by terrible mechanics designed to push players towards paying for characters and loadouts with absurd amounts of grind.  The current Loadout system is completely based on random generation, making playing the character that you want to play with the loadout you want to play them with is basically impossible. Instead of being able to fully customize your loadout like you can in most games, loadouts of weapons and passive abilities are randomly assigned to cards that you get from cases that you buy with in-game currency. In addition to this, there are 5 levels of loadout card rarity, only the top three of which give a character all three passive abilities. Lower level cards (3 for iron and bronze rarity, 4 for silver and gold) can be consumed to craft higher level cards with a fee of ingame currency, but only the resulting card’s character can be chosen; the card’s weapons and abilities are completely random. As you can imagine, this leads to players getting a lot of loadouts that are completely useless because they don’t synergize with the character’s playstyle.  In the most recent beta phases before this, this wouldn’t have been as much of a problem, since the default loadouts for each character synergized very well with their playstyles. In the current stage of the beta, default loadouts contain no passive abilities at all, meaning new players start at a disadvantage against established players. While getting a loadout with 3 abilities isn’t too hard, you’ll probably be stuck with a bunch of passives you don’t want/use until you find something almost decent.  What have to be the most disappointing aspects of this current loadout system is that it makes characters feel less mechanically diverse and distinctive than they have in previous beta stages, and that it seems to have held back the release of around 2/3 of the characters that had been present in earlier betas, no doubt to redesign them to work with this terrible loadout system. I would not at all be surprised if my favorite character from the earlier betas, Phantom, an incredibly fun character that was basically Metal Gear’s Gray Fox, gets cut altogether or reworked into something completely different because he couldn’t be fit into the current loadout system.  In my first review of this game, I likened it to Brink, recommending it to anyone else who enjoyed it. However, Brink didn’t waste your time with its unlock system; pretty much everything was unlocked for completing the tutorial. Dirty Bomb, on the other hand, seems to want to waste as much of your time as possible in the hopes that you’ll pay up to not have to deal with it. If this is the alternative to paying $60 for a multiplayer only game, then personally, I would rather just pay the $60.  When I heard that Nexon was going to publish this game, I knew it was only a matter of time until it was ruined by terrible F2P mechanics. It’s just a shame that it didn’t make it out of beta before it happened.   TL;DR: Great game; inexcusably terrible loadout system that forces you to do tons of RNG-based grinding or drop cash for good loadouts",

While all of this is going on, the enemy team is trying to keep their reinforcements flowing by tearing down barricades in the side alleyways, which you can defend and repair. Certain classes repair faster, or lock down areas with turrets and mines, or call in air strikes. Everything's built around the objectives, and it works pretty damn well.  One note: the game might frighten you with seemingly pay-to-win gambling aspects; fear not! Look deeper and you'll find that for a very reasonable price (ingame or real money) you can buy a complete, totally competitive loadout for your character(s) of choice. Speaking of these characters, you get a handful for free, while others rotate on a sort of 'free trial' system every week, allowing you to try before you buy.  In terms of the actual shooting, not much to say... Somewhere between Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty, with a splash of advanced movement (ex. wall/long jumps) and Battlefield-style class interactions (several types of healing, ammo replenishment, enemy tagging...). It all feels pretty well put-together; if you like fast-paced shooters, you'll probably enjoy it.  -----  TL;DR: TF2 + COD + crazy classes and amazing map design/objectives.

Which a lot of free to play games do, but it is noticable that the more popular free to play games don't: Team Fortress 2, Dota 2 and League of Legends all don't have a 'pay to win' aspect. And because this game needs to beat all the other free to play games in the same genre, because they cant offer a slightly worse game for a lower price, the developers need to come up with another way to earn money with this game that doesn't give the players that are paying an in-game advantage.

It relies heavily on supporting the team, but also rewards the player for this with extra xp, thus encouraging people to play the game to it's fullest. It's also got interesting characters, or mercs, with fun backgrounds and a 'Get rich and don't give a ♥♥♥♥' attitude. Even though I'm writing a positive review, I must report the cons as well, but the only con I can find is that it's in Beta, and therefore a few bugs are found here and there, every once in a while. Other than this, I must say that this is a fun/serious game that you'll enjoy even though sometimes you'll find yourself thinking 'Ugh, I can't believe that (Blank) costs so much money!'. I recommend looking at things in a more positive outlook, and find out that you keep racking up the money while hardly noticing.   To summarize though, Dirty Bomb is a fun game filled with devastating abilities and powers, and as time progresses, more interesting and opportunity filled options. I rate Dirty Bomb 8.5/10, but 9.5/10 when it exits Beta. Cheers from Canada, and don't be a ♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Fun game, has great mechanics, wouldn't reccomend till its out of beta. The game itself is fun but leaves A LOT to be desired. Firstly, its a hell of a grind to unlock just ONE class on your own. If you're lucky, you make 1k credits a match, but you need either 30k or 50k just to unlock a class, and 17k to buy a decent loadout for a class (not from drops). They definitely need to fix that whole system.   It takes a hell of a long time to go from starting up the game to actualy playing. First it loads the little corner side bar, then the actual dirty bomb loading screen, then the game boots up. Then you have to join a server, joining the server takes time, and once you join it takes 14 seconds to deploy (this is all before you get to choose your class and spawn in). Overall it takes about 5-8 minutes to start playing from the minute you cliick 'play' on your steam games.  The game runs RAMPANT with hackers, there's one at least every other lobby, you'll know it once you get insta headshotted from across the map. It typically takes a full clip or so to kill one person (if you're not a god at aiming and can always aim above the torso), but you'll get insta killed often enough to know somethings up every other game. There's also people who like to spam the chat with nonsense, with no way to mute or block the spam, neither voice nor text. If that wasnt bad enough, it is a VERY tedious process JUST to report someone and actually do something about it. The process makes it not even worth it because you have to go to their website and fill out all that information. WHY NOT JUST REPORT IN GAME??  Its left a really sour taste in my mouth because as good as the core mechanics and gunplay are, everything else just messes it up. I'm uninstalling until it gets updated and theres some kind of ban wave, I can't deal with all that nonsense, games shouldn't be frustrating.",

It seams that either a team absolutely dominates or gets shut out, one or the other no inbetween.

After you get on the other team then most of the enemy team quits but the game will start anyway as 6 vs 2. After the game starts and your fairly certain that you will win because its 6 vs 2 its like the game trys to locate every one of the very best players it can to give to the other team.

When games are balanced and people are playing how the game is designed, then this game is very very good. However in my experience so far it's just one team steam rolling the other. So if you get on stacked team; DB is kinda fun! If not it's really ♥♥♥♥in lame! Upon further investigation, this game is entirely free but expect to pay time....lots and lots and lots and looooooots of time. DB was sort of enjoyable until I got past level 5 but after that it's not that much fun. DB has an immensly grueling grind and I hate it. Combine this with a low pop and extreme amount of hackers; DB is just a flash in the pan Nexon money grab with very little money invested and it shows.

One of the maps is completely indoors, I pretty much stick to that one. As for weapon variety, you have to collect 'loadout cards' which has preset weapon setups. No character customization, no loadout customization...BUT, it's also still in Beta. So keep that in mind. Hopefully they add a little variety to the game with time.  UPDATE: 7/7/2015 - After the recent update, I am now unable to login. Says it was unsuccessful. Website has many reports of such, but developers have yet to come up with a solution to fix this.

Ever. - It is the most polished and complete beta I've seen. - It is NOT a pay-to-win game as long as you are willing to PLAY for a couple days to unlock the merc you want. In my opinion, this gives the game some longevity.  I mainly wanted to write this review to state some suggestions I feel would make the game better.  DISCLAIMER: I realize this game is in beta, and the devs may already be working on these, but I feel it's best to mention them anyway.  - A better in game scoreboard A large part of the scoreboard is taken up by each player's mercs.  Also, While you're in a game, there is no way to see your K/D. I feel stats like K/D and maybe things like assists and plants/defuses would be more helpful than showing the mercs of every player. (it's not like they can be changed in the middle of a game anyway)  - A timer that lets players know when the current free mercs will be rotated out  - An actual fast knife keybind For those of you who don't know, there are two knifing methods. A slow powerful one, and a fast weaker one.  There is a keybind for 'quick knife' but it uses the slow knife. Shouldn't it use the one that's actually quick? Adding another keybind for the quick knife is another option.  - In game currency for loadouts. I think it would be nice to have a 'pawn' option for your loadout cards. This would give silver cards and above some value to players who don't care about looks.  (because that's all that they add at those forms)  Can't wait to play Execution, and I hope there are even more game modes to come. Something like domination would be lots of fun.",

There's no matchmaking, so usually players with highest level participate in the same team to quickly win and easily level up.

Although during the introduction of new Mercinaries the merc developers don't see to test the new guys at all or not enough to check how they stack up against others. The first two additions, when they were entered were and are brutally overpowered. Sparks, A medic class, has a revive gun that doubes as a sniper rifle that can one shot people with a full charge, Thankfully as of right now that's been fixed. The newest addition, Phantom, is so incredibly overpowered at the moment that most people just leave the game when people spam him. He gets a cloak that's almost completely invisible. You really have to look for him or you'll just get flanked and then have a katana shoved into your anal cavity. And his cloak gives him a shield; yep a ♥♥♥♥ing shield while he's invisible. On top of that he has a variety of incredibly powerful SMG's that might as well be considered assault rifles given their prowess at range. And for the cherry on top, His katana is a one shot with the heavy strike to anyone 100 HP or lower and a two shot to anyone in the game, including the tankiest Merc in the game. His light strike is 65 base damage and has a ridiculously short animation and an insane hitbox range. Its literally your field of view, Making it a completely viable solution to just flick your mouse around and left click with the katana in frantic situations. He has 120 HP to add to all the overpoweredness, Just for context other high damage mercs have around 90-100. Effectively making all threats to him a potential one shot, And his cloak not only helps him escape by making him hard to hit but invincible as well.   Verdict: As of right now I'd say skip the game and wait until the Merc developers learn to either to balance the numbers more responsibly or thoroughly test new Mercs and change them before putting them in the game. Because as of right now they've got to substancially nerf Phantom before I'm going to jump back in, But after all the balance problems are sorted this is an absolutely great game that's a bunch of fun.",

Most notably the Champions system from League of Legends, where you can choose to play a character in combat (but you get 3 in a squad, and can swp them out situationally while inside of a match) and the competitive system that CS:GO has. You can play Comp. after level 5; and the casual is not an untalented bunch; there is some clever play to be had there.   They have adapted the claver pay system from Ghost Recon, the aim-is-super-important ideal from CS, the 6, 7, 8-man DYNAMIC squad from the likes of LoL and MMO raiding, where everyone fills a seperate and distinct role (In CS:GO, everyone fills very similar roles) and the map design and run-and-gun tactics from Insurgency and big-map games like Battlefront, CoD.   Most unique, however; is the Loadout system. You can buy with points or be awarded at random Cases which you then open to reveal a random Loadout card. The card has BONUSES for your Mercenary (character that you play) that effect your in-game playstyle. New and better weapons; actual bonuses. The cards have names like Close-Range Assault, Standard Rifleman, Premium Rifleman, etc. and supply you with the weapons for your niche as well as actual bonuses such as: increased volume of nearby enemy footsteps, increased # of magazines, ability to pick up and throw live grenades, increased health for deployables (turrets, health stations, ammo stations) faster reloading, sprint while reloading, increased ironsight focus while being shot at. The list goes on and on and every single bonus is as useful and clever as the last. the game is matching the right bonuses for your character and your playstyle. This changes everything. Managing my finances outside of matchmaking isn't just worrying about how slowly I collect points: It's spending them wisely on my Loadout cards, new Mercs to play, upgrading current cards. This is my favorite feature. that and missions: REvery 3 hours, you get 3 missions for bonus EXP and points. Wicked. They have done a great job of designing how I think about the game when not in a match. It keeps me feeling like I'm in control of my own destiny, that my progress isn't just about practice, and playing at the right times so that the matchmaking algorithm doesn't ruin my ranking (Im looking at you, every single eSport Competitive game). Progress is more than timing and an algorithm. It's managing Mercenaries and Loadouts. Awesome.",

Well, too bad, because...  Next problem: leave a match early and risk being penalized. Want to quit and restart because youre stuck with high pingers or cheaters? Sorry, you'll be returned right to the bad match you were trying to get out of.   Next Problem, the crappy players who join far away servers to have an absurdly high ping so that they can lag kill everyone. Its 2015, anyone with a 200+ ping shouldnt even be allowed to join a server. They should only be joining servers they can play normally, and equally with others. All of the competitive matches are this way. So even when Im pumping bullets into a player, they are killing me, retaining all their health, and the kill cam either shows that I got killed with a single shot to my foot (or arm), or sometimes there is no bullet trace at all (the ping is so high that my computer hasnt even received it yet but the server is telling me Im dead). A couple fo the players are bold enough to tell yout they are doing it intentionally. It ruins the game. I have way too many other games I can play and enjoy getting my ♥♥♥ kicked fairly.  Next Problem, additional items (throwables, deployables, etc) seem to either fail or are not available when you really need them. Brand new match I didnt receive any air strikes. Why not? No one knows. My entire team had no deployables until halfway through. The other team had theirs.  Next Problem, shooting through every obstacle. I dont know if this is a ping/lag issue but Ive been in too many matches where bullets come right through a solid building; these werent even close to a corner or edge.   Also, Im not sure if the game is plagued with the same problems as other F2P games (latest Tom Clancy one is aa perfect example). But one of the last match I was in was not a server problem. Opponents were invincible, shooting me with one shot kills through solid walls, etc. I recorded it and will forward to the staff.  I am wildly mediocre at FPS multiplayers (and I can admit this). But because Im not that great I tend to know when I get legitimate kills and when I get robbed of them. So, first time playing I found a good match on a good server. Last 3 times playing I was hopping from server to server (and switching match types) just to try and figure out what was wrong. This is why I hate F2P. They are all pure crap. Im just glad I didnt pay anything for this.   Its free, so no harm in trying it out. You'll see what Im talking about very soon (along with the other problems thta I dont have room to list). I kept goiong back and forth on whether or not to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down; Ive changed this 4 times now. But this time Im leaving it at a thumbs down. I made the mistake of buying a short booster after having a handful of good matches back to back. I shouldnt have done. I know better than to give money to devs that cant even handle the most basics of game creation.  BTW, its still better than BFH but not by much. Its really a shame. This game prob had the most potential out of all of them recently. I left my original review below. I think its important for people to see what has transpired in a few weeks  Original review below:  7/17/15  Hell yes. One of the better free to play Ive ever played. Even better than BF4 and Hardline (and I paid big $ for those with Premium)  Matches and actually game play are very easy to understand. In-game credits seem to stack fast. It also seems like everything that you can purchase as an add-on pack, or starter type packs, can also be earned by playing totally for free.   Its just a multiplayer shooter done right; only a few points that need help. DICE should take note. And a true Free to Play without Pay 2 Win. So they did F2P right as well. I cant believe i waited so long to download this.  I should add that while playing in my last session (Stopwatch) it was filled with hit discrepancy. Since you can get a 'ding' when you get a headshot its easy to track the damage that you should be doing. However, almost every exchange between my and an enemy was wrong. For example, last death I had three body shots on a guy at fairly close range. He didnt see me. As he turned around I got a headshot with a confirmed 'ding'. He kills me with a single shot and retained 100% health. But that was happening the whole round.  Also, the [sic] 'Ninja' is slightly annoying with their invisbility. In such a fast-paced game its almost like a cheat. It extremely hard to pick up on its 'Predator' style camoflauge. If the game wasnt so fast moving it wouldnt be a problem. But since the game is so fast its basically impossible to see them at all.   Overall, this is a 6/10. But thats pretty good for a f2p. If it wasnt free, I probably wouldnt give it a thumbs up.",

Also I think the cost for these cases will put alot of people off buying them.   So far I have no real complaints. Although if you go against a particularly good team, spawn traps are an issues.  Worth a try, fro something a bit different.",

Gameplay handles smoothly and continues on the tradition Splash Damage brought with Brink of giving color to what is usually a muddy drab world of FPS. The open beta and free to play model have helped to get this game off the ground already where the aforementioned title by the same developer fell on its face. Great game still, I stand with TotalBiscuit in defending its merits but alas it failed at launch.  Moving forward though, Dirty Bomb keeps with a good pacing and builds excitement as the clock ticks down on objective completions through tempo change in music. From right after I got my keybindings set, I felt immersed in the game and that is why it is worth a look.  Quick note on beta micro transaction system, there is no pay to win. Money simply helps unlock things quicker and gets bling, but all characters and weapons can be found or bought with ingame currency although right now the numbers are a bit high so the grind is longer. After 4 hours of playing I am 25% of the way to unlocking a character.",

Each one comes with augments that give minor buffs to the merc; anything past Bronze is not better, it is just a cosmetic, therefor a bronze card is as good as a cobalt just less rare and easier to obtain.  -Loudouts can be traded up for more rare loudouts in case you are interested in the cosmetic (still working hard to obtain my first cobalt card)  - Not a whole lot of maps (still in beta) but they are highly replayable  -Lot's a fun with friends and great team based objective gameplay  -Great fun in casual and competitive  One thing I will note however is this game sometime conflicts with antivirus programs such as bitdefender. This can easily be fixed by disabling the features of the antivirus program temporaraly and then re-applying them after the game is launched (this is usually only necesary after game updates and the inital install but besides that there should be no issue).  I don't believe in giving games a #/10, instead I will just say this game is worth your time. It is personally one of my favourite games that came out this year, and it not even finished. Since it is free what is there to loose? Give it a try and I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.",

I read a post online for this system is 'TOP PRIORITY' dated months ago, yet to this day there is still no party system. There is server browser to browse low populated servers, however, after every game you have to switch back to your friends team and when you have 5 people you end up not being able to switch to your friends team due to amount of players. This is something you have to do every game regardless of staying in same lobby.  2. I have constantly ran into hackers, which for some reason really never get bored of showing off their hacks, rather it be super speed , auto aim, rapid fire. Constant head shots by SMG across map or sniper. (This I can let go for it being in beta, however, I feel very strongly that this game is making updates about more stuff to buy rather than put in party system or anti cheat system. I have no way to report them at all).  3. The bad map balance, fact this is still beta is no excuse because usually maps will stay same in the official version. I am constantly being spawn killed by snipers with semi automatic sniper. I am usually killed in 1 - 2 shots by snipers and when they can see into my spawn 300 meters away it makes it real fun....for them. Maps are made in such way I am always constantly being shot from 3 different directions regardless of where I go making me feel irritated.  4. Easy mode? I have not really encountered many games in which aiming actually makes you do less damage than hip fire, but this is one of them. Don't waste your time aiming in because everyone runs around 100 MPH hip firing running in circles. You can hip fire across map with 100% accuracy with any weapon. I think the rhino's mini gun is the only actual weapon in game that has reduced accuracy across map.  5. The amount of credits for mercenaries is ridiculous. Takes me around 10 hours of play time through entire week just to unlock a merc, on top of that I have to unlock the loadout cards to use certain weapons. Which is another week of playing to get decent card with good perks. It is F2P and not P2W , but with work this can be really boring.  6. I am crashing at least 3 times a day despite having a top of line system several times the recommended specs, saying I am low on memory, but I am not even using quarter of my memory.",

Objectives are useless unless you have spare time from farming so much K/D. If it fancy's you to play support you will learn the only thing your team cares about is K/D. K/D is the life blood of this game because the measly in game cash you get per game is such a joke you might as well put time in to farm K/D. After farming K/D for 35 matches which is roughly 20 min per match not including waiting time and time it takes to farm K/d and if your lucky to get a mission you have actually have a champion unlocked to you may use him to complete it get a WHOPING 500-750exp! You may get a BRAND NEW champion with BRAND NEW abilities to farm K/D with. When you are well on your way and played 5+ matches with this BRAND NEW champion at some point you will realize you have done nothing but farm K/D. Compare your K/D to other players. Bask at your amazing K/D and learn K/D doesn't just matter in CoD and Battlefield but it matters here. Live the K/D, breath the K/D and be one with the K/D cus at the end of every match thats all thats going to mater cus you'll get an average 75exp for a match and most champions cost around 35,000+ exp.

Spawn camping needs to be less incentivized. Perhaps upon full release they could add a short spawn invulnerability to prevent this. However for a closed beta as far as gunplay goes its a blast. Its aim intensive and not casualized and the long time to kill in the game makes a much more enjoyable pace for me personally. Also the jump movement mechanics are a blast so I would recommend this game and would say it is moving in the right direction.",

        {
            "review_text": "I've put a decent amount of time into the game, moreso than I've put into other F2P FPS titles. The game brings to mind a crossover of Titanfall/Advanced Warfare, Team Fortress 2, and Counter Strike, to name a few.   The TF/AW comparison comes from the overall 'modern speed' style, where you're not necessarily flying around the maps Quake 3 style but instead using the environment to propel and move yourself strategically around the map to gain an advantage over your enemies. It's not 100% necessary, but it'll make you a better player overall if you take the time to learn the mechanics.  The TF2 comparison is in regards to the class system Dirty Bomb has in place. The characters have their own personalities, special moves and powers, speed, weapons, etc. Some classes seem to be straight from TF2 altogether (Large fat dude with a minigun balanced around defending objectives, cocky but incredibly fast objective attacker/planter regularly played with a shotgun, multiple classes design to heal and provide ammo, etc). It's less of a straight ripoff and more an expansion on TF2's class system. Your moves have cooldowns and could easily be compared to Dota 2 or any other game that gives you abilities on a cooldown.  Counter Strike comparisons come into play with the *heavy* focus on teamwork, communication, objective gameplay, and precision aiming. While the pace of the game itself isn't similar to CSGO, the overall feel of the game gives you a sense of teamwork and precision not seen in other titles.  The F2P model, in my opinion, is extremely well done. Rather than purchasing straight upgrades and overpowered weapons/items, you purchase 'Loadouts.' Each loadout is 100% randomized, and you can opt to buy a loadout crate with 1,000 ingame currency, or you can win a crate by completing various objectives over the course of your playtime. Opening a standard crate will give you an Lead, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Cobalt Loadout. ANYTHING above Bronze is purely cosmetic and 100% unnecessary. Lead loadouts come with your randomized weapons, and one modifier. Iron loadouts give you two modifiers, and finally Bronze loadouts will give you three modifiers. 90% of the modifiers obtainable are mostly QoL items, such as reduced flinch while aiming down your sights (Which you should never do anyways, there is no penalty to accuracy or recoil for hipfiring, except for slowing you down and making you an easy target), an alarm when airstrike/artillery are inbound, and other minor QoL changes that are absolutely not needed, as all of these things can be negated by simply playing and paying attention. Over time, you'll learn to listen for the loud sound of an airstrike over you, or artillery inbound, or when you've been targetted by a turret. It's for people who need some assistance at the beginning, later on when you get a loadout that gives you any of these modifiers you'll groan, wishing that you had gotten a 'better' on, such as a 10% reduction to your abilities cooldown, or a 10% addition to your frag grenade's explosion. You could definitely argue to a 10% explosion radius boost, an ability to reload while running, or a 20% reduction to reload time is 'overpowered' and 'P2W', but since these modifiers are 100% random in each of your loadouts it is literally impossible to get them on purpose, it's random, everyone can get them with minimal effort.  Graphicswise, the game has a nice art style to it. It's easy on the eyes while being easy on your rig. Over time you may find yourself playing on lower graphic settings to get a higher framerate. It looks good, plays good, nothing wrong at all.  Overall, I can't recommend this game enough. It's a shining example of what a free-to-play title should be. It's fun, fast, feels great, plays great, and is just a blast to be a part of. So many crazy moments happen while playing, and no two games play the same. The only real complaints I have is that there's only 5 maps currently, but they're so tightly balanced and put together that every time I play a round on one it feels like I'm playing it for the first time. I'm still learning new things about the maps and characters even now!   Also, with the exclusion of Comp matches, playing music while playing increases the fun. I would recommend something similar to the Titanfall or Crank 2 soundtrack. Trust me when I say it'll make your playing experience *that* much ♥♥♥♥ing better.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGPuMx5IrkY ",

(spawn campers - with turrets occur) 'random' item drops. sometimes you see lvl 2 with really rare loadout cards, or someone who repetitively gets event cards, while others grind and get nothing. no autobalance, voting is restrictive, and hard to kick people/afk currently. sometimes layer glitches occur, among other bugs   again game is still beta. its free so play it.

I have a lot of fun in many of the games, but sometimes the times are so imbalanced and the game doesn't have any sort of auto balancing so you can either leave the game or get utterly destroy by the other team. I have had matches where you are spawned camped. There are a lot of these unbalance games, I have joined then left multiple games because the game I just joined, was one of those games..(matches in a row I had this). The different characters or “mercs” aren't balance well either and it takes a good amount of time to save up for new mercs.

The Merc/Card system allows you to bring three characters into a match and to swap between them when you respawn, which lets you either fill voids in your teamcomp, or actively counter the other team.   Almost every character is unique, the two that are closest together are Arty and Kira, which differ vastly, Arty can call in artilery strikes as an ability, and can have two on standby at once, while Kira has a medium duration orbital laser cannon that can be retargeted while firing.  Maps are well designed and easy to navigate with many alternate paths that you'll need to master the movement system to find.  My biggest issue is with the matchmaking, or more exactly, the lack thereof. Now I'm by no strech of the imagination a great player, but I know how to play objectives and classes (Area of Denial generally), my W/L ratio is abysmal, somewhere around one win for ten losses, teams as of this writing are shuffled by RGN, skill and level have nothing to do with it, you will regularly see higher level players attempting to stack teams, and shuffles commonly place most of the higher level players on the same team. Most games I've played have ended with one team steamrolling the other into oblivion.  The only other issue I have is with the community, while most people are generaly quiet, there are a number of people that simply taunt the enemy team when they're winning by landslide, the kind of stuff I've seen is generally enough to get someone banned from other games, however if a person leaves the lobby you are completely unable to report them in any way, that needs to be fixed to promote more positive play.   I want to end on a high note; I have had two games that were balanced by some miracle, and those two games were the most fun I've ever had playing an FPS, BAR NONE, if they can impliment some kind of skill balancing, I will do everything in my power to recommend this game, but untill then, I just can't.  Update: The balance system has been modified, I have had significantly more good games, but I still can't fully recommend the game to casual players, but it is significantly better now.",

If you have played Brink before, which is also developed by Splash Damage. You will find a very similar concept to their gameplay system, and style. However there's no tweakings of your guns attachments nor parkouring around the map. THere's double jump though on some platforms. It's still the classical FPS shooter game.  There's three mission gameplays, Objective, Stopwatch and Elimination. Objectives as the name mentioned, to complete multiple objectives in stages. This game is similar to like TF2 Payload, but here as protecting the EV and delivering the data. Stopwatch mainly works the same as Objective, just that both teams are swapped to compete between who completes the mission faster. So teamwork is still the key here. For Elimination just clearing of the opposing players till the team is wiped. The matchmaking system here can sometimes seems leveled, but the number of level capped servers are too little. Most of the servers are uncapped, so you will be playing with high level players as well.  What's so overwhelmingly positive about this game is that, the reward system benefits the non-P2W users. Each mercenaries comes like a card, with different rarity. Lead being the lowest, and Obsidian being the highest grade. Almost every round you have won, will entitle you with a card crate. That you can unlock them anytime to get cards! Unlike Payday2 or CS:GO, where you need keys to unlock them. However the downside is that sometimes you get a card where the mercenary has yet to be unlocked. You will need to use your credits to unlock them. Each mercenaries requires 50,000 credits, which can be earned every round you play. Crafting of the cards is also available, however it's advisable to do them in later stages. Each week 2 mercenaries will also be rotated for new players to try them out, similar to how Evolve has done their class rotation. In Dirty Bomb mercenaries are broken down into 5 main classes, Recon, Engineers, Fire Support, Medics and Assault. This hasn't been cleared mentioned in the game. So new players may not know how to choose their class wisely, resulting in bad teamwork.  For networking, there are servers in Asia, Russia, Europe, US, Australia. For Singapore players, you get around 40ms-55ms in those Asia servers, and are capped at 150ms. So you wouldn't get high-ping players in your team.

The downside is that grinding is very, very difficult. This isn't a game you can just play for free, probably by design. This wouldn't be a big problem if loadouts were so reliant on RNG and crafting and/or if mercs weren't so damn expensive. The game also suffer from a lack of difference inside each weapon class, especially SMGs and rifles. Dirty Bomb has the misfortune of being managed by Nexon, which means apathetic game management, lazy development, and being mined for all the cash it's worth before being cast aside. Competitive mode is currently a wasteland, though that may be due to its status as an alpha test, rather than a fully developed mode.  Since this is free, the game is worth trying.

No matter what after playing this game for more than 30min it'll start to only use 1 core, max my ram and even freeze any other applications including audio, and most of the time exiting the game won't fix it, I have to completely restart my computer. As far as I know this is a rare issue as my friend with almost the same PC build has no problems with this game.  All in all fun F2P game but I cannot recommend if I can't play it.

There ARE microtransactions. But, you don't need them. The game is just as enjoyable spending no money. Take it from a guy who's put 100 hours in and doesn't have half the mercs.

The maps are generally well designed and balanced, so are the weapons. There are 20 characters (mercenaries) each one with somewhat different abilities.  WHY PLAY IT OVER OVERWATCH? As Overwatch this game has characters specilized in healing, but while in Overwatch a healer can't play alone offensibly in Dirty Bomb you maintain a good offensive capability and you are able to a lot of damage. This means that while Dirty Bomb as Overwatch is a team game you are less depended on your team mates (if they are noobs it's easier to carry them to victory). Also if you don't like futuristic stuff this game expect for 2 laser weapons has all fairly common rifles.",

Maps always have a primary objective, and usually some secondary objectives for both teams that generally make attacking or defending easier if completed.  Objectives range from, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, repairing a tank and escorting it, steal the ♥♥♥♥ from the enemy, deliver a bomb to a specific target, repair a generator, construct MG nests...

The game is a very fast shooter, it takes time to get used to it, the weapons and mercs are balanced and the maps are unique and really well put together. The only thing I don't like is the fact that even if you want to play in the same team as your friends it's really hard for that to happen, there should be a clan/team system.  IMO, more people should try this game, it's fun and it's FREE!!!",

im right damn it murderer:  this style has a player go to a point where they know they will get the most kills using the biggest or scariest gun they got. this often leads to ♥♥♥♥♥ing that medics are not rezzing. need is dependent on how the other teams aim is defender: this style has a player finding the place the are least likely to die, then they laugh at people calling out for medic. and player should have better aim. need is low  objective junkie: this style has the player thinking that the player is the only one working for obj, which is true. this is the most needed style then there is  wild card: this style leads to the dumbest and funniest things. like finding new jumps, knifing a rhino to death, turn the corner and get a shotgun in the mouth. whatever is gonna happen this style is not gonna to wait till someone finds them picking a booger in some dark bathroom, no they are gonna run out there with there entire fist up their nose. a most have for the game to be fun. more needed the higher the rank of players. healer:  this style can be really boring and is only when need is called for. this style does everything it can to keep people alive. i dont see it as an full style but more of something a good player does to win. i have seen some incredible almost full time healers but after a while they go out and get them selves shot. really fun to play with someone running half the map to get my dumb ♥♥♥ up.  almost any merc can be played with any style, some are better suited for a certain style then another.   thats where the balance comes in and is difficult to keep there maybe a medic on the team but it may not be a healer could be a murderer, like before they nerfed sparks. which does make her the hardest to do it now. so when you get capped repeatedly by a sparks that sparks is not doing her assigned job. according to everyone on the team if the team is losing, but if the team is winning it is mostly because some sparks has lost their mind and gone on some murderess mayhem.   good players can shuffle between a couple per map, have one they think they are good at, but can do any ok  great players can turn any one as needed hahah any of the styles i did an above good job of trying to explain im an ♥♥♥  the good player will see the need and say some thing once, an ♥♥♥ will ♥♥♥♥♥ about it the whole game, and never do it even if the merc best suited to for it is in the lineup    if a good murder gets to their spot the are gonna get aces all day to end that you will need a wild card  the wild card is very often PROXY  oh that name not so loud, it bad enough i have to play against her. proxy is the single dumbest character in the game and i play her all the time she is a terrorist  she is a all or nothing person she is a im so dumb im gonna yell out when i start repairing a EV well all the mercs do that for some insanely stupid reason  doing dumb things leads to good times  its kinda like life  the times when i have had the most fun i was doing something stupid. i always had enough restraint to keep from going to far but i would often make a really dumb decision (maybe not intently) to see if i would survive. i use to *cough* know of people that every forth would blow up some way to big to be a toy. in this game you get to for that all the time  and riding that line is what makes a great player  i am not a great player i hope to be soon please soon as i said i play proxy mostly i do also play one of the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mercs AURA  for seasoned players aura is a slight pain  early players cant beat her.  so the learning curve is kinda weird  a player plays to level 5 they kinda understand maps and controls not much else though then they log onto to a server where great players are having it out.  if the server has two great players really working on opposite teams and everyone else is less then good game will be in balance and most players will think its a fun game  if the team are not balanced the new player is gonna through up some crazy score or never get outa spawn. if the player gets a good score they will continue to do the same thing on the map and complain that other people suck because this strategy worked before, and should always work.  the same strategy is not going to work every time if it did the game would be very boring and it is not (even with the very small number of maps).  when a game is a bunch of lvl 20+ players this doesnt mean its gonna be a good, but low scoring, game. there are times when a team just can not sinq up. it not that anyone is playing like ♥♥♥♥ just the spawns are not timing right for the mercs being chosen.   my favorite is two good players on each team with other players having a ok idea of what to do.   crafting is dumb booster packs are kinda dumb, there is no CGC aspect to game so i dont understand the way card obtained.  whatever merc is kicking ♥♥♥ at the time is the most op  all of them are op except skyhammer  im am righting this at

The Loadout-system is probably the best I've ever seen, with new players being able to go bronze very easily and older player being able to actually get some cool skins (Cobalt, Gold, Silver).   Over the months there have also been a few events. At first they were only for specific Loadout cards (Roccat and Logitec) but then came Trinkets. Starting with 'What the Dickens?' which introduced three new Trinkets and the Trinkets themselves. You would receive the Trinkets after several play hours.

The combat is extremly fast paced and smoothly. Graphics looks nice too for UE3^^. Only thing I could speak against would be the lack of content at the moment.  Overall still cant get mad about Dirty Bomb. Its too good to be mad(not for very long :D)",

And yes i have double checked, only in this game does this occur.  Too many smurfs in the Max Level 6 rooms and they flat out dominate the game  All in all i give the game a 8/10 since despite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ping and the constant need to remind myself not to hold the W key too long, I still find it very enjoyable.  P.S. But seriously fix the whole elongated input thing it drives me insane how many times it's killed me or denied me from melee kills. I cant stop to aim, i cant stop to melee, when i try to melee my character just runs past my target.",

The only con for me is, that there is (a small maybe?) no competetive scene.",
