This is especially obvious when playing the mini-games, which are extremely difficult/impossible with keyboard/mouse, but can still salvage the game by choosing Automatic battles when creating a game. Sadly without the mini-games, this becomes a Conquest clone.  As far as multi-player, there is LAN only and share a PC options, so no internet gaming, if you were looking for that.  That said, for the $3 sale price it works. ",
