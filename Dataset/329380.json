Go to the Steam folder where your installed games are (Steam/SteamApps/common/stealthinc) 2. The the game folder should include another folder called _CommonRedist. Double click that. 3. In that folder you find the OpenAL folder double click that aswell. 4. In that you find the 2.0.7.0 folder. Go in there. 5. Now you find the oalinst.exe 7. Double click that Data and it automatically installs the missing .dll file that you need. 8. You should be able to play the game now :3",

It seems the devs only care about consoles now, as this is obviously a port (though the change in name to the Console-approved one gives that away). There is no proper options menu, you can only select resolution and anti-aliasing quality, or rebind keys through a launcher before the game starts. Stealth B-astard Deluxe had Steam Cloud support, but annoyingly that is also absent from this outing. And the worst change, the game is now tied to the framerate. If I play this on my low-spec laptop, the game runs in slow-motion, with sounds playing normally but the game taking ages to move. I play it on my PC, and the game runs at unplayable extremely fast speeds. There is no VSync option anywhere to be found, so I can barely play. You have a 144hz monitor? The you're out of luck. And although this hasn't affected me, many players have had problems running the game in the first place. It's really disappointing because mechanics like the Inflate-a-Mate look really interesting to experiment with, but the moment I uninstall this game everything I've done will be lost as they didn't add Steam Cloud support. It's like they threw it out on Steam, added some achievements and left it. If you enjoyed the original Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then get this on a sale. If you haven't played Stealth B-astard Deluxe (or the original free version), then try that instead. This is not a proper sequel.",

After pressing the escape button to stop the game, the game was even not able to display the menu. So i had to click blind to find the Quit Button.   From the impressing in the main menu the game needs a lot of ressources. Maybe this is the reason for the problem above, but if this is true, then its the worlds most unefficient game. I can play on this PC games like Dishonored in highest resolutions without problems. The thing is Dishonored is 3D game, while Stealth Inc 2 is just a 2D game with a comic like graphic.  -A 'Dissapointed from the reviews' User",

The level design is well thought-out, the puzzles are challenging without becoming 'fake' difficulty, the controls are fairly intuitive, and the graphics are nice...but the performance issues let  everything  down. Unless you're one of what seems to be a very small minority, the game can and will run extremely slowly, either at random or because there's something about your computer that it doesn't like (not sure which one). For me, on one system at least, it was the sound card - removed it and switched over to onboard sound troubleshooting something else recently (and forgetting to put the original sound card back in), and I can run at normal speed about 75% of the time now, though that's in windowed mode at a lower resolution instead of fullscreen, which seems to be one of the more common issues. The other 25% of the time, it runs like tar for no apparent reason, with a reboot occasionally (but not always) bringing it back again. The devs are seemingly aware of the problem(s), but don't appear to be coming out with any patches to help resolve things.  The times I can run the game normally, it's fun. But unless it's on sale or part of a bundle, I couldn't recommend it except if the slowdown bugs get patched.",

It's more of a puzzle game involving activation sequences, so if you're looking for stealth/pathfinding stuff, there's a severe lack of that considering it's in the name. Mixed difficulty, some areas are easy, some are hard. So long as you're not hell-bent on being a completionist, it's balanced.  Haven't had any major technical issues, but the mouse control (for aiming with one of the main mechanics) handles hideously if you're in windowed mode or use a dual-screen setup. The cursor doesn't lock to the game window or stay visible, so it's very hard to tell where you're aiming. Not a show-stopper, but obviously poor testing.  There's also no support for non-xbox controllers.  I picked this up with a discount voucher from a completed badge... no regrets, but glad I didn't pay full price.",

            "review_text": "  When I started playing, I honestly thought it was going to be a really short platform indie game. But instead, it was long enough to last 2 entire days to finish.   You're a clone (some kind of fatty 'boy' wearing green glass as you can see) among many others, and apparently you're smarter than the others. Your objective is to progress through the company's different areas to perform test (and free the other clones in the test rooms). As you progress, you'll discover new gadgets to use in test rooms. And once you've completed the 8th test of the current area, you'll be able to use the gadgets outside of the test rooms.  As you might have guessed, we have to hide from the enemies if we don't want to die, and the shadows are really useful for it.   Pros :  - 50 levels to entertain you at least an entire day.  - Some gadgets might be entertaining to use.  - Collectable hats and clothes for your characters (I love to wear both the Police Hat and Uniform).  - The overworld map (which displays the explored areas of the company) somehow reminds me of Super Metroid.  - I honestly didn't expected this game to have some kind of story.   Cons :  - Although the story was getting more and more interesting, the ending was poorly normal.  - I honestly wish there was a better way to switch between gagdets, because the way the scrolling was made wasn't practical at all - Despite shadow and darkness being really useful to hide and my ability to see in the dark, there's some part of the games where the developers decided to put no lighting at all. Despite having a Light gadget, travelling through these areas are still a real pain - As in Super Metroid, there's no way to teleport through a part of the map to another, so you're gonna have to walk alot to travel from bottom left to upper right - Apparently, the CEO of the PTi company asked for the building to be built as a maze, because I sometime have alot of trouble to get to the next room, despite the map clearly showing a way between both rooms.  - Community High Score is quite full of hacker (trust me, none of the test rooms can be done in 0.1 second).",
