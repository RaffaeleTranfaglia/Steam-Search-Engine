One thing I would like to see is more knockdown animations, appropriate to where the hit connects.   For some people, the lack of MP might turn them out, but it doesn't prevent this from being a great game.",

            "review_text": "Knock Down Blow is largely a martial arts sports game, sharing more in common with Budoken (1989) and the like than most other fighting games. It does not feature magic attacks, energy blasts, or even flips; but rather fists, feet, blood, sweat, tears, karate, forklifts and a bear. This provides for a more realistic, restrained, visceral and violent experience that defies the gameâ€™s appearance and feels quite unique to the genre.  With liver injuries, skull fractures, brain damage and more all lovingly recreated, this game delivers a real sensation of beating the crap out of someone else, which will appeal to many Steam users. However, Karate Master also delivers a sensation of having the crap beat out of you, which many Steam users will relate to.  Some of the training exercises depicted are tedious, some are momentarily fun. And while there is a cheese strategy or two for the actual fighting, timing and technique are rewarded and the results are most satisfying.",

They claimed to have controller support where it did, It took me nearly 30mins getting it to work, and for somereason the controls can go unresponsive right before a match, but kick in a sec in. But by far the worst thing is my AnitVirus freaks out on the data.exe file. I'm pretty sure its a false positive but still, having a game you purchase on steam that does that is a bit unsettling. It just feels slitly sluggish during menus and small moments. Now the Fighting amazing, I have a great time ever fight sometimes I get a but confused on i get 1 shot but still the fighting can and is very enjoyable.  Besides the bugs etc, the only thing i feel is a bit meh. Is how the level and training system is. You get 3 training options at the start of the game, and that is great. Once you use those 3 you wont get to see another til after you beat a event ( which sounds alright but) This is where it gets to the grind, they are op for a good 2 3 trys, and you do gain some ablity after but doesn't feel fun in that way. And until you get money and fame your kinda stuck doing the same stuff... and omg please get rid of the work mini game ...... worst mini game ever. I hate it... SOOO BORING anyway...  Can't reccomend it @ its current price, find it for a $1 sure, but still. Wish it wasn't so MEH fighting feels so fun!!",

            "review_text": "Karate Master 2 is a 2D single-player only fighting game well worth its price-tag, offering a roughly 6-8 hour SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY experience. For those wondering, it also offers controller and arcade stick support (for PC-compatible sticks).  The in-game graphics and music are well-made and truly represent the developer's vision in giving the game a late 80's/early 90's feel. Characters all either reference 70's/80's/90's era martial arts movies and famous figures (Most of which being 'Mas' Oyama) and cutscene artwork is well-made, however the art style for character portraits can at times look slightly off.   That being said, the dialogue (in English, at least) is hilariously inconsistent - Whether or not the developers intended to give the game that 'B-grade action movie' dialogue - and is entertaining at many times, to say the least.  The gameplay offers only a single-player story mode that plays as a 2D-fighter with RPG levelling mechanics, all of which are delivered through various minigames.   These minigames range from timing to mashing, and while some may appear tedious at first they are easy to pick-up and never too jarring as the game allows you to reap the rewards from excelling at a certain mini-game over another, offering 4 options for each in-game stat.  The core gameplay is entertaining though at times inconsistent. Using a standard LP, RP, LK, RK setup without any set combos or movelists, the player already has all the tools they need to win. Therefore apart from the statistics [mechanic], the player has to rely on movement, spacing, counter-attacks and timing to win their fights. FGC enthusiasts could say that the game is heavily-'footsie' based, if that means anything.  The defensive system is where the game is most interesting: The player will always be guarding at the middle of three heights, and must hold up or down to shift this guard.   In addition to this are parries, which may also be performed at three heights using both punch buttons. Unfortunately and having played KM1, I can say that it is much more difficult than its predecessor to predict/anticipate/read enemy movements, making parries heavily luck-based.   Also available to the player are standard dashing mechanics and a ducking mechanic (which I find much better than attempting to parry or guard high attacks).  The enemy AI also seems to be completely random in terms of attack patterns and damage, where an enemy fought at the beginning of the game, at later stages, can randomly and instantly throw a match-ending attack. This is another aspect of the core gameplay - 'Ikken Hissatsu' or instant-kill moves: Rather than being as they would be in other 2D fighters such as Guilty Gear/Blazblue, the instant-kills can be any move in KM2, so long as your 'timing' is perfect.  Instant kills are difficult to describe as the only explanation offered behind gaining one is that an average of the character's strength and damage stats must exceed the opponent's toughness. As none of these stats are given for opponents it genuinely does happen almost randomly, although timing a counter-attack at where the opponent isn't guarding tends to yield them more often.  In closing, KM2 is neither a fighting-game player's dream nor will it keep you coming back for more for too long over its short length, however it will scratch an itch for martial arts [and obviously, Karate] enthusiasts that other fighting games might not.  The game will not convert players who don't like fighters, however if you're looking for a solid, serious-yet-tongue-in-cheek action game that throws back to the days before Street Fighter 2, KM2KDB is a good place to be.",

            "review_text": "Great game for those who reminisce about the 16bit era. A lot of button mashing in this game, and repetition but it is fun. This game is quite educational, using japanese names for the techniques. I love the reference to Mas Oyama(quite an interesting story about Mas check wikipedia) of Kyokushin Karate, for those of you who don't know Mas really fought a bull. The bull might have been sedated, but non the less it was a bull he fought you tube it! I also love the inclusion of Sanchin kata (body mind and spirt). There are hints dropped within the dojo fights that point at Karate and 80's Karate movie history, but only those who are familiar with the history of karate will catch them.  There were a few issues I found with this game which are minor  1.) Some of the english translations are terrible like STRENGTH being spelt wrong. The ending story clip is a bad translation, but I'm used to it from the NES era.  2.) Small thing I noticed about the Boxing stadium fights, were the glitches where your character would be frozen while the CPU would be moving and barely beating you up! Every match in the boxing stadium lasts 3 rounds, and never ends in a count out. Is this the spirit of the karate ka?  Conclusion: I've put about six hours or more into this game and enjoyed it. The reason for this could be that I am a karate practitioner, and I grew up playing games like this. I hope that if they release another game that they include specific information on the characters you engage in. This way people playing can learn more about Karate and the origins of the styles. I think people will still enjoy this game, if you are skeptical you can always wait until it drops in price",

Very tactical figher, I'm more consicous of what I'm doing opposed to button mashing in Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. Soundtrack is awesome, it's as if I'm playing a karate game based off an 80s movie. I enjoy the graphics, they are charming in their own way. The variety of different looking fighters is impressive. Even AAA games like Ryse have the same few character models, but this game has a nice diversity with its art assets. The grind is long just as it is in real life, and I have totally bought into the idea of progressing my character through training. Will be playing a lot more of this game, favorite obscure indie game for sure.",

            "review_text": "A pretty good game!  Now while the job mini game is boring and the training minigames can be a bit confusing. The actual fighting in this game is very satifying. The fast paced combat, sound effects, and the randomness of injuries during combat make you (the player) feel always on edge. I also felt that the games combat was never unfair if you take combat slow and watch your opponent move you can usually get around their defense or doge/counter your opponets attack in a way that feels very satisfying. It it hard to describe but when you do perform what was explained you feel like at that moment now you have control of the fight. I never truly felt that way in any other fighting game before this one.  I do like how the in game sprite look and move! It is not the best looking but it has a nice style. The training environments are nice remind me of old kung fu movies training under a water fall and having the other students beat you up so you get tougher, that is great to see and help reinforce the whole karate lifestyle. But the game character portaits contrast with the in game sprite style. I think it would have been better off tweeking the in game spites for the character portaits during dialogue as oppose to what we got. There isn't that much dialogue but when there is you are reminded in how bad the character portrait contrast with the rest of the game.  The sound track is a bit weird for me the overworld track I love. It has the take on the world feeling to it, thats great! The other songs are either forgettable of bland. No other song is more bland to me that when you start a fight. Interesting enough when either you or your oppenent take a serious blow the music starts to kick up and get good.  Now the game is a little rough around the edges (at the time posting this review). some glitches may happen when fighting And text may get flipped around. And if I am correct in saying I do not think the developer CRIAN SOFT native language is english cause at time the dialogue is off when characters are interacting with one another.  But with all that said I highly recommend this game to any body that likes martial arts stlye genre and fighting games!",
