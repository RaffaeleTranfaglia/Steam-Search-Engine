Relax in my office and keep an eye on the security cameras, easy money.  Night 1 1AM: Just noticed they have blast doors installed on the security office doors, this must have been a former military base or something.  Night 1 2AM: All quiet on the homefront, I think I'll ask that cute girl who works concessions out when morning rolls around.  Night 1 3AM: I could've sworn that the bunny suit was in the room the other two animals, but now it's in the prop room. Must be more tired than I realized. Noticed an indicator that says power is at 65%, they must try and conserve power at night.  Night 4AM: Okay, now the ducks in the party room, something is not right here. Power's at 50%, I'll have to be careful if I don't want to be in the dark with these things.  Night 5AM: HOLY S#!% turned on the lights to take a leak and that damn bunny was right outside my door! Powers at 20% but screw this, these blast doors are staying shut all night.  Night 5:30AM: SOMEONE IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. There is no way in hell I'm opening that.  Night 6AM: I quit.",

            "review_text": "Great horror Point-and-Click game. In this game, you're a security guard which got hired in a Pizzeria to work 5 days a week. However, you have the night shift. You don't move around the building, you're in the office, where you get 2 doors, two door lights, and a tablet (Also a freaking fan which takes a lot of power) You use the tablet to look at all locations in the Pizzeria, but you don't look around for criminals - You're looking at the Animatronics, the maskots of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. At night, they free-roaming mode is turned on, and they want to get you. Why? I'll quote the Phone guy here 'The Animatronics think you're a naked endoskeleton which is lacking a suit, and all they want to do is stuff you into a suit, which is with a lot of wires in it. So basically it means if they stuff you into the suit, the suit will kill you because of the wires. Hovewer, that's not true. The Animatronics are haunted - By kids. A few years ago, a man in a Freddy Fazbear suit kidnapped 5 children. They found a suspect, but the kids went missing. They were never found. The Animatronics don't think you're a naked endoskeleton, because Bonnie, one of the Animatronics was next to a endoskeleton in one of the cameras, yet he ignored it. Anyways, you use the tablet to look at which place the animatronics currently are. If you don't find any of the animatronics on the camera, it can mean two things: 1. The Animatronic is next to your door, so you'll need to close it before he gets into the office! 2. The Animatronic is in your office, waiting for you to lower your camera. To know if he's in the office, you'll hear a weird sound of a child while you're looking at the camera.  You'll also need to check onto the Pirate Cove between 'Often' and 'Not very often' if you don't do that, Foxy will run through the hallway, and get into your office. You can't just close the doors for the whole night. You have limited power. You'll need to survive from 12am to 6am, in all nights. With only 100% power, which gets drained quicker if you have the lights/tablet/doors turned on. So you'll need  to spare your power, or the office will be in complete darkness, and Freddy will get you when that happens. In the later nights, the game turns into a more 'Strategic-Horror' Game. You'll need to plan a strategy, so the four animatronics won't get you, and your power won't get completely drained. It's a really amazing experience, and it costs only 5 bucks. You definitely should buy it, it's really worth it. 10/10",

I had a blast playing this game and the game is oozing with atmosphere but it's not an atmosphere I find particulary scary.  This game is fun and a blast to play but I actually wonder how many people are just playing up that it's super scary because they want to feel a part of the crowd whom do find it scary.

But this game has challenge to it. 4/20 mode took me EIGHT FREAKING HOURS to beat. But i did it anyway because i like challenges, and i will not stop until my mission is complete. Foxy has made me jump a couple of times, but i am not scared of this game. I just like the time consuming challenges of defeating this game.  Those are my thoughts on this game. I recommend it if you have a fear of animatronics, like to be scared, or like challenging games. Or all of the above.",

Boys and Girls of all ages, I bring to you the game NIGHT TRAP on the Sega CD should have been: Five Nights at Freddy's.  This game is so atmospheric, so creepy, and so tense that even my dogs jump in fright as the game gives me a game over screen. Using nothing but still images on a camera, some lights, and two doors, your job is to last 5 whole nights.   'Last five nights? From what? What's trying to kill you?'  Freddy and his gang.  These animatronics are unlike any other antagonist from any game I've played. If there is a phobia of animotronics dressed in mascot costumes, I have it now. The game tells you that instead of moving around the establishment, you must sit in the office, awaiting any who dare come your way. Watching the cameras for the robots to move, whilst watching either sides is a MUST. If you aren't careful, one of them might come into the room. And game over. What do they do to you? I won't say. Don't even look up the answer. You'de be doing yourself a HORRIBLE misfavor.  You only have limited power, and sometimes, the lights and doors won't work. Key mechanics you should know right now.  The only drawback I have with this game, is the jump-scares getting stale, repetitive, and annoying soon after. The game itself, though? Harmless enough.  Have fun...Freddy'll keep you company...",

            "review_text": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click, horror survival game created by Scott Cawthon. The game centers on a fictional pizza restaurant called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza', where the player must act as a night security guard, defending themselves from the malfunctioning animatronic characters by tracking their movement through the facility using security cameras.  The player must survive their shift, lasting from midnight to 6:00 a.m. without being attacked by one of the animatronics roaming the facility. The player, who sits in an office and is unable to move, is given access to a network of security cameras throughout the facility to track the movement of the animatronics. Four of the five characters have distinct movement patterns while the fifth, 'Golden Freddy', only appears when certain actions are taken, however, most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics.Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out, leaving the player with no defense against an attack.   FNAF is actually a fantastic game. Even if the animatronics aren’t scary, the lore behind the series is the most talked about, most researched, and perhaps the biggest lore of any game ever. Heck, it’s the only thing that keeps Game Theory running! (No offence to MatPat. You are one my favorite Youtubers)  If you have never played FNAF, you really should. Even if you don’t enjoy the games, the lore behind the whole thing, is something worth checking out. 10/10   Three sequels have been released:  Five Nights at Freddy's 2  Five Nights at Freddy's 3  Five Nights at Freddy's 4 and soon, Five Nights at Freddy’s 5 : Sister Location",

This game was based off of a Maryland pizza parlor, called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, carrying the motto, 'Where food and entertainment come to life,' straight from the restaurant itself. The restaurant was closed down in 1987 and is still being investigated because of an animatronic coming to life and biting into the frontal lobe of what used to be (but she is still alive) a very happy customer.

            "review_text": "So, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 has officially been announced! Choo Choo, all aboard the hype train! Final destination: your worst nightmares!  I already posted a review of FNaF 2, so you can go check that one out if you want. I figured I'd just talk about what could easily be my game of the year 2014 and the biggest indie horror sensation since Slender (though far more deserving in my opinion). So is Five Nights at Freddy's really that good, or is it an overrated piece of non-scary garbage after all is said and done? Eh, considering you already saw my recommendation, you probably know my answer in advance. Ah well, let's get to talking about it.  On the surface, the story of FNaF is very simplistic. You play as Mike Schmidt, a nightshift security guard at a family restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria that's based on Chuck-e-cheese. The mascots Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the bunny, Chica the chicken and Foxy the pirate fox are represented as animatronics, and though they appear innocent during the day, entertaining the children with songs and games, at night they roam around the restaurant and don't take kindly to any humans still around. Your goal is to survive five nights, from 12 PM to 6 AM (around 10 minutes in real time), avoiding getting your face rammed into an animatronic suit. Sounds fun, right?  The gameplay is refreshingly simplistic. Instead of moving around with a flashlight like in most indie horror games, you are stuck inside the security office. You can use the security feed to monitor the mascots throughout the restaurant, check the doorlights and close the doors should one of the aggressors get a bit too close for comfort. This would be a lot easier if you didn't have a limited amount of energy to manage. Everything you do uses power; using the cameras, keeping the doors closed and turning on the lights. When the power runs out, the building goes into a black-out, and it won't take long until Freddy gets his chubby bear hands on you. You can't close the doors all willy-nilly, you gotta do it when you really have to.  Balancing is of course very important in every game, and FNaF handles it well. Foxy and Freddy force you to use your cameras while Bonnie and Chica require you to check your doors. In short, if you only use your camera, Bonnie or Chica will kill you, and if you never check your cameras, Foxy or Freddy will eventually get you without warning. There's a fairly competent difficulty curve, where new animatronics become active across the first few nights, and become more aggressive during the later nights. Unfortunately, with some very simple tactics the main nights become kind of easy. Even on the bonus night 6 it's perfectly possible to prevent Freddy and Foxy from even moving at all simply by watching them frequently enough. Yes, my main complaint about the game is that it's perhaps a bit too easy. Then again, Custom Night 7 allows you to make it as difficult as you want it to, so you could say it's a moot point. I just wish the main nights were just a bit more challenging.  Now let's clear up a misconception I frequently hear about this game.  'In Five Nights at Freddy's you're just waiting for a jumpscare to happen.'  This is a rediculous statement. That's like saying 'Super Mario Bros is just waiting until you get hit by a Goomba'. Unlike a lot of horror games, Five Nights at Freddy's uses jumpscares as a sort of punishment for failing. A succesful night will have virtually no jumpscares. You could say that the sound that plays when an animatronic appears in the doorlight is kind of cheap and pointless (FNaF 2 removed this), but they're not THAT bad. I prefer a screamer as a way to accentuate failure over one of those fake jumpscares common in horror any day.  FNaF isn't all about jumpscares either. It nails other horror aspects exceptionally well. From the eerie dark ambient music that plays subtely in the background to the pitter-patter of the mascots on the move all around you. Weird circus music plays from an unknown source, mysterious knocking on the walls and children's laughter echoes through the halls. This game is filled with brilliant atmospheric sound design, and I'm a sucker for good sound in video games. I found the sequel lacking in this regard. Paired with the ominous dark rooms of the restaurant, the parts room being the most unnerving, and you've got yourself a highly immersive horror game that seems so simplistic at first glance.  The concept of having sentient animatronics as villains in a horror game is such genius I'm surprised it hadn't been done before. It plays off the irrational fear of mascots and animatronics a lot of people seemed to have when they were kids (and perhaps still do). I can't say I have the same sentiment for animatronics, since chuck-e-cheese is not a thing where I live, but I know mascots at theme parks unnerved me when I was young. I found Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy so fascinatingly terrifying from the moment I saw them, and they were the main reason why this game spoke to me, but Foxy sprung out to me. While the first three are designed to be creepy stalkers, Foxy is simply scary. With his sharp teeth and threatening demeanor, he evokes a more rational, primal fear, like you would fear a wild animal. Seeing him sprint down the hall towards you is comparable to being jumped by a rabid dog. His design and behaviour conveys it perfectly. He means you harm in more obvious way.  I would say Five Nights at Freddy's is more than a game, it's a psychological test. How well do you handle stressful situations? Do you easily panic under pressure? Because the game totally punishes you if you do. When you start freaking out you make mistakes and lose track of what is really important. It feeds off your paranoia and kills you when you start losing it.  Horror is extremely subjective, and not everyone will get scared by the same things. If it didn't scare you, that's a shame, but you can't deny that Scott Cawthon did a damn good job on this one, especially considering he did everything by himself. It's a game that has scared the pants off of thousands of people, reached cult status in mere days after its release, introduced characters that are already iconic, has a deep and dark storyline that sparked huge amounts of theories and has countless fans chomping at the bits to see more of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 in the near future. Oh, and it's fun to boot.  Five Nights at Freddy's is THE new IP of 2014 that by far had the biggest impact on me and I can't wait to get some more of that goodness.  I'm Ready 4 Freddy!",

The mechanics were well thought out and the game itself was fun to play even if the story was a little weak in itself. the animatronics are cleverly thought out and makes you adapt to each one of them as individual characters rather than lumping them into one big threat, for example Foxy will only come out of pirate cove if you do not watch the cameras(including his camera) often enough or watch them constantly. This forces you to watch the cameras and maintain a balance between reserving your limited power(which constantly dwindles) and keeping an eye on the animatronics lest they try and make a break for your little closet you call a security room and shove you into a costume filled with nice little sharp and point bits of metal. I look forward to the next game this company creates and I can say 100% they have made a fan of them out of me. 10/10 Ready for Freddy.",

            "review_text": "Five Nights never really catched my attention. At first it seemed like another typical jump-scare game that Youtubers will just overreact about in videos. Once MatPat released his theory on the story, my interest began to grow. I started searching stuff about the game and at the peek of it all, I bought it on Steam. The gameplay is pretty simple, you just have to monitor the animatronics at night for 6 in-game hours and keep them out from the security room you are at. You have a camera that shows most of the building to you, 2 doors that you can close and 2 lights that you can turn on to see 2 o fthe animatronics in case you can't find them on the camera. The real kicker though is that EVERYTHING DRAINS POWER. Power is basically your best friend while playing the game and it drains at a moderately slow rate when you don't use anything. The more stressed you are and francticly try to check the camera and close the doors, the more power it drains. This makes the game an interesting combination of surviving the animatronics, while at the same time trying to not run out of time. pretty unique as far as horror games go. Speaking of horror, this game seriously has none. I am a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to any type of scare, but this game was a walk in the park pretty much. Not even close to the scariest game ever as everyone tries to say. I will, however, say that it was mostly because of the way the game is made. It is possible to beat the game without a single jumpscare, as long as you have the skill to do it. This is good, because your own skill dictates the scares of the game. Very cool. Let's talk about the nights, shall we? The first 3 or so nights are pretty easy if you know what you are doing. When night 4 comes, it gets harder. Not only do you have to deal with Bonnie and Chica, which can sometimes overstay at your doors and drain too much power, but you have to deal with Foxy, who can quickly run at your office and can get you killed if you don't check him often. Freddy also becomes a threat and can be a problem if let to go close to your office. There are plenty of strategies out there on how to beat nights 3-6 and it's even possible to make Freddy and Foxy stay at their starting points the entire night, making it quite easy.  Night 7 is a custom night that you can change to your heart's desire. It's mostly just a nice end-game addition to help you practice, but if you beat the hardest possible setup, you pretty much have beat the game 100%. The presentation is another thing where this game excells at. The dark and eerie athmosphere really has that feel of being alone at night.  In the end, the game is great. I think that it's a good entry point for people who are interested in horror and it has great mechanics, great athmosphere and a story that makes you think. If you are interested, give it a go. It's not the easiest of games, especially when it comes to the later nights, but it is well worth it just for the experience. ",

It's a pretty oppressive setting to start with, but before too long the phone will ring and you'll start to get an idea of the situation you've gotten yourself into.    KISS Principle   The game-play itself couldn't be simpler. You flick between grey, fuzzy security feeds, watching out for anything unusual. You view the empty tables, the dark corridors, the animatronics room.  You'll get your first glimpse of the 'puppets' themselves. You remember how I said earlier that the Chucky doll from the Childs Play moves was creepy? Well the unnerving smiles leering through the metal and fur present on these animatronics captures that sense of menace perfectly, but there was only one chucky, here you'll find yourself stalked by a few of the creepy buggers! The only other controls you have beside flicking through the CCTV screens, are the door controls (you can lock yourself in your office) and the door lights (CCTV doesn't quite cover the dark access to your office, A blind spot which can prove fatal.)    It's behind You!   Wait, did you just say fatal? Oh yes, Freddy and his friends have a habit of wondering around at night, and should they manage to find their way into your little office... well.. . It's game over man! So why don't you just turn on your lights, lock the doors and wait till morning? It's a question of power management. You only have a limited amount of electricity you can utilise throughout the night. Keeping the lights on drains power, keeping the doors locked drains power and trust me, you don't want to be out of power when you see that creepy bear leering into the security camera just outside your office!    Surprise   Don't go in expecting a triple A release here or you will be disappointed, what you essential get for your money are a series of static screens you can flick between and some creepy audio, but this bare bones description doesn't do the experience justice. With such a simple premise and game mechanics it's a surprise that this game works, but it does. This is a title that is more than the sum of its parts. The tension builds as your power reserves dwindle.  You'll see the cuddly killers creeping ever closer. You'll have your finger ready on the door lock button, just one more second, just one more second before you hit it.... This game oozes atmosphere, It's as creepy as hell and it WILL make you jump! If you're looking for a cheap scare that you can enjoy over the course of an hour or so, then you can't go far wrong with Five Nights At Freddy's.

            "review_text": "I ignored this title when it first appeared on the Steam catalogue as it didn't really seem to be my kind of thing, but after a friend suggested that I look it up properly, I proceeded to watch the trailers and thought that it would be worth a go... why not? I had a look around the net and got it for 50% off on  HumbleBundle.com .  First of all, I am really glad that I took the time to play Five Nights at Freddy's, even though it's not the type of game or genre I would normally go for, it turned out to be a lot of fun and  actually pretty scary , even though you  know  what's coming after a couple of play-throughs, the game still has an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple horror game where you take up night shifts as a security guard for Freddy's resturant, strange and frightening things being to happen when the animatronics seem to develop a mind of their own after 12AM. You have a limited amount of power and thus, very limited visibility while you struggle to decide if you want to keep the cameras/lights on or the doors kept sealed. I won't go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it for any of you.   This turned out to be a great little Indie Game and the way it has soared in popularity in such a short amount of time is astounding, but I am glad that this is getting a lot of recognition. Even though the concept is simple, the game itself is fantastic and a lot of fun, especially at 2AM in the morning with all of the lights off and volume on full. Even though it's somewhat of a short game with simple controls, it is well worth the £1.99 I spent on it (I'd say it's worth the full £3.99 too) and I am really looking forward to a sequal or any future updates.   If you've been keeping an eye on this but are unsure about spending £3.99 on something short, see if you can find it on sale somewhere. Take my word for it, it's  brilliant . This game proves beyond a doubt that simplicity in a game can be very effective.",

These youngin's are trying to ruin my horror games! Seriously, don't bother trying to find a good community.   Without any of that into consideration, the game is good. (Depending on who you are.)   As for the horror part, it's great. It's dripping in atmosphere, and while you could call it 'jumpscare-bait,' the jumpscares would be meaningless without a good build up. The sound design is superb, it's haunting and the game rewards you for listening closely as most of the sounds mean something.   The gameplay is great and very original. It's very well thought-out, you can really tell that a lot of effort went into making all the mechanics. That being said, many people don't like it and just feels as if it's micro-management. The animatronics all move and act mostly randomly which is great and unexpected in Nights 1-4, but on 5 it just feels unfair. You can play the game perfectly, yet it'll screw you over because... why not? It feels like a fake added difficulty, when I die I should feel like I made a mistake! Not because the random number generator screwed me over!  The visuals are simple and not overly detailed, yet they are good enough and give the game it's own style and character. Each room is well put together and can be really spooky, especially at night! The graphics are all pre-rendered images, and while it is rough around the edges in places, it isn't too easy to notice. It's done very well to trick you into think it's actually 3D. (Though more observant players will notice.)   The story is what some would call the only part worth playing in this game. The story is presented very well, and is very mysterious. It's a lot of fun to try and put the pieces together and search for clues throughout the series. Yet, despit what some think, the story itself is very simplistic.  It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.  Even with all that, it is far from perfect. The jumpscares look laughably silly, and it could remove all the built up tension you had. The game is well designed, but not well made. There is no pause button. Pushing escape instantly exits the game. (Like, what?) There are no options what-so-ever. (No subtitles for people who like them) There are no resolution options, the game is not widescreen so if you play it fullscreen on any monitor that isn't decades old, it'll just stretch the image. This is 2015, widescreen should be the standard.   If you can ignore it's technical flaws, the community, and want a unique and fresh horror experience, play this game. If you've seen videos and don't think you'll enjoy it, then you probably won't, so don't bother. And if you do enjoy the game, then I recommend the sequels!  The sequels are great, and they don't feel like shameless cash-ins. Each game brings a new gameplay twist making each one stand out as it's own game. I say you should give all of them a try, but if you only want to try one I would say go with the fourth one. It's really good. (Unfortunatly, they all suffer from the same flaws as this one. Except for the jumpscares, those got better to the point of actually being freaky.)",

This game has taken those robots that kids love, and created a straight-up nightmare.  Five Nights at Freddy's is amazing. It is a unique horror game that is simplistic yet so satisfying to play. This game has you responding to a local newspaper ad for a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a place that is very similar to Chuck E Cheese's. With singing robots, pizzas, and parties, it should be a place that brings much fun. Freddy's has a very dark and mysterious past and has one feature that keeps it from being a pizza-filled paradise: the animatronics tend to 'roam around a bit at night'. Normally this wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that these robots will recognize you as a metal endoskeleton without a furry suit. This is strictly against the rules at Freddy Fazbear's and these robots will gladly obey the rules by shoving you into a suit. This wouldn't be bad either, if it weren't for the fact that these suits already have endoskeletons, so you won't survive the plunge. You must survive each night of the week as you manage security cameras, large metal doors, lights, and a dwindling power supply that will certainly spell certain doom for you if it diminishes completely.  With gameplay mechanics never seen before and an extremely creative setting and characters, Five Nights at Freddy's earns a solid 9/10 from me.  My only wish is to see updates bringing new content to a wonderful game and I hope to see more from Scott in the future.",

Anyways, it says that you could be a nightguard, ensure safety of the anamatronic animals, make sure (that they stay in their proper place)that they don't get stolen. But the problem is, when it becomes nighttime, you aren't alone. The anamatronics(as far as I've heard) are little kids stuffed inside the costumes by the employees. And now they're trying to get revenge. So they come to life at night, and, yeah, try to kill you. There are four animatronics 'Bonnie' the bunny, 'Chica' the chicken, 'Freddy Fazbear' (the main character of the anamatronics), and lets not forget (my personal favorite, notice my profile picture) 'Foxy' the pirate. But anyways, the object of the game is to keep watch of the cameras, manage your power, and make sure the anamatronics don't come near you. If you like repetitive games and jumpscares as well as excitement and dread every second you play, I highly recommend 'Five Nights at Freddy's'.",

I would reccomend this to anyone who wants the spooky/paranoia experience without the blood and gore that you see in stuff like Neverending Nightmares. While blood is acceptable and expected, it isn't something you can have around slightly younger audiences (Not toddlers, but 4th grade through middle school.)  However, this game is NOT, I repeat, NOT for everyone. It all depends on how you look at horror games. If you start this game up expecting another Amnesia or Slender type get-chased-by-monster game, then you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This game is NOTHING LIKE THEM. In this game, you play as the night guard for a run-down soon-to-close pizzeria with animatronic animals that come to life at night and try to kill you. Think of it as if Chuck E. Cheese and Night at the museum had a baby raised by Satan. In FNaF, you cannot run. No, you aren't running around the Pizzeria trying to not get caught from 12 to 6. You work form a tiny office with 5 ways to interact: Close 2 doors, Turn on 2 lights, and check the various cameras to track Freddy and Co. throughout the building. To sub-quote the mighty BrutalMoose 'Essentially you are in the center of a giant Pac-Man maze trying to keep the robots out.' This game relies on the creepiness of it's environment as opposed to being scared of Freddy himself. And it does that well. This game changes everything you know about horror games and twists it, and you may or may not love it. It also may or may not be worth the 5 american bucks you spent on it. Fortunately there's a mobile version that's cheaper.",

You have a right to be scared of the game, you have a right to do that. But you have no right to judge it by its jumpscares. It's impossible to put into words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what a horror game is. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was playing Slender... seems a thousand centuries ago. I played at a friend's house to just get it over with. I left the computer because I had to eat dinner. After I fin-  OKAY, OKAY, I'll stop ripping off Apocalypse Now for Now and just say that this is easily, EASILY, the definitive horror game of 2014 (In... case you didn't know that already). Five Nights at Freddy's is the product of indie video game developer Scott Cawthon, and his first attempt at a horror game. From my knowledge, he did make some games in the past, and weren't necessarily bad either, but did, on occasion, get some negative feedback from players complaining that the character movements in those games resembled those of animatronics.   Fast forward a few years later and Scott decides to USE this negative feedback to make his own original game about, you guessed it, animatronic anthropomorphic (animathopomorphnic) animals out to kill you and you have a limited power supply, limited vision, a security camera, and a FAN (*shudders*).... Oh, and also it's actually the 4th restaurant in a series of restaurants that all closed down because one closed down because of a murder of a child outside FredBear's Family Diner, and the second one (Fazbear's Pizza) closing down because of multiple parents complaining of the smell of the animatronics, comparing them to reanimated carcasses, and the third one closing down because of a certain Bite of '87. So... yeah, bad history. I could go more in-depth with this plot (Puppet is behind everything (probably)), but I'll save that for the FNaF wiki.  Now, gameplaywise, THIS game is what I call a break in the horror timeline. The typical indie horror game of 2013 or 2014 was very simple. You're a person whom you don't know the name of and you're trying to escape an asylum, or maze, or house, or-- and you're treated to cheap jumpscares, Unity graphics, lame story, bad voice acting, and general 2013-14 horror game logic: it's not scary. BUT, Five Nights at Freddy's changes this completely. It's a game with generic, yet unpredictable jumpscares (especially during the 1st and 2nd Nights), and that makes them very effective, EXTREME rising tension, good replayability, simple, but original graphics, ENGAGING AS ♥♥♥♥ backstory, and a guy on the phone who talks to you every night. Think of him as George Clooney from Gravity: he's there to relieve your stress for 3 minutes.  With all of these components in place, Scott Cawthon made a game that probably changed the horror gaming industry for a while. It's honestly the very first horror game that I've ever played that I keep coming back to nearly every day to have another shot at that ♥♥♥♥ing 20/20/20/20 mode. And with that said, if my review wasn't descriptive enough, and you've NEVER seen any footage, information, or talk about this game at ALL, go on YouTube and check out Markiplier's complete playthrough of the game (you won't regret it).  tl;dr While jumpscares, and difficulty can lead to the game eventually not becoming scary at all, Nights 1-3 in Five Nights at Freddy's were the scariest 3 days of my life, and, potentially, my most chaotic. Pay the man your 5 dollars and play this game.  Also: return of the honk.  19.87/20",

            "review_text": "When I first started this game, I was struck by it's immediate warning, which had the words 'light', 'loud' and 'scare' - already that sounded like the kind of passive agressive / insane temperament I was forced to grow up with as a child in Long Island, NY in the 1980's.   After many hours being in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, I can say this place is one that you owe yourself, as a human being who uses a computer, watches films, and likes a good story - to vist at least once.  I appreciate the source of emotion this game uses - the fear of inanimate objects being imbued with life - the sadness of tainted childhood (let alone - LOST childhood...) - the anger at an unappreciate employer (you have NO idea what I have been through...!) - the joy of victory...that last one will only last briefly.   The plot is that you are a night watchman at a nearly defunct children's party place, akin to a Chucky Cheese, which was the source of video games/arcades in the 1980's and is what helped even spawn the popularity of games today (this game, in essence - is a twisted homage to the very origin of mainstream gaming). The game was 'sold' to me that you were making sure the puppets do not move, and do not come to your room. I was very confused - to me this game looked HORRIFYING but there was no hint at the horror, and it felt more like a 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space' mixed with 'Child's Play' type of experience...why are all these screenshots so scary, yet the gameplay sounding so innocent?  Because the game itself relies on your fear: of the strange, of adults, and of corruption.  The things I love most about this game are unfortunately, what I feel most big budget developers, and most gamers now, would and will try to change. I see 'complaints' about Five Nights At Freddy's, but to me, are it's sordid virtues:  - The game cannot be played in windowed mode (which means..no distractions! - when you play, you are immersed in the game as if you were playing it on a TV/Console or Arcade - you can't multitask, typing in Word, ordering crap on Amazon, changing songs in iTunes, check your Wordpress, Facebook, Farm, etc. etc.)  - The game can't change resolution or 'insert setting here' (because the developer perfected it for you - this game is an artfully created experience - it's like a video game version of a French Film from the 60's - it's an 'auteur' at work - the game's creator knows what he is doing, trust him - and go with the sound settings and graphics he picked - let the 'Five Nights At Freddy's' take you as its prisoner.....in every way...)  - There is no save setting (The beauty of this game is that an enjoyable play session can go anywhere from 2-20 minutes - and the learning curve is steep - save settings and short levels become redundant)  This game is worth every penny of it's price. I purchased it based on it's uniqueness and that it spoke to me as a lover of a good story well told. I was rewarded with an amazingly crafted and simple Puzzle Horror game that I could play at day or night - and within seconds be swept away to an intense little cramped office, where all that mattered was immediate survival - 'Five Nights At Freddy's' is not just about watching cute animatronic characters in a security camera - it's about why you're watching them - are we as 'dumb' as the person who took this job? Maybe he just wanted a scare and a challenge too.  Play it, enjoy it - take your time - then go watch a horror film and play a game - 'Five Nights At Freddy's' is an ode to both.",

Very Unique, compare to other horror games where you chase or run away from monsters, this you can't which really gives your the feeling of hopeless as they are trying to get you.  2. Even though jumpscares is cheesey, it always gets you all the time even when you expected it. This is the mother load of jumpscares.  3. I have an older brother who always watches scary movies............he won't play this game. Enough said on that.  4. You have to look closely and quickly but there are a few humor in this. For example, there a list of rules somewhere, reading it you'll see a rule that states 'Don't poop on floor'. I want to hear the story behind that one.  5. Creepy characters: Yes they are not scary, but you have to admit that they are pretty creepy. I'm actually scare of Golden Freddy. *Shivers*   Negitive:  1. Loses it's charm: if you play it long enough it starts to lose it's charm.  2. Very repeitive.   Yes I haven't played it for a while, but seeing videos and reading 'phone guy's' dialog it really creeps me out even to this day.

A few months go by, FNAF 2 is out, and I still haven't played the game. I eventually used some money that I recieved for Christmas to purchase this game and FNAF 2 here on Steam. Iv'e played through the game and beat it already (with the exception of 20/20/20/20 mode), and I am not disappointed. Five Night's at Freddy's is a simple yet fantastic horror expierience. It offers a new approach to horror, along with a very interesting story that keeps you hooked and playing until the end. I tried desprately to not die from anyone in the game. But when I did, I jumped out of my seat a bit, and my heart felt like it was going to explode for a few moments. My only real gripe of the game is the tediousness that can come with it, especially after playing each night a while and continuing to get stuck on one. Another small issue is that the game really doesn't have any replay ability, despite the unlock of a custom night mode. All in all, Five Night's at Freddy's is a fantastic horror experience. This game goes to show that not all good horror games are made by the big budget companies. I'll give Five Night's at Freddy's a 9/10.",

The gameplay, simple yet creepy visuals and sound design all make it a solid game designed by one man.   However after a few nights in the novelty wears off and the atmosphere wears off after multiple replays of the same old jumpscare. The game should've been called 15 Minutes at Freddy's, as it eventually comes across as just a novelty for you and your friends to fool around with on Halloween night.  Overall, it's not bad. It just can't really hold up as a playable horror game with it becoming repetitive too soon.",

Some reccommendations for this game will include: Playing at night Play with headphones (medium - loud volume)  play by yourself for nightmares or play with friends over for hilarity... or a few extra pants to throw in the washing machine  A few things I would like to see in this game would be. A radio that you can click on to play some music/talk radio stations on, -- But that takes away power as usual -- talk radio stations would have stuff like news relating to the pizza place you work at, like; 'In other news, the man who went missing was last reported at his night job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria' or something along those lines... On the custom day (Day 7), you should be able to have an optional 'Infinite Power' cheat. A special ending for completing 20/20/20/20 on the 7th day.... or an acheivement or something... All in all it's a great game to play if you're bored and want a good scare 8.5/10",

I've beaten night five, and it was genuinely challenging to manage everything at once.  You have a limited amount of power of which you can spend on looking through the cameras, flicking the door lights on/off, and locking the door. It makes you manage when you look around, and how often you do it.  You can't sit with your eyes glued to the cameras because it'll drain your power just as fast as keeping a door closed. Speaking of which, I love how all of the devices consume the same power, so there's no inherent punishment for locking down the door, and it just creates a better game flow in my opinion.  True fear is created by the feeling of helplessness, and that's something FNaF gets really right. What really makes the game frightening for me is the suspense. Not of the monsters themselves, I don't find them particularily scary. What really gets to you is that at any moment you could slip up and blow the game in a second. You have to keep your guard up the whole time, because at no time during the game are you safe. The feeling of insecurity, the atmosphere, the apprehension. Those are what makes the game frightening.

It does get challenging at times especially as you have to check on all of the animatronics at the same time as well as making sure you're not using too much power (I suppose that adds to the challenge of the game: Managing power as well as checking all of the animatronics and surviving). I feel the creator of the series did a good job at creating it and developing it by himself.   Do I recommend it? If you like psychological horror, of course I recommend it.

I nonchalantly get to night 4 using Markiplier tactics on night 7, 20/20/20/20.  Night 4. 12 AM. The call starts. I don't care and begin monitoring the cove. The call cuts to Freddy's music and the call suddenly ends there. I start to worry a little, thinking this is where it ends.  I was right.  No less than 10 seconds later I look at the cove, not to find an 'Out of Order' sign, but replaced in all caps with a sign in the EXACT position, aying 'IT'S ME'. Not a footstep echoed. Silence was very prominent. Even my friend was quiet, seeing the distraught look on my face.  Knowing what was about to happen, even without echoing footsteps, i lower the monitor and Foxy jumped in my face.

            "review_text": "I went into this game with the mindset, 'Eh, it's a popular horror game and it really doesn't look all that scary, so what's the harm in playing it?'  Three days in and I'm looking at the walls, searching for clues to whatever grizzly tale this once-innocent pizzaria posesses.  The game centers around your character, Mike Schmidt, as you work the night shift at a pizzaria called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The game is rumored to take place around the early 90's due to the amount you get paid (about $125 at the end of the week) being the minimum wage for that time. Also due to the pizzaria's one defining quality; animatronics of child-friendly creatures. Foxy the Pirate Fox, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny and Freddy Fazbear. What could go wrong?  Did I mention the whole 'these guys are here to kill you so have fun surviving' bit?  In the game, you are forced to survive six hours per five nights as these four animatronics try to kill you, each night getting more challenging than the last. As the nights progress, phone messages the previous night guard left for you are played, giving you hints about what to do and posters begin to change on the walls, desribing how a once-loved restauraunt became the nightmarish hell it now exists as.  The game mainly relies on jumpscares for its horror, but the true horror shines when you start paying attention to the posters on the walls and phone calls given to you. (Also I'm about to SPOIL most of the story for you so you might want to leave if you don't want the story spoiled).  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Posters of the animatronics begin to rapidly change into posters of a crying child, a poster of Freddy becomes yellow, resulting in the appearence of the ghost-like, limp Golden Freddy teleporting into your office, crashing the game as he kills you. Finally is the rules poster that changes into four different newspaper articles, describing the story of a man who killed five children and stuffed their bodies into the animatronics that now roam the halls looking for you.  Did I mention the phone messages decribing an event known as The Bite of '87, where the front of someone's skull was bit off by an animatronic?  ***END OF SPOILERS***  So needless to say, the haunting tale behind why the restaurant looks so abandoned in the game is some heavily disturbing material that only gets more disturbing as the second game expands upon it.  Now, of course, the game's mechanics are simple, but in my eyes, the best thing about this game is the anticipation of the jumpscare. You know that if you get caught you will be jumpscared, but you never know when it could happen. The scares are pretty lackluster, minus Golden Freddy the first time you encounter him, but the anticipation of them helps to balence them out.  There's also the fact that, by night 4, you're only checking two places on the camera to make sure the two toughest animatronics aren't moving from their spots. This makes the entire camera gimmick much less substantial to a game based around using security cameras and can take away from the game.  Then again, not having your eyes on half the animatronics by night 4 to actually stand a chance just brings the tension up even further.  So, to summize, Five Nights at Freddys, or FNAF, does great in:  A creepy setting Creative way of giving instructions on how the game is played Creative, fragmented storytelling that allows for a lot of interpretation Great tension  While it doesn't do so great in:  Jumpscares being relied on so much Little use for the security cameras  Final Score: 7/10 ",

            "review_text": "Five Nights at Freddy's received positive reviews from critics. Indie Game Magazine praised Five Nights at Freddy's for its simple take on the horror genre, noting that its artistic direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of 'brutal tension' — worsened by how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese's, and that 'it's an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game.' In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's was considered a 'fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying.' However, the game was criticized for taking too long to load when launched.[1]   Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's a score of 80 out of 100[2], commenting that the game took a 'less-is-more' approach to its design, and that while 'the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability,' it would '[still] head straight to you and eat your face off, or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind will fill in the rest.' The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat, rather than the arrival of the threat itself, as executed in other horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is 'not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all.' Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5; comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap, he praised the game's minimalistic presentation (with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the game, along with the fact that the 'nervous impulses' of its repetitive gameplay would '[reach] almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment.' In conclusion, he felt that the game was 'horror done right,' but that it was too short.   Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who — due to their ability to only move when they are not being observed.[3] Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it 'drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles,' but that the 'inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you.'[4]  ",

For some reason I thought it was a stealth game, where you go from room to room in a randomly generated building with little power. you have to turn on power and avoid the spooki robits.  Then I realized it was none of that.  It was an escape button simulator.",

            "review_text": "They are way too many opinionated 'reviews' that are either just a few words to simply bash the game and its creator or to make fun of the fanbase. I'm going to try to give this game a short and honest, unbiased review.  First off.. it's not really as scary as it is nerve-wracking. As many have stated, it's the anticipation of the jumpscares and the worry of if you're doing things right that makes this game about 'stress management'. You really have to be able to cool your jets to be successful. Unfortunately I am not that kind of person, so every night of this game is a wild ride for me. But don't take me too seriously when I say it's not about being scary or horrifying. Scott certainly nails the atmosphere and seems to know a good deal about what us people find to be creepy. He MUST have watched VSauce's video on the subject before development.  The game has very limited options, mostly regarding video and audio. It would be nice to be able to hear the footsteps a little better, and for the video to able to support a broader range of resolutions. The controls are okay, I guess, but there is a bit of 'dead zone' in the mouse. A tighter, more tangible feel would certainly make the game easier to handle.  Overall, this game really give me the chills! I get nervous easily, and creepy animatronic have also sent chills down my spine. I'll admit, I can't play this game sometimes! It certainly works, depending on who you are and how steely your nerves are. With that, I don't think people who AREN'T at least startled by this game have any right to write a 'review' on it. I mean, come on guys. It really ruins it for interested gamers, and you shouldn't dictate what people should and shouldn't spend $5 on.   Now, I do want to touch on this whole 'milking' thing... You people have a problem with another person's success or something? I don't understand the logic. If you had made a successful product, wouldn't you want to keep getting more out of it? I fix cars for a living. Based on the whole idea that Scott is milking the series, should I start turning down customers who bring their cars to me for repair? Absolutely not. I provide a service, and Scott provides a product. Either way, we have found something we can do that people appreciate us for, and pay us to do. There is no shame in success and making money off of what you do, and no one has the right to shame you for it. Also, aren't you aware that he licenses plush toy and tee shirt companies to produce merchandise for the series? He's got to make a killing off of that, too.   Nonetheless, this game certainly has a good reputation and certainly accomplishes its goal. And there is no way I could be offended by the series' creator unless he emails me back with some nasty reply or something. I give it a 8/10. Maybe a 10/10 if I can ever finish it and see everything it has to offer. And even then I'll have to check out the other 3.... er... 5... :P",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3.Hail Satan  4. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 5. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 6. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 7. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

The first time I played this game I couldn't play it for more than one night at a time because of how nervous and frightened I was. Nicely made and executed very well. However the jumpscares will get very old after a few nights and just an annoying scream that says you lost. But if you are up for a challenge like I was then you can try to beat this game on the highest difficulty and spend hours trying to beat 20/20/20/20 mode. I have yet to beat it after all of these hours poured into it. The closest I have gottten is just a few seconds (5-10 seconds) left in the night and plan to beat it very soon.

            "review_text": "Wow. This game. I recommend it in some ways, but really don't in other ways, if you know what I mean.  I'll start off by saying Scott Cawthorn is a genius. Never did I expect a game like this to have so many little details that have a massive effect. This could be some creepy picture that randomly spawns from time to time, and which you either miss or see and get surprised by. Or, it could be Freddy randomly staring at you from the show stage when you least expect it. Everything in this game seems to have a purpose, from an endoskeleton on a table to Freddy's nose. I find it amazing that there's so many different rare screens that could occur and take you by surprise at any moment. This is what makes this game special.  The idea of it is also unique. Most horror games (and by this I mean almost every other horror game in existence) require YOU to do something that usually ends up in your surprising death. However, Five Night's At Freddy's has an entirely different concept. All you do is sit in a chair and look at cameras. This sounds like the easiest thing in the world, but once you play it, you realise how paranoid this makes you feel. You're basically waiting for them to decide when they want to come and attack you. This is an incredibly scary experience, and the game barely ever gets boring (unless you're Markiplier and have spent the past 7 hours trying to avoid an endless cycle of death).  So yes, I do recommend this game, and for many good reasons. If you have a heart condition, then this game is a suicide mission. If you do not, then it is still a suicide mission, but a bit less dangerous. Have a good stay at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!",

At Night (12 A.M.) the animatronics begin to wander around the establishment and if Mike is seen by one of these animatronics, they may mistake him for an endoskeleton without a suit on. Upon seeing him this way, they will try to forcefully stuff Mike into a empty Freddy Fazbear suit filled with componets incompatable with a human, hence Killing Mike. To survive from these animatronics you are given two steel blastdoors with exterior lights, One Tablet/Computer hooked up to the security cameras around the establishment and limited power. By using these, you run the risk of draining power to both the doors and the lights, where you will be vonerale to the animatronics. You must regulate your eletricity usage to survive til 6 A.M.

Chicka will come on the left and then go to the right Chicka will be like Bonney so I have no important thing to tell you and the right door wo'nt jam. Foxy will come on night 2 if you dont look at him every once and a while he'll be sonic the hedgefox and will run down the hall he is in piarate cove so if you noticed it said Freddy and his 2 freinds well Foxy did the bite of '87 people say also Foxy goes to the right and another tip the anamatronics will not come to you (besides Foxy) untuil you use the camera again so Foxy will go after you if your being scared and dont want the anamatronics coming after you well Foxy will stop you from doing that just 'Genious' idea of yours. Freddy does'nt come untuil later in the game usualy on nigh 4,5,6, and custome night he will also 'stuff you into a Freddy Fazbear suit' when you lose power by using doors or the lights and do a jukebox wind up so if you almost made it to the end of the night you might live Freddy comes to the left. Golden Freddy is special he will come to you if you do custome night 1 9 8 7 to a reference to bite of '87 and on the Freddy poster if you spam the camera on it hes a hallusination so nothing bad right?Wrong. you avoid him by quickly using the camera if your to late he will not make you go to the game over screen he will crash your game with a frightening face and also he will teliport through doors. I thank you people who read this and Scott for such a wonderful game and this popular Indie game has many story so if your interested watch therory viedeos or lore videos thankyou for reading.",

So far this game is the best game i have ever played, there is a few pros and a few cons though:  Pros: Great gameplay expieriance, Chilling but entertaining, Even if you play this 100 times you will not get bored, Great animatronic graphics.  Cons: On night 1 there is not much movement, Freddy and Foxy don't move as much as they could.  All and all i rate this game 9.5 stars out of 10 stars.

Only a few point and click defense games came before FNAF. I say defense because in order to not die, you need to use something to your advantage. Thus being doors. And while you have doors, you may never feel any more safe than if it was open because you kow if you keep it closed, the power will drain and you will get caught really quick.  10/10 Scott makes great laxitives.

He may represent GOLDEN FREDDY, since GF is limp. u r the murderer being chased by nightmares of dat harrible night, having no escape from the wrongs dat u did. dat's why u come night after night.  TIps- do not look at ur cameras too long as they comsume power and u can get caught by the animatronics.  check pirate cove if Foxy is there or not. if not, he's probably running in the west hall. shut the left door if so  dont turn on ur lights too often since they take 15% of ur power if u do dat often.

I know this is an indie title, but some graphics feel unpolished. I know that FNaF2 has less polished details; it's just a nitpick. The A.I is unpredictable. I know that Alien Isolation has this problem too, but in that game you have a way to protect yourself. That brings up another subject: this game is like Alien Isolation. It's not a problem, as both these games are great and are worth your time. For $5, Five Nights at Freddy's is a must buy for all horror game fans.

The thought that Scott Cawthon put into this now trilogy is magnificent. The story that goes behind the murders and 'the bite of '87' and the backstories to the animatronics is something that horror games have yet to parallel. There is nothing I love more in a game than hidden easter eggs, secrets, and lore that stretches the imagination. Just look at the craze these games have caused. Multiple channels on Youtube broadcast the terror of the games, and others shine light into the creative backstory and theories that make up the game. Who knows if we will ever know the true story, but as people say, if you can get this many people involved in a discussion across the world about several aspects of your game, you've done something right.",

Chicka will come on the left and then go to the right Chicka will be like Bonney so I have no important thing to tell you and the right door wo'nt jam. Foxy will come on night 2 if you dont look at him every once and a while he'll be sonic the hedgefox and will run down the hall he is in piarate cove so if you noticed it said Freddy and his 2 freinds well Foxy did the bite of '87 people say also Foxy goes to the right and another tip the anamatronics will not come to you (besides Foxy) untuil you use the camera again so Foxy will go after you if your being scared and dont want the anamatronics coming after you well Foxy will stop you from doing that just 'Genious' idea of yours. Freddy does'nt come untuil later in the game usualy on nigh 4,5,6, and custome night he will also 'stuff you into a Freddy Fazbear suit' when you lose power by using doors or the lights and do a jukebox wind up so if you almost made it to the end of the night you might live Freddy comes to the left. Golden Freddy is special he will come to you if you do custome night 1 9 8 7 to a reference to bite of '87 and on the Freddy poster if you spam the camera on it hes a hallusination so nothing bad right?Wrong. you avoid him by quickly using the camera if your to late he will not make you go to the game over screen he will crash your game with a frightening face and also he will teliport through doors.

Which is maybe the most interesting part of the FNaF game's. The games vary little in way of what has happened in the game for this to happen, there are so many theory's about the games back story. Personly I also fet that the game play was vary good, the first few nights the game is vary slow, and quite scary. Then on night 6 and beond, the game takes a turn to a much more tense kind of feeling, mixed with a bit of panic. 4/20 mode had to be the most panic inducing for me. Having to control every thing, and keep an eye on every thing made for some chaotic flailing aobut.  Now with all the prase I have for the game is out of the way, I can say some of the stuff that I didnt like about this game. It was a bit annoying to die, then having the game over screen sit there for a good few minutes, only to be taken to the main menu screen to start over. A quick reset would have been nice. Thing game also doesnt like having more then 1 monitor on your computer, if you move your mouse out of the game screen and on to a new monitor, then thats gg for you, as you flail about trying to get back in to the game before foxy bites your face off. It was also a little sad that there was no reason to look at any of the other cam's aside from foxy's, leaving out a lot of vary interesting pictures that you could have looked at, and a lot of secreats that you would have missed, like the golden freddy scare, or the crying children poster that are hidden away in the game. but aside from those 3 things, this game is amazing. solid 9/10!",

You only have your tablet for cameras, the doors that shut and the lights on them. The noises really mess with you as well. You feel like they're right there beside you and sometimes... they are. It's extremely suspenseful and the time is just mocking you the entire time as you wait for the time to pass and try to conserve the energy.  All in all, if you're looking for a truly scary, suspenseful and thrilling game this is by far the one you're looking for.

You might find it hard to get further in the game whether it can be the robots destroying you or your own will to progress further.   The robots design of uncanny valley-esq looks combined with their AI, the sounds, the subtile changes you might only notice flipping through the cameras, camera 6 being an audio only camera, and even the hallusinations occuring on later nights really hammer a scary enviorment. You will never ever ever know a greater joy hearing the 5-6AM song.   And of course, for the interested, there is a story within the game, and like most good stories, you can take what you want from it.   I'd recommend it for any fan of horror.

This game...my god, this game...It's soooo good and such a fantastic horror game and yet it's so simple in its design. Basically you are a security guard who has been hired for the night shift of watching Freddy's pizza parlor. All you have to do is watch the security cameras by pointing and clicking. However you have a limited amount of power so you can't use the cameras all the time. You also have control of mechanical doors to your left and right sides as well as lights that will illuminate the hallways to your right and left. As the night goes on, the mechanical mascots of Freddy's will move off camera and seemingly appear whenever you switch to a different security camera. Very rarely will you see one of the mechanical mascots actually moving within your camera, and when you do, you are usually done for by then. Very simple, very jumpscary(the best kind of scary in my opinion), and very good. I highly recommend it, one of the best, as well as the cheapest, horror games on Steam.",

For me, this is not about the horror, or jump scares, I am rather immune to that stuff - But what I love is the strategy part, to learn where the animatronics are, how they move in general, how to complete the game perfectly. With that said, I must admit I also love the whole idea, both story, design and gameplay - With much of the story left unexplained, there is a lot of theories to exchange with other fans, which I enjoy being a part of. It is a very interesting game, and I have enjoyed it a lot (On my friends steam, in case you are wondering about my low play time number). I guess some might say it lack a story, and it tends to repeat itself (On another level, if you complete a night) - But I suppose it is mostly used for scaring, which (According to myself) makes the repetition fine - There is no need to make it more stressful no matter who the player is - You know exactly what to do, which makes the game more fun for a longer time. The phone calls are an excellent way of a 'instruction booklet / guide' - Not to mention it also added a bit more scare to the already creepy atmosphere - The only lack at this, was the fact that a new player probably wouldn't listen all that well, being too caught up in the cameras and doors / lights - Speaker tends to mumble a little, I would recommend listening to the calls online, instead of in game, it can get a little confusing. When you've learned all the jump scares and calmed down a little, the real game begins: Are you able to make it trough all nights simply by technic? - Give it a go, you wont regret it. A little summing up: It's a great game, the lacks it have is not problematic enough for the game to not get a good score - If you're a easy target to scare, watch others play it first, that might help. Good luck on your night shift!",

I suspect that those writing negative reviews based on that premise are simply too stupid to understand the patterns. 3. Yes, this game is played a lot. Yes, Markiplier has a large fanbase. However, if you dislike a game because it made people popular, or if you genuinely dislike the fanbase, just don't watch the videos.   This is an enjoyable game. If you feel the need to b!tch about this (or any) game (or their players), you really need to get out more, rather than diminishing the work and joy of others.",

It is good for you if you're looking to be scared or shocked, but it is definitley not the game for you if you dislike jump scares, clowns, etc. It's gameplay is fair and the graphics are a bit 'shady,' and by this I mean that you are always looking through the POV of a camera. The storyline is definitley authentic, but don't play this too mutch in one day, as the charactor's moves and actions become more and more predictible; for instance the duck with the 'Let's Eat' bib will always come down the right hall, and Freddy Fazbear will come down your left. It is definitley tense because you are in ANTICIPATION of being scared, until you actually are. (In other words, you're expecting something to happen all the time, but it most likley won't.) Again, this game is scary, and I don't recommend it for children under the age of 10. I dislike the way the fox gives you absolutley no chance of survival, and people? Let's be honest here. If you actually were going back for a second night, you'd probably either (a) bring a flashlight, (b) bring a gun, or (c) bring both. But in all truth, I would just quit immediatley.",

Con:  1: If your monitor's resolution is LOWER than 1280 x 720, BE WARNED, the game has NO option to change resolutions, not in properties, not in launch options, and not in the game. For many users, alt+enter will work and fix this problem by putting the game into windowed mode, however FOR SOME users, alt+enter WILL NOT work.   FOR USERS WITH HIGHER RESOLUTION, they can simply change their resolution to 1280 x 720 for a temporary time to play. If they use a higher resolution, the game's edges will be cut off.  So all-in-all, check if your monitor can support 1280 x 720 before you buy this game, otherwise key parts of the game you need to use will not be accessible. ",

As the phone guy puts it, they see you as an endoskeleton and will try to stuff you into a Freddy suit, with only your eyes and teeth remaining. If you can survive the enitre five nights, you get a paycheck and beat the game. There ARE optional extra nights, and the 20/20/20/20 challenge, but I personally have to get past night two.

Especially if your are playing alone in the dark. However the jumpscare kill ending is the same for all animatronics. After a couple of hours you will get used to this death sequence and just focus on beating the nights.

            "review_text": "I discovered this game quite by chance while browsing YouTube for some new game recommendations.   I've always believed that I handled jump-scares (occurring at live haunted attractions and such) fairly well. However, I am absolutely terrified of the concept of statues, mannequins, dolls and the like moving on their own accord. It took me five days (pun intended) to buckle down and try FNAF experience personally rather than vicariously through someone else's gameplay. They do say it's better to face your fears head-on, so...sure, why not?  I'm writing this review after my first attempt and I can honestly say that, for me, this game delivered.   It pretty much reinforced every deep-rooted anxiety and primal fear that I could possibly imagine (and some that I couldn't) leaving me in a serious, full-on panic wherein every light in the house had to be turned on and every lock double-checked. It was probably a very bad decision on my part to start this so late at night. So will I be sleeping tonight? Nope.   FNAF is a different sort of horror game than I've every played. The graphics aren't fancy but, in the end, they don't need to be. For a game like this, it's all about atmosphere, and I feel FNAF has that in abundance.   In my opinion, the simplistic and limited mechanics of gameplay, coinciding with its dark ambiance and subtle alterations in sound only serve to increase the level of stress and the feeling that you are powerless. Jump-scares are a pretty basic, yet effective, way to get a reaction and in FNAF they are executed well. The static-filled screens and flickering lights strain your eyes and wreck havoc with your imagination. Limited resources and a specific time-frame provide the foundation for nerve-wracking, split-second decision making and clock-watching. Add in the that fact that your stalkers are a bunch of man-sized, animatronic stuffed animals (with eerie frozen smiles and staring eyes) who will never move when you're looking at them - this game can become pure nightmare fodder for some.  As you progress, the tension becomes greater; the mood more sinister. The urgency to react faster becomes more prevalent - testing your awareness. You're challenged to manage your resources and time against a menace that defies logic and with each night, it draws you further in. Underlying it all is the question: why and how is it happening? And, for that matter, how in the world is this place considered child-friendly?! With little information to go on, the back-story is left to mystery and further adds to the suspense.  At it's core, FNAF touches on the primal fear of being trapped alone, in the dark, facing a horror that wants nothing more than to happily chew your face off.   All in all, FNAF is engaging and proves a game doesn't necessarily have to be gory and violent to be scary. Is it for everyone? Probably not. If your reaction to jump-scares and minimal mechanics is 'meh' - this probably won't do anything for you.   I recommend this game for any enthusiast of survival/psychological horror-themed games looking for something a little different.  10/10",

For normal fans of horror, this game probably is not a good fit, unless you enjoy feeling helpless and like the game is short changing your resources. This game comes down to Understanding the pattern of the Four Robots, knowing how to prevent an attack, managing your resource of limited, unrechargable energy, and a quick ear, and luck.  This game also offers a very extensive lore, that is revel only enough to make the player feel like there's some sort of story, but not giving the full picture, cause many fans to theorize what the story is based on in game clues. This is also a negative point though, since the fanbase is childish, most theroies are half baked, and is overall annoying.  7/10 New good concept good execution good feels controls good  not for the typical Horror fan Based more on luck than skill in highest difficulty awful fanbase",

While I find the idea behind the game and find the McGee like version of Chuck E. Cheese characters to be very creative, the game is still way overhyped. Sitting in a room and turning out lights, checking cameras, and closing doors is just way too simplistic. In my opinion, if this was a game where you were actually a character who could roam around and fight off the monsters it would be worthy of the praise, but being stuck in one room the whole time from the first person perspective, it just seems very amateurish.   In short, the monster puppets are creative and this would be a fun smartphone game to kill time with but as a pc game, if one can get it on sale for a dollar or two I'd recommend getting it just for a few moments of fun but in a world where most games have a open world where you can go all over the place, jack cars, do quests, etc, and so on, this game feels out of place.  But while I don't recommend paying 5 dollars for and while I do think its overhyped I do recommend it to horror nuts (when it goes on sale for a buck or two which it probably will go on sale for during Steam's summer sale) just for the visuals, the interesting creatures, and it gave me an idea for a story, so maybe it'll give other horror nuts an idea for a story, a new horror franchise, etc, and so on.",

Basically you're in a room with cameras and doors with lights to press if your enemies are outside the door beacuse you won't be able to see them very well in the darkness which will be a problem then... Your enemies by the way are 4 animatronic characters that will get more active the more progress you make on your nights... the first one is a bunny called: Bonnie. The second one is a chicken called: Chica... and the third one is a bear named Freddy (which is the main antagonist in the game) and the fourth one is a fox called: Foxy. they are going to try to kill you when they get a great chance and you have to stop these chances and survive through the nights... but be aware of the power you have to left side in the bottom corner... if it runs out you will die... possibly... or maybe if you're lucky you can actually make it to the next night... oh i forgot to mention: you have to work your shifts from 12 am to 6 am in the game... and the only help you get is from a guy on the phone, cameras and the doors that can be closed to stop them from coming in... sometimes you can't close the doors that means that you're doomed... because one of them is in your room and will kill you if you put up and then down the camera... You have to watch every one of them on the camera to make sure they don't move so often... but more necessary... only check on Freddy and Foxy... beacause those two are the actual problems in this game... because they can kill you very easily if you don't check on them too often... but you need to be aware of the other two too: Bonnie and Chica... but Bonnie is more active than Chica is... so you don't need to check on Chica too much... but then there are the other two... or actually THE THREE problems: Bonnie, Freddy and Foxy that you need to guard (you can hear Bonnie and Chica step on the floor outside the room sometimes that means that they might or might not be very close to you) ... I highly recommend this game for those who wants to get their socks scared off &gt;:) If you don't find animals scary... Five Nights at Freddy's will prove what kind of hell animals can be...   PS: there is a fifth animal called: Golden Freddy... and he can be found in your office if you look on the cameras on a poster in one room too much... and if you stare on him too much he will crash your game and end the attempt you're doing in this game... so get rid of him by going back to the cameras, because then he'll disappear...",

Let's not forget that I have respect for Scott Cawthon on making his fans happy (sames goes to the YouTubers and others who either played FNAF or do anything else FNAF related like Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Rebornica, Smike, MatPat, etc.), even if FNAF's fanbase is one of the worst out there (despite there are some fans that don't act like your average FNAF fan). Also, when I first watched Markiplier's videos related to the FNAF quadrology, the jumpscares made jump back when expecting jumpscares per new game, but nowadays, I just got used to them. Should I recommend readers like you to buy the game or any of it's sequels or spinoffs? Well, it depends on your opinion due to how much hate FNAF's fanbase has gotten.",

This game is now a sereies that I have fell in love with and is now one of my favorite games of all time believe it or not. Even though I haven't experienced all the jumpscares yet here is a list from the least scariest to the most scariest of all the jumpscares in the game but of course, the ones I experienced before. No.5 Foxy. This is the weakest really because what all the others do is that they are up in your face while foxy just peers through your door except for the fact that he runs down the hall which I heard scared many players. No.4 power outage scare. This is one of the two jumpscares that Freddy Fazbear has. While your power is all out, after a certain amount of time Freddy will come up to the door on your left and play a song based off something else I forget what its called but when he is done playing the song the rest of the lights go out then after a certain amount of time again will walk upto you then jumpscare you from the shadows. No.3 Freddy Fazbear (jumpscare 2). Now coming to the top 3, Freddy will do his laugh and if he can he will teleport into your office and kill you with an eyeless look and in a more crooked position. No.2 chica. Now we are getting closer and I bet some of you know who it will be anyway, back to chicas jumpscare. This chickens got umph in her scare, she like flys at you doing the animatronic scream for only the first four characters in the game because I know Golden Freddys is more of a roar. (Heh Rhyme). Finally, No.1... BONNIE! Bonnies is really the scariest animatronic character and the proof is that Scott Cawthon the creator of this indie-horror smash hit has walking nightmares of this guy. Bonnies jumpscare is real scary one he is up in your face and second of all his eyes are staring right at you which makes this creepy scare be at the top of this list. Now this game is fun and scary so if you hate this game get lost! Haha I'm just kidding do whatever you want! (: This errie camera and click game deserves a 10/10 and a platinum medal.

There is a positive.  I have mixed emotions about the gameplay. The first night is really easy (I played the third game first before any of them;Im kinda new to this game franchise, I used to hate it and think it was overrated.) This game was one of the best indie games of the year...it was wonderfully scary at first and introduced unique and cool game mechanics. But after about two to the three nights, the game loses its scare factor. The jumpscares are predictable and the gameplay becomes slow and boring. 4/20 was nearly impossible to complete. It took over 4 hours to complete and I was playing with a friend...but because it was a one-of-a-kind and brought forward a brand new theme in the horror game genre. But this game drags out. Five nights actually feels like five days...the gameplay can be ridiculously hard and the power drains way to quickly. Positive and negative.   The style is amazing. I love the designs of the animatronic characters and I like the names. Foxy I think has the best behavior and mechanic to evade him out of the four of them. Its cool to see him running down the hall. The eleven cameras by pulling up a monitor is a cool game mechanic, like I said it introduced a new theme in the horror genre. For a 2014 game, the graphics were pretty cool...the office makes you feel somewhat claustrophobic. Positive.  Overall, because the game was new and introduced a new concept into the horror genre, I would recommend it. The gameplay is fun for the first two to three nights...but afterwards...I dunno. Scott Cawthon did a good job creating a horror game and I think its a bit of the fandoms fault for creating such a bad image for the game with their sensitive comebacks and insanely messed up rule 34 crap...sound effects were cool, characters were wonderfully sculpted and the 4/20 was a good, rageful challenge.   Would recommend.",

Keep doing that until it's 6am in-game and you're done for the night. Repeat again the next night. Congratulations on completing the game in under an hour.  Honestly, I had hoped for way more than it delivered. I was expecting a horror game for PC. What I got was something that wouldn't look out of place on some casual browser-game site. The 'scares' are just jump-scares. There's no tension because there's no need to worry. It's just a question of click until they get too close and then shut the doors till they leave again.  It just doesn't live up to the hype.",

FNAF is basically a game where you are a security guard trying to stop these starnge Chucky cheese type dolls from killing you. You do that with your 10 FPS Cameras and doors that take electricity to close. Wait until morning (6:00) you win. You do this for 6 nights until you finally reach night seven which is custom mode. Setting the API for the animatronics however you would like. Although Scott made a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money off of this game I don't see why this game is so called 'exhilirating' or '♥♥♥♥ pants horror'.

At 5 A.M with about 3% left, open the left door. This worked for me.  Shock horror is very subjective. However, using a jumpscare to shock someone is a very cheap tactic, and you don't get shocked because it's scary. You get shocked because it's an instinctive reaction. It's really only scary the first couple of times. While I know horror, as well as humor and such, are subjective, I think most can agree that a jumpscare is more of a way to get you screaming rather than a way to get you sleeping with a baseball bat at your side because you are having night terrors.  I don't like to factor in communities as something to count in my reviews, because communities are more of a by-product of the game rather than a factor. I also don't like talking about communities with almost nothing more to say; this community has already been 'reviewed' by many people. In short though, the FNaF community feels the need to make everything an animatronic, feels the need to roleplay, and feels the need to use logicless arguements to defend the game.  Here's a   very, very   old 'review' of the community, copy and pasted word for word:  'At the beginning of this year (Janurary 2015), the FNAF Fanbase and fan made material seems to be 'dying'. What I'm trying to say is that since this year, the FNAF Fanbase has been swarmed by people who don't even own the game. When I mean 'people' I mean preteens who only like the game to either: A.) Fit in B.) Be 'cool', or C). Markiplier plays it, (I DO own both games, I'm not a hypocrite) and people who make unsupported theories that are merely speculation. The ABC is intentally related. The people who speculate do something like this (Not a real chat here):  Me: I keep getting killed by Foxy. MereSpeculation: well, foxy wants to hide with u but u get a heart attack. he doesn't like getting stuffed GoldenBonnie: he screams because his voicebox is broken but he wants ur help Me: Where in the game do the animatronics attempt to stuff Foxy in a suit?  Or:  MereSpeculation: ZOMG FNAF IS REAL Me: Really? GoldenBonnie: YES GAME THOERY SAID SO Photoshopper: LOOK AT THIS IMAGE [link]  Timeline is this (I don't know the dates):  August: FNAF is released (or something) Markiplier plays FNAF, and he gains a boost of subs (;)) (I remember watching him in late-2011, so funny) FNAF gets many new players (including me, happened around November) Some Bronies make FNAF songs. I don't really care. December: Around the time FNAF2 is released. Speculation is flooding forums. Markiplier plays the game. (I get the game, still December) More Bronies use FNAF/2 for their fanfics. OhLook ItsFnaf starts playing.  Janurary 2015: The fanbase is falling apart: Most 'theories' are not logical and mere speculation (There are some good ones, just saying that the majority are just spec.) They also flood forums. poniesponiesponiesponiesponies (Bronies use it FNAF/2 much more) Absurd amount of people named after the animatronics, as well as roleplaying. Tons of hate aimed at Scott for 'milking' the series (and yet it's OK to milk Pokemon. Poor Scott) I make this discussion.  tl;dr? Go back up and read it.  I'm not hating on people like Smike, who make FNAF videos, people like Markiplier or OhLook ItsFnaf, who play the game for entertainement, Scott, (ignore the haters! ;) ), or Game Theory, who propose theories (I haven't watched it, but I've heard they're pretty good vids).  I'm just DISCUSSING ABOUT (not hating) people who flood forums with speculation, people who roleplay the animatronics and are named after them, and people who write nonlogical, pointless fanfics.  tl;dr? Go back up and read this discussion.  How do you feel about the current state of the FNAF/2 (and soon to be 3) fanbase? ːballoonicornː    .     .

            "review_text": "LASTING IMPRESSIONS Five Nights at Freddy's  GENRE Horror/Point-And-Click  STORY Five Nights at Freddy's follows the story of Mike Schmidt, the new night guard for the vintage pizzeria starring the animatronic characters Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. Upon starting his first night, Mike is informed by the previous night guard of his duties; check the cameras, make sure everything stays in place, and don't get murdered by the animatronics. You know, the usual. Mike must now survive five(seven) nights in the building making sure to not run out of power, not get murdered by haunted robots, and get his paycheck.  GAMEPLAY The gameplay is fairly basic; easy to learn, hard to master. As your job is to guard the building, you must constantly check the cameras. This will allow you to know where the animatronics are, and keep some of them in place. Along with the camera you have the doors and the lights. The doors are used to keep any and all animatronics at bay should they decide your office would be a nice place to sneak into. The lights will let you know if Bonnie or Chica are outside of their respective doors, so that you may promptly close it right in their faces. Be careful not to forget that this pizzeria has fallen on hard times, and is running on a battery of sorts. All appliances run on this battery, and if you run out of power; it's over.  FINAL THOUGHTS Five Nights at Freddy's is the first horror game I've ever played. In my first couple play sessions I was spooked solid. The game left me on edge, paranoid, and gave me a cold feeling inside. Sadly, the feeling didn't last. After a couple more play sessions it wasn't scary, it was frustrating. It had devolved from a horrific version of Night Trap to Night Guard Simulator 2014. I could only get enjoyment out of it by playing it with friends in a skype call. While I still enjoyed the whole look of the game and got quite engrossed the lore behind it all, I couldn't slog my way through all the nights. Five Nights at Freddy's did not leave a lasting impression, but I'll give it props for trying.  Also, minimum wage for that? Bull. ♥♥♥♥.",

Lastly, the only thing that made the jumpscares was the loud scream - other than that, it was quite cliché; the character just jumping unpractibly at you out of nowhere. I just didn't find it interesting. Not only that, but the fanbase scared me way more than the game did.   I'd rate a 4/10 for the game.  And a 1/10 for how it's now being portrayed by fans.",

All you do in this game is have a character who sits down in a chair... Clicking buttons! How boring is that!  As of the horror aspect of FIve Nights at Freddy's, it is set out in levels (nights), and in each level you do the exact same thing, the clicking button ♥♥♥♥! So if this game is set out in levels, with the exact same thing every level, what does that mean?! It means you get used to the layout the animatronics move in, you know the sound cues, blah blah blah, and all of that adding up to the game becoming less scary! As of other horror games suxh as Alien: Isolation and Outlast, where you get to move around with an ACTUAL storyline, they will not get less scary as you progress because you end up in new territory, instead of being in one place the whole time in Five Nights at Freddy's!

I used up all my power quickly on the first night while listening to the jackass on the phone and got killed at like 2 or 3 AM because a big teddy bear appeared and I couldn't close the door. Loaded it up again and pretty much just sat there for 90% staring dead ahead (both in-game and irl) to conserve power, checked the cameras closest to my doors the remaining 10% of the time, and made sure to shut 'em in time if one of the robotic carebear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s got close. Easy.   Second night was more frustrating. Every time I got to around 3 AM I got jumped by the purple ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Bonnie or whatever. I realize the whole game comes down to observing and responding to the patterns of these bigass pooh bear dolls before they jump you and make sweet animatronic love to your corpse, and I realize that if I stuck with it I could figure out these patterns and respond to them appropriately, and I ALSO realize that this is where a lot of the 'fear' that's supposed to drive this game is derived from.   The problem is that I can't find anything compelling enough about its presentation to bother with it.   It's far too formulaic; even if the animatronics have increasingly complex or unpredictable patterns of movement that increase the likelihood of sudden death and generic ho-hum jumpscares (the lamest form of 'horror'), EVERYTHING is rooted in repitition. The interactive element of the game is so sparse it almost feels like you're just clicking on random pictures in a slideshow until 'AHHH uneckspected soscary.gif' inevitably pops up. And they're the same pictures each time. ALL you can do is move the character's perspective left and right while you're in your office or whatever, open up the camera, and check all the security cameras one by one. Oh, and close and open doors and turn lights on and off. That's it.   In theory, the idea of restricting player control in the interest of generating fear is a good one; but it's implemented poorly here due to a lack of variety and a heavy reliance on cheap scares.",

Sorry, I'm surprised. Here's the 2,000,000 subscriber, we're very proud of you son. A perfect smilk card, all top 10s! Very proud. Ma, I got a thing going on here. You got a lint in your milk. Hey that's my milk! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Smike, I told you stop making top 10's about the house! Hey Smike, Hey Dawko. Is that Milk Gel? A little, special day. I'm reaching 2,000,000 subscribers! Never thought I'd make it. One year two games, the second two games and a book. Those were awkward. One game even was free, I'm glad I was still able to make top 10's about it. You did come back different. Hi Smike, Dawko, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Typhoon Cinema? Yeah, You going to the funeral? No I'm not going. Everybody knows, milk something too much, you get terminated. Don't waste it on using others content, such a hothead. I guess he could have just made his own. I love this incorprating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations, Well Smike , today we are milkers. We are! Smilkers. Amen! Hallelujah.",

Yes Five night's at Freddy’s is a nice game to play but sadly I can't recommend it for a few reasons. These being:  1. Not really a horror person but will play them once in a while, so really only buy if you are looking for a few good jump scares 2. Shortish, although for an indie game it is pretty good, so if you have had bad experiences with other indie games don't worry this game isn’t like them it is really worth it's money 3. Can't change sound options (not really a reason not to buy it but I think it would be nice for them to put it on)  So yea I will say yes it's a good game to buy if you are looking for some good jump scares but if you are like me and not a huge fan of horror things then I will simply just say buy at your own will.

In Five Nights at Freddy's you are a night shift guard for the restaurant that has alot op weird robot furries that want to hug you.  Doesn't sound to bad right? Well it isn't.. In the begining.  You see after night 4 you basicly need to follow a certain pattern in order to win, which ruins the atmosphere. Because, if you succeed the pattern and keep up the whole night, you win. The jumpscares will just get annoying at a point and not scary anymore.  See I respect Scott (the dev) for this game, but the second one.... That's another story.  Also whats a fnaf review without mentioning it's fanbase. It sucks. Don't argue with them, you'll die of laughter (if you don't know dying isn't very fun) Wanna know something else about the fanbase. Half of them didn't even play the game and just like the story. WHich is : a guy kills 5 children. The end. Now you might think 'but I heard so much good stuff about the story' it's all basicly a big (mostly bad fanfiction).  So if you wanna pick up a cheap horror game that will entertain you for a few hours and scare you at the beginning. Buy it. Don't bother with the second one, it sucks. Third one looks like someones crappy fan game made in Gmod with a golden rattle snake bunny that is having a seizure. but it's in the FUUUUUTUUUUURE.",

Partially it might be because the game is mostly just about build up for a jump scare, which I find startling but not scary. But I think the bigger issue is that the game is really just about micro-managing your battery in the most painful way possible.  It also feels like there's an interesting world and story behind everything, but the problem is you don't actually interact with the story. You're just fed (very small) portions of it in the background, but the game play is just hide from the monsters and that's it. The why has no impact on your character, story, or decisions. Among other things, this means I don't get invested in my character at all.  If you're the type of person who likes to get scared, and gets scared by ambiance and jump-scares, than this is probably a good game for you (and yes, I realize that sentence makes me sound condenscending, but I actually mean it legitimately) but otherwise I'd probably avoid the hype.",

Don't play it as a horror game, play it as a strategy game because it is a good strategy game but a meh horror game. You only get jump scares when you die.
