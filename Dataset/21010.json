You can choose between 2 characters to play each with different combos they can do. If this game is in sale its worth a buy if not then there are better games to play. I still give it thumbs up because even it was short i liked the combo system and also wanted to know how the story progresses. Still keep in mind its short only 6 Chapters you can beat in few hours with one character. ",

Today this city is gonna soak with blood.  What can I say about this game...it's just a 3d beat'em up, there is nothing except brawls, u just run from one fight to another punching everything u stumble upon in the face. There is also a lockpicking minigame but it looks so out of place and would rather suit some stealth action. So on the pros side it's a bet'em up that can be played with your fellow bro in local co-op and on the cons side the game is very repetetive and has nothing to offer except simple fighting systems. I'm not even sure the DC/Watchmen fans would like it.",

            "review_text": "This review is for both Part 1 AND Part 2 of The Watchmen: The End is Nigh. The game spans about 6 hours, so don't let my playtime fool you. For whatever reason, this game is split into two parts with separate steam store pages.  Gameplay:  This game is a bit clunky at first, I will admit that. However, the clunkiness does not kill the game, and after a while you get the hang of it it actually becomes quite enjoyable. There have been some criticisms that the game is repetitive. At some points, yes it is. Very much so in fact. However, the story (especially in the first part) is good enough to keep the player wanting to move forward. There are a few glitches to contend with, but nothing game-breaking and nothing that makes it unfair for the player. The combat is fluid and well balanced, and once you learn how to chain together moves and heavy and light attacks it gets very cinematic at some points. The combat system in this game is great for what the game is. It is an arcade-style beat 'em up with comic book-like cinematics in between levels. You should NOT buy this game if you're wanting Batman-style combat, because while you can tell that this is in the same vein as those games, it pales in comparison to the combos and high-flying action of a Batman action sequence.   One feature I quite enjoyed was the constant introduction of gameplay elements through pick-ups. I thought that was a really helpful way for me to keep myself interested and keep fighting through wave after wave of baddie. I wanted that next powerup. Unfortunately, at some points, the pick-ups that seemed to be right in your path suddenly move to something you have to find. At the end game I noticed that I was missing about three or four moves that I could have collected, but nothing in the game told me that I needed to go and look for them. There are also Nite Owl suit batteries and Rorschach cards that you can collect to expand the power-up meter. They're not necessary, and I completed the game without collecting very many of them. If you're a completionist however, good luck, because the level design at times is frustratingly confusing. There were so many parts in the game where I thought that I would find a power-up at the end of this long hallway and theres isn't anything at all. Quite annoying. The second part just gives you all of the moves you missed straight away so you don't have to worry about moving on without your full moveset. They just give it to you eventually.   One thing I thought was odd was the tiny, subtle playstyle differences between Rorschach and Nite Owl. Rorschach is the ONLY one who is capable of picking up weapons and using them against enemies. Nite Owl, for whatever reason, doesn't like to pick up or keep weapons. I think that this makes it more fun, in some ways, to play as Rorschach because theres nothing like smashing a mace across a thugs face. I don't want to give the impression that Nite Owl is useless, however. He has equally awesome moves and I felt satisfied playing as him for the first part. If you're a Nite Owl fan, like I am, you will enjoy this game. If you're a Rorschach fan, you will also enjoy this game.  Story:  I personally enjoyed the story of the first part of Watchmen. If you know anything about the Watchmen universe, and how it differs from our own, you will also enjoy the story. I also enjoyed how Rorscach and Nite Owl converse with each other at numerous points along the journey. They bounce hard-to-grasp ideas off of each other, and each of them have their own opinions that they vigorously believe in. I thought that the conversations between the two main heroes definitely help to make the player think about the pretty complicated concepts that Watchmen like to tackle. The second parts story is lacking, and is very much so the weaker of the two.  Visuals/Sound:  This game is visually impressive for what it is. The environments are done well, and while there is a lot of reusing of materials in this game its not really botheresome. There are some really neat environments and it is fun to see how those environments change the player. An example of this is if its raining in the level, your character will have tiny little raindrops all over them. The visuals are done well and you can tell that effort was put into them. At no point did I feel disappointed by the visuals or art in this game.   Mentioning art, the art direction in this game is excellent. It stays true to the Watchmen movie and really makes it feel almost like deleted scenes from the film. This made me enjoy it all the more.  Overall:  Overall this is not the greatest game to ever grace the steam store. However, if you're a Watchmen fan, like I am, you will really enjoy this game. Part 1 is a really solid arcade style beat 'em up and will keep the player entertained throughout. Part 2, however, feels kind of like an afterthought and because of this it really isn't very good compared to part 1. I found myself pushing to get through part 2 just to get it over with. Some people may even be satisfied with JUST buying part 1. You're not missing anything in part 2.   I really enjoy this game and I think that if you can get a deal on it you should try it out too. On sale, this is a great value for your money. At the time of this review, the first part is 5 dollars, and I think that is a fair price for this game. Bundled together with part 2 it jumps the price up to 10 dollars. I wouldn't pay that for the second part. Get it on sale, and binge on some ♥♥♥-kicking Watchmen action.  Final Score:  Part 1: 7/10  Part 2: 5/10",

It can't picture myself playing this game after a few hours though, because it is incredibly repetitive. If you need something to do for a weekend, and the game is a dollar, then go for it.",

            "review_text": "Im a huge fan of the graphic novel, I liked the movie, but this game sucks pretty bad. It's short, the story is really lame, it can hardly be considered a pre-quel to the movie/comics since there's no connection whatsoever to the original events.  The gameplay is simple, but it suffers from the camera problem of old games (you can get attacked from people that arent showing up on the screen and you dont get warned about it). Few combos, but the executions are really sweet. And the graphics are nice. But the biggest problem is: it is VERY REPETITIVE. Its like: fight, open door, fight, open door, fight.  If you played Ghostrider for PS2, its exactly the same thing.  The characters have some philosofical discussions through the game, but its hardly any deep like the comics intended them to be. The voice over is pretty decent, tho. But all in all, this game is REALLY NOT WORTHY it. The repetition of the same things for 8 chapters makes it really boring and annoying. Just a very bad spin off.",

It's a relatively small game, with 6 chapters that last about half an hour each (depending how fast you go) but it still has a good plot (which i won't reveal)  Pros: - Decent graphics - Simple controls, nothing extreme like you'd expect on other beat em ups - Unique Characters - Enemies arent OP - Awesome double chins  Cons: - If you play as Rorschach, Nite Owl's AI is completely useless, and merely distracts enemies for a while - Linear  Notes: - Short game, which is bad for some, but others might like it. For the price, personally, i can't complain. - Playing as Nite Owl means your AI partner (Rorschach) actually helps fight the enemies - Batman Before Puberty Hit + What looks like the guy from CoD Ghosts  Overall, 8/10 score. Well worth the money, especially if on sale!",

I gave it a try again after some weeks, realised, who awful this ♥♥♥♥ is, and abandoned it until the end is nigh for me.   That said, just let me add, that “Watchmen: The end is nigh” is pretty much one of the most stupid things on steam. The whole thing is just bloody awful, the graphics are ugly, the levels are boring and repetitive, you fight pretty much the same guy cloned a thousand times, because all enemies look the same. Talking of the fights: The whole game is always and constant the same dull repetition: Run along some corridor, beat down some dudes through the same stupid, repetitive, boring combat system, continue to run, split up, run, fight, meet Rorschach/Night Owl again, run, fight, get bored as hell.  The story is a joke. A simple, stupid, bad joke made from cynical WarnerBros. Which obviously only tried to make a fast buck out of the Watchmen franchise. This stupid, dull rubbish is NOT at all worth the name “Watchmen”. There is no deep story (until the point, where I finally gave up), pretty much all appearance of characters you know are nothing else then unmotivated, senseless fan service at most. Nothing of this pathetic piece of digital ♥♥♥♥ is in any way worth the name “Watchmen”.   ♥♥♥♥ this game. And ♥♥♥♥ everyone who is responsible for it.",
