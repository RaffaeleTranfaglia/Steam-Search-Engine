    "description": "Fantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games. It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players.",

            "review_text": "Fantasy Grounds is quite honestly the best virtutal tabletop software. I've tried several, but I run campaigns exclusively on this now. This software has a massive learning curve. You can get the basics quickly, but to master it takes a while. It is so feature rich that you can automate 90% of the DMing with enough planning and set up. My players love the system - other DMs that play in my campaigns want to switch over.   Combined with other software (map designing, photoshop, ect) you can create excellent and wonderful campaigns loaded with graphics built upon a fantastic under-the-hood ruleset system which takes the technical (mathematical) aspects comepletely from the game so you can have lightning quick combat encounters and focus on roleplaying. Of course the combat traker is wonderful if you want to have a combat heavy hack-n-slash campaign and only makes combat more enjoyable.   The story design part of the game is great. You can pin combat encounters, NPCs, story elements, loot, exp, and more directly to the map. Experience can be awarded on command. Loot can be dumped into the party inventory automatically and the players can divide it themselves.   Character creation is simple and easy. All of the math is again automated here. Just drag items to your inventory. Same with spells, but things get more complex if you multiclass, but its just part of the learning curve.   Some will complain about connectivity issues. Port-forwarding is a simple thing to do, but VPN software can get around it. Mac -&gt; PC does have some issues. I only have one Mac user in my games, but he has the majority of the technical issues. Tech support is very fast as well, but I've only had to use it once.  Overall, I can't recommend this software enough. I have had hours of use with it. ",

Since we are just getting started I thought it would be nice to have a program that would show us the rules and do some of the math for us. I purchased a liscense thinking 40 bucks is a lot, but since its a one time fee it would be fine. I got into the game and found that all the features that seemed useful were behind a second paywall.   I've requested a refund and would not suggest this product especially if you are just getting started like us.",

            "review_text": "There's two common threads in many (not all -some have legit gripes) of the negative reviews of Fantasy Grounds: First, the user doesn't bother learning how to use the software, then complains that it doesn't do much for the cost.  Second, the buyer doesn't understand the licensing (specifically, WotC stuff), and is somehow surprised when they don't gain access to the entire PHB, DMG, MM, and published adventures with all of their art, rules, statblocks, etc. for a pittence of what the actual books cost. Part of this is also not understanding just what porting that content to FG does for them. You'd be paying for the rulebooks or adventure books if you weren't playing a VTT or if you were playing on any other VTT. I don't understand why people think they should for some reason be free when in digital form. If you already own the physical books, you can manually enter all that information into FG. You don't need to re-buy it. And you'd be doing this for every other VTT anyway, WITHOUT Fantasy Ground's automated functionality. So you don't need to buy the WotC FG versions if you already own the books. You'll just need to manually enter the stuff -just like playing on paper. If you want the automated functionality for an official licensed product, you're going to pay for it. And WotC has decided that the cost for those are the same as the books (they set the prices, not SmiteWorks). I put the entire Pathfinder Beginner Box into FG using nothing but OGL libraries and the official PDF from Paizo.  Fantasy Grounds is a TOOL. It's not a published game. It's not a published adventure. It's very much like Roll20 or MapTools. You are not getting a complete, ready-to-play Tabletop RPG when you get Fantasy Grounds. Several reviewers also seem to not understant this. It's Virtual Tabletop Software designed to facilitate playing P&amp;P RPGs. You must still know the rules of the game and have many of the resources you'd need to play the game face-to-face (like the battlemaps, player handouts, etc.).   Where Fantasy Grounds shines is incorporating that information into the program itself. You want to add a monster to the battle? Drag it from the MM to the combat tracker -now your monster with all its stats, attacks, and everything else is available right in front of you. Want to add a spell to your wizard? Drag it from the integrated rulebook onto your character sheet, and FG automatically sets the proper dice/bonuses for casting/attack, saves, DR, etc. based on the information in the spell stat block. You can click on the spell and have instant access to all of the spells relevant stats and description -all within the program. THAT is the functionality you pay for when you buy an official WotC rulebook. You have the entire MM at your fingertips with everything you need. Character sheets are updated automatically and re-calculated on the fly (great for things like ability damage).   FG automates many die rolls, so an attack roll boils down to selecting your target and rolling for your attack. Modifiers for size, ability scores, cover, and other conditions and effects are automatically applied. If you hit, simply roll damage and the likewise the correct modifiers are applied and damage the target. This even compensates for different weapon types and resistences. If you roll a threat, it will automatically roll to confirm a crit, then automatically double your damage roll if you get a crit. Stuff like that. In other VTT tools, it's ALL on the GM and players to do that.  There's tons of different ways Fantasy Grounds makes life easier for both the GM and players. From automating common functions to cross-linking notes, maps and images. With the proper libraries a GM can convert a published adventure from paper to FG in an afternoon, and never have to reference anything outside the program while playing.  It's that kind of automated functionality you pay for with Fantasy Grounds, and that kind of functionality does not exist in Roll20 or Maptools (my current favorite is the Barbarian Rage ability from PF -you can re-calculate the character stats, or just add the 'Rage' condition, specify the duration, and FG does all the work for you). And the GM can still override everything, so you can easily houserule your own stuff into supported rulesets (or fix things when your players click the wrong thing or forget to add a modifier or something).  And if you play 3.5 or PF, you're in luck -the entire rulesets are OGL so you don't have to buy anything else. 5e can get a little pricey, since WotC sets the costs for VTT content and they've decided to make it the same as the published books. But, the advantage being, all the content in the books is available and ready to use in FG.  FG is a massive, massive time saver. Both in preparation and playing. Using all of that functionality does require one to LEARN how to use the software. This is a very complex program hidden under a fairly decent UI. Don't expect to DL the software, spend 30 minutes clicking around, and expect to use it perfectly for your session with friends later that night. Going back to my very first point in the review, quite a few of the negative reviews state the program doesn't do things it CLEARLY does -simply because the reviewer never bothered to take the time to learn how to use the software.   Now, TBF, if you're NOT using a supported ruleset (Rolemaster, D&amp;D 3.5/4/5, PF, Savage Worlds, etc). the argument for using FG over some other solutions is harder to make.   The program is older (the codebase goes back to 2004), and it's starting to show its age in some areas. The UI is clean pretty good once you get used to it (I really love the radial menu, personally), but without proper dual moniter support you really need a lot of single-screen real-estate, otherwise things start to feel crammed a bit.   The program is a bit of a resource hog, particularily on memory. Those with slower or older computers -especially ones without a dedicated GPU- may notice performance issues.   There's some neat features in Roll20 that don't exist in FG, like dynamic lighting. This will be added to FG when SmiteWorks finishes the Unity re-write -set sometime for release next year (it's worth noting that the full re-write of FG is being designed to be fully backward compatible with existing FG content).  There are occaisonal disconnects from players when playing. Usually the program reconnects on its own without issue. Considering Roll20 requires a 3rd part service to use that does go down on occaision and FG does not, I don't see that as a big problem.  I've noticed a few other little quirks in the different rulesets, but nothing that causes problems when gaming.  TL;DR: If you're using a supported ruleset FG is the best VTT out there. Bar none.  EDIT: Oops'd a word or three.  Also thought I'd clear up some of the cost stuff, since many people are confused:  FREE License - Allows players to manage characters for various rulesets, as well as connect to games hosted by Ultimate License.  Standard License ($40 USD) - Allows you to create and manage characters and campaigns, host games for Standard and Ultimate license holders, and connect to games hosted by Standard or Ultimate license holders, INCLUDED RULESETS: 3.5E, 4E, 5E SRD Content, FATECore, PFRPG, Numenera.   Ultimate License ($150 USD) - As per Standard, but can also host games for FREE license holders.   So you can easily play D&amp;D 5E games with the Standard or Ultimate License, so long as it's SRD content. This is basic ruleset functionality -if you want all of the automated functions (like being able to drag a fully-functional monster from the MM onto the combat tracker) you'll need to enter the statblock yourself, or buy the associated FG rulebook. Likewise with the adventure modules.  3.5 and PF are fully functional, and there are many community made modules that include the content of the official PRD and d20fsprd.",

Not only can you play DnD rule sets of different editions with this software, but you can play a number of other types of rulesets using the same program.  The greatest thing about this program, besides how everything inside it works, is that you arent just limited to friends that you know. The online community is amazing on the forums, with just one post you could be playing a game in minutes, hours, or a couple of days depending on what type you are looking for, and timeframe. You can play with anyone in the world that has the program. You dont even have to buy it if your DM has the DM edition, all you have to do then is download the free demo and you can play with everyone else just like you own the program.",

I'd basically resigned myself to going without playing online.  Fantasy Grounds caught my attention since it was just uploaded to Steam here, and it has succeeded in turning things around for me. Edge of the Empire support is enabled through a custom, user-created ruleset (free!) that continues to be updated and is rather well-organised. Its creator is also in the process of making a video tutorial series for it. Through a combination of his first tutorial video, a read-through of the ruleset's functions on its forum page, and an afternoon of playing around and experimenting by myself, I was able to learn the entire system &amp; host a short session today (bought it yesterday night after learning on the demo version).  Overall, it's VERY fun, very pretty, and the extensive amount of features designed to keep everything organised is exactly what I was looking for in a virtual tabletop for Star Wars.

I think the biggest problem is that each of the DLCs are exceptionally expensive on top of the price that you pay for the tool. There are a few free DLCs available but they're currently very limited, and the tool is improving all the time.   It also has a very high learning curve and doesn't lessen the preperation required before hosting a game.  The one thing that I'm hoping for is a ton of fun free DLCs (PS. It's a mission creating your own as there are currently licensing laws preventing you from publishing without royalties paid to the creators of the rulesets. Which really limits the community. Free DLCs will normally only be released by the creators of the ruleset.)  Who is this really for? You can normally use the free (demo) version to connect to online games if the host has the full version. So you're not required to purchase this to partake in games. Purchasing this is only recommended for long time GMs who are commited to their games and are unable to host locally all the time. I promise you that currently pen and paper and/or a printer takes just as much time to use and prepare with and if you're organized you can achieve exactly the same.  The true value comes from the market. If I were the creators of this tool I would've rather taken royalties from each DLC purchase than charge this much for the tool. My group moved through my story in 3months and I gave up after that as I wasn't prepared to pay more for new DLCs.  Anyway, so yes I would recommend this tool but only for long term GMs that have the cash to waste and the inability to host games locally (or technologically obsessed ones like myself that use their laptops for everything) go for it. And I have to stress this again, only for long time GMs.",

Wizards of the Coast is notorious for making their previous products obsolete to ensure their current ones are sold like hotcakes, just look at Magic the Gathering (5 months after a collection is completed a new one is released and a year after that neither are deemed 'playable' by serious gamers), so I understand that the developers might not be able to get the license for a gaming system the creators want to fade into ancient history.  My problem is that NO WHERE on their Steam Store page or main website does it say that the DLC items are not compatible with older verson of the systems their program supports. I spent several hours searching and eventually found one after utilitizing Google Search and it was an archived post on their Forum Boards about others having a simliar issue with creating 3.5 games.
