            "review_text": "If you like dying, this game is for you. 2D side scrolling action takes you through various terrains and monster on a quest to defeat the scourge! At least, I think it's the scourge. With various difficulties depending on how you play; the game challenges your ability to jump, double jump, aim, and not break things when the wasps come for you.  You can decide which starting 'class' you would like to be, giving you various bonuses depending on your play style. Your stats can be adjusted with equipment, so changing up what you are doing as you are playing is entirely possible. Start out with hopes of being a wizard but find out you aren't up to snuff? Collect DEX gear and start shooting things. Find your aim is a bit off? Ditch the leather and go full out ATK for sword on fluffy, on claws, on blue glowing orbs of death fun.   For an even greater challenge, bring a friend. Mobs get harder and dying just gets more fun! Bring a whole lot of patience. You'll need it.   The game is fun and has significant replay-ability, especially if you like to collect all items available. I hope they eventually add-in trading cards or achievements. Despite some of the levels being insanely difficult *cough*crater*cough* as they work on balance and tweaks, the game provides enjoyable entertainment that will while away your hours, leaving you wondering what black hole you fell into.",

            "review_text": "I like this game, but it has a ton of glaring issues. It's not what it should be nor is it what it wants to be, yet.  This is a rogue-lite in its lightest form, providing hardly any differentiation between runs. The differences will be in the traits you obtain at levels 5/10/15, the items you get from chests (which are varied in usefulness, but are mostly similar and few) and of course mob drops/mob spawns. The layouts for each district follow a very strict pattern, involving massive sections next to each other as opposed to the standard 1x1 platform-style stage randomization. Each non-town district would blend into each other if it weren't for the differing biomes, which serve as alternate mob spawn pools for easier access to certain resources often at the cost of an increased difficulty.  Towns in this game currently serve very little purpose outside of a few obvious fantasy tropes. You have the Blacksmith, the Tailor and the Leatherworker, the latter two having static and unchanging names. You also have two shopkeepers which offer normally pointless and randomized items from the shop pool. Tools and weapons being sold are typically out of your price range when you'd need them, and entirely skippable once you have the gold for them. There are sometimes potions on sale, as well as herbs and hilts for treeless runs (I'll mention it later) but other than those the item pool for the shops aren't fantastic. Finally, there's the Hoarder that allows you to sell your items, which you'd think would be absolutely useful... But the sell price for each and every item you'll get ranges from 1-3 gold depending on said item. Weapons don't offer large sell prices, nor do armors. The Hoarder is a very cheap man.  The main issue with shops (again) is that they're normally pointless as far as tools and weapons go. With enough experience and proper door selection, you'll almost ALWAYS find the resources you need to make shops irrelevant. Heck, normally the only thing I'm missing at the end of each run are rings (which fight against a rather large and annoying chest drop pool) and rarely one piece of armor. I can go ahead and find a friend to wear a miner's cap to completely resolve the ore deficiency we may have.  Finally, Altars sometimes also spawn in towns, and are the only non-constant you'll find outside of giant chickens and normal chickens. (They're not worth talking about, food and potion drops if you're curious.) Altars are currently money sinks for the runs that offer their bounties long before the shops care to stock them, which is normally what happens as stated before. Altars cost 500 gold, which is a steep price for what they offer: A chance at a minimal stat buff, debuff or nothing at all. Rarely you'll earn a return to full health which is by far the best result most of the time, but the game is very stingy with both the spawn rate and good results of the Altars. By the time you have the money to trigger an Altar, you may not even find one... And sometimes they'll spawn when there's clearly no way you could have the money already without chopping every tree down. Normally, it's not worth the min-maxing.  ... Min-maxing... Forgot about that. This game's mechanics are often lacking fluidity. Min-maxing is something that seems to be discouraged, due to the Scourge Invasion mechanic (a mechanic Spelunky players will find familiar, but irrelevant) and the rewards often not being worth the effort. Most of your min-maxing is for gold, from chopping tons of trees to continuing to break open each ironite ore deposit even when ironite is otherwise out of uses. Your reward for gold farming is, again, Altars and the occasional shop item before you have the chance to forge it.   Forging is relatively self-explanatory, but crafting can be a little tricky. Crafting is done via shift-clicking two items like an awkward Bejeweled puzzle. It's an easy mechanic, the issue is just the recipes at times. A lot of the early crafting recipes build off of each other, which provides cohesion and ease of access to tools and weapons. Some of the later items are either wiki bait, or 'Oh, I didn't know that existed!' items. It can get awkward, but with enough thought it's not too bad. There's not too many crafting recipes to memorize, so once you have the main ones you're set.  Combat is simple. Grab a weapon, attack. If you want to use an item, hold it in your hands and right-click. Every item can be left-clicked with to hit enemies melee-style, and that's based off of your ATK stat. Staves and Bows can be right-clicked with to cast spells/shoot arrows, which are based on MAG and DEX respectively. Typically, people break down their runs to three classes. (it's often necessary with the lack of inventory space if you're somewhat new to the game still) With the speed of some mobs, and the fact that a lot of mobs in the game fly, melee is at a huge disadvantage. Ranged players will be able to aim their shots from afar, without aggroing enemies and easily taking out a majority of the mobs they'll see. The downside to Ranged play is that walls can often prevent shots, and by the time you get past the wall they'll have seen you. With the addition of the Fire Bow, you won't be having any issues with damage should you find it. Resources for arrows are normally quite plentiful as well.  Mages are strong. Too strong. Fireball shoots horizontally, moving forward seemingly infinitely and even passing through walls. While this is a powerful weapon, there is the downside of accidentally killing enemies and having their xp despawn if you're not careful... But honestly that's the only con to it, which is absurd. Bolt is pretty much the god staff, allowing you to shoot directly both above and below you. With jumps, timing and practice, this is normally the superior option. There's also a strange bug that makes each shot hit the target enemy once for each player in the run, which Fireball is unable to do. Frostshard is more of a melee supplement, offering additional damage that's halved from your current maximum mana. Mages are normally a distance away from their enemies, so it normally provides little to no benefit... If it costed one mana like the other two staves, it might be worth the effort of even using. Summon Zombie is also an option if you find it or use the Scourgeling race, but against flying enemies it's worthless.   Speaking of races, each race has it's own specialties. However, some are clearly superior to others. Typically you'll want to unlock the best races early on to put yourself at ease. Some races such as the Qualogg provide utility instead of immediate additional power.  Unlockables for character creation include the aforementioned races, the hats and also companions. Like races, there are a few certain hats and companions which are obvious choices once unlocked over the other ones, which is unfortunate. Each unlockable set has at least one thing that's insanely challenging, but most are either freebies or based on RNG which is really unfortunate.  The game is simple. Once you know what you're doing, it's as easy as going through the motions. You'll get all the items you need to beat the final boss, and you'll always win even if you're not a seasoned veteran. The skill cap is so low I feel like I'm in a hobbit hole.  If you want a game to play with friends when you're bored and you don't have better options, this is a nice game to pick up. (just be weary of multiplayer issues such as de-syncing) If you want a fully featured game with proper balancing and potential for failure even after learning it's mechanics and practice, you'll want to wait on your purchase of this game. I still recommend it, just don't expect wonders in it's current state... I'm sure with time the balance issues will be ironed out and the game will have more to accomplish and do.  Sean Young, if you're reading this I do hope you can find some ways to take care of these issues.",

            "review_text": "This game is lots of fun when it works, and for singleplayer it works perfectly! There's a nice curve in difficulty - players learn how to avoid basic enemy movement patterns and adopts strategies for attack in the first few levels. In later levels enemies perform new patterns that the player must adapt to or suffer greater penalties to health than before. I revel in the challenges the game presents, and the way it rewards skillful movement and planning. Each town is a welcomed rest and keeps the action engaging rather than exhausting.  Multiplayer should be an even greater joy, it's great fun coordinating with a friend and reaping the efficiency of two players dividing duties and actively harvesting resources. however multiplayer has always ended in a mess for me and my friend. I'm unsure if it is due to poor connection because the initial levels work without a hitch. Once we'd reach level 10 and on though everything starts to go to hell. Enemies lag out of place, projectiles spawn unattached to a source, flickering phantoms of beasts would hover in place after death. Occasionally the ground wouldn't load and I'd fall into an inky abyss. It's worse that the multiplayer functions at all because it's only after great progress has been made that everything goes wrong. In one round I even lagged a full level behind. My friend would enter a door, and I'd enter the (unplayable)level he'd just been through.  I understand that with a rogue like game you can't just have a player joining part way through, so allowing a disconnected player to reconnect might not be the best solution. But most games with multiplayer I've played will at least give you an indication that the connection is unstable. It'd be nice if the game recognised a poor connection, and stalled or paused players to try and reconnect/ stabilize. I admit I have no idea what is necessary to actually maintain a multiplayer session, but my experiece so far with it has always ended poorly, and that experience is all I can contribute. If the connection issues could be fixed up I'd happily buy copies just to distribute them to friends and spread the joy, but for now I Guess I'll wait til my friend and I can get a better connection :/",

The graphics are similar to Castle Crashers and  newgrounds.com,  because of the pixel art style its derived from.  Your objective is simple, survive at least 20 districts in, and kill the end boss, all while leveling with random drops and level stat progression.  There are hats, which change subtle ways you can play, which can be unlocked, along with races which have different gains in those stat areas. Some are more Dex based for archery, some are more towards magic, while others deal in strength.  There are also companions you can earn, which can help you in your quest. All of these have to be unlocked, and some are 100% chances to gain, others are 20%. You may have to run more than a few times to get everything.  It's a great game, though it does have a few issues, but they're pretty minor. Such as being unable to 'Play Again!' after a loss in Multiplayer, which results in a black screen for those connected to the host sometimes. As well as being able to take advantage of the 1HP revive. Though these are minor, if you have patience to accept it.",

Trying to get past the first level took me and my friends atleast 1 hour or more because we either died or didn't know what we were doing. Singleplayer is alright, and I would say even more difficult but you have alot more control over the game without you having to worry about your friends dying or baiting you into death. I also would like to acknowledge that the hats, races and companions are a nice variant to the gameplay and give you a challenge/goal to achieve along the way. Overall, I would give this game a 8.5/10.",

The battles are hard in this game, if you get hit you better have a potion, because there are almost no other ways for you to heal (I like this because of the fact that IT'S HARD). When people say it's like Terraria, They are right, and wrong. For instance, this is more of a adventure sidescroller, while Terraria is Huge and once you get everything, you have to wait for more updates, and that is boring, while you will be playing magicite constantly because you have so much to unlock, by the time you get all the items to unlock, there will be more updates, because it took you A LONG time to get them all. There are some serious challenges in this game, limited ores, limited health, you have to deal with food, you want to get this epic hat but it's so hard to get. I haven't even done multiplayer yet, but multiplayer means 2 things, less stuff for you because your friend needs stuff, and you can't just have everything, it would be unfair! Also, from videos, you have to revive your friend (if im correct there is a timer to heal your partner). The fact that it costs 10 dollars is kind of sad, but I guess the creator has a point because you will definitaly be playing this game often. Don't forget about the bosses, they get pretty hard (The final boss in this game is a wall, and it comes for you and you have to kill it, sort of like Terraria). Unfortunatly there is a time limit, unlike Terraria, to get out of the level, or else you will get killed by the games main enemy. The crafting does take some time to get used to.  If you love rouge-like games, you should buy this one, same with rpg  I rate this game 8/10 hot dogs, and it still has even more potential!",

        {
            "review_text": "This game is, in my opinion, as good a sidescrolling 2D action-platformer as you'll get. Here are my reasons:  The character creation has enough variables, even at the beginning, to offer a unique run to everyone, though through minutes upon minutes of clicking and a whole lot of luck, you can produce the same character every time. You can basically play however you want, with various races, styles, companions and, of course, hats to choose from, each having an effect on the character.  The levels are randomly generated, sometimes screwing you over horribly at the beginning and sometimes waiting until you've sunk a good half-hour into the playthrough and got some really nice items before doing so. It's almost always difficult, but a challenge worth taking. It's rewarding to beat the game, not only for the first time, but every time, and there are lots of different challenges for those better than myself, those too good at games in general. Replay value, need I say it, is high. The game is split into levels, each themed to a biome or region. Each area has its own monsters and, in some cases, mini-bosses. Some may have more ore or trees, or more glowy bug things to hit, so depending on strategy, different places have advantages and disadvantages. At the end of each level, you can choose one of three doors to go through, determining the next area's biome, though towards the end, expect a crater or three to appear. You have twenty levels: nine 'wilderness', ten towns and the Scourge Lair (The lair of the Scourge). In true RPG fashion, you must conquer the nine and get your skills as high as possible to defeat the badguy.  The multiplayer, though initially faulty, is now working pretty well, so playing with friends is a possibility for social butterflies and other such people with friends. It's not essential to the game, so don't fret if you're missing, y'know, friends. Who needs 'em, right? Anyway, the multiplayer adds a new dynamic: sharing loot. If you're against that kind of teamwork or just really like your stuff, it may not be to your taste. If, however, you don't mind sharing that one herb or extra ironite, or if you really enjoy the results of your selfishness, multiplayer will be at least as fun as singleplayer, if not more so.  Finally, the music and artstyle are gorgeous. Like, this game is charming to play, with pulsating, dynamic pixelated backgrounds and one of the best soundtracks my ears have encountered. Except the forest: its music is merely great. The rest, however, are amazing. I'm still holding out for its appearance on the store page.  EDIT: Oops. I forgot to mention the crafting. It's good. You can look up crafting guides if you want, but figuring things out yourself is much more fun. So is figuring out what to do with that drum you made while clicking things. I've played for more than thirty hours and still don't know how to use it. Such is life. Basically, you hold shift and click things, 1+1-style. Pretty simplistic.  EDIT 2: Since 1.4.5, multiplayer can now also have PvP, so if you really like screwing over your companions and watching their pixelated corpses wiggle on the ground, you do that. It also adds yet more challenge to the co-operative side of the game's multiplayer.  ---  I highly recommend the game. It's just brilliant.  Other products are available.  ---  TL;DR: i lik te gaem.",

The character creation is a little frustrating when your picking skills and stats as they are randomly generated and most of the time you will take a while to get what you want, and although customisation is limited finally unlocking a hat, companion, race or even new variation is very rewarding.  So if you enjoy games that reward you for your feats and will punish you with death when you screw up, then this is the game for you. ",

            "review_text": "Magicite stared at me from the steam page for months before I grudgingly tried it on a hunch. I found a game that was pretty, fluid, simple, and fun.  The permadeath works - it's not lame. Every death or two gives you more hats, classes, or ideas on how to progress. Instead of being a burden, the permadeath acts as a way for you to clean the slate and do better. It's healthy.  The game lasted me around 15 hours. I beat the boss multiple times, each taking me around 20 minutes (i think). Eventually you get used to how the enemies work, and the game becomes an exercise in muscle memory. Unlike similar games (like rogue legacy), this muscle memory doesn't get challenged very much. It won't put you into situations where 3-4 enemies with different powers are spewing them all at once, and you have to navigate the world to defeat them. Instead, magicite tests your patience. You have to identify each enemy and be careful with them - because regaining health is difficult. By the end of the game you'll be taking enemies out at range more often than not, because you won't be finding enough potion materials to heal yourself. Only one or two equipment/hat/trait/skill combinations can keep you healed, and even then it's tiresome and slow to heal to full (notably, the ice queen hat, clairvoyance skill, and high MAG).  After all this invested time, my big gripe is that melee is just too important. The three different general paths (melee, archer, magic) are fun and play differently, but it always boils down to using your sword. No matter how you build, the sword is the only ifinite source of damage; your magic will run out fast and regen slow, and your arrows compete with armor for crafting materials. So it feels a bit like the magic/archer classes are more work than they're worth. Even with the right skills and playstyle, it doesn't usually feel like they're really worth it.  After unlocking most of the items, hats, and races, I think i'm done with it. But at this price, 15 hours of gameplay for $10 was pretty reasonable.",

But, even though I had all the items it was still fun to play a run with all the OP gear like the overworld helm, floaty slime, and Djinn. Overall I think it has alot of good qualities but the only thing holding it back from being as iconic as the Binding of Isaac is the lack of enough late game content that will keep players playing for a while. Also, if you do get the game, some challenges like 'beat the game without chopping trees' or 'beat the game without killing enemies' seem impossible becuase they go against everything you have learned so far, but if you actually start a game with the intentions of not chopping trees, you'll find that its actually not that hard with a proper load out and game plan. Just use all other assets available and you'll be able to beat the game.",

Easy enough to pickup, but hard enough to prevent you from walking up to the boss on your first 50 tries (Expect to die a lot).   Cons:     There is some re-use in monster behavior and monster types (eg A stronger/faster purple spider in contrast to the regular spider from the first level)     Monster AI is not particularly sophisticated nor hard to figure out how to counter.     The bow mechanics. The bow can fire outside of the range of most of the early monsters, so you can hit them with your bow before they even know that you're near them, making a lot of bow combat one sided with you firing at non-moving monsters. Arrows are also not affected by gravity, making it really easy to use (maybe too easy).     The hunger bar seems kind of like an afterthought and doesn't affect gameplay all that much. Food is extremely abundant in most biomes.     I like the crafting element, and I like the fact that the game was designed to encourage the player to experiment with resources. There aren't that many things to craft though, so once you've already learned all the recipies, continuing to do them feels like an unnecessary chore sometimes.   That's a lot of cons, but this game is really fun and really addicting and is all-round pretty well designed. Definitely worth it's list price.",

Then you'll like this game. Do you not like roguelikes or have never played one? You might still like this game, I dunno.  Pros - The crafting system is awesome (shift+click two items), particularly because you aren't given any of the recipes - part of the fun lies in experimenting and figuring things out (or if you really want to you could use the wiki) - Lots of recipes - Different races provide for different playstyles - if your starting items don't include an axe, for example, you have to kill everything to get coins and then buy an axe in the marketplace at the end of each level so that you can get wood and sticks to make handles for more tools. (I think there's actually another way but I don't know what it is) - Challenging (I think that's a pro anyway) - Procedurally generated everything - I can't make any guarantees, but I feel like you don't need to be a roguelike fan to enjoy if, but if you are then you'll definitely enjoy it - Co-op up to four players - Plenty of unlockables that aren't too easy to unlock - Haven't encountered any bugs Cons - No LAN play, so you'll still have to set up port forwarding to play locally  Tip: Don't stay still for too long",

The game is quite harsh to the new and uninitiated, and can be difficult to learn when under such oppressive circumstances.  But give it a chance, and you won't regret it.  Best described as a Terraria and Rogue Legacy lovechild, MAGICITE has you traversing randomly-generated biomes, collecting resources and crafting tools/weapons while fighting off hostile creatures. Between levels (called 'districts') there are towns where you can trade, sell, and buy.  However, if you die, you lose everything and have to start over. The higher your score, though, the more chests you can open, giving you a chance to unlock more classes.  The game can be quite punishing, but ultimately feels satisfying when you make it further than the last attempt. It borders on downright addicting.  After a few runs you start to get better and travel further. Might want to try giving it a shot yourself.",

Upon buying this game, I noticed the appealing, simplistic graphics and concept of the game first. There's enough content in the game whereas you can endlessly play until you unlock every single item in the game, or do funny and difficult challenges with your friends. When playing multiplayer, there is a big chance of it completely failing randomly throughout the game, causing you to start all over. There's no save function, which is overwhelming, but the fact that there's so much more to unlock gives it replay value, along with the curiosity of what updates are coming next.    PROS.   Replay value. Tons of unlockables. Multiplayer. Awesome and simplistic graphics. Great animation to go along with the graphic type.    CONS.   Can be repetitive. Not too many updates, leaves the game dull after a while. Sometimes buggy multiplayer [crashing, lagging, etc]  [tl;dr] Def buy this game.

Each character has a different style of playing, I personaly prefer bow and arrow but you have to work slowly up from sword play etc. Each hat, race, companion you unlock really changes the game, some times making it easier while somtimes making it much harder, if you are into that thing!  It has a great crafting mechanic that isn't over whelming, most things make sense that you don't need to look up a wiki to craft everything, however I would still recommend it for impatient gamers.  I like the resource collecting though it can be tideous however you can have perks to help you there!   A good amount of enemies per stage, I love the bosses but nothing to complicated, I think if I was to change anything I would make the bosses a bit more difficult, the hardest part seems to be removing around the lower enimies while fighting the boss.  9 / 10",

You will have to find resources, craft items, kill monsters, conserve your health and hunger, fight bosses, and get epic loot! The more you play, the harder it gets, and the greater the rewards become. This game requires patience and strategy, and gets more fast paces the more you play. I started out playing as just an ordinary human with nothing but a wooden axe, and now, I'm a lizard man with a katana made out of freaking emerald who wears a pirate hat and has bunny ears. 10/10         YouTube™ Video:  Magicite: Part 1 - Jimbobs First Video&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "Magicite's a fun roguelike, don't get me wrong. It's brutally hard at the beginning, and all of the unlocks can keep that type of difficulty going (if you're a completionist!).  The game consists of various races trying to beat the 'Scourge', which is basically anything evil and purple. To win, you must survive 19 zones, with the 20th being an all out timed live-or-die boss fight. Getting past three stages, let alone 19, without knowing what you're doing, crafting recipes, and melee reach with various items is pretty much impossible, though. Of these 19 zones, there are around 9 biomes, although in all honesty 2 are almost required to be skipped in order to have a good run (Volcano and Crater; the loot and xp from Dungeon and Spider far outweight the risks if you have ranged attacks).   One of the key mechanics is the Scourge being able to infiltrate a zone after around 5-6 minutes, causing the player to either run like hell towards the exit or die trying. If one of the three scourge monsters hit you, you die. This may seem like a crippling mechanic, but in all honesty as long as you don't waste time you'll seldom deal with it, and you have roughly 1 minute to escape before one of them catches up to you.  The ability to decide how you want to play is based around 5 values; the race you pick, the hat you wear, the companion you pick, and the stats / traits pair you (re)roll.   Races deal primarily with what items you start the run with, along with minor stat increases / decreases. Hats have drastically different effects across the board. It's impossible to list them all without taking half a page of text. Companions deal with mechanics more than stats; levelling up, health, and speed can be modified, to say without spoilers.  Stats are randomly assigned to a character, and can be rerolled at the start screen for another set of randoms. HP deals with your overall health, ATK (Attack) for your melee damage (sword and fist alike), DEX (Dexterity) increases arrow damage from bows, and MAG (Magic) increases your magic damage and overall mana pool. Traits are randomly given when you reroll stats. Each runs has you start with 2, and depending on how you roll, each can be incredibly valuable for your playstyle. My personal favorites are Locksmith and Potions Master. I find that good traits trump good starting stats, but I'm sure others will disagree to an extent.  Races, Hats, and Companions are unlocked by satisfying varying criteria, from beating certain bosses to gathering various materials or killing enough monsters, to beating the game in various ways.   My biggest gripe with the game is OTI, or 'Oh, that's it?', the phenomenon that happens when you think a game'll have a lot more content than it does. I've played for about 13 hours and have beaten the game twice, I've crafted pretty much every item ingame that I can, and other than unlocking the insanely hard or RNG-based (20% chance when doing certain criteria, etc) hats, races, and companions, I'm pretty much done. My biggest complaints are:  The early game feels more like fighting to get better gear, versus fighting to beat the game. Without the Regen Fairy and Brawler's Scarf, there's virtually no way for a newbie to progress.  Certain playstyles are incredibly superior to others. Ranger is the easiest way to beat the game the first time around with the right choices (Looking at you, Dwelf), whereas melee and magic are horribly reliant on careful health management and certain unlocks, such as mana regen vs just crafting bone / stone arrows.   Potion Master is almost required to beat the game. 50% chance to get 2.5x the effect on your potions is a maker-or-breaker for a run. I think the same for gold chests unlocks(So many powerful tools for all types), but others disagree.  The game is put on the back-burner until Roguelands, another title from the Devs, is 1.0, at least unless Magicite gets enough hype to warrant progression beforehand. This, along with the fact that Magicite is past 1.0, screams the risk that Magicite might be left as is. I had to warn ya, potential buyer.   Risk of Rain is the same price, also goes on sale for like $2.50, and is fantastic as hell. I love both, don't get me wrong, but if you want any story or powerup mania, this game isn't it. All you get is 'We were forced underground, go kill those scourge'.  Co-op takes Hamachi or Port Forwarding; if you can't / dont want to do either, sorry about your luck.  Sometimes bosses don't like you and decide to spawn really early into a game. You can still beat them without waking the scourge, but it's a bit of a pain.  Trailer isn't the same as current version; there is no magicite in it yet, despite blacksmith w/ shiny thing.  This might seem too much to handle, but think of the pros:  It's really damn fun to play. Solo gives you a taste, but co-op can lead to some insane hilarity, especially when you see a certain chicken make a friend go from 8 to 0 hp in two seconds flat. Co-op also lets you do some fun strats and unlock things at the same time, so it's great to pick up the 4-pack on sale. I'm glad I did.  The difficulty is great to start out with, and (despite critics) I like the crafting system; it's simple.   You can kill nothing, kill everything, grab everything, basically ignore everything and technically can still beat the final boss despite however you played. Diamondite pickaxe would be a must, though, as well as absurd dodging skills.   It's a mixed blessing, but I've always been the sort to buy into the hope that dev progress will occur; I'd love to see expansions with bosses at floor 30 or 50, especially considering that I thought we were crusading to save the overworld.   Experimentation feels real in this game. Every death feels to really be my fault, and knowledge really is power in this game.  Outside Help: Crafting guide is pretty necessary the first time around, as picks / axes / swords aren't the most obvious to craft. If you don't feel like checking yourself, the basics are this: Combine sticks together until you get the desired base, then combine ore bars (or wooden planks) until you get a blade, which you combine with the base. Sword bases are a plank and a stick. Bows are combing webs into string, then string with an unfinished bow (sticks added together), and magic is 2 of 1 bug for a gem and the gem with a stick. Net for getting bugs is 2 string together then combine resulting net with stick. Left click to grab bugs when you see em. Keys to know: Escape for general menu, R for inventory.   Either way the devs go, I've had a good time, and I have a feeling this game could keep me interested for a lot longer.",

            "review_text": "Magicite's a fun roguelike, don't get me wrong. It's brutally hard at the beginning, and all of the unlocks can keep that type of difficulty going (if you're a completionist!).  The game consists of various races trying to beat the 'Scourge', which is basically anything evil and purple. To win, you must survive 19 zones, with the 20th being an all out timed live-or-die boss fight. Getting past three stages, let alone 19, without knowing what you're doing, crafting recipes, and melee reach with various items is pretty much impossible, though. Of these 19 zones, there are around 9 biomes, although in all honesty 2 are almost required to be skipped in order to have a good run (Volcano and Crater; the loot and xp from Dungeon and Spider far outweight the risks if you have ranged attacks).   One of the key mechanics is the Scourge being able to infiltrate a zone after around 5-6 minutes, causing the player to either run like hell towards the exit or die trying. If one of the three scourge monsters hit you, you die. This may seem like a crippling mechanic, but in all honesty as long as you don't waste time you'll seldom deal with it, and you have roughly 1 minute to escape before one of them catches up to you.  The ability to decide how you want to play is based around 5 values; the race you pick, the hat you wear, the companion you pick, and the stats / traits pair you (re)roll.   Races deal primarily with what items you start the run with, along with minor stat increases / decreases. Hats have drastically different effects across the board. It's impossible to list them all without taking half a page of text. Companions deal with mechanics more than stats; levelling up, health, and speed can be modified, to say without spoilers.  Stats are randomly assigned to a character, and can be rerolled at the start screen for another set of randoms. HP deals with your overall health, ATK (Attack) for your melee damage (sword and fist alike), DEX (Dexterity) increases arrow damage from bows, and MAG (Magic) increases your magic damage and overall mana pool. Traits are randomly given when you reroll stats. Each runs has you start with 2, and depending on how you roll, each can be incredibly valuable for your playstyle. My personal favorites are Locksmith and Potions Master. I find that good traits trump good starting stats, but I'm sure others will disagree to an extent.  Races, Hats, and Companions are unlocked by satisfying varying criteria, from beating certain bosses to gathering various materials or killing enough monsters, to beating the game in various ways.   My biggest gripe with the game is OTI, or 'Oh, that's it?', the phenomenon that happens when you think a game'll have a lot more content than it does. I've played for about 13 hours and have beaten the game twice, I've crafted pretty much every item ingame that I can, and other than unlocking the insanely hard or RNG-based (20% chance when doing certain criteria, etc) hats, races, and companions, I'm pretty much done. My biggest complaints are:  The early game feels more like fighting to get better gear, versus fighting to beat the game. Without the Regen Fairy and Brawler's Scarf, there's virtually no way for a newbie to progress.  Certain playstyles are incredibly superior to others. Ranger is the easiest way to beat the game the first time around with the right choices (Looking at you, Dwelf), whereas melee and magic are horribly reliant on careful health management and certain unlocks, such as mana regen vs just crafting bone / stone arrows.   Potion Master is almost required to beat the game. 50% chance to get 2.5x the effect on your potions is a maker-or-breaker for a run. I think the same for gold chests unlocks(So many powerful tools for all types), but others disagree.  The game is put on the back-burner until Roguelands, another title from the Devs, is 1.0, at least unless Magicite gets enough hype to warrant progression beforehand. This, along with the fact that Magicite is past 1.0, screams the risk that Magicite might be left as is. I had to warn ya, potential buyer.   Risk of Rain is the same price, also goes on sale for like $2.50, and is fantastic as hell. I love both, don't get me wrong, but if you want any story or powerup mania, this game isn't it. All you get is 'We were forced underground, go kill those scourge'.  Co-op takes Hamachi or Port Forwarding; if you can't / dont want to do either, sorry about your luck.  Sometimes bosses don't like you and decide to spawn really early into a game. You can still beat them without waking the scourge, but it's a bit of a pain.  Trailer isn't the same as current version; there is no magicite in it yet, despite blacksmith w/ shiny thing.  This might seem too much to handle, but think of the pros:  It's really damn fun to play. Solo gives you a taste, but co-op can lead to some insane hilarity, especially when you see a certain chicken make a friend go from 8 to 0 hp in two seconds flat. Co-op also lets you do some fun strats and unlock things at the same time, so it's great to pick up the 4-pack on sale. I'm glad I did.  The difficulty is great to start out with, and (despite critics) I like the crafting system; it's simple.   You can kill nothing, kill everything, grab everything, basically ignore everything and technically can still beat the final boss despite however you played. Diamondite pickaxe would be a must, though, as well as absurd dodging skills.   It's a mixed blessing, but I've always been the sort to buy into the hope that dev progress will occur; I'd love to see expansions with bosses at floor 30 or 50, especially considering that I thought we were crusading to save the overworld.   Experimentation feels real in this game. Every death feels to really be my fault, and knowledge really is power in this game.  Outside Help: Crafting guide is pretty necessary the first time around, as picks / axes / swords aren't the most obvious to craft. If you don't feel like checking yourself, the basics are this: Combine sticks together until you get the desired base, then combine ore bars (or wooden planks) until you get a blade, which you combine with the base. Sword bases are a plank and a stick. Bows are combing webs into string, then string with an unfinished bow (sticks added together), and magic is 2 of 1 bug for a gem and the gem with a stick. Net for getting bugs is 2 string together then combine resulting net with stick. Left click to grab bugs when you see em. Keys to know: Escape for general menu, R for inventory.   Either way the devs go, I've had a good time, and I have a feeling this game could keep me interested for a lot longer.",

The only problem is that if you die (which you will if you encounter a stronge enemy) you stay dead and have to fight the whole way back, just to die again and figure more out about the enemies. 2. Health pots. ALWAYS get the Skill that you have 50% Luck with potion brewing, trust me. In the beginning you get quite a lot of herbs and poitons for mostly bushes and slimes, and a bit from chests and stronger foes. But as soon as you hit f.e. the dungeon area you gotta sit out on the ones you got before, since you will find about 1 potion every 3 areas.

He released ONE, and LAST update for the game, which hasn't even fixed the majority of the bugs.  In conclusion, this game has a lot of potential, but a lot of bugs and close to useless features. It used to be updated at least once or twice per month in the beginning, now it's dead. It's broken in it's current state and I would not recommend buying it even if it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "So yeah, I love this game but after a while it's kinda bleh. The combat gets repetetive and boring after a while and the enemies are the same. The enemies are just retextured versions of eachother. The combat is just you standing next to an enemy and clicking Left mouse button until it dies. Other than that the art style is nice and the town music is soothing. a small tutorial would be nice and after you craft something that tip at the bottom should dissapear. Also, inventory space is a big problem after you start getting stuff because crafting become a hassle. There should be a side gui for crafting somewhat like minecraft since everything is made with 2 components. If not that, then backpacks should be a craftable item of varying size depending on the materials used (regular hide for small sized backpack, and then like in increases by 2 slots every tier) Infact I actually like that idea of backpacks more than a side gui. Or both. but that seems eccessive being that there are not a lot of items. I feel like there should be more weapons and that skills should be able to be picked. And character creation is little to none, which subtracts from the rpg side of this. You should also be able to pick what traits and stats you want since I end up clicking away at the stats button till I get what I want anyways; so it seems pointless to make traits and stats random, more like a waste of time to me. Also the amount of multiplayer bugs is crazy. Loading into an area is always scary and it's super laggy. I wouldn't reccomend buying this if you're just wanting to play with your friends because I have to say the multiplayer isn't worth it right now.   TL;DR: Pros: - Cute Art Style - Easy to learn - (atleast in my opinion) The music in the towns is really nice. Cons: - repetetive combat for all classes (really lacking in diversity) - inventory too small - character creation is little too none, and takes WAY too long due to the fact that your stats and traits are completely random everytime you make a new character.  *EDIT*: To be completely honest, there is a very VERY easy way to fix all of this. Make the game modable. Because then modders could fix bugs and add more, and make the game great again! GUYS, VOTE MODS, #MakeMagiciteGreatAgain  Rating: 5/10 I love the game but it's also really frusterating and I'd recommend waiting until more updates come. *DOUBLE EDIT*: He said he's not updating the game anymore, r.i.p  Seriously tho if you're not gonna update it then make it modable so others can do what you don't have the time for!",

Other things are a mess Taking damage causes awkward things to happen: you recieve knockback and i-frames; while in i-frames you can still put out an attack animation, but it won't do any damage. Your attacks are very laggy, so getting hit while attacking means waiting for seconds before you can actually attack. Enemies also get i-frames, but they have contact damage during said i-frames. Enemies have attack animations, but always do contact damage even from behind. Enemies get knocked back by your character, but the knockback is ambiguous. Jumps and aerial movement don't have tight controls, and the character moves with the gusto of a cement mixer.",
