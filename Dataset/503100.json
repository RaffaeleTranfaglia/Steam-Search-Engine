            "review_text": "Difficult recommendation to make. It is fun for while it lasts, but I would suggest waiting for the developer to release additional levels. I have played for two hours with my girlfriend, and it appears we are 80% complete. There are 12-ish levels.  The trailer is basically the entire game. One player navigates for the player that is wearing the headset. The navigator views a map of the level from a top down perspective. It is akin to the old map views in the original Doom. The navigator can view the entire level, enemies and all. This view allows the navigator to direct the player wearing the headset. Occasionally, the navigator can imput commands, or hacks, to assist - like disabling a patroling enemy. However, we have barely used them to complete the levels. The levels thus far have all been single floor - one floor with no stairs or elevator or ledges to a second or third floor.   The player in the headset can sneak, walk or run throughout the level. He or she has no weapons or items to really interact with inside the game. You can collect keys by walking into them to unlock doors. You will also relay passcodes and observations to the navigator.   Visuals get the job done but are very bare bone. Again, reminiscent of first person shooter gamers. Basic visuals ensured that I had a stutter free experience with a 980ti and i5-4570.   The concept is unique but would have liked more depth. One of the store page screenshots depicts a console that states 'trustno1'. I hoped that tied into the actual game somehow - some sort of story that might make the person in the headset question whether the navigator was actually on his or her side and/or motives. A meta that disrupted whether the players were aligned together - akin your assistant in the beginning of System Shock II. Alas, that was me reading far too much into that screenshot. There is no story, explanation or anything. Although ... looking back, I am fairly certain my Girlfriend deliberately lead me to my doom on a handful of occassions.   That said - Black Hat is one of the more polished VR games that I have played thus far ... just kind of shallow. It shows the potential for these type of VR games with a player at the desktop computer and a player in the headset. Remains to be seen whether we will ever get there. If Team Future Games released a game ... in the future (heh heh) ... where the roles are flipped - the navigator tries to stop the headset player, and the headset player can hack and defend himself - I would totally be into that game.   On the topic of motion sickness. With my Girlfriend, I played in the headset the entire time and never experienced any sickness. The initial session lasted an hour. First time in a game with locomotion that I did not experience motion sickness. War Thunder in a plane made me ultra dizzy. The free Wizard VR game made me sick. Black Hat was a welcome relief. Pushed it to the limit too - sprinting, moving backwards, moving slowly. No motion sickess, so that was a nice change of pace. Regrettably, the Girlfriend cannot say the same. She put the goggles, moved a step in game, swooned in her chair, said 'whoa' and then immediately took them off. Refuses to put them back on. Take that for what you will, but I think if she was willing to give it another try, she would adjust.   ** Edited for clarity.",
