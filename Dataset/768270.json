    "description": "&quot;Lisssn&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game for listeners in the style of adventure classics such as &quot;RHEM&quot; with many puzzles and mysterious machines to set in motion. But instead of having only to look closely and to combine, this one is especially about hearing and listening closely.",
