            "review_text": "  “When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing.”    Metal Slug 3 (MS3) is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer game developed by the company DotEmu with emphasis on action-oriented run &amp; gun gameplay.    Atmosphere &amp; presentation:    + Remastered version from the year 2000 resolving some technical faults of the original. + In comparison with its predecessors of the MS series the levels are less linear, offering a few alternative paths through a stage. + Each stage has its own atmosphere and iconic art style of the MS series.  + Two player cooperation contributes to the fun and appeal of the game.  o Solid sound effects.   - Very short game that can be finished in less than an hour.  - Irregular slowdowns in single- and multiplayer.    Combat &amp; gameplay:    + The run &amp; gun gameplay is identical to the other parts in the series. + Easy to learn but hard to master combat mechanics. + Different weapons and power ups with their own advantages and disadvantages. + In comparison with its predecessor Metal Slug from 1996 the overall level of difficulty is higher. + Challenging boss battles with extensive attack patterns. + Various enemy types with well crafted animations.  o Level of difficulty and number of continues are adjustable.    Characters &amp; story:    - Four characters that only differ from each other in appearance.  - Lack of coherent story telling.  - No voice acting.    Summary:    DotEmu successfully converted this classic run &amp; gun game to the PC with a few beneficial changes. MS3 remains true to its origins with a rock hard nature and all guns blazing from every part of the screen.    Trivia:    Nothing beats the Metal Slug series on old arcade machines, were you had to pay for every time you died.    Achievements:    Estimated time for 100 % completion: +10 hours  Singleplayer achievements: 28 Multiplayer achievements: 2    Chronology:    Metal Slug 3 (PC) 2-D platformer + run &amp; gun  (Action) – 2000  Metal Slug X (PC) 2-D platformer + run &amp; gun  (Action) - 1999   Link to Steam review for Metal Slug X.

A good port en recently (November 2014) got an update with trading cards, infinite continues and some other improvements. Graphics and sound effects are retro but can be put in 1920*1080 resolution. Released in 2000 and still a fun game to play. Works perfect with an Xbox 360 controller. A classic with some improvements for today's gaming. Can be very difficult and sometimes frustrating. This was the point in the arcades - the more you die the more coins you had to put in the machine. Prepare to die a lot!",

            "review_text": "I noticed most of the reviews of this game go along the lines of “11/10 it's Metal Slug”. I'm going to quit it with this pattern and tell you exactly why you should give SNK your money to play this video game as if you'd never been into an arcade before.   For the uninitiated: Metal Slug 3 is a run and gun game that hits all of the nails on the head with the back of a rawket lawnchair that looks like a shotgun for no real reason, doesn't take itself too seriously, has powerups that can't be described using words that aren't synonymous with “fun” or “baller” and has vehicles named “Slugs”.   The responsiveness and naturalness of the controls is a big point to mention in this game. Your character controls like a dream, with jumping controls to avoid the slew of bullets coming your way being crisp and responsive, and character movement being about as immediate as your thumb, fingers, or hand(joystick 4 lyfe) is. Which is important because it's one shot and you're dead. But you get a total of about 60 lives so it's fine.   Fire direction is tied to your movement, but the game is balanced around this in a manner in which you won't miss the free aiming typically associated with modern run and guns, and will probably find it more fun in all honesty.   Speaking of fire direction, the lack of 8 firing directions like in similar games is done beautifully rather than frustratingly, as it enables you to fire upwards while walking or do things like jump or move and aim straight down while moving in midair, things you'll need to pull sometimes to make it out alive. In places where diagonal fire is even something you'd feel the need for (which are short, infrequent, and don't overstay their welcome), you're always given a heavy machine gun which is capable of fire on diagonals should you aim it upwards and downwards again while firing. These segments are incredibly satisfying to take on.  AND THEN THERE ARE SLUGS. An important part of the series, slugs are the vehicles you're able to get into which just ramp up the insanity to a whole new level. Be it a tank with an aimable machine gun and a cannon, an armored weaponized submarine, or a camel that shoots plasma balls at your enemies, These multi-hitpoint wonders just rain death if you take care of them and it's as amazing as it seems.   I've yet to mention the satisfying little details that this game crammed in to make everything just so much better than any competing games have accomplished as far as I'm aware. Little things like the cosmetic reload animations that happen when you're idle, or that eating too much food makes you fat and melee attack with a fork really complete the game.  The menus are a bit confusing with a controller, as they were designed with older game pads in mind and not xbox 360 controllers, so there will be some awkwardness when A isn't select and B isn't back if you rebind your controls (you'll really want to, I recommend X for shoot, A for jump, and right bumper for grenade), but I came here to review a game not a menu.  Overall, if you're looking for a good time that doesn't involve hand holding, I'd have to recommend this game. If you're looking for some hand holding, Easy mode is still pretty okay, so I'd still have to recommend it.",

I played through the missions individually because I don't like being punished. The game was mostly enjoyable but the final mission was designed to eat quarters. The final mission is FUN, but VERY CHALLENGING.  I prefer to play classic games without ugly filtering effects, this MS3 lets you run completely clean or with filtering effects. It even has a wide mode (that I think doesn't stretch) but I chose to play in 4:3 windowed mode. I'm not totally sure if this is an emulation, but part, if not all, of the ROM dumps are in the game's install folder. I think it's more like an emulator with a custom front-end on the game. Not sure how all that works but as someone that hasn't really played the heck our of Metal Slug, it seemed fine to me and worked well.",

There's only 5 missions so don't get addicted or you'll have finished it in 30 minutes. It's got good replay-value and serves its purpose as relaxing casual fun, so it's a good addition to your library if you have money to spare.   Graphics/Soundtrack  Graphic options are poor and it looks hideous on full-screen (the pixel-art becomes a blurry fest). It was made with a 4:3 ratio in mind so don't get excited when you see the 16:9 option in the graphic settings. The soundtrack isn't remarkable at all but it does its job.   Controls  As with every arcade, a controller is a must for this game. I don't recommend getting it if you don't have one.   Observations  None to make at the moment.

In fact, right about now is when I refer to my Blood of the Werewolf review, because like I said there, it's easy to make a game really hard and kick your ♥♥♥ and that's all there is to it. There's no art in that. Blood of the Werewolf had art in how it was challenging, because it gave you just about all the tools you could ask for and it was still able to kill you. This game is a prime example of an artless, mindless slog through game design tragedy.  The funniest thing is that people will deny arcade games were meant to eat your quarters because they don't want to sound like they're not good enough to beat the game or something. Go ahead, come on in and convince me you beat this game without losing even a single life only using the pistol on the arcade machine back in the day. I don't care because it has nothing to do that. I can finish all the maps in Bad Rats in less than a minute in one try, that doesn't mean I'd give  that  game a positive review.

That is not to say this game is bad, yet it definitely is not as good or as fun as it could have been.  First off, the menu is archaic and slightly annoying. The whole interface is a little off: the game *clicks* every time you move your mouse over a button and an annoying voice actor shouts “OK” when you press a button on the main menu. This is slightly bothersome yet doesn't affect the game that much. It just shows how little extra effort was put into this port.  When you get to the mode select, it gives you arcade and mission mode. Don't let this full you, both modes are identical except in mission mode you choose where you start. Once the game begins its your typical run n gun game with lots of enemies and lots of projectiles. The character controls well yet a few things like the inability to shoot diagonally can get annoying. The gameplay eventually gets repetitive with little new ideas or innovative level design between levels. Oh, and by the way you will die a lot...  Yet, on the default difficulty, this is one of the easiest games I have played in recent years. Why you might ask? Because there is literally no punishment for death. When you die you respawn in the exact same point and you have unlimited continues (I used 61) and all the enemies retain how much damage you gave them after continues and deaths. You could be terrible at this game and beat it. Yet, with the choices of different number of continues and different difficulty level the game can tailor to players with a variety of different experience levels. Though playing on limited continues makes you realize how unfair deaths and spawns can be as at points the game floods the screen with deadly objects that are nearly impossible to dodge (a double jump might have made the game seem fairer). The difficulty is a slight flaw of the game. The default difficulty should be slightly more difficult and make it possible for people to increase the number of continues.  This game has a few aspects that makes it stand out though. The pixel art is beautiful, the animation is incredible and it is very rewarding to see things explode. This game has some of the best pixel art ever and is a joy to look at. Also, the final level has some decent story and new mechanics (Space-esque shooter which is fun) thrown in even if that level is incredibly long and drawn out.  Overall, this game is repetitive, has a relatively easy default difficulty, over-priced, unfair deaths and can be lacking in fun from time to time. That being said the game has great pixel art and decent gameplay. I would not recommend this game unless you LOVE pixel art or want some average retro run and gun action. If you can overlook some of my mentioned flaws, you could possibly really enjoy this game.   5.9/10",

As a result, in Metal Slug 3, you'll be fighting mutant crabs, zombies..honestly, the list goes on! That's what I love so much about this game. It takes it to the extreme! Having played Metal Slug 3 as a kid, I can surely say that the buy was worth it. Not only did I get to relive my childhood memories, but I also got to master the game that took blood, sweat, and tears for me to beat as a kid. Having spent 60 full hours into the game and getting all of the achievements, I believe I used my money well.   I guess the only downside to it is that it's a bit short, since it's an arcade game. The game focuses on replayability, since it's excruciating your first time in and it expects you to continue to try after hundreds of deaths. After a while though, you get used to it and realize what to do in each level. That, and port issues messing with the music, making it, most of the time, sound offbeat.  In short, the game's really fun for an arcade 2-D shooter, even though port issues and it being brutally hard can push some people away. For those buying: Forget logic, just blow stuff up and have fun!",

The menus could be smoother and tweaking on the control options is definately something to consider, but these are mere niggles when you have an extremely fulfilling and enthralling game to balance it out and then some.  A must-have for anyone who likes to watch their character smash enemies to bits, but be prepared to die a lot.

I have played it on medium and with a keyboard, the latter may be my problem. So I could be wrong in its inhuman difficulty. A controller might offer a better time.  As button mashers go, it will allow you to happily disassociate from your day to day, focusing on rampant blasting and grenande throwing instead.  Since the game play was too 'BANG! BANG! die..repeat,' I can't recommend it as I would other games where some level of skill brings you hours of fullfilling play time.

Metal Slug is notorious for being balls to the wall hard, and this port is no exception, but not for the reasons you would expect. Let it be said now that I adore the base game, but SNK did shameful job moving this over to PC, probably because they ported this from iOS.  Graphically, the game is still gorgeous and holds up beautifully, and while there were some hitches here or there, the impeccable animations and art style make it shine even by today's standards. However, optimization is nigh impossible, and the options presented are barebones. You can change your screen size and aspect ratio, but not much else, so I guess that's something.  Controls, however, are abysmal. I tried both keyboard and gamepad, and while gamepad is more...responsive, the mapping done on it is extremely confusing, and the other controller configurations doesn't give much to help. There is a clear way to make a Metal Slug control scheme, and somehow, SNK messed it up. If you want the true Metal Slug experience, grab the Anthology on the PSP. This port is playable, and I did get through the campaign and a few bonus stuff with a gamepad solely for love of the game, there is no reason why you should waste money on an inferior port of 3 when you could have all of them for just as cheap. Do yourself a favor and skip this iOS port. Metal Slug deserves better.",

There, done, you got your answer. Now, if you like decently long reviews, going on about different points of the game, please read on.  Gameplay: Now, this game is, as I said, a 2D retro shooter based on the arcade game of the same name. You go shooting through every levels, killing enemies, finding upgrades, and beating the end boss of every levels. I LOVE this game, the levels are extremely creative, and you won't think any level's the same. There a good amount of enemies, and you'll have fun blasting through them left and right. The bosses are great too, giving you a great challenge before starting the next level.  Controls: The controls are simple, and very easy to understand. You use (I'm explaining Xbox 360 controller controls, BTW.) the left analog stick to move your character, use the A button to jump, the X button to shoot, and the B button to use your grenade. (I may be wrong, but that may be cause that's the way I set them up in the menu, so I apologize.) I love a game that isn't complicated with controls, so it's a plus for me, and hopefully you.  Difficulty: Hot damn is this game difficult. Now, I'm more of a platformer adventure kinda gamer, but I did really want this game since I can't get the first Metal Slug on my Sega Saturn, so I bought it. Long story short, thank God there's an unlimited lives mode, cause I suck as this game, to say the least. You have a one hit insta kill. So you need to be sure to prepare for anything that may come at you. Now, if you're some kind of seasoned pro at these types of games, by all means get it, you'll probably have a blast with it. As for people who are just getting into this game, such as myself, prepare to die ALOT! So, in conclusion, this game is extremely difficult for people like me, but that isn't even a negative to the game as I love a good challenge. So, I still do recommend it to seasoned pros and novice players alike.  So there you go, my personal review of Metal Slug 3, I love this game, and with local multiplayer how could you say no? Playing as zombies and throwing up blood after getting bit is a joy with a friend. And it's arcade perfection, so you don't miss out on anything when it came out. So get this game, and I'll be giving another review on Metal Slug X whenever I get it.",
