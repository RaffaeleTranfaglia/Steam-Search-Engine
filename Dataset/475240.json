            "review_text": "I quite enjoyed this game for what it was. Sure, there are some things about it that aren't perfect mechanically, and it could certainly use some work. I bought this with the intention of wanting to support an indy developer as I am attempting to go through the same process.  I played this game through to the end taking a little less than two hours, plus some time just messing around inside the game for fun.  Pros: - Price. - Some entertaining, though at times, awkwardly written dialogue. - A variety of challenges from level to level; each level introducing something new. - Retro-esque graphics, if you're into that sort of thing. - A few hilarious references, my favourite being Mortal Kombat's Sub-Zero reference. - A short game; doesn't overstay it's welcome. - Appears to be easy, but looks are deceiving. Can be quite challenging! - Good for a few chuckles. - Addictive with a dash of charm.  Cons: - Minor mechanical game issues:  - At times I would push the thumb-stick one way and suddenly face the opposite direction when attacking.   - Clipping into the side of moving platforms and floating for a bit.  - If two weapons are on the ground and on top of each other, it reads as one pickup, destroying the second weapon.  - Rendering issue where, at odd times, a frame would go completely black.  - Enemy projectiles seem to continue through walls. (Died in a spectacularly hilarious way because of this)  - Fairly repetitive combat as you can really only swing your sword or throw the item in hand. (Found that just running past enemies and dodging was the easiest way to power through this game). - Some parts are frustrating and annoying due to stacked enemy placement. This being different from a difficult situation, as some of these places you had no choice but to take a hit.  I would say that this is a great prototype that doubles as a game. There are certainly a lot of things that the dev could do to improve upon what's already there and build this into something larger and more refined. It's clear that the dev was passionate about what he/she was doing and I have to congratulate them on releasing their game.  Keep up the great work!  7/10",

The controls are very responsive. The graphics are excellent. Very easy to 'read' what things are.  The game is exceptionally well executed. Very solid. The timing of enemy attacks and so forth seems to be the result of much play testing and refining.  Throughout your journey you will face all manner of Orcs including clubbers, axers, archers, vomiters and even mages. The progression of difficulty is very well done.  Overall I really cannot say anything bad about this game and wish more Indie games were executed as well as this one.  Highly recommended if you enjoy action adventure platform games. ",
