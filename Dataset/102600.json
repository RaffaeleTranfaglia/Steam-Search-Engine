The proposal is simple, tower defense, prevent the orcs from reaching the portal, there are different types of enemies with different behaviors. The fun is to develop a strategy with the available traps, exploring the scenario in order to exterminate all. The vision in the third person possibility you to actively participate in the struggle, something different in these types of games.  With a fun and intuitive gameplay, the graphics also pleases with his cartoonish appearance, the sound of stacks of orcs being crushed and torn is comforting. The plot is simple, just an excuse to kill orcs in many ways.  7.5/10",

It has everything to spend a great evening: +Cartoonish but high quality graphics - Great animantions of everything - traps, spells, orcs deaths. Lovely. +Variety of enemies (and even allies) - different enemies, different approaches. +Gameplay: provides awesome replayability which is just great for a singleplayer game - this is a towerdefence game AND you are playing as a hero that places those towers, so you can play with more offensive traps so they do everything for you, you can put more effort into leveling your character and kill all the orcs manually, or you can buy some troops and make more defensive traps to block the enemies. Great game. Good level design and nice story. +If you lucky enough - you can catch this game for 90% on sale - instabuy (dont forget the dlcs they are very usefull) +3 difficulties +Nice OST  Overall, i loved everything about this game. Very well done.",

            "review_text": "For those who don't know, it's a third-person tower defense set in a fantasy world. You're a war mage and your job is to defend the human world from the invading orcs. That's the synopsis in a nut shell without giving too much away, the rest is orc slaying fun history.  There's a variety of useful items including but not limited to 2 main weapons, 4 spells, 10 ground traps, 4 wall traps, 3 ceiling traps, 2 minions, and 3 'Weavers.' All of those have various uses and abilities and it's all up to you as to how to best deploy them against the enemy. That's not even including the DLC. Weavers are simply menus with available upgrades you can purchase with cash earned from waves. You get a limit of which items you can use per mission, the max being 9 available slots. You are also able to upgrade traps when the time comes with 'skulls' earned after each victory. So it's somewhat tactical, you need to strategise your approach when starting a new map. It gives you a moment of grace to choose which traps to use and to scout the map.  The music is upbeat and catchy, it compliments the protagonists witty commentary and the bloody orc slaying perfectly. I haven't encountered anything negative to say about it.  The sounds effects are crisp and simple, nothing special of note here. The one sound that got on my nerves was the Autoballista firing sound, it's a loud  WHOOOOSH  and drives me nuts when I have a lot of them. Other than that, I don't mind the rest, it's very atmospheric. The sound that sent chills down my spine was the sound a flock of Fire Babies makes, it's very ominous.  There's no endless mode, if you want an endless mode then get the second game. However, you can create a mod of the existing levels and add or modify waves. It's hands-on and takes patience and some planning on your part to do this, it's not an in-game feature.   Pros:",

It has a few shortcomings (no CoOp), and Nightmare isn't quite as difficult in this original as it was in the sequel, but the gameplay is still going to challenge players of every skill level.  For those of us who love Tower Defense/FPS hybrids, this game is a solid purchase at anything under $10, and a steal when it dips below $5. If you play through the achievements (all of which are reasonable), you can expect about 15 hours of very enjoyable gameplay.",

The game offers you a simple yet challenging gameplay.  Like a tower defense game you only need to prevent the enemies (in this game Orcs,Gnolls,Ogres,etc.) from getting into the Portal (Rift).  You can plant traps and use you hero to cut them,shoot, and kill them with spells, this makes the game more interactive. (which isn't like other tower defense game where you have to wait and watch after planting your towers)  The story is good too simple and funny which makes getting to another level somehow enjoyable as you get to know what and why the orcs are attacking.  The Hero isn't boring either and you get to somehow love the guy as his humor and sarcasm is pretty entertaining and funny.  Grab this game and have some fun.

            "review_text": "Orcs Must Die! is a fun, addictive game that combines twitchy, arcade shooter goodness with tower defense mechanics to hold back the neverending tide of Orc invaders. The levels are well designed and the traps are some of the most unique I've seen in the genre. From bubbling pools of lava, to spring boards that launch enemies into ponds of acid, as well as the classic spike and arrow traps, you'll have more options than you know what to do with. The story is basic but complimented by funny banter from the main character and is told through voice over and still images.  Perhaps the games greatest strength relies in the the 3rd person shooter elements. You're not relegated to simply laying traps and hoping for the best. Instead, you can fight alongside your machinations, whether it's with a spear, crossbow, or magic; you yourself lend a hand in achieving victory. It's fun and fast paced and keeps the player engaged in each level as well as providing room for error when setting up traps. This is something, I feel, the genre as a whole is in need of. Too often in these style of games, the player is relagated to one or two winning strategies that are only uncovered through tedious trial and error. In Orcs Must Die!, the player can create endless combinations to achieve victory precisely because they can shoot and stab the orcs alongside the traps.  In the end, it's a fun, addictive game with 3 difficulty levels and plenty of replay value. There's also a sequel worth mentioning. So if you like tower defense games, this is a must buy. If you don't, I'd still check this out on the cheap during a steam sale. It just might surprise you.",

The game play is fun, and it's really satisfying to watch the enemies get ripped apart by your traps. There are several levels of difficulty, so even the most skilled players can find a challenge here. The fact that you can upgrade your traps is very handy especially as you move through the levels and there are several DLC for this game as well expanding this game even more. Orcs Must Die! is a very good take on a tower defense game with lots of features and nice graphics. I didn't expect much from this game at first, but it turned out to be surprisingly good!",

The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs.

There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun. Other than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts. Only downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel. Don't let that stop you from buying it though !  [Rating: 87/100]",

Along floors, walls, and ceilings. Traps consist of lava, tar, spikes, and so on. Unlike alot of other defense games this game has more interaction. During and in between rounds you can purchase and lay your traps through out. However, you can also attack the oncoming orcs with one of two weapons. A melle and range weapon set this game apart. Being able to actively attack enemies makes this that much more fun. No need to feel as just a spectator to the game. Most enemies wont attack you as they are driven to their goal. However, as the levels proceed difficulty increases. With newer enemies comes new threats, and new threats begat new traps to counter. If strategy and defense is your cup of tea.

The flow of the game goes quite well with its style of humor and aesthetics. It reminds me a bit of Heretic/Hexen in terms of weaponry/magic and the music strikes a resembling similarity to Warcraft 2.   My only complaint is the lack of multiplayer.

Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the 'main base' you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over.
