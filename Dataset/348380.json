            "review_text": "I got this in a LazyGuys bundle. I would guess that I paid about 25 cents for it. The game took me 11 minutes to complete, with a walk to my kitchen to get some water adding an extra minute or so. As I filled my glass, I glanced over at the calendar and saw that today was 'Pi Day'. I didn't know that, and I learned something new... true, it's a fact of questionable worth, but still. So all in all, the time spent getting water was productive, hydrating and informative.  I'm sad to say that my trip to the kitchen was in every way a more enjoyable, valuable, moving, fulfilling and emotional experience than 'The Interview'. I really tried to be forgiving when I thought about what to put in this review... you know, points for uniqueness, the strange and disturbing images, the complete weird nothingness of it all. But in the end, no. The few generated thoughts I had while playing... i.e. maybe this is a government experiment on my character, how will it unfold?... none of those musings came to fruition. The ending felt contrived, the whole thing felt like it had an hour-long development period (and I mean from concept creation to finalized content), and it was ultimately just lame. There's potential for something interesting to come out of this mess, given more thought to the content and result, but as it is it's a wasted concept.  So.... 25 cents/11 minutes. Worth it, either money-wise or time-wise? No. But if you buy this 'game' anyway, I must recommend getting a refreshing beverage while 'playing'... it will likely be the highlight of your short experience.",

The concept is really interesting, leaving you with many questions; but at times I feel like it bombards you with too many questions, assailing you with dozens of overlapping themes. Maybe if it were longer, 30 minutes at least, The Interview would succeed more at what it is trying to accomplish. There is potential here but definitely a lot of unused potential. I am looking forward to what this developer puts out next.  5.5/10 - Average/Good",
