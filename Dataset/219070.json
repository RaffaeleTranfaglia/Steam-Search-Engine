            "review_text": "2.5D deathmatch between small spaceships that has no reason to exist. Sort of crappy 2-dimensional Descent where you dig your own tunnels and play vs bots. Boring and repetitive. 3D graphics are very basic(it uses Unity3D engine) Controls are laggy. No online multiplayer and good luck finding someone to play this in split-screen. This was an impulse buy which I already regret.",
