            "review_text": "(TLDR at bottom, if you don't want to read it all.)  As far as I can tell, if you read the most helpful negative reviews, you'll find everything I would have said myself (lack of game presentation polish, business practices, rude developer and rude close followers of said developer). Even the ones that are a little aged at this point still ring true in a lot of ways.  A lot of people compare this game to Factorio for its similar logistics puzzle/mining and refining automation premise, and to Minecraft because they both have a 'blocky' world that you can dig around in, I guess. If you liked Factorio, then I feel that these are the main differences you should be aware of before you try Fortresscraft out:  -While Factorio is much looser in how it handles player progression (It's there but you don't really have to follow it very closely), Fortresscraft has a far more linear progression path in general. Sure, you can expand your mines, or your filter systems, or anything else when you want to, but the developer has a very strong vision on what he expects you to be doing at X point in the game, and the game is made to remind you of what you should be doing at any given time. Constantly. You may like it, you may hate it. I grew to dislike it, and you can thankfully turn some of it off, but not all of it.  -Unlike Factorio's two dimensional world, Fortresscraft incorporates a third dimension into gameplay. This is probably where the Minecraft comparison comes into play. You can build into the sky or dig into the ground for what looks like far longer than it would take to hit any sort of world border, but you should know that there's nothing in the sky (that I know of), and that after a certain depth, there isn't really a point in digging deeper (that I know of).  -Fortressscraft is far more complex than Factorio. Sometimes this is interesting and adds some fun to the equation, but there are other times where it feels like needless padding of gametime being moved onto the player. There are a lot of machines that craft one item, and only one item. Some of these machines aren't very used either, just collecting dust until the off time you want it to craft whatever it crafts.  While the differences between the two games are largely subjective tastes that you may love or hate, here are some cons that you'll see in many other reviews:  -The UI, while often displaying a lot of information to the player, is often unintuitive in how it displays this information, and in my opinion can be quite ugly. It also often lacks basic convenience features found in many other games, such as the more common stack management keybinds. Be prepared to click and drag your items a lot.  -Progression is slow for anyone new to the game, or anyone not interested in busywork. There are many systems in the game that function at a snail's pace until you sink in the time and effort to expand your mining or logistics systems considerably, and it often feels like an artificial means of padding the game's gameplay hours for marketing purposes. While some of the information is there, a new player is probably going to have a rough time learning the game's complicated and often nuanced systems. The in-game documentation can help, but seems to often be written from the perspective of someone who already knows the nuances and doesn't really see why they need to be explained, in my opinion. This attitude shows in bright colors if you try to ask for help on the forums, and that's not really just in my opinion. More on that below.  -While there are some very nice and helpful people in the general community, you're going to get very familiar with the same gaggle of people who seem so passionate about the game that they come off as passive aggressive, snarky or downright rude. A quick browse of the comments in the review section will show you about a dozen of them. Unfortunately, this attitude is often demonstrated by the developer himself. If you're coming in expecting baseline respect and consideration for you as a community member, or even as a paying customer, you should prepare to be confused and disappointed, especially if you have any questions or constructive criticism of the game. Replies include 'Maybe you just don't have the IQ for this game :)' and 'Well, it was obvious to me, so I don't see a problem with how it's presented'. There's a small book that could be written on this point, but I won't get that deep into it.   TLDR: I don't really want to rant any longer, so I think I have a nice summary of my feelings about this game. In a word, I feel it's all about patience. The game was fun to me after, and only after I was patient with the game's unpolished presentation, the unituitive in-game help system, the pretty steep learning curve that's partially caused by the lacking tutorial/in-game help and the deplorable help often received on the forum, the clunky control scheme, numerous naggings to do exactly what the developer expected me to do in the game, the abysmal way I and others were treated as community members and customers by the developer and his followers, knowing little to none of the concerns or criticisms of the game would ever be taken seriously by anyone not paying into the developer's Patreon, and finally, the clear financial infleunce the developer's refusal to get a job to support the game has on the game itself. The game is still definitely in early access, and being 'released' was to get more sales. It means absolutely nothing for the game's state. There's work done on the base game still, but the game's clearly going to be sold in DLC parts now. Frozen factory is a huge part of the game and it's looking like there's another DLC release coming soon. No game should be unfun until I'm patient with it and the aspects related to it for a number of hours.  Finally, to the four followers and the developer who are undoubtedly going to thumb down and debate this review in the comments like children, I'm just going to tell you now that you shouldn't bother. I have the IQ for the game. I know how to play. I muscled through the crappy tutorial and the crappy UI and watched video after video teaching me what I should've been taught in game. I loved Factorio, so this 'genre' is for me. I actually enjoy the idea of a more complicated, more content rich Factorio in three dimensions. What I don't enjoy is how this idea was implimented in Fortresscraft. There's too many valid criticisms that are just being ignored, and often openly ridiculed for being provided.  Fortresscraft could've not only been as good as Factorio, but it could've easily been better. It feels like such a wasted effort to me, and the fact that Factorio has over 10 times as many concurrent players than FC is completely understandable, not to mention an all time peak that crushes FC's. That's not even mentioning that Factorio has a standalone client off of Steam and it's only been on Steam for a relatively short while, so it's even higher than that.  But hey, I'll just take the wise advice I've seen given on these forums. 'Haha. That's great. Please by all means take your attitude elsewhere. We have no need of it here.'",

            "review_text": "'We'll fix all the playability issues after we make enough sales from our full version release.', said no developer twice.  I still don't recommend this game. The developer has now declared that it is finished, and all he'll be doing now is fixing bugs. Here are the remaining issues I have with this game:  1. Consistent UI for machines. This one tripped me up repeatedly. I'd go to a hopper and press E to interact with it, because E opens the UI for pretty much everything else in the game, but the hoppers have no UI. Honestly it makes more sense to use T to Toggle the hopper settings, instead of Throwing selected item on toolbelt into it. Would be Consistent to have a UI for the hoppers, see exactly whats in it, then you could pull specific things from it.  1a. When I finally started tossing iron in, I would have to press Q repeatedly to get everything out of the smelter feed hopper. Then drop the iron in, and if I dropped in anything else, it would randomly select what to make next. So I'd have 1 iron bar, and then a bunch of copper and tin. Although, it's indicative of not random, but a LIFO type system. Last In First Out. Since copper and tin were already automated to that hopper.... So in order to get JUST iron out, I'd have to rotate a belt, empty the hopper, put the iron ore in, wait for the iron ore to finish processing, then rotate the belt back, and drop stuff in again.   2. Mobs pathing through solid objects. Got a nice recording of a slime inside my CPH and also inside the crafting machine. Can't shoot it there.  2a. Kinda got lucky on my base placement, although at the same token, unlucky. It's been a while since I've started a world and had my base nestled at the foot of a mountain on one side. Because the last time that happened, I had to DIG OUT a mountain side, because the green balls of wasp vomit? poop? were flying out of the mountain side at my CPH. Once I dug out enough, I found 2 wasps just chilling inside the mountain, shooting at my CPH. Like solid walls? who cares! we don't have the programming to respect solids. With the slime just willy nilly oozing into and out of my CPH, I'm going to have to assume that nothing else respects solid surfaces either. Arther sure as hell doesnt.   3. No display showing how much charge arther has. At least he's no longer holding a digital sandwich board, cracking jokes, but it's impossible to figure out how much charge he has now, except with a charging station I'm told. It's nice that his text now shows up over your toolbelt, but the sound is a bit obnoxious. Reminds me of an old NES game, where when the characters talk, it would make little blip noises with each character... like Zelda.   4. Arther upgrades still reside in your inventory, and same with suit upgrades I'm assuming, since pressing S in the inventory screen opens a screen for suit upgrades that looks clearly incomplete. I made Arther's power core, why the heck does it live in my inventory? Why doesn't it go to it's own area? IIRC, you can take arther's power core out of your inventory and put it into a storage box. As long as you pick it up before you log out, and it's in your inventory when you launch the game, Arther counts it as having it.   5. Still wish there was a compass. The holobase does seem much better somehow, and there's these red arrows in it, no idea what those are about.   6. Logistics Hoppers, the white ones, although they still didn't spit things out as fast as a Large storage hopper, you could use them to empty a mining drill and send the contents onto a belt. Now they are slower some how. The point of the logistics hopper was to get the ore out of the drill and into transport. Now there's no choice but to stick a storage hopper on them. Which also seem slower in their dispersing speed.   7. New Issue. The automation machines, the stamper, the extruder, the coiler, and PCB maker, used to just zip right along. Since they updated the recipe for laboratory pods, to use 1 PCB per three plates, for a total of 2 PCB to 6 plates for each lab pod... I would build a belt turntable, put a hopper on top of it, stick conveyers on each of the outputs, 3 sides leading to a stamper, 1 leading to the extruder, coiler, PCB maker, have the belts meet at the bottom and move up into a second hopper at the same level as the first one, so you could waste less resources and make lab packs... The whole build occupies slightly more space than the New and improved Behemoth of a CPH. But seeing as the speed of those automation machines is excruciatingly slow now, it causes a backlog, throwing the ratio's off. That's when I decided I'd had enough FCE for a while.   The early game of FCE is Excruciatingly slow. Now with the improvements to the speed of the automation machines, it's going to be EVEN SLOWER...   What FCE feels like to me: Solitary Confinement.  When I shut the game down, I don't feel like I'm leaving FCE, I feel like I'm escaping.  I'm really happy I got two copies at such a cheap price, but to be honest, unless it goes F2P, I'd leave this alone and spend your allowance on a game that was made by a developer that cares more about giving you a quality game, rather than how much money they get for making it.   I will delete comments on this review at my discretion. I'm tired of being harassed by FortressCraft Promoters for expressing my opinion. I'd like to lock it so no further comments can be made. But apparently I don't get that option. So if you love FortressCraft Evolved, write your own review and stay off of mine.",

            "review_text": "Wow, where to begin with this game. Let me first start with my opinion. I love this game. However, I can not recomend it as of yet. I spent 24 hours fo game time as of the time I've written this, and I still don't really have a clue what's going on. It's advertised as a tower defense mincraft clone, but I've never played minecraft, so I'm not really sure if it is. I really like the idea of having to dig to find minerals, the blocks you can remove, the things you can research, but I don't like having to search outside the game or go through a million other steps to get a general idea of what I should be doing.  Let's start off with the 10 second tutorial. It sucks so bad, after the first time I booted the game up and watched the unskippable (in this day and age, really?!) opening scene, I had no real idea of what to do or how. Sure, there is a help menu that gradually fills up with more information as you need it, but isn't the point of the tutorial to teach you what you need to know? There's no real explination of day or night, no real explination of what you can craft, and nothing tells you what you're research unlocks until you've already researched it.  Now the community is great, and all the answers can be found someplace, but to me, that takes time away from the game. It's advertised as a tower defense, but it's more like a base defense, eventually. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty, but this game needs a ton of polish before I can actually recommend it to anyone. The learning curve is HUGE in this game, and I'm still finding things out the more I play, but if that's your thing, feel free.  Update: With the new patch that came out, I truly do love this game more. I still can't recommend it though until it does some serious polishing. No game ever should keep basic things away from the player, and that level of transparency is exactly what this games lacks. It's also unbelievably slow. I've been playing for days and there are still things that are hidden from me and I have no idea what they do until I actually spend the 5-6 hours unlocking it. As a player, it's truly the only reason I keep this game thumbs down.",

It's a little bit like factorio in 3D :)  The Hololense feature is just awesome and helps you to always keep the overview what happens in our base.  If you may think this is another Minecraft clone, then you are wrong. The only simalarity are the block bases building thats it.  The developer is really active and keen to deliver an awesome game, who also listens to his community - also after the release.   The only thing I personaly miss currently are more decorative blocks, to give my base a more industrial/futuristiv look and feel.",

            "review_text": "Let's start by saying that this game is still being heavily developed despite being out of early access. Some of the newer stuff doesn't have icons but besides that the game is basically 100% completable in what constitutes a pretty decent end-game that can take 50-100+ hours to get to, with additional difficulty settings for pretty good replayability.  The game does a good job of combining a minecraft style sandbox with tower defense. It takes some of the slow and annoying parts of minecraft and removes it and gives the player a lot of tools to assist them with common tasks such as building. building 50 blocks in a straight line in survival mode is very convienent, not to mention no wait on breaking a block and protection mode from breaking multiblocks. The grappling hook is quite fun to use and makes grappling up a verticle mining tunnel a lot of fun. On my 4 year old computer the game runs smoothly even with a lot of stuff going on.   Overall when buying this game remember some developers wait until they have everything that they can possibly do to the game done with before exiting early access, this allows them to make excuses for whatever bugs are in the game. This developer has done a great job at leaving early access and releasing a very stable main build along with a constantly updated bleeding edge build. The game might not be as complete as some other games that have exited early access, but it is stable, there is a lot of fun things to do, and my biggest complaint about the game is that $12 is just way too cheap. I would of gladly paid $20-$30 for it possibly $40",

Another is the spiderbot, which is supposed to defend your base, however it is a rubbish shot, and it spends its time getting in your way or damaging the terrain around and under your base making it difficult to move around. Need a way to switch it off or disable it.  EDIT: Recent update made the Spiderbot better. No weapons at the start, upgradeable weapons thereafter and they've apparently made it a much better shot with the ability to target up to 5 mobs simultaneously.

Hooray!  This game's been out of early access for a couple months now, but it gets more content in its free monthly patches than a fully supported Blizzard game. There is an upcoming, 8 dollar expansion pack that I'd gladly pay for (Dev's cat's gotta eat) based on what I've seen thus far. To anyone confused about the patreon bit: A patreon sub enables a very small handful of cosmetic, VIP 'bling' blocks if you will, and early access to the expansion. It's a donation with a tiny thank you; not a sales' offer.  My original review, less my comment on multiplayer:  Factorio meets Minecraft, kind of like playing feed the beast/Industrial craft mods but with the cohesion of a single dev behind it rather than 100 separate mods in a package that never works or updates quite right.  If all of that's greek to you, the game consists of finding raw materials, and constructing the logistics to extract, move, and process them, either into more logistics, research pods, or defenses against attacking wasp things.   The GOOD: Engaging base building game Lots of recipes to craft across several tiers of stuff. Good visual feedback on logistics letting you know what's working or not Still being actively developed (IE more's coming)  The BAD:  Currently there's very little variety in the enemies that attack you, or your defenses to deploy against them.  Gameplay between the last available research and charging the OET (winning) is currently just a huge grind for more power generation. I expect this gap will later be filled with more interesting content, but were the dev to win the lottery and stop making the game, it'd be poorly balanced in its present state.    Overall, I could recommend this game: it's less than the cost of minecraft and basically takes the most interesting parts of minecraft to me and expands them. WIth the mulitplayer issues fixed I expect this will be a fantastic game to play on LANs or with a small group of friends.",

This game revitalized that sence of wonder, being overwhelmed, and exploration that the first time I played minecraft did. Those that like Minecraft, and are a little done playing modpack after modpack and geeting burned out on it should DEFINENTLY play this game. and come on, it's only $13 (on 2/15/2016), why WOULDN'T you get this game?  I must say though, that if your computer is a toaster, it'll get frustrating with the game turning into a slide-show. This game isn't exactly friendly on your ram or proccessing capabilities, but you can drop the detail and graphics WAY down and still have a good time, it'll just look like it was done on the N64. But, normally this game is gorgeous, provided you have the computer to handle it.  For those of you who are experienced in minecraft (particularly tech mods) you'll discover that you will be making LOTS of controll based mistakes. Also, you'll have a decent understanding of tech progression, however, it is dificult to know ahead of time what you need to do. I would recomend that you play a few worlds to better understand what to do, and what way you prefer the most to do it. Your first few worlds are likely to fail in your eyes, this is fine, and fixable at just about any time, but you can always start fresh.  I would like to see a more comprehensive creative mode, as it does not lend to helping you actually mess around with logistical ideas, and what not, which I would like to see. currently, if you have an idea to use a system, you have to just try it out, which makes experimentation a potentially costly endeavour.  The short version is that this game is amazing, and any fan of starforge, minecraft, and/or factorio should most deffinently fork over the cash and get this game. it's not even all that much cash in the first place.",

Updated Dec 29th: Back to a red thumb, survival is just too empty to call this a game. Still very much 'in development' even though it's missing the EA tag...  Updated Dec 2015  While this game is no longer in Early Access, some of it still feels very much 'beta'. This is not a bad thing, at least not in this instance. For example, the graphics settings are very basic. You'll be forced to live with Jar Jar Abrams due to any light source emitting massive amounts of bloom. So your options are going to be darkness, one light, or blinding nova of brightness.  'So what?' That's pretty much what I mean by still feeling 'beta'. Don't like music? Better also not like other sounds, it's all one slider: Volume. Some other GUI issues pop up, like no exit to menu. You must always head to your desktop, and since the game has stringent survival mechanics and no pause...well it's either full exit or no bathing.  'Just GUI issues?' So far, that's about it. I mean there is a lack of content (trees that grow, plants that grow, a sun/moon/sky/weather) But these, to me, are fluff. The base game is there, the mechanics are sound. It just needs the finishing polish to make it a full game.  'Lack of Documentation' There is still a big issue with information in game. You need to craft item 'Thing' which is made up of items 'A' 'B' 'C' and 'D'. Item 'A' is made up of 'B','C', and 'E'. Item 'B' is made up of 'E'. Item 'C' is made up of 'F'. And item 'D' is made up of 'E','F' and 'G'. Confused? The help menu helps, but it's just a start. (Back to feeling beta...)  Lastly, I feel the AI is just not there. I see some slugs, and other minor mobs. But nothing that screams 'life'. The planet (always snow, nothing else...) you land on is a dead husk, with aimless monsters. Again, the mechanics are there they just seem under utilized.  No modding that I can find, can't even change textures. Might need to use a fancy program to edit files though.  Anyway, do I recommend the game? It's hard to say, I really enjoy playing it. Would enjoy it more if modding was there, or at least information as to how to mod. Until then, it has plenty of hours worth of content to keep you busy, if you're after a crafting/building game with really bright lights. So I give it a green thumb, though with my track record with plants it might as well be red.",

After many years of running modded minecraft servers, I was quite sick to the back teeth of the game. That being said, I did get this game thinking there would be some similarities and expected to get bored very quickly. This game, quite simply put, is amazing. The developer is nothing short of a genius!  The game has you start with afew supplies, after crash landing on an Alien planet. You are given a small tutorial, and then thrown into the deep end. At this point, I went and watched a few episodes of Direwolf20's lets plays. After being educated a little.. I jumped back into the game.   You begin by scanning for various ores, and setting up mining equipment. While this is happening you will be also scanning new blocks and plantlife. This accumulates research points which you can use to unlock new research projects and equipment.   It's not long past this point, you realise that 5 hours of game time has passed, and you've simply got lost in this enormous game! By this point I had found my first 4 ore types, and had begun building a system of convayors that could fill my smelters on the surface. Research seemed very simple at first.. but another few hours in and I was now constructing a lab and researching new projects was taking several hours at a time. This was ok though because I had so much other stuff to do while this was happening.   However.. the bigger your base becomes, the more power you use.. the higher your base threat becomes.. and it's not long before you threat analyser is telling you.. 'Attack immanent!'. Now for those like me who love the tech, and the factory side of the game.. the invading alien swarms will only attack your central hub.. and once it's health is 0, it just reboots. That is unless you're playing hardcore.. and then its game over.   So as I went deeper into the ground, I realised just how big this game was. Some of the caves, from top to bottom, were bigger than minecraft, bedrock to sky... I would liturally hold my breathe incase I fell off a ledge, as death meant I would drop all my equipment. So far i've been 1,187 blocks deep.. and everytime I go exploring, I just can't explain the feeling of being so small, in caves so large..   This game is great for those wanting some survival, some tower defence, and some tech. I love all the machines that automate the ore collecting and the minecarts that collect the ores.. the way the power system works, and the defending of my base. It really is very well balanced... and it has just the right difficulty level to keep most playing, and not getting bored.  10/10",

            "review_text": "FCE is a voxel-based game. That is where any similarities to that oft-compared 'other highly popular voxel-based game' ends. The point of FortressCraft is to build your base/machinery/infrastructure, and let it do the work for you.  You start out having crash-landed on a planet with with the most basic of machinery. Your Central Power Hub to produce power, a research station to perform basic research, a smelter to smelt ore into bars, for use in the crafting station. Selecting the easier resource difficulty levels will also give you a bonus coal deposit right near your CPH with the machinery needed to automate coal delivery right off the bat.  You then start finding resource deposits, placing extractors to mine from them, and collecting ore to smelt to then craft the machinery needed to automate that whole process. As you discover different types of blocks, you can perform research to be able to craft new machinery to work faster or perform other tasks. Once your basic research at the research station is all complete, you'll need to build a laboratory to continue higher levels of research.  Once you've got your infrastructure rolling along nicely, producing metal bars and power at a good rate, your base threat will increase to the point that the wasps start attacking. Thus begins the tower defense aspect of the game. You'll need to build a defense network to deal with the bugs. And, of course, upgrade that network as your research and production levels increase, to deal with increasingly strong bugs.  The best part of this game, though, is the developer. DjArcas is constantly adding new content into the game, and live streams development quite often. A lot of game developers claim to be highly involved with their community. And some even live up to that claim. But Dj is the only one I know of that interacts with his community live on Twitch while he's writing the code for things that he's talking with the community about. Many of the machines currently in the game are the result of suggestions made while he was streaming development.  If you like voxel-based games, city-building games, or strategy games, or any combination thereof, I highly recommend you check out FortressCraft Evolved.",

            "review_text": "Not recommended. I hoped this would be something of a cross between Minecraft and Factorio — and it is, kinda — but without the charm or appeal of either one.  The survival mechanics are cranked up to an excessive degree. You're in a hostile environment, so your suit has to spend power keeping you warm (or sometimes cool), and also powering your light and your scanner and etc. It recharges slowly during the day, but VERY slowly, and days feel incredibly short.  So at least in the beginning, you're going to need a recharge every couple of minutes. That ties you to your central power hub, which the game states is irreplacable, meaning you literally cannot explore very far (or deep), nor set up base in a place of your choosing.  The grind is similarly cranked way up. It doesn't just offer you automation, it forces it on you. For example: While the ore smelter will take ore from (and put bars into) a neighbouring 'hopper' (chest), there's no way to manually load said hoppers, as far as I can tell. It wants you to use conveyor belts to automate everything, but conveyors cost tin and copper bars, which need smelting. Just getting the initial conveyor network set up can be a royal pain depending on how far (and how uphill/downhill) your mines are.  Research is a total mess. The game will happily let you research advanced devices without researching the components that go into those devices — like inventing the car before you've invented wheels and motors. If those were your last research points … congrats, you're screwed. At least until you find more things to scan — which might be impossibly far from your base without some basic suit upgrades, which you can't afford because you haven't found the materials, etc etc.  And finally, the graphics. This might be a question of taste, but personally, I'm amazed they managed to take Minecraft and make it even MORE ugly. Same blocky world, but with a very limited colour palette, almost everything in the dark, and constant snow. Not pleasant.  I only played for a couple of hours — not long enough for enemies to show up, whenever that happens — but I simply wasn't having much fun. YMMV. ",

            "review_text": "Epic game. Quite feature-rich and playable, while still being in active (and community engaged) development, yet designed with the innate desire (I would say promise, if this wasn't the world of software with its ever-emergent unknowable bugs) that its development will never force a world reset. The dev is on the forums almost daily, actively engaging with users re: feature tweak/addition suggestions, bug reports, balancing issues... rather than buying a buggy in-development game and getting cryptic or dismissive responses to your suggestions/issues from the obvious PR arm of things (as opposed to the techies who know what the bleep you're talking about), you're buying Minecraft-esque access to a living, /thriving/ beta version, with much less endemic issues than Minecraft, ALONG WITH front-row tickets to real-life large-scale game development unfolding in front of your eyes.  And, it is incredibly well-optimized when it comes to visual/computing-resource playability. My favorite feature of the game, far and away, is found not in the gameplay, but in the settings menu: click a checkbox, set your target framerate, and the game will take ahold of the quality and render distance settings in order to keep you achieving that. In a frenetic base with umpteen-gazillion things going on, it'll automatically turn down shadows and maybe kill the render distance - just like our IRL brains would tend to focus on a small subset of the goings-on in a real hectic factory - while during landscape exploration, you can get the voxel equivalent of Skyrim's brilliant vistas. (Hint to DJ: World-gen structures of awesomeness maybe?)  Geeky stuff aside, the gameplay... wait, never mind about 'geeky stuff aside.' If you just want another alien shoot-em-up with resource management and base-building mechanics in the tactical background, then this game isn't for you. If you want a tower-defense game where mobsKilled is proportional to resourcesAvailable through some arcana, this isn't the game for you. If you want another (Modded) Minecraft, where you have the option that the base can be there just for aesthetics, or for helping you The Player become the Great Lone Warrior and Loot-Collector of Your Infinite Domain (not that many take this option, but from some of the forum posts, quite a few do), this isn't the game for you.  BUT, if you want a game that blends ALL these elements, plus ever-present environmental factors, automation systems that would appeal to Rube Goldberg and Henry Ford alike, and a strong requirement to Go Forth and Explore... then as long as you can handle the irreducible complexities of such a system, this IS the game for you. This is the game for the MacGyvers of Minecraft, the Fords of Factorio, the Kings of Kerbal, who want to apply their problem-solving, epic-failing, and grand-constructing skills to an infinite-yet-efficient landscape and a stable-yet-expanding game mechanics platform (with official modding support much closer than with Minecraft). If you're geeky, 10/10 would recommend.",

I'm personally not a fan of Minecraft, as I tend to get bored with pure survival/aesthetic building games pretty quickly. This game hits all the areas that I enjoy in one package: Exploration, problem solving, combat, automation, logistics and the challenge of tweaking your factories to improve their efficiency.  The game has been rock solid stable for me and hasn't crashed once in the 50+ hours I've racked up playing, sometimes well into the small hours of the morning. I'm eagerly awaiting a more stable and comprehensive multiplayer experience. I've only just reached T2 ores, but I'll be buying the expansion anyway as a developer this good deserves support, plus I have no doubt it will add greatly to the experience.",

Dont get me wrong it work(on default setting) but it dosent feel right  -conveyor going vertical i know the devs did it because people complains too much about pipes cost and i got to agree you got to do it in order to progress at decent speed(in solo play anyway) cause building pipes requires days of farming 4 nickel if i remember right per pipe mean if you wanna extract titanium at -400 you need 1600 bars wich mean 6400 ore in the best smelter got to agree the veins you were extracting will be empty by the time you collect all those ressources for me anyway   -feel lost after a while im somewhere in the game where i need only ressource -300-400 and everything else is automate at the surface and i got to say i wich i had more generator type or transporting type or better storage hopper ...",

That said, I am quite sure you can automate pretty much the entire game if a player was dedicated and skillful enough, though that is MUCH easier said than done. I cannot currently comment on the multiplayer aspects as I have not messed around with that (yet!). The cons are that the tutorial is fairly useless. There is a LOT to figure out, but once you get the gist of it, the game is pretty consistent. Another con that kind of irks me is that most of the mobs that attack your base do not effect the player in any way, so you literally clip through them with no repercussions.",
