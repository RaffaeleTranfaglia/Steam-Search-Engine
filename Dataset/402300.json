Therefore I know whereof I speak.)    This is why we shouldn't leave Japan on its' own. No, really, I'm serious. We do that and instead of Football Manager they come up with this?!?!",

            "review_text": "It has a lot of points I like and tickles a certain itch, but a lot of areas that it could expand on and make it a really good game. It feels too minimalist and grindy for me overall, although it's still a fun game to play. Mileage may vary, but the sheer chaos of a high level dungeon might make it more worth it.",

            "review_text": "Great strategy game, sort of an evil, very simplified version of Dwarf Fortress. :)  You build your dungeon, set treasure to lure in adventurers and try to slaughter most of them. &gt;) Don't be put off by the fact that the game's text-based, it's quite easy to imagine all of the epic fights of heroes against your bosses. If you're fond of a (R-18) manga Maou no Hajimekata, this is likely the game for you.",
