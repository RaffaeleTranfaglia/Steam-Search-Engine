            "review_text": "I love ARG's. So imagine my utter disappointment, when I realised I have just missed over a year of what is arguably the finest ARG I have ever played?  The Black Watchmen somehow slipped under my all-seeing radar, which is incredibly sad. Sad because I have missed out on joining what will no doubt be a superb global effort, of thousands of players all staying up unreasonable hours, just because they are not quite able to understand just what that picture is supposed to represent, and why wings matter,  The game is literally centered around the real world. You use a central tool to receive puzzles and enter answers, and through where clues and information are given out - but the rest is found 'out there', in the real world. Professionally designed websites (that don't immediately stand out as obviously fake) are used, as well as authentic places around the world, are all used to give you that sense of PRESENCE that is sorely missing from other attempted ARGs.  It isn't without minor fault - the occasional typo, but really nothing that you wouldn't see in real websites I assure you!   I've yet to move up the agent rankings. You start off as a Red agent, meaning world interaction is limited to just you initiating email based contact. Later, you can optionally apply for other grades of agent interaction, from email only, to full on creepy - phonecalls in the middle of the night, strange letters in the post... I am absolutely in for that, and will give the required info as soon as I am able!  What I have yet to experience, and I cannot WAIT to do so, is the live events. As you might expect, you collaborate with global agents via IRC, forums, the usual, in order to solve puzzles in real time. Apparently, one agent is picked to experience this in a full-on 'reality show' - I know nothing about this other than what I've read, so I suggest you, dear reader, do the same. I, sadly will never be 'picked' as I am not physically able, which is utterly sad, but nevertheless, I loook forward to the day I can help solve such events.  Being a puzzle game, based around the internet, you are inevitably going to come across spoilers. However, in saying that, I have solved every single puzzle without 'bumping into' any obvious answers, which is nothing short of unbelievable. There are solutions out there, in the exellent Blackwatch Forums, which should be visited daily. The answers to particularly difficult puzzles can be found, but only after you've worked your way though a lot of excellent spoiler hints. This makes you feel like less of a cheater, and more as what you would have experienced had you been around at the time the community was solving it, just as you are now.   The hints are very well done, asking YOU questions rather than just simply giving you the solution. It makes you feel a lot better about seeking help, because you know you were not the only one a bit lost on how to continue - only to find the right track with just a smallest of nudges. (There was one particularly nasty puzzle which I will not spoil, and I needed every clue they gave - and even then I STILL couldnt' immediately solve it - I really had to put the clues together).  In closing, you may initially buy The Black Watchmen, and feel like you didn't get a lot for you cash. But, if you like puzzles, if you like something a little different from the normal, if you understand stressing over a number is fun, and solving a puzzle gives a certain amount of euphoria, you absolutely MUST buy this game.",

The phone calls you get (if you so choose) are fun. IRC is fun. Some agents go out to locations for missions and Periscope their journey. They meet up with people and collect intel or other items to relay to the other agents to continue solving whatever puzzle there is at the moment.   You don't have to get super involved, the story missions are easily worth more than the price, but if you do get involved you will be warmly welcomed as we are always looking for more agents to help stop the summoning of mythological creatures by building paper boats and floating them in the pond for Dispatch.",

Previous free AR games I have played have an obvious love or devotion from the developers, which this is missing.  My biggest gripe with this game is that input parameters for deciding if you have supplied the answer are so narrow and specific that you can spend many hours in frustration chasing possible answers, only to later realise you already discoved the real answer long ago but didnt use the correct title. For example while 'icecream store' would be incorrect, 'Sunny Farms Ice Cream Store Inc Pty Ltd' would be correct.   A further kick in the teeth however is that the game quickly devolves any complexity into in browser 'flash games', and 'Social Engineering' otherwise known as 'email formating games'.",
