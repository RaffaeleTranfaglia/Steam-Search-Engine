            "review_text": "Half Life: Blue Shift is a great, albeit short (2.5-3.5 hours in length), addition to Half-Life as far as DLC goes. It's events occur alongside the main game, beginning shortly before the Black Mesa catastrophe, and ending about half way through the story of the main campaign. Because of this, I'd personally recommend playing it before Opposing Force, as the events take place before that DLC's occurrences chronologically speaking.   In Blue Shift you play as one of the security guards at the Black Mesa facility, whose name is Barney Calhoun. You will make your daring trek through the complex in hopes of escaping the ongoing calamity, and there will be lots of shooting, puzzling, and storytelling experiences along the way. Other than the plot   shift   *wink*, nearly everything in my review of the main game applies to Blue Shift aswell. It's of the same quality, and I'd recommend it just as heartily as I do the original Half-Life.    Personal Rating: 9.5/10",

It shows us that cute Barney is also a murdering machine which is great I say. The game introduced the Half-Life HD pack. It also has some pretty original puzzles, making the copy-paste Half-Life gameplay a little more sufferable, for the third time in a row. It can't compare with Opposing Force with originality though. It doesn't add new weapons, but it is as full of details as the previous two games. It also has a happy ending, without you being obligatorily captured by G-Man. It features a great character named Dr. Rosenberg that you will interact with and help him escape Black Mesa. Oh and you can see Gordon Freeman himself at least 3 times during the play. It's a must for any Half-Life fan, even though it's that short and not extremely inventive, gameplay and story-wise.",

Blue Shift dynamically changed Half Life by making you play as neither the jocks nor the nerds but the would-be of both groups, the security guards; a prospect that made me shake in my booties. Oh and would you look at that, another double name that refers to both the character and a scientific term. Oh Valve, you unscrupulous little geeks. It’s like next you’ll follow up with a console exclusive called “Half Life: Decay” which had a focus multiplayer. What a sick twisted world that would be, huh. Then again, we don’t speak of the dark times to come. (Cough) AC: Unity (cough). On the surface the game is about an alien invasion, but deep down you see a much more compelling story. The story of Barney the mute security guard who recovers from his lack of speech as is seen in Half Life 2; hint hint upcoming piece (cough) hint. Blue Shift was the shortest by far, but it brought with it updated textures for the graphics junkies for which I have no respect, and yet I have no disrespect. In other words don’t talk to me and we’ll be just fine. This game is marginally more open than the previous titles and I found myself breaking down a wall to a much later part of the game earlier, so there’s that. A concept Eric Hirshberg is still trying to figure out. This piece was made with a tad less effort, yes. Thanks for asking, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life: Blue Shift  Short but sweet   After the success of Opposing Force, Gearbox decided to make another expansion pack for Valves critically acclaimed fps, Half-Life.   When aliens from Xen are teleported to his work place at Black Mesa, security guard Barney Calhoun must cut his shift short and try to escape the alien infested base, as well as fighting off the HECU marines who are tasked with neutralising the situation by killing all lifeforms in the facility.  Like Half-Life, the game explains where you need to go, what you need to do and why, however trying to wrap your head around the backstory of the Half-Life universe proves to be a difficult task. This expansion pack brings us to new areas of Black Mesa, unseen in previous games and there are a few Gordon Freeman cameos throughout.   What made Opposing Forces’ gameplay so much fun and memorable was the fact that Gearbox introduced new weapons and enemies. Unfortunately, in Blue Shift, all the weapons and enemies were recycled from Half-Life. Dr Rosenberg’s companionship was a new gameplay aspect introduced in Blue shift. Unlike other scientist in Half-Life, who only have 4 character models, Dr Rosenberg has distinctive facial features and is an essential character who makes multiple appearances throughout the game. As well as this new feature, you can look forward to the return of fun but difficult puzzles and awesome shootouts against aliens and soldiers.  Like Opposing Force, the graphics in this game have dated significantly since 2001. It is still enjoyable none the less however for those gamers who play the new shiny 1080p games, then this may be a struggle for you. Like all Half-Life games, a lot of thought has gone into the level design especially in the old areas of Black Mesa, where the equipment, hallways and signs have new textures. Notable were the health and HEV suit chargers, as there was an obvious change in their design to suit the old run down areas of the facility.  This game was a short but sweet expansion pack, only taking me 4 hours to complete. Like Opposing Force, there were no new “stand-out” soundtracks, those from Half-Life were once again recycled. However, it was fun to see the Lambda incident through the eyes of Barney Calhoun. Venturing into the old areas of Black Mesa was a unique experience, the gameplay was solid and it was interesting working with Dr Rosenberg as this companionship had not been done yet in a Half-Life game.  7/10",

If you did not enjoy Half-Life, you should not. If you have not played Half-Life, you should get and play that game first.  Simple as that.  As for the game itself, it's a competent, if rather short, side story to the original Half-Life, following the story of Barney (who returns in Half-Life 2), one of the security guards from the Black Mesa facility. When everything goes to hell...err....Xen, he tries to help the scientists and escape from the facility himself. It's a fun little romp back through Black Mesa, but it is no different mechanically from the original game - it does not add anything, and is missing some of the features of the original game. It's worth a budget price purchase, but is the lesser of the two Half-Life expansions.",

Where this game is set apart from that game though, is in the construction and flow of the game. This one, (a much shorter game), flows much better, and other than one or two spots, it forgoes the platform game style that Half-Life has. Only occassionally do you have to leap, duck and weave across impossible terrain and asinine engineered structures, and by the removal of this completely annoying aspect of the original game, this one has not aged as poorly....   Let's face it, games back then, especially of this genre, grew from those platform styled games, and it's what game developers knew, but it's old hat and it doesn't stack up well. Thankfully Blue Shift doesn't fall into that old game cliche often.  The plot for Blue Shift flows better as well. Instead of just hunting down an alien to kill it, this is a better defined story arc, requiring working towards a non-violent goal of escape (though not without a good dose of alien and military murder-mayhem along the way). Interesting, considering in the original you're a scientist and this one you're a security guard.  For anyone that is curious about Half-Life, this is probably the game for you, since it's short and IMO, better.

From the same friend that introduced me to the Half-life series, I also received knowledge of the splinter games to Half-life and the impression that this game would be about Barney. Wait... Calhoun is Barney? So, I wasn't lied to. Then why didn't any body refer to him as Barney. Where we suppose to know Barney as Calhoun? Regardless, Half-life: Blue Shift made me want to take back on quesioning whether Half-life was too long. Half-life: Blue Shift's brevity and instatenous action brought an increase satisfaction for Gordon Freeman storyline.   I suspect that the game was used to experiment with new mechanics for future games, relative to the release to this game. I admit a certain number of standstill problem solving took a large amount of my time. Fortunately, I didn't need any guides or cheat to figure them out, but that didn't change the very awkwardness of the resolutions. From the spand of 4 hours that it took to finish the game on normal, you can tell that a large portion of the consistented of more tactical problem solving versus rat-in-the-maze problem solving. I cannot argue since I enjoyed the process of 'How do I take care of these guys? Well, I seem to be safe in this corner and can shotgun any who pop through that doorway... Wait, they have grenades right now, don't they. Crap, speak of the DEVIL!'  Although I cannot think of a way to resolve this, I found the ending dissatisfying and unfulfilling. If not for the credits soon after, I would have thought I still had a chapter or two to still go, but without any closure for the game it ended. I also didn't care for the thrid wheel feel to the game. As Barney, You get to do so much, and carry the story to lead into the Half-life 2 saga. Yes, You see G-man, but much like Gordan Freeman, G-man remains behind the seams.  My overall thought is that I would not recommend this game. I cannot think of a reason to tell some 'yeah go get this game it has this, and that and so expands on what you would have known about the Half-life series.' The game is not a bad game, but I cannot see myself telling someone that the game's worth their time.  Overall, I'd rate this 5/10.",

Freeman is shown couple times, but wouldn't it be cool if you could sometimes see him running around, maybe accidentally helping you unlock a door or turn a power on (or off and make matters more difficult, that selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :).   Also It's kinda strange that as an ordinary (but brave) guard you're basically doing the same things as Gordon, only you're expected to do it without H.E.V. suit.

Here, you play as Barney Calhoun, security guard from the Black Mesa incident, as you may of already figured by now. There isn't really any notable change in gameplay that I think I should mention, but one. Since you are a security guard, not a scientest 'Grunt'(Refers to the new scientest that they make to all the dirty work so that the others don't have to, A.K.A Gordan Freeman and his HEV suit), you will find that you can not use any of the HEV suit chargers found in the game. Instead, you have to find body armor, vests and helmets, often found by dead security guards lying around the facility. The armor works the same as the HEV suit, however. But, the game is only 3 hours long, as this is just an expansion to the original half-life.",

I feel like we get all caught up in the majesty of its predecessors that we miss out on what it is. I actually reccomend playing it before you try out Opposing Force because it seems to fit in better and it makes Opposing Force shine brighter, but also because it helps build the story of the original games and it makes everything sort-of fall into place.  Despite its reputation in the franchise, it is still quite fun and worth a playthrough.",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: I've marked this review as 'Not Recommended', but a more accurate descriptor would be 'Recommended with Heavy Reservations'. Read on to find out why.  ---  'Half Life: Blue Shift', a Gearbox Software expansion to Valve's debut title 'Half Life', is the first thing I've seen in quite some time to leave me completely unsure how to feel about it.  On the one hand, it's not a bad game per sé. It's got generally the same gameplay one comes to love playing 'Half Life', it's got the same gimmick of remaining in full control of the player character, this time around a security guard named Barney Calhoun rather than Dr. Freeman, throughout the entire game with no cutscenes, and it provides a unique perspective on the Black Mesa Incident we haven't seen before in 'Half Life' nor in Gearbox Software's previous expansion pack 'Opposing Force'.  These all sound like good things, but there's a wide variety of bad things about the game as well. Firstly, it's too short. Because I'm a terrible gamer it took me about 4 hours to complete, but it only takes most people about 3 hours. None of the new weapons introduced in 'Opposing Force' return, many of the weapons from the original 'Half Life' don't return, including the iconic Crossbow. Throughout most of the game, the only enemies players can expect to run into are headcrabs, vortigaunts, barnacles, houndeyes, and HECU soldiers. While other enemies such as bullsquids and alien grunts will occasionally appear, at no point in his adventure will Barney Calhoun encounter zombies of any kind, Black Ops personnel, or any of the new enemies introduced in 'Opposing Force'. Alien controllers will appear only once, during Calhoun's brief stay on the borderworld of Xen. In a truly shocking display of pure laziness, there isn't even a final boss. Bear in mind here I'm not saying the game failed to introduce an original final boss and simply recycled one of the old ones, which would still be bad but forgivable, I'm saying there literally is no final boss; the entire grand finale is literally just pressing some buttons. In lieu of any kind of variety in enemy encounters (or even enemies themselves), players can expect at least one headcrab to be hiding behind EVERY corner and inside EVERY wooden box. I mean that, by the way; no matter how strapped for ammo you are, break wooden boxes at your own risk.  Enemies aside, the story is weak and uninteresting. Without spoiling anything (although there's hardly anything to spoil), the basic plot is that Calhoun must help the Black Mesa scientists execute a hare-brained plan to teleport outside the doomed research facility. This heavily simplistic story is relayed to the player exclusively through lengthy bouts of expository dialogue from random NPCs whom one couldn't be blamed for wanting to kill rather than listen to. Unfortunately, one of these NPCs cannot be killed as he is an essential character to the story who, at one point, must be escorted by the player to his destination, making 'Blue Shift' the first 'Half Life' game to feature an escort mission. Expository dialogue, even in excess, can be forgivable if the story is interesting, but here, it just isn't. Again, it's simple and boring.  All of that being said, though, is it really that bad? Sure, the story and the enemies are both overly simplified, but is this really that much of a problem in such a short game? Herein lies my dilemma in determining what I think of this game. Most of my problems with it come from how simple it is, but is simplicity itself necessarily a bad thing? I, for one, am inclined to say no, it's not.  Just to have some semblance of a conclusion, I'll say that if you've recently finished playing 'Half Life' and now you just want another fun romp through the Black Mesa facility as a new character with a new perspective on the Incident, then this game won't disappoint you. However, if you'd prefer a full game and unique experience like 'Half Life' or 'Opposing Force', stay away, as this won't sate you.  2.5/5.",

In this HL game Calhoun(Your security guard character) tries to save his oqn ♥♥♥ rather than going and killing some Epic bosses. They escape eventually from Black Mesa and that's my readers...is what makes it's story a rather dull. Even G-Man isnt interested in Calhoun since he shows up only a few times.

So that saves this game from a 28, average.  TL;DR: Short game where you get to be a security officer during the Black Mesa Incident and you get to fight Xenians and escape.  CLOSING STATEMENT: Given the unfortunate 38 because of unoriginality and just HL gameplay which is fun, mind you.  FINAL VERDICT: 38/49.",
