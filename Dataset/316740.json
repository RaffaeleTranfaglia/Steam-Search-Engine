            "review_text": "I'm really not sure whether I should recomend this game or not. On the one hand this platformer-RPG has some cute graphics (although quite a lot of people won't like how simple and 'empty' they can be) and a great, relaxing soundtrack. There are plenty of levels with ascending difficulty and a huge variety of enemies and bosses -every world, literally, has its own kind of enemies- that throw away tons of loot to collect which then can be used to upgrade weapons or construct different stuff like some very useful teleporters. If you want a relaxing game to play when you have some free time and you find its graphics appealing, then you can give it a try (since it doesn't cost much), but you have to play it on easy or medium at max, cause hard is irritatingly difficult.  Quite disappointingly, hard is the only way to gain achievements and unfortunately it's very difficult and unfair. Platforms tend to get smaller and smaller as you progress and your jumps have to be more and more accurate every time, thus making the last worlds almost impossible to beat, since the controls lack the precission needed to make these jumps and if you press the button a tiny bit longer you fall into the gap and have to start the level all over again, as there's no sign of a checkpoint even on the biggest levels. God knows how many unnecessary and irritating deaths you will have to suffer on your way to beat the game (if your nerves manage to fight it till the end). And since this isn't enough, even these simple graphics can get confusing at times. For example some enemies can be hidden behind a tree or on a platform that's beneath you and you can't see them properly, so if you don't pay much attention you might get hit and fall, which equals to even more unnecessary deaths.  However, the most annoying thing about this game is that you don't expect this kind of difficulty. There are these cute graphics, made by kids, there's also the sounds that make you relax and the first levels are quite easy, too. So you lossen yourself and sit back and then you get suddenly caught off-guard and smacked hard in your face for being such an unwary fool.  So, finally, if you want to have a little fun for some hours or buy something for your kid, you could give this game a try, if nothing else is on your mind, but if you are an achievement hunter that wants every game completed 100%, you should first double-check that you can handle the irritation caused by this game's unfairness, before playing it.",
