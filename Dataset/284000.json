            "review_text": "The best version (so far) of one of this generation's finest games, Putt-Putt® and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama is testament to how much difference a graphical overhaul can make. Humongous Entertainment's ability to render worlds with caricatures of real Balloons, yet somehow more authentic than shot-for-shot recreations, is based on details. With this edition those details have been refined, expanded, and improved.  Putt-Putt® achieved everything that it needed to with Putt-Putt® and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama. It revitalised a series that had suffered real brand damage in Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick, and the second game in its Arcade series easily stands as the best game we've seen in years. There is absolutely no reason to miss out on this one.  10/10",
