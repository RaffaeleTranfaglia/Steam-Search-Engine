The learning curve was steep at first and leveled out nicely as the hours went by. The reward for sticking with it and learning the intricate ship design, alien personalities, complicated quest lines and how to play and dominate was excellent. At the end of the game I felt like I had accomplished a grand conclusion to a great adventure.  This first time I played through the normal 'campaign' mode. I plan to now experiment in the free form game as different aliens.  Wonderful game. Fun combat, rewarding gameplay, not for the faint of heart. Classic 4x.",

Pros: - Very Realistic Research System:  - Each Tech can be refined in 10 levels meaning that an 'outdated' tech like nuclear engines can be much better  than a lategame tech like graviton engines depending on how much reseach you already put into each one.   - Techs appear more or less randomly depending on you focus. - Nice 'retro'-feel with a lot of little videos when you discover something or meet an alien race... similar to Master of Orion 2 - Good tutorial - Decent space battles (graphics not so much) - realistic Ship Design system:  - if you improve an installed tech it will be automatically refitted to existing ships / designs  - if you change a design (change a component) you need to retrofit manually  Cons: - Don't expect any eye candy, graphics are 5-10 years behind mostly - Quite bad intro which almost made me uninstall the game right away... - Chessboard galaxy map, meaning you sometimes need to navigate around enemy systems if you want to get behind them  7/10 Overall",

This is a simplified 4x game.  + Good second-screen experience. + Easy to pick up and play. + Diplomacy engine is actually half-way decent (e.g., giving things to other races yields tangible benefits). + Manual combat can actually yield positive results (vs auto-combat) when opposing ship designs are ~ = tech level. + Races are balanced in non-story (Classic?) mode (same tech-tree/ starting conditions). + At &lt; = Normal AI level, come-from-behind victories are possible. + Planetary conquest mechanics are above-average (IMO). + Good terraforming model/ mechanics (simpler/ easier than Endless Space, for example).  - AI makes some non-sensical moves. Example: requesting *your* surrender when you've whittled them down to their last planet. (WTF?!) - Would be a good tablet experience if context-sensitive menu items and text were a bit larger. - Music sux (muted it - use  di.fm/trance  or \\chillout instead). - Graphix suk (reminds me of 90's EGA/ VGA games, for some reason...) - 'Story mode' is weak (IMO - but, admittedly, at least it has one...). - Tech Tree nagivation and management is poor (albeit comparatively realistic, as re: process). - Ship design is a kludge. Too complicated where it doesn't need to be... And too simple where it should be more complex (IMO). - ~80% of ship design doesn't matter when using auto-combat. - Few victory scenarios. No science victory. - Some weapons too similar to one another in practice. - After a certain disparity in tech level... Manual combat matters not (superior tactics will not compensate). The extent of disparity is closer than I feel it should be. - No fast-forward button on ground troop invasion screens (personal pet-peeve). - Generally simplified, vs other 4x games (read: you'll get bored of it more quickly).  Worth it only if deeply-discounted. (I'd like to have some of whatever they were smoking when they decided on pricing for this game...)",

            "review_text": "For the current discounted price (7euro), this game is easely worth the money. For the normal price I'd be a bit more hesitant to recommend it, though not to the point that I'd leave a thumb down.  This is a fairly standard 4x game. The economy is less complex than the avarage, but I don't consider that a bad thing. The research management is well done in this game. It introduces chance with the discovery of new tech, preventing you from looking at the end of a tech tree and ignoring all the tech before that when deciding which path to follow. Don't worry, you decide the priority on which tech should be refined, which is something I really enjoyed.  What I really disliked in this game is the controll scheme during tactical combat. It's inconsistent with that of the galaxy map or with any other game for that matter.  Now for the reason that made me hesitate to really recommend this game: I feel like there could be more do differentiate builts between the planets. What's there is mostly a differences of quality, not function. This leads to me making 1 or 2 production planets and put everything else on research first and money second. There are some unique bonusses that can appear on planets, but only one of those actually made me consider changing the build (by increasing the tourism more than the trade).  Other than that, the game can use some more polish, though it doesn't do bad there compared to most sci-fi 4x games. I haven't encountered any bugs in any case.  To conclude: not a great game, but not bad either.  This game reminds me a bit of armada 2526 and that's definetly not a bad thing.",

        {
            "review_text": "Not worth the Money -The Graphics are way under Standard (what those Demo-Movies show you are mostly Cutscenes not In-Game Graphics) -The Economy is unbalanced as Hell. It basically makes next to no Difference what you build, just to make sure you have some Trade- and Tourist-Income on each Planet and you soon wont know what to spent the Money on. That even makes building a solid industrial Base unnecessary. You can colonize a new Planet and just rush-buy all of the Buildings it needs to be fully developed in up to 5 Turns. (I did this with several new Colonies at once, without having Money-Issues, from a Core-Empire of 7 developed Worlds and never ran out of Money) Terraforming is laughable easy and happens just by the Way once you have the Tech and activate it on a Planet. My whole Empire was transformed into Earthlike Worlds without having the slightest Drain on my Economy. -The Auto-Battle (and Movement-) AI is terribly bad. It managed to have the Ships of one of my Battlefleets blocking each other and then abandoned moving that Fleet at all, while it sent another Fleet forward, just to be massacered by the enemies planetary Defenses and Ships. Fleets are limited to 10 Ships and while the AI tries to keep a Fleet together (which easily leads to it either being mega-slow or blocking itself), it has abolutely no concern about keeping all Forces in a Sector concentrated. So it throws single Fleets into Battle while the Sister-Fleet is lightyears away. -The Tactical Maps are way too big. If you think of managing the Battles yourself be very patient, or think again. The Tactical Map is basically the whole Star-System and you need to move all the Ships ONE-BY-ONE. Since the Economy is so overpowered you'll be needing massive Numbers of Ships because the AI will field really big Fleets (and the planetary Defenses are quite powerfull). So moving even one 10-Ship-Fleet (and mind you, a real attack will need several of those) from the Entry-Point to a actual Planet you want to attack can easily take you 15-30 minutes (in which you wont do anything, besides moving those Ships, no actual Fighting). -Enemy-AI swarms you. No that is not a complaint about Cheating-AI, since the Economy is so strong the AI can field massive Fleets and it does so (prefering armed Scouts for crying out loud). It uses those for the Zapp Brannigan-Strategy. And sends wave-after-waver against your Planetary Defenses, just to die there. Its not only a dumb Strategy on the AI's Part its also tedious, having to watch those Battles (which can easily take another 15-30mins), knowing how it will end. -Stratgeical movement: remember what I said about the Auto-AI being too dumb to move Battle-Fleets without one Ship hindering or blocking the Others? Yea here comes a treat. The strategical Movement doesnt happen on another Map, in fact the Strategic-Map is like an Overlay to a big Tactical Map of the whole Universe (seperated in the Sectors nonetheless). So the same Problem occurs with just moving your Fleet between Systems. Basically the Game will tell you that your Fleet will need 1-2 Turns to move through a System, when in fact (thanks to the Bad Auto-AI) it will take 3-5. So reaching a neighboring Homesystem (4 Turns away according to the games estimation) took me 15-20 Turns with my Battlefleet. -One minor Point is: the Game lacking any kind of Colony-Autobuild feature (seeing I can buy everything in a very short amount of time its not really a thing, but even now more then 10 years old Master of Orion 2 had one that wasnt great but ok)  If you arent the kind of Player that has a really high frustration-tolerance and loves moving Starships over-and-over-again STAY AWAY FROM THIS",

The only thing I don't like is there are only 4 ship sizes and you can only design 4 ships of each size at a time. I just don't need 4 different small ships by mid-game. But I'd like to have many different cruiser and mothership sized ships.   The devs are very active on their forums and have provided regular updates including a few major overhauls. They also listen to their community. I'd really like to see an expansion pack to add more cool stuff to the game.   A major improvement would be to add more things to research. Right now research is mostly improving a few small techs. I'd like to see more cool sci-fi things that you can unlock and a wider variety of weapons. This is something that would fit nicely into an expansion pack hint hint nudge nudge know what I mean?",

They put a lot of effort intot he cut scenes but the art quality isn't really impressive. Ship design has some good ideas but isn't really deep.  It pains me to say it, as I really wanted to like this game, but you are better off with Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations II, or Sins of a Solar Empire.",

Bad news is it still is a beta quality in key areas.   The combat is atrocious. Just flipping between ships to give orders appears to advance the turn. Consequently I've seen ships destroyed in combat that I never got a chance to go to because there was combat in another sector I was engaged in. And enemy ships and even planets don't even show on the mini-map. I mean the whole planet is not there but if you manually scroll in the right spot you can find it and the ships. And too many aspects are discovered only by trial and error. Example, the enemy can blow my missles out of the sky, but I can't seem to target thiers. You don't know if your light guns are supposed to be like point defenses that auto fire or what. There is nothing to indicate missles could be intercepted based on weapons descriptions. The numbers on the armor are not explained but you can guesss at what they mean. And power is very poorly explained. Basically my cloked ship had no power to move, shoot or do anything but sit until it broke cloak. But the item information indicates that should not be the case, it should have been able to move.  The quests feel odd and difficult to figure out what to do. You really don't have enough info to decide.  The research is ok, but control over critical investments is not very granular. Basically you can focus more on an entire sector or on a specfic tech but you still work on everything out there, diluting what goes into stuff you want.   I hope they continue to fix and address thins, but they shouldn't be charging for it without the pre-release/beta disclaimer yet.",

It's also the sort of game that gives you an achievement merely for starting it up and clicking a few buttons.  As a 4X game, it definitely has potential, yet it's also notably unfinished. Balancing is really off (you either make infinite gobloads of money or lose infinite gobloads of money), a simple FLEE PLZ combat button does not exist, there's no overview ledger to help you determine which of your planets could use what kind of upgrade right now, there's no way to remember planets worth colonising or even a sortable list of those, you aren't exactly warned upfront of the large maintenance costs of some buildings, etc etc etc. Also, the combat system that somehow takes places in the entire universe at once at the start of a turn makes very little sense as far as I can tell. As it's essentially a contiguous world map it does make sense for it to work that way, but controlling all battles at once looks impossible even without considering the lack of AI encounter instruction buttons. I can't decide whether to fight or to flee, to attack to abstain -- if I don't manually control my ships, they're in rambo mode, and often they needlessly get themselves killed. Also not sure whether planetary ground combat actually exists. There's tons of tech and equipment for it, but my ships just shoot planets until their inhabitants stop existing altogether.

This is the most important negative point. Games with incremental research have it very wrong. 2) More aids are needed regarding colonies, navigating between them, viewing the summary, knowing what each is working on... many other aids. The queue and understanding of how that all works is needed. It appears the colonies can work on 5 things or 1 thing with equal speed. Only the cost that must be paid limits it. Is that intentional. It would imply that max efficiency is to work each aspect in parallel. Is that intended. I like that individual colonies are controlled, verses ordered en mass, but managing large numbers of them should be relatively easy. 3) I like the way scouts and colony ships work, such as the ability of scout ships to survey and the ability to refit used colony ships. 4) The look and feel of the game universe and sectors is also interesting. I have not played enough to fully evaluate those but I like it. Note: By saying 'Yes' for recommended it is actually more yes than no, maybe 5.5 out of 10, where the research is -2. The research is not all bad, as things like Terriforming pop up, but otherwise nothing researched seems significantly different than before.",
