            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game but I just couldn't play it. The controls are horrible. Its a point and click game without the pointing and clicking because they force you to use keyboard controls for things that could easily, and much more fluently, be done with the mouse. At many points the mouse just did not work which seemed to be because i had the mouse at the wrong point on the screen. However since I didn't have a mouse pointer present at the time it was impossible to tell this.   There is also a very limited option screen which only features volume controls. There are no resolution or graphic options at all so you have to play on the settings they give you.   However if you can deal with these issues the game does have some redeeming factors. Although I didn't play long enough to see much of it the story did look to be interesting. The characters were designed very well and had great voices work. But the best factor about this game was the graphics style. The settings all looked amazing with vibrant colours.   Overall if you can overlook the horrible controls and other issues then you could play this game, if it was even just for the story. However I can't recommend this due to it being impossible to play for me personally.   TheIronicGamers rating system",
