            "review_text": "DLC Quest is an amusing game that rightly pokes fun at the gaming industry while at the same time being a genuinely fun platformer.  The game is divided into two parts. First part is easy and won't really challenge too much, except maybe finding all the hidden items. The second part has a moderate challenge that adds wall-jumping (which Player must earn by getting the DLC), spikes and a hilarious ending. It's great to play a game that makes you laugh most of the way through. Also, for 100% achievement hunters, this game's list of achievements is short and reasonable.  Perhaps not worth full price since the playing time is about 3 hours, but recommended whenever on sale.  EDIT: changed 'The game is broken' to 'The game is divided' ...",

At the start you can't even go to the left, you don't have animations, no sound and you can't pause the game. But later you can do everything. From getting a hat to shooting everybody to death.  The humor in the game is just brilliant. I love it. There a signs everywhere that tell you what to do. So for example there is a dead end in a cave, so there is a sign: 'Dead end.' Just next to it: 'No seriously, go back.'  The people to talk to in the game, or even a horse, are also quite hilarious. One person sais: 'I don't have anything relevant to say at this time. I'll play an important role soon, but you  don't  know that yet.'  The cutscene at the beginning of the game is so bad it's really hilarious. The story of it. Haha. No words.    There is a lot more humor in this game. But you have to figure that out yourself.   Also, don't murder the sheep for no good reason.",

            "review_text": "CAUTION: This game is only actually worth it when it goes on sale because it is a short and easy game, but it still serves as fairly decent satire.  There really is not much I can say about the gameplay, replayability or graphics because the game doesn't need to look amazing considering it's puny length and you would already know what to expect from the gameplay. You cannot die, there's close to no physics and unlike the Stanley Parable; when you replay this game, you will get all the same things. However, this game does give an important message about DLC overkill in games. In most games, you will see pre-order bonuses, retailer exclusives, overpriced and stupid DLCs which don't really enhance the game so much as to justify the purchase of DLCs, they seem to serve as novelties nowadays.   This is what makes this game important. Remember the days around the PS2 era where if you bought a game, you got the whole game and not just parts of it which will be filled in with DLC. That made games more exciting and more worth paying for. That all changed with the dawn of expansion packs for the big MMOs and Horse Armour (I'm looking at you, Oblivion!) but it isn't entirely for the worst from what I have seen. The DLCs for Saints Row: The Third have added many hours to the game and are of decent quality rather than being lousy 20 minute long stories which I thought was cool.   The only real issue I have with the game is the fact that I, and many others already know that a lot of DLC is pointless on the PC unless a game doesn't have mod support and on PC, mod support is always expected and always demanded for it to constitute 'a real PC game' which is fair enough knowing that mods are changing the face of the games industry, but this satire is very relevant for consoles, which don't have mods, so console gamers rely upon the release of overpriced DLC to get new stuff in their game.  It's good for a laugh, the platforming is fairly easy and it can be quite entertaining, just don't buy it for full price.",

You unlock parts of the game by buying DLCs ... but you can relax, it is in game with the coins you collect. While the gameplay and style is easy and the graphics are really simple I would say this game was fun to play. There is a lot of stuff to discover even though it adds little to the amount of playtime you get out of this game. While it mimics a lot of what was and is going on in the gaming industry it managed to do it as a nice platformer. However, because it adds very little it does not shine in anything but references. So while I do recommend getting it you cannot await something spectacular. It is there for casual fun and that is what is to be expected.",

After all transforming a joke into a game doesn't improve the quality of the joke; rather in this case, transform said joke into meaningless blabber that comes off as repetitive and obnoxious. Gameplay itself is lacklustre and generally shoddy. As for graphics, well retro graphics are no excuse for unimaginative and ugly design. We've seen many games use retro style successfully: Hotline Miami, Evoland, and Cave Story to name a few, yet DLC Quest fails to hit the mark. Perhaps the only redeemable aspect is it's chip-tune music.   Had I reviewed this game years ago upon first playing it, I would have given it a positive review, but upon looking back, a mixed-negative review is far more appropriate.",

The theme for the Dark World is amazing, I spent some extra time in there just for the sake of the music!  But what really makes this game a must have is the satire of games, DLC, the whole business of games, and all the references to other games and gaming phenomenons!

The humor suffers a good bit from the fact that the game pokes fun at itself in such an in-your-face way, not hinting, but more like telling a joke and announcing when the punchline will come and what it is about. The kind of 'humor' that can sometimes sound more like a sarcastic rant. An NPC saying stuff like 'I'm a filler NPC. I have no purpose.' isn't really funny. Those things make the game look more like an interactive critical essay.  The gameplay logic is more interesting, because it depicts the design flaw of the illusion of choice in an extremely streamlined progression well.  The music is not bad.  So the game itself is mediocre at best AND it is so short that after having bought it for 1 EUR, which is 67% off, I feel that's a bit too much. It has two 'campaigns'. (Not sure whether that was originally the case.) The first one I played through in a bit less than an hour. The second one in 1.2 hours, not with all achievements though.  Some times I came up with better dialogues while playing because they leave so much to be desired. But some dialogue and gameplay is OK; It's not all lackluster. It's just overall an extremely mediocre experience; nothing memorable. The best thing is, as I mentioned, the speedy menu navigation, and the equally crisp and fun controls.",

Much as the game itself is only £2 (65p at time of writing) the fact is that without charging actual money for DLC the game loses any real investment a player could have in the satire it's peddling because there's an absence of the actual tangible effect of the relatable concept; but it can't do that because doing so would undermine its stated political standpoint.

It's also incredibly funny and just a joy to play. Particularly if you're aware of the state the gaming industry is with it's DLC Armageddon which I imagine you all are.   The game itself is an 8-bit style platformer with smooth controls and blah, blah, blah. There's nothing to fault the game with really, at all in fact. The music is classic 8-bit styled and only gets annoying when you miss a single coin somewhere in the Live Freemium campaign and spend an eternity tracking it down. I recommend you be thorough in the winter section, do that and you should be golden. The voice acting and motion capture could do with some work but otherwise it's a knockout! Seriously though, this game is pure fun from the mountains. Buy it and then forget about it in a few days like every indie game. Unless you have friends to talk about it with and have a debate and/or ♥♥♥♥♥ about the money-grabbing publishers that are constantly finding new petty ways to pinch a pretty penny from your Polly pocket.",

Now you know when they say dont judge a book by its cover well that really doesnt apply here because it literally says it all in the f**king title. You start off as a pleb, scurb little mormon boy named AlecJackSpecticTank who finds himself in a twisted yet literal world of DLC(DonkeysLikeCock). Your best friend is, well the shop. And if thats not sad enough your forced to buy dlc to play the game, even though its not real money/steam wallet money its f**king stupid in my opinon, not to hate or anything. The game is an fast paced Moba that really sets the bars as to what the pc can do, with only like 3 resolutions and like 4 other settings this game really takes advantage of the pcs capability Also did i mention it only lasts liek 30min-1hr. Secondly the gameplay, well there is not much to other than your forced to buy the jump and move LEFT, thats right move left like wtf. If thats not bad enough your better off spending your money on opening a case on csgo or tf2. Even though some may respect it for what it is i think even gaben would agree that this is a -69/100 on the metacritic, not only that but this game makes bad rats look like gta on max settings. This game is so BAD i mean gud that it gives autism and up syndrome to every 1-10 ppl, so count your family and divide by 2 x your friends and gabens left nut = your 420% of gettings one of 69 dieseases and disablities. In the end if you made it this far if your thinking of purchasing this game check with Alec Dryer, if you played this game uninstall and become amish, and finallly if your bought this game make sure you thank your fellow peruvian dota player for not laughing at you and always thank shrek and the rat gods for giving you the blessing of slipping on tht D.... for DLC",

Obviously that was Gates-bashing, and this is DLC-bashing; satire tends to reflect whatever the fashion of the public's disdain happens to be. For DLC Quest, their attempt to both mock and highlight the major game company's use of DLC to extract more money out of the end user is apt and well thought out.  The first part of the game is an outright taunt at the concept; starting with no ability to attack, animate, jump, even move left, you need to use the in-game coins to purchase any of these things as DLC. From there the basic abilities become available and thus establish the foundation of the game, you need to return to the seller to get more DLCs in order to progress. The more stages of the game you complete, the more DLCs you're likely to need to continue further. A second part becomes available when you complete the first game, which is designed to be more like an actual game, complete with a story, a collection of stock characters, a bad guy and indeed more DLCs. I have to give the guys credit for making a semi-coherant storyline and plot progression through this part of the game and the jokes are good, but the game brakes the fourth wall way too much, which I don't mind in the first part - it makes the most sence there.  4 out of 5.

The gameplay is simple and works fine, but it simply has no depth, and gets monotonous very quickly.",

Besides the idea of buying DLCs, the game itself is well-made. The control feels fluent, and the graphic and soundtrack combine to produce an 8-bit oldschool style. And the final boss battle is creative. I'll not spoil it here, but it also involves DLC, and is fought in a way I've never seen before.  + a game about games + fluent control + oldschool graphic and sound + humor - 1st campaign is too short - would be better if the Map DLC actually gives a map 9 out of 10, marvelous.",

Even just going through both parts to beat the game is worth the $1 I paid for the game, but the extra hours are from trying to get the last two achievements that involve beating the game under a certain amount of time which still has me going at this game.   It's pretty funny as to how the NPCs interact with your character, how it's a satire, and how it mocks a lot of things in other games that require DLCs. Like how right at the beginning of the game you have to buy a DLC (with in game coins, not real money) in order to jump and move left.

DLC Quest is a retro-style platformer that makes fun of the casual gimmicks of video games, as well as DLC, which is what this game is all about. You obviously don't need to pay real world money for the DLC. Instead you collect coins to use as in-game currency. There can be DLC for almost anything, like controls, pause menu, and other things that don't need DLC at all. However most of the DLC is basically add-ons and things to progress through the story. You can also find hidden DLC packs to collect and then purchase to use. DLC can be toggled at the DLC purchase menu.  Off the subject of DLC, I would like to talk about how DLC Quest makes fun of generic video game mechanics. I loved how there was a DLC called 'Remove Ads' that replaces the Buy Soda signs, as they are in the form of adverts, even though they were never advertising anything real ever. Another funny moment is a place called 'Allan please add zone name' which starts off as a blank space past the Dark Zone, but getting the correct DLC for it makes it a real map with real everything, but keeps the name for some reason.  I loved DLC Quest, it was a quick and very easy game to play, and I enjoyed the comedic events that go along with it. I give this game 8/10.",

Run around and collect coins to unlock features, which enables you to run around in some new places to collect coins, which allows you to ad nauseum until you unlock the ending. Coincidentally, it services as a weak critique of metroidvanias and the constructed nature of progression/gatekeeping in games, but it doesn't have much to say about any of this besides ZING! GOTCHA!   The controls are mediocre, the platforming is uninteresting and unchallenging, the exploration is tedious, the dialogue is sometimes funny but usually simply extant, and the game is one of those games that I sincerely regret having played. It's in that small pantheon of experiences that seemed like a good idea at first but then were just not, and which I will sincerely regret for the rest of my days. I loathed this experience so much that I would be happy to pay Going Loud Studios another three dollars if they could wipe the memory of having played their extremely boring game from my brain.",

DLC Quest is a retro-style platformer that makes fun of the casual gimmicks of video games, as well as DLC, which is what this game is all about. You obviously don't need to pay real world money for the DLC. Instead you collect coins to use as in-game currency. There can be DLC for almost anything, like controls, pause menu, and other things that don't need DLC at all. However most of the DLC is basically add-ons and things to progress through the story. You can also find hidden DLC packs to collect and then purchase to use. DLC can be toggled at the DLC purchase menu.  Off the subject of DLC, I would like to talk about how DLC Quest makes fun of generic video game mechanics. I loved how there was a DLC called 'Remove Ads' that replaces the Buy Soda signs, as they are in the form of adverts, even though they were never advertising anything real ever. Another funny moment is a place called 'Allan please add zone name' which starts off as a blank space past the Dark Zone, but getting the correct DLC for it makes it a real map with real everything, but keeps the name for some reason.  I loved DLC Quest, it was a quick and very easy game to play, and I enjoyed the comedic events that go along with it. I give this game 8/10.",

For those that don't quite get it, this game is a joke about the gaming industry and how DLC has gotten to be more and more rediculous over the years. I love a good pun especially in game form, anyway on to the review in 3 catagories.  Gameplay: The gameplay, man what can I say about this... ok so basically you start out with a normal cutscene. Bad guy comes in and kidnaps the princess, ok cliche but whatevs. From here you have to find DLC scattered throughout the world and then spend your hard earned couins to unlock the DLC you aquire. These things inlcude, the ability to walk left, jumping, animation, sexy swimwear, etc. In the end it's a good laugh.  Graphics: Good ol' 8bit, nothing wrong with a little retro from time to time. Looks good, animations runs smoothly (if you've unlocked the animation DLC that is).  Sound: Fun soundtrack that goes with the rediculous theme of the game. The sounds for movment and attacking are not bad as well and fit in with the 8bit art style. (Unless of course you don't unlock the sound effects DLC in which case you wont hear them.)  Overall I would definately recomend this to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10",

However I did get the game into a unwinnable state the first time around so I had to replay the entire thing from the beginning which sucked. Apparently this can be done a couple of different ways.  The expansion is what really soured me on this game. Yes its free but...It felt cobbled together and unfocused in comparison to the original. Longer but only by padding and adding LOTS of backtracking. Less jokes, more game...[weak platforming, coin collecting]  I'm stuck between reccomending and not reccomonding but with the retail price in mind and the lackluster second half I'll have to give this a no.
