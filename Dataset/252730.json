    "description": "The original PC sensation that started it all! We've brought it back in all its virginal glory! The world was a much simpler place in 1995. The kids were listening to the grunge, the first test-tube gorilla was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, and a little trivia game called YOU DON’T KNOW JACK took the interactive CD-ROM trivia game show...",

            "review_text": "To make this clear, this is not for the 2011 game. Instead, it covers the original 1995 game. For those that are not familiar with the series, how the game works is that the host will read a question and give four possible answers. If you think that you know the answer, buzz in and answer. While this sounds like your typical trivia game, this is far from the truth.  One thing unique to the game is that the players receive screws. If a question appears that it looks like another player does not know, you can use the screw to “screw your opponent” forcing them to answer. If somebody has the lead, using them is a good way to try to catch up. However, if they know the answer, not only will they gain money, but also you will screw yourself and lose money instead. They may be screws, but that risk make them double-edged sword instead.  Another difference from a traditional trivia game is that the host wants action. If one player has a big lead but nobody tries to answer the question, the host will not be happy. When that happens, the host will comment on the leader’s cowardice and gets the audience involved. How can there be an audience in a video game is a mystery. When they get involved, they will say, “Don’t be a wimp!” forcing the leader to answer anyway. If you are trailing and know this, intentionally not answering is both advantageous as well as funny watching the leader’s reaction.  Visually, this is the game’s biggest weakness. Most of the time, the only things to see are some faded text, the current question, and the player scores. The only real animation worth watching is seeing what happens to your icon when the score changes. While this sounds strange, a blind person can play this game with a person that can see without any problems. With almost nothing to see, not even the host, there is little reason to watch the screen. Since this is a trivia game, making a stage like in  Jeopardy!  or  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  would have made the game more interesting to look at.  However, this is not a game about the visuals. Being that this was one of the first CD games, they crammed it with tons of dialog. That dialog is what makes the game fun. The host always has something interesting to say throughout the question. Even with the categories for the questions, it gets you interested in what it might be. In one case, in the category is “The Fruits in Your Looms”, they ask, “Which of these fruits derives from the Aztec word meaning testicle?” Just the fact that they would create questions using such seemingly unrelated items makes each of the questions interesting to hear. In the case of the mentioned question, the correct answer is avocado. When it comments about it and guacamole can make people burst out in laughter. When the comments are strong enough, do not be surprised if a break is required to recover from the laughter.  Considering that the game has hundreds of questions like the one above, this makes a great party game. Just remember that the game really works only when played with others. Since the game offers no computer opponents, it is not the same without live competition. While the humor is there, without competition, the game does not have the same appeal.  There is one final thing to remember. When the game wants you to type in your answer, tell the game, “F%¢&amp; Y@#”. All three players should do this. You will love how the host reacts. What the host does to you, not so much.",

            "review_text": "While this was never the most graphically beautiful game of its time, it was originally made in Flash. In its day, it was one of the greatest games of all time, purely for the sound and music. The action 'behind the scenes' in terms of audio made this game visceral. Streaming it over a 56K dialup connection was laboriously slow but worth the wait. Later gaming consoles brought about titles like 'Buzz' for the Sony Play Station. But this was the grand daddy of them all. From the host who made you feel like crap if you got an answer wrong, to the ability to 'Screw' your apponents, this was one of the best party games available in the 90's. The best experiences were when you played with friends, though it does have a single player option. The mini games like 'Jack Attack' and 'The Gibberish Question' kept the gameplay moving along in a way that you couldnt wait to see what the next category was. Great Game :)",

This trivia game is quick to jump into and just as easy to enjoy; whether you're looking for a quick time killer or want to match wits with friends for an hour YDK delivers.  YDK J will be a bit more difficult for especially young folks, this game arrived in the mid 90s and it shows. Expect lots of classic 70s and 80s material to appear alongside the then current pop-culture of the 90s.  Solidly entertaing game with lots of fun tongue-in-cheek risque humor.",

However--on a side tangent--one thing that gets me between older and newer versions (like YDKJ 2011) is that 20 years ago they were somehow able to make a game with random questions every match and yet for some reason are unable to accomplish this with newer games, which are the same questions every match, every round. The only disappointment with this title, really, is that everyone has to huddle around a keyboard. Basically newer games with their multiplayer support and this game's randomization every play would be aces.",

As it is, I can't answer 20-year-old US trivia questions and the US voices don't have any nostalgic charm for me (they're even pretty boring - Paul Kaye, aka Dennis Pennis, brought tons of charm and flavour to the UK version, I would guess by improvising).
