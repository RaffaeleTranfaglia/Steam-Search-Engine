No other arcade racing game has such awesome feel and handling, at least no other racing game that i know of (and i know a lot). Especially in multiplayer mode this game is addictive.  In order to play FOUC you need to install Microsoft GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. You should be able to install WINDOWS LIVE by doubleclicking the exe [LiveUpdateLauncher] located in the game directory. The game directory is usually [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Flatout Ultimate Carnage]  BTW: We are still playing it online via 'Games for Windows Live'. The Microsoft announcement from June 2014 that 'GFWL' will be closed at 1st July was false. Microsoft told us that 'GFWL' will not close anytime soon.",

I went from this to Burnout for a minute and it felt like going from driving hyper-fast tanks to toy cars.   Here's my complaints: -The color pallette is straight out of Quake. Wish it was a little less muddy.  -The music is awful. I wish there was an option to change it out. If you like radio hard rock you'll like this. I do not.  -It's sometimes difficult to tell what piece of debris is going to turn into a major wreck vs act like flying scraps of paper. Nearly everything in this game is destructible and debris stays around, which is fun but sometimes the physics are unpredictable. -Games for Windows Live. If the service is dead, why does it still sign me out of my Xbox when I play this game?  Other than those complaints, I really enjoy this game. I only tend to like arcade-y racers, like Burnout and Project Gotham. This fits nicely in there. I bought 15 games or so recently and this has gotten the most play.   ",

            "review_text": "It’s the spiritual successor of Rush. It’s Mario Kart for almost grown up adults. It’s the racing game for people who find continually trying to drive the perfect lap in Forza or GT tedious yet kind of sort of actually secretly like it. I am a Forza/GT fan who typically despises games like Need for Speed, but I loved this. There are some annoying things like Microsoft basically holding you hostage nearly forcing you to make an account in order to play the damn game. Or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port aspect – all menus have prompts like press ○A and the mouse curser isn’t even supported even when friggen annoying Microsoft menus pop up in which you really need a damn mouse. On the plus side it supports non-Xbox controllers. That being said, it’s really a decent game. The racing aspect is super fun and it controls well although there’s obviously a bit of plasticity as it’s a smash up racing game. You’re encouraged to run into other players and take high risks in order to get more boost as opposed to just straight racing, so go ahead, have another one and drive sloppy. There’re plenty of upgrades for cars albeit not as in depth or complex as Forza or GT. There’s a good amount of cars as well so you won’t get bored; there’s always something to look forward to. And to top it all off there’s a ridiculous arcade and mini-game section where you’ve got to do silly things like make the biggest crash and fling your driver as far and high as possible. This section is particularly fun when you are too high/drunk to actually race. In summary, despite it being poorly ported and having Microsoft’s greasy finger prints all over it, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and ridiculous racer. Having not played any of the other ones in the series, it seems like Carnage is all you need. Apparently it has virtually all the features of 1 &amp; 2 and more and it doesn’t blow barnyard animals like 3. Cheers. ",

However I have a few specific problems, firstly being the reset input. In races it can theoretically be used at any time, however in derbies it takes upwards of 15 seconds to reset after being flipped or getting stuck on other cars, leaving plenty of time for other competitors to smash into you multiple times. I was hoping this would have been an improvement from FlatOut 2, but it wasn't.  Secondly, health seems to have been decreased, or smashing and crashing deals more damage. I'm not sure which one it is, but it's too simple to wreck an opponent. In 4 lap races on wide and open tracks, a third and sometimes a half of the racers are wrecked long before the race is finished.  Finally, this game is way too easy. The improvements made were necessary, but it's also taken away the challenge of the game. I'm halfway through the Race Series with 100,000CR, enough to buy a new car and all the upgrades with 40,000CR in the pocket. With health decreases and damage increases, I average around 15 slams and up to 3 wrecks per race, while finishing in 1st place and 10 seconds ahead of 2nd place, and with the rewards money is very easy to accumulate.  FlatOut 2 was my childhood so it's great fun to play through these games again. I'm thoroughly impressed by Ultimate Carnage and will continue to play it for hours upon hours, and others should too. Recommended for mindless smashing, crashing, explosions and complete destruction, this game doesn't disappoint.",

They fixed water, tuned picture saturation, removed bad post effects, added normal mapping, improved overall detailing of the original tracks... and it looks seriously good.  The bad thing is that the core gameplay and physics are taken directly from FO2, which is boring BurnOut wannabe (unlike the original game). It seems like they actually tuned handing a bit, so the car is an actual car now and not a paper box on a wheel, but I bet it will get worse as you progress.   Honestly, I didn't play much, just a few cups, but it's just enough to say that the game is better than FO2, but still not good enough to get positive. It's funny how this game has 83 versus 92 of FO2. I guess that is related to GFWL used in this game, but you can create local account and I don't really care about multiplayer.

But this game IS Flatout 2 with much...much.... better graphics. Not kidding. Same cars, same tracks... same people flying out the windows (I love that), just much prettier. Also they changed the soundtrack. Speaking of soundtrack the Flatout UC songs are nowhere as good as the old ones: I just turn the audio down and hum Alkaline Trio's Oh, mercy me while barreling through the Flatout UC's many detailed tracks. There are single races, cups, demo derbys, online play and even challenges involving hurling the driver from the car for distance, In the end, this game offers a whole lot of races, tracks, upgrades and cars to tear around in.   If you have a top notch PC this is among the best racers the PC platform has to offer. If your PC is aging a bit you may want to download the less resouce intense Flatout 2.",

The biggest change was more drivers on tracks and greater graphical details. I would recommend Ultimate Carnage to everybody who loved the first two games and to people who just like to destroy stuff and enjoy one of the best PC racing games. It runs flawlessly even when it is, like I said, double port. Too bad it is the last FlatOut to this date.  NO! Just forget that there was anything like Flatout 3.

All the tracks are full of destructible objects and they look different in the start and in the end, when all the rails, trash and destroyed cars of opponents cover the track. Plus the soundtrack ♥♥♥♥ing rocks.",
