Different bosses and bonus stages break the continuity that would make the game too repetitive. Multiple game modes are also offering a good replay value. Very nice game.",

            "review_text": "GAMEPLAY: You know how many Breakout/Arkanoid games can be described as 'It's Arkanoid but with X.' Well this game is like Arkanoid but with X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D and J. A very inventive spin on the genre. How inventive? How about boss battles that require different strategies to beat. Or bricks that are cells and multiply via mitosis. Or bricks that take off like bottle rockets when you hit them. Or....  MUSIC: The creators of this game were clearly fans of Daft Punk. The soundtrack is =SUPERB=. This is the Daft Punkiest game soundtrack that doesn't actually have music by Daft Punk. And I mean that in the best way.  GRAPHICS: The graphics presentation is very polished. Stylized 3D backgrounds compliment the 2D gameplay action in the foreground. Between each round the camera moves around or through the 3D background for another viewpoint. The only drawback here is sometimes the ball is difficult to see when the bloomy particle effects are at their most concentrated.  If you like old-school breakout action with a modern shine and everything but the kitchen sink added to it, get this game!  Disclaimer; I am only a couple of hours into the game at this point. There may also be a kitchen sink.",

            "review_text": "Shatter is about bouncing a projectile between your paddle/ship/etc. and various blocks you need to break to progress to the next stage. Power-ups occasionally drop from said blocks, and there are different varieties. That's all pretty basic. What sets Shatter apart is the beautiful backgrounds and setpieces in the game, as well as the unique features it adds. The most obvious is your ability to push away or draw in objects as you play, including the ball, the pickups, the fragments (points), and sometimes the blocks themselves. At first it's merely a nice feature for adjusting the path of the ball mid-flight, but later it becomes necessary to really properly progress through the game. Fortunately, Shatter does a good job of ramping up the necessity of using these features, so by the time you truly need to it's natural.  Another somewhat unusual feature is the concept of boss fights, not totally unseen in a block-breaker clone but rarely done well. Shatter does it quite well, I'm happy to say, and thanks to the aforementioned beautiful design of the game the bosses are visually satisfying in addition to challenging. The mechanics of each boss fight are similar but not identical, making you target specific vulnerable points while dodging whatever attacks the boss is capable of. The fights are also spaced evenly between the levels, giving you a nice change of pace to break up any monotony that might set in.  Difficulty wise, the game is not easy but not especially hard for an experienced player... at least when it comes to just surviving the game. If you want to rack up the high scores, well that will take some serious skill. The game's scoring system is simple on paper but hard to master, relying on a multiplier which increases with gathered fragments but decreases for any blocks which slip past your paddle or make contact with it (yes, they can do that). It provides a reason to replay the game for people who are all about the high scores, made even more attractive with the game virtually taunting you by showing you higher scores from any of your friends who also play the game. Devious, but effective.  Beyond all that the game is quite solid, featuring some unique types of blocks, interesting mechanics, varied arena shapes including circular, and a fun bonus round after each area where you have to keep three projectiles in the arena for as long as possible. I also really have to compliment the game's music, which is both fitting and kind of catchy. If you have any love for Kavinsky or Daft Punk you'll probably like the soundtrack.  Shatter is a fresh take on an old formula, one that adds some interesting new concepts without straying too far from the basic idea. It hits that perfect line of 'easy to pick up yet difficult to master', and provides something you can either spend hours on or just pick up for a few minutes at a time.",

There are also a lot of extra modes to play besides the main campaign part of the game. The only thing I disliked about the game, was the fact that whenever you broke objects, the debris would fall down and hit your paddle. This made the paddle fall out of the playing area for a couple seconds, making you are unable to hit your ball during that time.",

But the way how this game does this is really good. There are many gamemodes. One of them being the Story mode, the 'main' mode of the game where you can unlock other modes or levels. The game itself is simple, it leads you through several levels, many different. Also boss levels where you fight against big bosses. You have special skills like blowing or shooting. You can also transform your ball into other types with special drops. There are many block types with special skills that you have to destroy like bombs. Also the game has physics! Great physics. I really like it.  I have a lot of fun playing this game. It has a nice futuristic drawing style. Furthermore it has a coop mode for you and your friends. The best about this game is probably the soundtrack. Its produced by someone named Module. A really good electro soundtrack with a lot of different styles.  If you are a brick breaker gamer or simply wanna try retro games again, this is the first you should play! Definitely worth being played! 9/10",

Most notably it actually gives you some control over the ball when it's in the air, which really eliminates a LOT of the frustration of endlessly trying to get that one last damn brick in the level.  The control is by sucking and blowing air from your paddle; you also have to contend with picking up the tons of little bonus items each brick releases, which are even more affected by the air motion. So there's a really interesting thing going on here with pushing a bunch of stuff away from you until you can get the ball stuck behind a bunch of bricks, then ssssuuuuuuucking in all those tasty bonus items, and hopefully getting enough of them to charge up your megablaster that can clear out a significant chunk of the level. Or at least enough to throw some more balls out into the arena. I really like being able to summon multiball any time I like!  Also lots of variety in the levels, some interesting Special Bricks, and the occasional boss. Because EVERY game is made better by bosses, damnit.  I dunno how you'll feel about this if you're a hardcore wall-breaker who lives and dies by finessing the trajectory of their balls. I'm not one of those people. I like flying tiny spaceships through swirling curtains of pink bullets. And this is the first ball-bouncer I may have actually enjoyed playing for every minute of game time in my entire life.",

One of the fundamental alterations to the classic Breakout formula here is having an enhanced influence on the ball's trajectory by means of drawing in and expelling air; abilities that can also be used to scoop up valuable objects and in some cases are mandatory or otherwise handy to use in order to defeat bosses. This is a concept that will probably be welcomed by the majority of players but possibly disliked by some purist veterans.  Another ability that changes things up is a stream of bullets that initially requires charging up and is then unleashed on request in one go to wipe out blocks with ease, helping to prevent the pace of the action and your progress from turning stale. These bullets can also be used to inflict damage upon bosses in addition to striking them at their vulnerable spots with the ball. Another way to expedite the rate of your block-breaking, as well as heighten the challenge is to release multiple balls into concurrent play, thereby giving yourself more things to keep track of and juggle.  While the visuals and sound effects are fantastic, the soundtrack is arguably in a league of its own, consisting of talently crafted melodies with intriguing and imaginative synthesis that warrant the price of this title even if there were no gameplay content. All in all, a fantastic and energetic package for a modest price.",

Highly recommend Shatter for the arcade-fan in you, and also too boost your friends-only-scoreboard-domination ego in you.",

            "review_text": "An impressive new design in a traditional game genre. Shatter is basically a brick-breaking game, but filled with brilliant, innovative ideas:  1. You can control the ball to some extent by pressing and holding left/right mouse button for pulling/pushing the ball to/from your board, which make the game course more controllable and less frustrating, especially in the case where only a few bricks left on the screen that are extremely hard to hit.  2. You can collect the energy awarded after hitting bricks and then using them to your advantages by triggering a bullet time or by protecting your board against falling bricks, and sometimes these abilities are essential for winning certain levels.  3. The bricks are of various types, such as stationary bricks, freely movable bricks, partially fixed bricks, and bricks that fix or moves the other adjacent bricks, and they moves on a physical and dynamic basis.  4. There is also a boss fight at the end of each stage. Each time you face a different boss with a very unique moving pattern and vulnerability. Apart from these creative points, the level design is also excellent: the time and difficulty for each of the levels are managable and never reach the threshold for being annoying or tendious, making you always want 'one more turn'. The visual and sound effects are good, both in terms of aesthetics and game-playing. This game is a must for anyone who likes this genre of games, even at the original price. For other players, trying Shatter when it is in discount would not disappoint you.",

And then you have a modernday arkanoid with a couple of nods to Geomtry Wars but a nuanced perfectly controlled arcade score chaser which allows you to tactically push and pull the 'ball' midflight, add risk/reward by lobbing in multiple balls to the arena and strategically decide when to unleash the powerup for maxium effect. There's a lot going on, but it never feels the wrong side of overwhelming and as the best arcaders do - gives you an immensely satisying feeling of control and progression.  Defintely recommended.",
