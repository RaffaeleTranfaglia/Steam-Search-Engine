It can certainly be challenging, and not all of that is fair- touching the outer walls kills you instantly, and enemies love to kick you into them. Overall, though, it's just simple fun. My only problem is with the sound: the music needs to be turned down and the enemies be given audible footsteps, I can't count how many time an enemy snuck up behind me while I was dealing with the ones in front of me.",

There's nothing people like better on tv than a show that has a plasma gun armed contestant placed on a electrified walled maze, filled with killer kung fu robots, and, basically, act like pac man.",

Consider this a playable music video and the $1 price tag pays for the song you will be listening to while playing.  It's FPS pacman and it's just a blast to play.  Would love to see DLC add more songs and levels at $1 for each batch.",

You could win money after each match and use that money to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, character upgrades, and power ups you can use for the next match. Maybe even custom weapons on the Steam workshop that other players make. You could even make a shop that sells the weapons that players downloaded from the workshop. Finally steam cards and achievements wouldn't hurt.",
