            "review_text": "I've known and loved this game for years, but unfortunately this is a lazy port. This 'Steam Edition' doesn't have changes in graphics or interface. No mouse support, no key mapping. In the options you can assign commands to said buttons A B X Y R1/R2 L1/L2, even though you're not informed of what joypad you're supposed to use to play this game. If you don't use a joypad, you eventually find out you are stuck with the keyboard arrows and the keys A and Z. If you want a different mapping, you'll have to download a virtual joystick driver.",
