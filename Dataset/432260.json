            "review_text": "*dies once* wow, this game is polished very well. It's really fun. *dies again* the soundtrack is good too, it really fits the game. *dies again* hey look, there's even a shop with a bunch of unlockable balls. I can be a Pokeball! This is great! *dies again* okay..this is only the first level. Maybe I'm missing something. *changes control scheme* there, I'll try the Keyboard. *dies again* on second thought, playing with the mouse is more fun. *changes contrl scheme* okay, let's do this for real. *dies again* ...okay this is a fun game to kill time with, but is it really that difficult?? *40 minutes later* OH MY GOD, I PASSED I- ..one star? One star?? Out of three?? I can totally do better. *repeats death process until 3 star rating achieved*   10/10 would break computer screen again  ====================================================================================  Tiltagon is a great minimalistic marble (because, let's be honest, if I say ball rolling, will you really take this review seriously? ....you probably shouldn't) rolling game, in which you..roll a marble. There are 10 levels (thank god for that..i've only just replaced my computer screen), 36 unlockable 'marbles', and an endless mode with modes Hard and Hard+. This game is very challenging (couldn't you tell?), however it is very well made/polished, and the fitting soundtrack makes it all the more fun to play. It's $2.99, and who doesn't love to kill time by rolling balls (yeah, I said it) down some slippery slopes? Especially when the ball you're rolling could be a Pokeball. 'Nuff said.",
