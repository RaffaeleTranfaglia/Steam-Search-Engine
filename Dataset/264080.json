This game has never been surpassed by any other in terms of how the world is thought through, plot, atmosphere and gameplay.   I know that outside of Russia it was not successful back in 1998, primary because the game was non-format at that time and it was not understood. It was true indie game which came an epoch before these games bacame mainstream. And now, when the time for such games finally came, I am glad to see it republished for wide variety of people.  By the way, I still have soundtracks from Vangers in my playlist.",

            "review_text": "Vangers was the first game I owned that captured my imagination. I played the game extensively in the windows os; I still have the original install disk. Over the years I managed to get it to work on various flavours of the windows os, although in some versions of windows the graphics did not work.  Then I switched to Linux and you can imagine my delight when I found a Linux version of Vangers on Steam!  The Linux version is actually a little bit more difficult to play than the windows version. There is no joystick axis support in the Linux game, and although landscape is deformable, there is no option to save the landscape to disk in the Linux version. That means that one of the exploits I used to use to get big mechos fast no longer works in the Linux version.  It doesn´t really matter. Once you know how to collect beebs efficiently, it does not take long to make enough to get whatever mechos you want.  If you are a beginner to the game, you might want to find the online manual and you might want to do a google search for vangers hints and tips. The game will throw curve-balls at you from time to time. They are avoidable once you know how, but to avoid them you will need experience in the game, or you will need to read a guide.  In all my years of gaming, Vangers is one of the few games that captured my imagination. If you would like to get your mind stretched a little bit, if you like exploring, if you like sandbox games then I highly recommend Vangers as a game that might be right for you. The whole game, start to finish is a learning experience, and even after you play through a couple of times is still an enormous amount of fun. There is so much to learn, so much to find. I wish you a very happy journey in the Vangers Universe.",

Now if you'll excuse me I need to buy a new Spreettle System and another set of ghOrb Gear for my mechos so I can transport my nymbos to Incubator, meet up with Feenger and get beebs because Leeky, the counselor of Podish of Fostral told me it's what I should do.  Just typing that last part out made me feel like my brian was getting sucked down into my spinal cord. If the last few sentences made any sense to you without playing Vangers beforehand, let me know what you're on and where I can score some.",
