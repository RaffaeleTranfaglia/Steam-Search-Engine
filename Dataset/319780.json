            "review_text": "I have made a mistake by purchasing this game. Its not worth to spend 13$ for it. It cannot be termed as airport simulator. If the game is like creation of airport, runways, accepting contracts for various airline co's to land their flights, fuel contracts, repairing, managing time schedules of different flights departures in consideration to arrivals, passanger lounges, creating waiting area and all the things that are related to airport, then it can be called as airport sumulator game. In this game player is required to do same action again and again and that irritates. Its a waster of money.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so I had high hopes given the great visuals and soundtrack of the first, even if it could use more in the simulating department...this was not what I was talking about. But then again, after writing this review for the first time, I found out that a completely different developer created this...go figure...  The graphics are great, technologically speaking, but it is way off; It gives a disco atmosphere to the game that simply is out of place. For the soundtrack a disco theme was chosen as well, and even though it doesn't sound half bad it still is way of.  The game mechanics themselves remind me of those Facebook Flash games or mobile apps; It involves simple tasks that just need to be done quickly. That in itself is not so bad, but for the price of $15 or so I'd expect a lot more. The developers seem to have no idea what the difference between center of mass and center of rotation is, not to mention how a vehicle handles or ac- / deceleration works don't really help either. Expect controls to be fully registered by the game, but react late, accumulating reactions and spitting them in your face whenever the engine feels like it.  Airplanes seem to fall out of the sky, land perfectly safe, go from 150km/h to 10km/h within 10 meters (visual judgement, but I hope you can understand this looks TERRIBLE)... There are missions that involve guiding an airplane to its gate by driving a car in front of it. Although I can understand why, I cannot wrap my head around the fact that the mission is more about driving through checkpoints as fast as you can and not about actually guiding the airplane to its gate... The snow cleaning is half-decent, in that, as a Farming Simulator player I am accustomed to those kind of drive-over-messy-area-with-device-turned-on-until-counter-reaches-zero missions, but still...  Some things I enjoyed were the missions where an airplane needed to be refueled or recharged using a fuel-truck or mobile generator, where you actually need to plug stuff in, but these missions are cut off once the plane is fueled / charged and you don't get to clean up behind you.  This brings me to another point, nothing you do actually matters. It's just grinding missions for cash (for upgrading equipment so it runs faster) and experience (for unlocking new equipment). There is no AI you can employ so you can handle more airplanes at the same time, even though the airport has 16 (as far as I could see) gates, and you have no say in what airplane goes where, because you have no control over the assets at said gate.  Conclusion, I'd like the developers of 2014 to be able to continue on the Airport Simulator series, as they apparently know a lot more about what they're doing...  NOTE: As stated in the first paragraph, I found out this was by a completely different developer than the 2014 version, and even though I adjusted this review there may still be some references to that game or comparisons that I overlooked. Take it as a sign that those developers have a lot more going for them than these clowns...",
