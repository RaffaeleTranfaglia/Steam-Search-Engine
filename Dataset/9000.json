            "review_text": "Spear of Destiny is one of the most challenging shooters I've ever had the pleasure (although sometimes the pleasure turned into despair and anger) of playing in my whole life.  It took me my sweet time, several years, to finish it. But I finally beat the whole episode today. 18 maps of pure awesomeness. The last map is one of the best maps ever to be a final map in any game. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw it.  Now, this game is not for amateurs. If you beat the first Wolfenstein 3D game, and I mean all 6 episodes of it, in I'M DEATH INCARNATE, well, you're still gonna have quite the challenge when you play this one. Imagine the last map in episode 2, but 10x harder.  Any true Wolfenstein fan knows about this game, but if you've never heard of it and loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 3D and are excited about The New Order, well, you should give this one a spin. Might be the little retro experience you were looking for. And, of course, it will keep you in your seat while you wait for The New Order to come out.",

            "review_text": "Spear of Destiny is a prequel to  Wolfenstein 3D  released months after Wolf came out. The Steam release also contains two third-party mission packs released in 1994.  If you're one of those folks looking for more classic Wolfenstein, the Spear of Destiny campaign is what you want: a challenging - if occasionally unfair - distillation of everything that made the original great in one single contiguous 'episode'. The only notable additions as far as I'm aware are new bosses, new music (the title track is my favorite), ammo boxes with 25 bullets each, and a couple of new textures.   The mission packs...aren't great. They were cash-ins by a company called FormGen, and are nothing more than janky reskins of the main Spear of Destiny campaign wrapped around amateur level design. I had to spurn my purism and turn on ECWolf's automap because I just did not want to put up with stumbling around maze after maze, not to mention level progression and even bosses hidden behind secrets.  Par times, boss names and a couple other things aren't changed from the original campaign, because it was only possible for FormGen to do sound and graphics swaps. Expect to be able to complete levels in as little as 30 seconds merely by stumbling across the exit, giving you stupidly high par bonuses.  Most of the new assets are actually pretty good, although some are just weird. They give the missions a different feel at least, but I wouldn't consider them essential playing even if you're the type of person who would buy Spear of Destiny.",

            "review_text": " Quick Breakdown:  A sequel to the revolutionary  Wolfenstein 3D , it’s not as much fun, and the level design is more frustrating, but it does make some small improvements non-the-less.  Length:  3 hours (Main game)  Genre:  FPS  Score:  5.25/10  Review Date:  2016-07-08  *******************************************************************************************************   Full Review:  Released a mere 4 months after  Wolfenstein 3D ,  Spear of Desinty  ( SOD ) largely offers more of the same. It doesn’t deviate from the original game much, largely serving as an extra set of levels, albeit more difficult.  Level design is much more inconsistent this time around, while some levels offer up a fun, maze-like challenge, others are merely labyrinthine tedium. Combat heavy areas tend to fare better in terms of gameplay. The game likes to throw passages at you with little alcoves with enemies on each side. This leads to a lot of annoying deaths from something that doesn’t really contribute to the game much at all.  Gameplay is essentially identical to original, you again have a knife for melee combat (which I never used), a pistol, a machine gun, and a chain gun, each essentially just shooting faster than the last. Ammo occasionally becomes too scarce during highly concentrated enemy areas, but it’s not too much of an issue.  Like the other game,  SOD  has a control scheme that’s pretty dated, and I modded it to play more how I want to, (instructions on how to do so after the review). The game is still pretty primitive, featuring no height variation in the levels, and little variation of any kind. It gets pretty repetitive, and sometimes just frustratingly boring.  The game boasts 21 levels, including secret and boss levels, and will take you around 3 hours to run through. This time around, levels aren’t divided into chapters, you play straight through from start to finish. (One of the minor improvements of the game).  There are two bonus mission packs, each offering an additional 21 levels, following basically the same scheme as the base game. These weren’t included in the original release of  SOD , but were released 2 years later in 1994. I’ve yet to play these, as I’ve had about enough of old school  Wolfenstein  for quite a while, and I’m not sure if I’ll come back to them or not. Still, they’re there for anyone that does care.  If you do plan on getting this, you’re best off getting the Wolf Pack, which includes  Wolfenstein 3D ,  Spear of Destiny , and the 2001 sequel  Return To Castle Wolfenstein  (which I’ve not yet played). It’s pretty cheap, and will get you the most bang for your buck when it comes to the old school Wolfenstein games.   Spear of Destiny  is by no means an essential release, but it’s still some extra levels for Wolfenstein fans. Grab it from the pack if you want it, just know that it doesn’t hold up as well as the original.  *******************************************************************************************************   Modding Instructions:  So for modding, I didn’t do anything fancy or complicated. Here’s a step by step guide:  1). Download the ECWolf source port, it’s what I used, and it’s all I needed for this game. It’s based off the ZDoom mod for the  Doom  games, and works with  Wolfenstein 3D ,  Spear of Destiny , and  Super 3D Noah’s Ark  (wtf). You can  download ECWolf here  [maniacsvault.net] .  2). You need to navigate to a certain folder in your Wolfenstein directory. Since you downloaded it off Steam, by default that’ll be:  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Spear of Destiny\\base  Copy paste that into Windows Explorer/File Explorer and it should take you there. If not, copy paste the following:  %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Spear of Destiny\\base  If neither of those work, you’ll have to find where you saved it since you’re not using the default location.  3). That ECWolf you downloaded in step 1? Copy/paste the zip folder it gave you into the location from step 1. Then unzip/extract all the contents of that folder into the folder from step 1. (the Spear of Destiny\\base folder).  4). In the same folder, look for something named “dosbox.exe” and rename it to “Steamdosbox.exe”.  5). Still in the same folder, look for “ecwolf.exe” and rename it to “dosbox.exe”.  Congrats! You’ve now modded your game to feature more modern controls, better key bindings, unlimited saves, and you can use the Steam overlay while in game now. The game is still launched through Steam normally, and it’ll still track your playtime.",

            "review_text": "Pretty fun expansion for Wolf3D, but this game really kicks your ♥♥♥. Bosses are every five levels instead of at the end of every chapter, and the levels themselves are pretty tough to navigate. Just for comparison, I was able to play through the first fifteen levels of the original in almost exactly half of the time it took to play the first twelve in Spear. Gameplay aside, the strangest thing that I like about it is the increased variety of ceiling and floor colours used in Spear. In Wolf3D, especially the first chapter, a lot of the floors and ceilings were grey, which is a bit bland and causes intense sensory depravation in areas with stone walls. As of yet, however, I have not played the two expansion missions for Spear, but the change of sprites and many of the art assets is in my opinion a plus. At the skill level that you'd be at to play them, you would have already been bored to death of the original Wolf3d/Spear textures. Overall, pretty solid game.",

            "review_text": "Date: 2/10/16 Review Number: 14  Game: Wolfenstein: Spear of Destiny From (Creator Publisher): id Software Played On:Laptop Steam Price as of Review: $4.99 Total Time played: 40 minutes Review:  Ah, the classic Wolfenstein. The games that can easily be called the grandfather of all first person shooters. Within this game lies the seeds that have given us DOOM, DOOM 2, and every other FPS that followed (all of which were horrible). Apparently the wheel of unintended consequences has decided that in homage to all of the games that followed in its wake, it was time to sit down and play a bit of where that all began (technically the sequel to that, though Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny were essentially the exact same game with slightly different map packs). In the early 90s, consoles were well into their formative years, while PC gaming had just begun to crawl really, when a smaller software company known as id released a quasi-3d Nazi killing game that was essentially a bunch of flat textures in a structure that offered the illusion of 3D. The game itself is fairly simple, playing a typical strong-man armed only with a knife and pistol, you sneak into a Nazi stronghold and proceed to do some significantly expensive interior redecorating, much to the chagrin of the current inhabitants,as they clearly did not expect your arrival. The gameplay is a barebones breakdown of everything current shooters are -- you walk around an environment looking for things to shoot, you shoot them before they shoot back, you find the way to the next area. All in all, the game is surprisingly simple in comparison to games available today, the difference between the three guns primarily being the rate at which they spit out bullets, and the lack of auto aiming and realistic bullet physics means shooting a nazi in the elbow from half a post code away is as effective as a point blank center mass shot, but the game is still exceedingly fun. the repetitive wall and floor textures hearken back to my childhood gaming years, and the sound of yelling nazis as they are shot never really gets old. Though the game itself is comparatively short and simple in comparison to newer games, that's really okay, as this is better played in shorter stints, enjoyed as a brief trip down nostalgia lane. Not entirely sure if it's worth five dollars of nostalgia, but it’s certainly worth something.  Game’s Fate: Its 13 megs, and a fun little time waster. Kept Buy/No Buy: I wouldn’t necessarily buy it at full price, but it goes on sale occasionally. Definitely get it then.   ",
