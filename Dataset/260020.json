Yet, I did manage to get some right that I accumulated random knowledge about over the years, and learned some new interesting trivia as well. Regardless, this game is fun even if you lose badly. The question categories are fun to try to guess at the type of question you will be given if you choose them, and the questions are fairly broad in their range. I imagine that playing it in multiplayer with a group that has a decent knowledge of sports trivia would be rather interesting, but at least for this game I don't have anyone to play such an arrangement with. As a single player game it still remains quite entertaining though.",
