Incase you have the misfortune of owning it and haven't played it yet, when it wants all your info, just exit the game and relaunch. Won't ask for the info again. Brilliant developers.",

Level 1 was a lot of fun. Do the arena first, btw. It is the tutorial and there's no indication that that's what you should do. So like I said, level 1 was fun. So was 2 and so on. My son and I had a blast debating which guy we should upgrade first. Thing is, 2 hours into it and we did every level plus the arena and finished every bit of content possible. We were both looking at the screen and saying, well, good thing we got it for (basically) free in the bundle on the christmas sale.   ",

No strategy is involved here at all. Matter of fact, if one of your units does happen to die, all you have to do is wait for the wave to end, and they all come back to life. Steer Clear of this title, even if it's on sale, or hell, even if it's free.",

My mouse litterally only shows up in the top left corner of the game screen when i need to click a button on the bottom right corner. i completely deleted all local content and reinstalled and it kept the faulty settings. In other words i couldn't even play this game.",
