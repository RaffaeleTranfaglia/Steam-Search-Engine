            "review_text": "Tisnart Tiles is a colorful match-3 puzzle game which features a number of interesting innovations to the genre. The difficulty grows gradually so you won't have a feeling of the game being overwrought (but you can get this feeling if you decide to play more complex levels after a while since you have played previous ones). And yeah, sometimes this game will really have you on the edge, as they have promised. So, it could be of interest to you if you're into match-3 games.",
