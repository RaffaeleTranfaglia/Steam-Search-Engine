    "description": "Developed by Shinji Mikami -- creator of the seminal Resident Evil series -- and the talented team at Tango Gameworks, The Evil Within embodies the meaning of pure survival horror. Highly-crafted environments, horrifying anxiety, and an intricate story are combined to create an immersive world that will bring you to the height of tension.",

Oh this isnt resident evil? by the creator of resident evil, but its not resident evil, you say? I dont care. This is what resident evil 6 and beyond should be or strive to be. The game pacing in this game is great and is officially the best survival horror game i've ever played. The combat is satisfying and getting that head shot is relieving in a sexual manner. (j/k)  I'll end this and say this game is one of the better games that works so well with the Steam Controller.",

            "review_text": "Quite possibly my favourite survival horror game ever. Sure it's buggy in places and the story has some weird moments, but it overall holds together really well. It's not Resident Evil, despite the creator of Resident Evil spearheading the production. This is something I wish more people would realise, instead of criticizing it for how non-Resident Evil it is.  I absolutely love the ID Tech 5 engine. The graphics in The Evil Within are among some of the strongest I've ever seen. The whole game is dripping in atmosphere and I felt completely immersed. It's also incredibly violent, and Tango Gameworks have gone to a lot of trouble to provide a AAA experience. They really captured the essence of horror and anyone who thinks otherwise clearly hasn't seen enough oldschool scary movies.   It's also quite a long game. Took me 12 hours to beat the main story and there's New Game+ and a couple other interesting modes to complete. There's definitely a lot of replay value to unlock all of the hidden secrets/collectibles.   I'd definitely recommend getting The Evil Within if you're a fan of horror in general. It's a challenging game, but very easy to become immersed in. Most importantly, it's fun and quite creepy. Definitely worth playing.",

            "review_text": "I've finished the game on Survival (normal difficulty) after 29 hours. Here are my thoughts:  Difficulty: The game's difficulty is average to difficult, but never unfair (the game gives you enough resources and messing up does not mean you'll have to restart from an earlier save). Graphics: playing this on Ultra, I was impressed and took many pictures of some really nice things I saw in the game. The game has many high points, with very nice light and dark scenes. The only con is the 'cut and paste' of some models, which break the immersion. Sound: I've played many of this game's quieter moments with my earphone, and I was really impressed. Amazing sound design, which makes you feel like you are playing a horror movie in the game's more stealth-oriented sections. Gameplay: RE4 with some limitations, so you cannot fight like a soldier. You can use melee, but it is not effective for killing the enemies. You get some upgrades that, when used well, really make the difference, but running and using the environment is the key to survival, as the enemies are a lot more aggressive than in other games of the genre. Story: Not too original, you'll feel like you are riding in a nightmare, but the pieces will make sense in time, especially if you play the DLC (I'm still playing the second DLC, but I can tell they really add meaning to the story). Some complaints: copied assets (as mentioned above), dying fast because of powerful enemies, action sequences are a bit overused so you lose a bit the horror vibe to get a more action-oriented feeling. Overall: 10/10, Essential game in any true gamer's library, especially if you enjoy survival horror games!",

            "review_text": "I was looking forward to this game, but as soon as I hit play I was disappointed. The aspect ratio is way off and to put matters worse my FPS still dips even with the 30FPS lock. What I find really funny is even if I try to unlock the FPS its still staying around 30 FPS AND still dips below that! That should not be possible with a Radeon R9 290X, I can run Crysis 3 on average of 80FPS and that puts The Evil Within graphics to shame.   Added Note: This is strictly a performance review, I figured we would all be smart enough to realise that but I guess only some caught on. That out of the way after more testing it would appear my FPS was struggling only when I'm outside but as soon as I went indoors everything was where it should be, about 80-100FPS and I'm ok with that. I notice though my game would randomly lock up for a few seconds and everything would be fine after until it locked up again but it is a new game and that can be expected to happen on release.  Now just to make those who wanted more than just a performance review happy, I did play through chapter 1 with the recommended aspect ratio and it did seem like I was watching and playing a more interactive movie approach, which was interesting. However atleast through chapter 1, I didn't feel like I was getting immersed into the story of the game, maybe because I didn't feel like I had any full control on my movement. The story doesn't really make since, atleast not right now in the early game but so far it feels like I'm watching a cheesy horror flick where one minute I'm injured but the next scene I'm fine?   After reading through some comments and gave more thought to it, I recommend to tread carefully with purchasing this game. If steam had a third recommendation option I would have chose that one but alas they don't so I'm still sticking with not recommending. Since I've only played through the first chapter I have regained some hope for this game and hoping the story starts to make more sense and maybe even become immersive. We shall see.",

            "review_text": "Quick run-down of TEW a day after i finished it on Survival mode. Solo nightime only playthrough with headphones on. Max settings with fxaa, unlocked framerate (via unlocked console at 1st, via .ini edit later due to console unlock messing with achievements), black bars intact to preserve intended presentation.  Pros  1) Atmospheric and diverse levels with map design that rewards exploration.  2) Combat system similar to RE4 with a fully 'modern camera' and nerfed melee. The coup-de-grace move in this game is burning downed enemies that requires matchsticks to perform. Burn area has a small aoe so if any enemies are very close to the downed foe they will catch on fire as well. While there is no roll or dodge the sprint mechanic is as effective and once fully upgraded it allows you to easily manoeuvre arround most enemy types, repositioning between attacks, baiting foes into attacking you, forming bee-lines and toying with the ai. Guns feel good even at stock levels even though some of them feel a bit overnerfed at vanilla as a means to add to the intensity (vanilla pistol shoots outside of reticle at 5m or less sometimes even when sitting still) . Gun reloads are RE4 levels of sexy.   3) Resources are limited yet you will always have what you need at your disposal. The game encourages both exploration and carefull observation of your surroundings. Using environmental traps and shooting enemies at certain body parts so that they either lose their balance and end up dying from environmental hazards or become susceptible to burning is pretty much mandatory.  4) Boss encounters are well orchestraded and usually pit you against an intimidating enemy in a pretty small space and require constant manoeuvres in close encounters until you either figure out some sort of environmental puzzle, or manage to down your foe with your arsenal.  5) The game looks good. Nothing jaw-dropping but it absolutely manages to capture the feel and look of the environments.Textures look organic and nothing feels out of place. There are certain scenes that are incredibly moody and brooding.   6) Key bosses are tied nicely into the game's story with their backgrounds explaining their vulnerabilities and appearance.  7) Replayable. The game has a NG+ mode, 2 harder unlockable difficulties, 2 types of collectibles, unlockable weapons that are rewarded once finishing the game and an upgrade system that requires more than one playthrough to max out everything. Also the achievement list is pretty great encouraging you to do various playthroughs (no upgrades, 1 hit kill mode, etc).  8) Stealth mechanic adds flexibility to how you can approach many encounters.    Cons  1) Cringeworthy voice over performances. Not as bad as 'Barry' and 'Jill Sandwitch' but close. Most of the time vo prevented me from taking any of the characters seriously and the dialogue was comically bad at times. Think a couple notches better than Godfrey Ho's Ninja films. Cheezy vo is great given the right context. In a game that appears serious and menacing however, it detracts from the atmosphere and breaks immersion making the player feel at ease with what would've otherwise been an incredibly unpleasant situation.  2) The game has almost zero build-up. Even though earlier chapters are slower paced and require a more stealthy approach since you don't have many weapons or upgrades, it still does nothing with character progression. Even if you take your time and read personal notes in order to get a better grasp at understanding who your character is what his background is and what his motives are, what you see on screen is just a guy with a gun. Not likeable or unlikeable, no personality traits or quirks just plain and uninteresting. There is no display of emotion and even when events that are beyond reason occur, the character seems completely disconected from what's going on arround him even if the answer is pretty easy to guess.   The game flows well and the action is pretty much non-stop, however there is no real incentive to push forward. Since character performances are wooden and all characters felt like stock material it's really hard to feel anything for anyone. Even the player death segments, while very gory, failed to evoke any emotional response. In that regard 2013's Tomb Raider, a game which had some horror undertones but was very far away from being labeled as horror, had death segments which felt way more gruesome and disturbing.   3) Unconvincing bad guy. As with every other character in the game the archvillain didn't make me feel anything. His origins and build up as a character are explained in detail, in contrast to those of the protagonist yet i didn't feel either compassion or hate for him, nor was i intimidated by him. In a way he was just a regular villain (but a very fun bossfight) with a Tetsuo-Shima level of power.  4) No sense of dread and spine-tingling tension. While the game has well crafted intense encounters it didn't deliver that heart-pounding borderline paranoia inducing experience that i was looking for.  The main culprit for this is the disconnection from the characters. The enemy designs while really well made looked familiar and their behaviour patterns were clear and very predictable, demoting what would've otherwise been a terrifying moment to a simple action segment.  5) Uninvolving story. I am certainly not one for pulling plot twists out of the blue for the sake of having a plot twist and i appreciate it when a game or a film has a predictable but well crafted story even if that is as simple as 1-2-3. The story in this however was uninvolving and that is truly a shame as there are elements within it that could've been emphasized upon adding emotion and attempting to immerse the player in the protagonist's struggle. The plot as is, felt like just an excuse for the action to take place.   Neutral  1) Visually visceral yet not frightening. The game's terror is the equivalent of SAW,House of 1000 corpses, Texas chainsaw massacre, etc.The game delivers gore with the subtlety of a Cannibal Corpse album so if films with disfigured bad guys, tons of gore, decayed, rotten environments and flesh sculpture get you then this will get you as well. If you are familiar with that kind of horror and it's something that you enjoy being exposed to then you'll feel right at home. If you seek for a deeper, more psychological and disturbed kind of terror however, then i'm afraid this won't do it for you.  2) Game feels like a horror anthology with a mix of bosses that either appeared in a RE game before in some form or are very conceptually familiar in modern horror.  All in all if you want a horror-themed action game with tight resource management, active/manual/engaging combat system that encourages observation and experimentation and diverse, atmospheric levels that reward exploration and allow you to approach encounters in either stealth or head-on or a combination of these two, then you'll have a blast with this title.  If you are looking for a game that will make you feel uneasy, terrified, out of breath and will put you at the edge of your seat and if gore horror does nothing for you then you'd better look elsewhere.",

The black bars and fov are fine you get use to them fast and if you dont there are patches for you out there . The game is fine the controls are smooth and the aiming is great the only bad thing in the control department is when your sneaking and hugging a wall near a corner he will just turn and face the wrong way every once in a while and at times that can be lethal but very rarley does it happen . The graphics i think look amazing but i also think there supposed to look grunge and not crispy clear but muddy at times and the enemys are just straight Evil and demented looking so if you like gore or horror you should love this game and if you like stealth it is just as great and for me stealth games and horror are the two best style of games in the gaming market so to me it is the perfect marriage and pulled off dam near perfect . I highly recomend this game and it is far from a short game so there is a ton of sick fun to have in this demented world . Two thumbs up and 9 , a must for any great game colliction .",

            "review_text": "The Evil Within - a survival horror game that borrowed a lot from Biohazard 4 ( Resident Evil ). I will refer to former Biohazard games a lot, since it is the same dev.  A lot of people say, that Biohazard went down the drain, when it tried to become a refreshing game, with a new playstyle, etc - well you can't please 'em all, right? Neither will The Evil Within be for everyone. The Evil Within focuses on inflicting terror into your brain, rather than having jumpscares. The game looks more like a piece of wicked art, rather than a game - however it's a pretty much flawless piece of art to say the least.  TEW will let you experience disgust, fear and ' WTF moments' - a lot. It features a dark atmosphere combined with fitting music. Compared to 'older survival horror' titles TEW is no exception when it comes to action, as it is fast paced action filled combat - just as in Biohazard 4.  The PC requirements are a complete joke and should be ignored by 95 % of the folks who want to buy/play the game. TEW is a console port and shows it off proudly, by having 30 FPS lock and a weird FOV. The 30 FPS lock can be easily disabled via Steam ' Launch Options ' - even though the game runs surprisingly smooth on 30 FPS already.   A lot of people say that the BLACK BARS are a giant nuisance, however - they are sooooo important when it comes to atmosphere. Removing them will allow you to see above ledges, farther around corners etc and it WILL RUIN THE GAME. As I've said before, TEW relies on terror and fear, leaving the player guessing where the enemy might be. Disabling the black bars will remove exactly this part of the game and will leave you with a generic horror shooter.  ______________________  All in all the game is awesome. If you've liked BIo4 / RE4 - you will like TEW as well. How scary the game actually is, depends on your brain alone.  The more you dive into the game - the more it will frighten you.  Oh and the voice acting is bad.   ",

It's pure action horror, with a heavy emphasis on exploring the area you're trapped it. Running through a level head on like Resident Evil 5 will get you annihilated, but checking every nook and cranny for supplies is fun, and makes things a hell of a lot easier. Looking for extra ammo, and Green Gel to beef up your character is really rewarding. This game is like the entire generation of action horror games rolled in one, playing it reminded me heavily of Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space, Shadows of The Damned, and Silent Hill Downpour.   My only real gripes are that the story is all over the place and kinda hard to follow. The main character Sebastian is just too much of a badass, absolutely NOTHING in the game phases this guy, even the damn Batman isn't as much of a brick wall to fear as this guy. It really makes the scare factor hard to take seriously. Also the difficulty the first time through can get insainly frustrating with one-hit kills around every corner of the later levels.   I have this game on the PS3 so this is my second realy playthrough, playing the game a second time even without new game+ is a blast, the game is much more enjoyable now that I know what I'm doing in each level. The PC port is nothing special, but is an improvement, I recommend it.",

Despite 30 FPS (which is being rumored to be the new default norm for future games) or the cinamatic black bars, I have enjoyed what I have played, as well as seen of this game, in this case the negative reviews are just as bias as those that give Resident Evil 6 bad reviews because it is different than it's predecessors. I would give it a reccomendation because it is just an entertaining game to me, same with Resident Evil 6, to me this game does get that feeling of Resident Evil meets Silent Hill meets a typical Bethesda game, which doesn't mean that it is bad at all. All I am saying is this isn't a game for everyone, so if you either aren't confident in your PC's specs, only care about you maxing out the game, or if you aren't big on Survival/Psychological Horror, then this game may not be for you.

It manages to add enough new game mechanics to be interesting. The difficulty on casual is challenging still but not impossible (although you might be tempted to look for odd hints. best avoided though, only done once so far as got stuck in environment). The characters are quite cool, and you can relate to them. The enemies are varied and with limited resources will need brains over brawn. There are some memorable nasties and a few moments that could make you jump thrown in. The graphics are nice and the sound atmospheric. Definately worth a look if you are a fan of the genre, and maybe even if not. Each chapter is fairly lengthy and there are at least 14 judging by achievements so a lot of gameplay.

The over the shoulder shoting mechanics spawned a new type of shooting game, and revived a series that was starting to feel overdone. Resident Evil 5...not great. Resident Evil 6...I am not even going to say anything. Evil Within remembers what made horror games great. You wanna know what it is? It's actually scary. WOW! What a genius idea...making a horror game scary. Too many developers decided that RAMBO needed to be the protagonist in their horror games. Having big crazy giant weapons with tons of ammo defeats the purpose, and takes away any element of being scared in you horror game. The Evil Within does a great job of making you feel like you have some power, but are still incredibly vulnerable. I had situations in this game where I got to a boss with like no ammo. I had to struggle and figure out how the hell I was going to progress with like 10 pistol rounds and 3 shotgun shells with a room full of enemies. Horror games should make you feel uncomfortable. You should feel like entering the next room is something you may or may not do...tonight...maybe tomorrow. The Evil Within is a great horror game because it doesn't try to cater to a casual audience. It is a horror game made for people who genuinely enjoy feeling like crap when they play a scary game.",

            "review_text": "Some seem to be giving this a negative review from the get go and I can clear that up why that is from the get go. This game was made by the creator of Resident Evil/Biohazard, so people were expecting something like the first 3 games, maybe like the remake or just something scary in general. What Evil Within most closely resembles is Resident Evil 4, it works in a very similar way with aiming and managing a few guns with lower ammo counts (vs 5 and 6). Hell the game even starts off in a village where you're outnumbered for the most part.  Let me say this: The way this game starts out it WILL seem like Resident Evil 6 where everything is over the top, however there's a reason for that and it very quickly becomes more weird, creepy and better paced.   Personally I didn't find the game scary, I more found DeadSpace, Resident Evil (remake), Aline Isolation to be far more scary. This game however is tense and does force you on the harder modes to be a good shot and work within your resorces. The game has a lot of traps that you'll have to be mindful of, and even if you are some will make you react in time or they'll shave off half your health, again adding to the tension.   I enjoyed the game overall and did find it to be Resident Evil 4's crazy sequel. It had more serious tones vs midget Napolean and a crazy cult. But over all it just felt super similar and like a good sequel to 4, even if it's technically not.   There's some frustrating moments and some oddly spaced checkpoints but they are few and far between. The game honestly does a lot to impress with varying locals (more so than possible in reality) and has some solid art design.   The beginning does not give a great first impression as I said, really makes it feel like a dumb action game and that VERY quickly changes. The game messes with you in neat ways though I think the twist is a bit obvious early on.   I beat it, can say it was pretty damn fun and worth playing.",

I played this game a couple years ago when it first came out but am only now sitting down to write a review. I felt compelled to do so because I saw that it had so many negative reviews. The Evil Within is, by far, my favorite game of my adulthood. I can't count how many times a creepy sound or disturbing image made the hairs on my neck stand up or my mouth drop open in shock and bewilderment. There is a heavy element of stealth to this game because if one enemy sees you they all come running and ammo is VERY limited, early game. Play with a headset and the lights off for true immersion and become super creeped out by the nightmares this game throws at you and remember... 'sometimes it's a better choice to run.' The DLCs were OK, I was a little dissapointed by them but they are worth playing. The story is a little hard to follow. Think Friday the 13th meets Nightmare on Elm Street, that is the villain who is toying with you the entire game 'Ruvik'. I've read that many people thought the controls detracted from their experience, I disagree. However this game does do one thing that I absolutely hate in video games. This is a game that encourages exploration and special planning on how you are going to use your weapons/items because they are so limited, late game the enemies start dropping more ammo. This even extends to the upgrade system which requires you to collect this green gel and you will want to collect every drop of this stuff. However, the only way to save is by making your way to various checkpoints. However many checkpoints are followed by events that block your path from going backwards. However great detail went into crafting this game so the creator may have intended for us to experience that frustration. Also, personally I enjoyed the randomness of the lockers in the safe zone in between chapters.  As I've grown older (early 30's) I rarely finish games simply because I have the urge to play a different game. TEW is the first game I have ever played a New Game+. That is when I stumbled upon a secret which I am certain I was one of the first to find since I couldn't find a single mention of it online however I was not the person who solved it. Check a discussion that I posted (check my profile) for the location but prepare for spoilers. One guy claimed I was trolling but then went on to make a video walkthough about it. This game is from the same dude who was responsible for the Resident Evil series, so of course crows play a significant part. If you don't mind the waisted ammo shoot these ♥♥♥♥ers for extra green gel. (hint: explosives work better when they are grouped, you're welcome)",

All these people complaining about the 30fps lock and aspect ratio are stupid. You can fix both of these issues very easily. It's a tense, gory and creepy survival horror game. It feels like Resident Evil, but IMO it's way harder than any of the 3rd person RE games. Ammo in this game is scarce, so that builds the tension when you're in the middle of a fight and you're running out of bullets. There are also some of those 'run for your life' moments which I love. The story is kind of interesting so far, but since I haven't finished the game, I won't put that in the review. So far this game is a 9/10 for me.

I don't expect much of a scare from games anymore as im fairly desensitised but the bosses were creepy and at times things did make me jump. Towards the end it becomes less scary and more concerning as you run our of ammo and start facing multiple enemies in quick succession.

            "review_text": "A slightly above average survival horror game which does just what this genre is supposed to do and I believe is expected from horror fanatics like myself...but nothing more. Uncharacteristic of a majority of 'horror' games recently, Evil Within does a solid job at providing (in most combat situations) just enough ammo to get by which makes the survival aspect of this game true to its word. Combat is more or less acceptable in that you have a variety of weapons at your disposal along with tools in the environment to use against enemies such as glass bottles for distractions or hand axes for one-hit kills. It's fun and fast paced despite a few sluggish controls. A notable example is during intense scenes where you have to fight in enclosed spaces, it would have been nice to have a 180 degree turn like in Resident Evil 4. Another minor complaint I have is that I wish there was some sort of reticle when aiming bottles at enemy heads; Sometimes I would aim right for their head and miss completely. Kind of annoying.   The money dropped after killing enemies to purchase weapon/ability upgrades can get rather frustrating because it takes a few seconds to pick up, and there are moments in the game where if you don't pick up the money you can't return for it because you are essentially on the clock to get somewhere and are being swarmed by enemies. It would have been preferable for there to be an auto-pick up for money. I think the lack of this feature takes away from the fun in combat. The environment is beautifully rendered and at times I have stopped myself to take a few screenshots, however, the textures popping in and out from the distance is distracting and the immersion wanes.   The AI in this game is remeniscent of Resident Evil 5 where Sheva would be pretty much useless in the heat of battle. Here I can be at low health with no ammo, lure an enemy near the AI and he just stands there against a wall or walks a few meaningless steps until I'm pinned on the ground. The best thing about the AI is you can heal him for free. They are at most a distraction for you to bide your time/reload/heal. My biggest issue of all is the atrocious fps inconsistencies throughout the entire game so far. I can go from ~30fps or lower to 60. It does not matter how much I play around with the minimal graphic settings available, fps doesn't change. There are some scenes which look amazing where the fps is consistently good but others that are of similar quality where the fps is consistently horrible. I have not encountered any other game where my fps behaves this way and I have played similarily demanding titles.    I'm on chapter 6 currently and while I don't regret buying this because I caught it at a decent price, it is something I could have passed up. The Evil Within started out as a promising survival horror but was quickly overshadowed by a number of design flaws ranging from controls or lackthereof, sluggish aiming, optimization, and poor AI mechanics. I hope my opinion on this game becomes more acceptable as I approach completion.  6.0/10",

You will have to be sneaky and conserve ammo to make your life a bit easier throughout the game. I would say the only complaint i would have was with the Kidman DLC. you dont really get to use guns too much in it, which is fine, but i hate running and hiding all the time hence why i think the standard game was awesome. The complaint was more of an opinion for me. It was still a very good DLC and added a good 4 hours of gameplay. The Executioner DLC was very fun, i love how they added a first person aspect to the game and let you play as the keeper. Performance wise this game runs great for me with everything maxed out (i have GTX 980 SC--i7 5930k 6 core @3.6) But im sure it will run great with lower specs than that, I was getting an average frame rate of 100fps.

After that it kinda becomes a rollercoaster of action scenes but still enjoyable to me. The biggest problem with the game however is the story or rather the lack of it that is. The first few chapters you're pretty much clueless which is fine and adds to the atmosphere, halfway through the story seemed to become pretty interresting but it just stopped explaining whatever was going on. The game just kept adding more question without answering any of them. I kinda hope they will fix that with the DLC but that shouldn't have been needed at all.  The gameplay itself, the unique bossfights are awesome I enjoyed every second playing through the areas.  The game only uses a few weapons, which basicly comes down to a revolver, shotgun, sniper, magnum(strong revolver), which I think is a good thing yet the crossbow does not make a whole lot of sense. It has several functions like impale (duh), flash (huh?), explode(ok I guess), freeze (say what?), electrify(oh common), fire(ok that actually is useful considering you want to burn corpses, but what?!?) Anyway it adds some strategy into the fighting without the need of several types of equipment so let's just roll with it.  The upgrade system is fairly simpel and lets you chose how you wanna play the game, so thats a plus most definitly.

Seeing only a portion of your screen does wonders for that, it's not for some stupid reason like 'cinematic experience' like everyone says.  Stealth is a nice edition that was lacking in RE 4. Now you can save ammo by simply not fighting your enemies, which rewards tactical play. You also can't kill everything with melee like you used to in RE 4, your fists are there to make you some space and even then they're not too good at that either.  This game is also pretty hard, even just on the survival difficulty, you'll feel like it's christmas every time you find some ammo or health.  If you can't un-cap 30 frames per second you really shouldn't be playing video games on your dads computer, I'm sure you have a console for you to play on lying around somewhere.  Good game, it's the RE 5 we wanted.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Yesterday, the devs posted an update, that they are testing some fixes (60 fps, aspect ratio, performance, bugs), and if everything goes well, soon, we will be able to enjoy TEW completely.  TL,DR: The Evil Within is a bit unoptimized, but it's unbeatable in atmosphere, and insanity, so it's AWESOME.  Detailed Review: Ah The Evil Within. Probably the most anticipated horror game in 2014. I saw the reviews, and I'm sad. Are graphics, and fps more important in 2014 than GAMEPLAY? Look at Crysis 3. It looks very fancy, but it's a simple FPS. However The Evil Within is different. Let's start with the negatives (there won't be a lot): 30 fps lock (people are bi*ching about this the most. It runs surprisingly well on consoles, but WE 'The Glorious PC Gaming Master Race' (as some call it) can unlock the fps, so this shouldn't be a problem on PC. Bigger problem is the optimizing, or to be more exact, the loss of it. This game either runs on your computer, or not. You can't gain fps, by disabling effects, HOWEVER you don't need an i7 for minimum. I have an i3-4130K, GTX 660 2GB OC and 8 GB DDR 3 RAM, and I could run it on max between 40 and 50 fps. One other thing: The A.I. is dumb.You can easily hide from it, if you go round an object. After a round, the enemy loses interest in you, and you can kill it silently. These are the negatives, and now the positives. The game is VERY atmospheric. If you sit down to play it, you will want to complete at least that chapter, which you are in. Other positive, the levels are very unique. Not just in locations, but in gameplay too. One moment you are in an old village, but in the other, you are desperately trying to reach the exit of a hallway, filled with traps. This IS a true survival horror. You have to scavenge for supplies, try to find secret areas, and you have to SURVIVE. The game has an upgrade system too. Throughout the levels, you can find green goo, which you can use to upgrade your character in a place, called Asylum. You can find map pieces, and keys too, which you can use there. So are you ready for a journey through the twisted mind of Shinji Mikami?  PRO + atmospehric locations + interesting story + challenging  CONTRA - unoptimized - some minor bugs - not suitable for everyone  VERDICT: If you like or liked Resident Evil 1 plus 4, and you'd like a game like those, The Evil Within is YOUR game!",

Not super fresh or original, and leans more toward action horror than the survival horror it claims, but that last point isn't necessarily bad, depending on your taste. However it does feel like a lot of ideas from RE4 got recycled into this, so I guess if you're jonsing for that type of vibe but don't want to relive Leon's Europian adventures for the upteenth time, than this will probably satisfy you.  *Original review below*  I'm not very tech savvy but I'm pretty sure if my PC meets or exceeds recommended system requirements (As far as I can tell), but still have to turn down not only my resolution but every other graphic setting (from the paltry list given) AND open the command console in game and start messing around with that THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

I have now completed the game and I can only recommend the game more, the gameplay holds the weight of the overly ambitious story. The combat feels intense and becomes increasingly scary due to your constant lack of resources, the horror isn't stacked on too thick with little to no jump scares throughout but you do always have a feeling of dread as you never know what is coming for you next (this is in part because of the games incredible music and sound design. MANY of the noises the enemies makes are bone chilling and because of very effective lighting effects).   The gunplay is very rewarding and 'crunchy' as in you can feel the heads limbs and other areas being hit and often exploding (I actually shot an enemy in the face and blew its face clean off with only a hole left in the middle of its head it continued to chase me around).   Now that I have completed the game I still stay true to my opening statement and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a cool new 3rd person shooter or a very nerve racking and often terrifying survival horror experience!",

There aren't many checkpoints so once you die you have to redo a lot of things over and over again which is extremely frusturating since all the monsters are extremely overpowered.  Throughout the first few chapters of the game you start with absolutely nothing to defend yourself with, and you receive more pointless items in the game rather than useful things like amo or health supplies. With this, you are expected to beat 'boss' monsters with extremely low resources. Bigger monsters take more than one shot to kill, so lets just say having 2 bullets just doesn't help at all (no matter where you hit them, whether it's the head/heart.)   Of course, the game is also very laggy and is even more frusturating when you're trying to run away from something.

Around release, many PC player talked of all sorts of bugs, crashes and the likes, but I have yet to see any of these things, and it even ran well on my older cards.  The Evil Within didn't reinvent the wheel by any means, but it still delivered a great horror experience with a lot of Resident Evil-like elements. This is what the later Resident Evils should have been like, if you ask me. While the game is scary, it's not AS scary as I thought it was going to be. Before launch, they did lots of marketing with people freaking out on video over how scary it was. Yeah, it makes me jump and get sweaty and genuinely nervous, but it never made me want to stop playing over being too scared. The story is great, interesting, to say the least. Story wise, it certainly is different from pretty much any horror game we've seen before. And as an added bonus, we got Anson Mount as the voice actor for the main character, which is sweet.",

That bought me in fast, and I somewhat regret grabbing this game at full price. I wanted a reinventation of the genre, and instead I got Resident Evil 4: The Add-on, or 2.5. This review will be spoiler-free.  The Haunted, which are the main enemies, can prove to be a challenge, and can swarm you fast. It makes me wish the Bosses were the same. Some of them are interesting, but some of the other ones can be cheap and frustrating. For the gameplay you mainly use your revolver, and kill enemies. For the ones who fall easily, be careful cause they can get back up. You can use matches to burn them, but try to decide wisely on which ones to burn. Some are dead, and some are not. You get limited matches at the start. It's not an orginal idea, but it works alright.   Other aspects of gameplay include using the Agony Crossbow, and It rocks. You use many different ammo types like freezing, blinding, fire, poison, and etc to wreck your enemies, and it's fun. Just save up a lot of ammo. You do this by disarming bombs, and searching around the enviornment, and enemies. I love the weapon, and at least you get it in the early half of the game. Unfortunately I wish I could say better things about the details, or graphics of the game.  The graphics are a mixed bag. With the new update it looks better, but the only drawback is the black bars on the sides are still there. I could've messed with the console, but I don't know or feel like why that's a good thing. It should've been fixed in development.   The one bright side of the game is that the villain (Ruvik) is voiced by Jackie Earle Haley. He does a great job voicing him. He feels threatening, and scares you well, and does try to kill you at points. I want more of this kind of boss.   The Bottom Line: Wait for this to go on sale and then try it for yourself. I have very mixed views on this game. It feels rushed, and has some great potential, but kinda squanders it, and I just hope they learn to make an even better title.",

Otherwise, think twice before bying, even on sale:  It looks good in screenshots, but is a bit clunky to play. Rather bad console port, not that many fps.   The story seems to be 'guy goes mad and gets teleported from one scene to the next', which probably is an excuse to have rather different scenes and screnarios which are not coherent graphically as well as storywise in some way. It's just a mix of mad nightmares and sometimes bad showmanship, probably by total different level designers, which is interesting at first, but wears down later. The demo was promising, however the full package didn't hold what was promised.  In my taste, you have to run away too often. There is no coherent way to handle things, sometines it is just a guessing game to try if any of the following works (or, in most cases, NOT): Run away? Kill this enemy? Or do I need to find something before I can progress? Press a lever? Piece my pants?

Like many I was greeted by the black bars constraining the top and bottom of the screen and immediately sought a menu option to turn this off, because wouldn't it be mad to force such an aspect ratio on a PC game? Apparently, not to the developers of this particular game and again I took to google to fix it with command line launches and the in-game console, very soon I will regret spending so much time and effort to play this game.  The very first lines of dialogue sound like they were translated through an unfeeling computer who sadly can't comprehend the english language with anything resembling human feeling or emotion. Luckily for that computer the voice actors could apparently not add any of that missing emotion to their performances so in a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way it all fits together and deserves each other. This somehow manages to worsen throughout the game as you encounter more and more characters who are forced to read off such lines as 'It's not just about being unable to see, it's about feeling normal' after you retrieve his glasses from a mutant spawn of hell in dog form, oh wonderful I'm so glad I endangered my own life so you could feel normal while we kill the psychotic undead in a hellish landscape juxtaposing medieval architecture and an industrial complex. You feeling normal is REALLY all that matters in this situation.  The gameplay does nothing to shore up the stilted dialogue and poor story. Stealth is quickly introduced from the onset and then used for 2-3 chapter depending on how willing you are to engage with it and then is swiftly discarded along with any pretense of horror or helplessness you might have felt. Pretty much as soon as you recieve a crossbow through which you can fire many different bolts (some stun and shock, others freeze, one bolt is much like a sticky grenade in function) in probably the only piece of real creativity in the combat, all tension and thrills are discarded for what is mostly a bland third person shooter. The weapons other than the crossbow are by the numbers handgun, shotgun, rife etc. that you will find to function similar to any number of other third person shooters, here you are merely deploying the weapons with sloppy, loose controls and a crosshair that you would swear is just plain lieing to you at times. Things such as a dodge or real melee system is nowhere to be found here, as in order to avoid enemy attacks you must stop aiming and lumberingly reposition, and your melee attacks are as effective as throwing marshmallows at your enemies, who seem only to be momentarily stunned or confused as to why you would even bother. There are some single-use melee weapons to be found strewn about but you simply press the melee button and they are used and disposed of, offering nothing of a real melee combat system to be found.  The graphics are perfectly adequate once you jettison the black bars and unlock the framerate, the lighting in particular is fairly nice and even exceptional in certain areas, and most of the blood and gore found in the game itself is fairly well rendered as well. I didn't notice any particularily problematic frame drops while playing through the game and it seems mostly stable, even when you take the game out of it's comfort aspect ratio and frame lock. All in all it's a perfectly fine looking game on the PC and I didn't have much trouble or problems with the graphics after the initial tinkering. This, however, can hardly make up for the myriad other problems the game has and there is certainly prettier games out there, and of the horror variety as well, to test your system with.  The Evil Within is on the whole just not very good. Nothing about it really elevates itself out of it's own pool of wasted potential, poor dialogue and story and dull, by the numbers combat and gameplay. It seems like a game that might have been considered 'okay' years ago but shooting has moved on from these slow, lumbering gameplay conventions, horror has moved on from men with chainsaws rushing at you and zombies stuck with bits of barbed wire being scary, stealth especially has moved on from frustrating, slow, trial and error gameplay. You can do better than this on all fronts, and for 66 Canadian dollars? You can probably get 2 or more games that do what The Evil Within does better.  TL;DR  Pros: -Solid framerate and lighting -Well rendered guts and gore -Different crossbow bolts show small signs of creativity in an otherwise drab selection of weapons  Cons: -Nonsensical story and stiff, horribly translated dialogue drag the story below B-movie levels into annoying dribble -Stealth is frustrating and poorly explained before being almost entirely discarded -Combat is boring and dull when not using the crossbow, other weapons are generic mix of shooter standards -Horror and tension is mostly cast aside for poorly paced, boring action sequences -Without extra work by consumer, game is a buggy mess that could crash at any time or barely start at all -Holds to stale genre conventions that have since been discarded or improved upon without adding anything of it's own to the mix  WTF: -Do you really expect me to believe a female detective will go out on a call wearing high heels? They're on screen like two times for five seconds but both times I'm now distracted by how much of a moron I think the character is, what if she has to like run or something? You know from those hordes of zombies coming after you, or even like, chase after a criminal, you know her job that she apparently does? -This was really the last place I expected to find a terrible Sephiroth stand-in -I made it through 7/14 or so chapters in this game, I guess if it suddenly becomes amazing in those last chapters they did a poor job of making half of their game not suck and so I'm not really sorry about not making it through the whole thing to be honest",

The Difficulty: This games doesn't really feel too difficult on it's own, it has it's moments but nothing unbeatable, but the sheer banality of it is what started to wear on me. It felt like I'd seen al this before and seen it done better.   Graphics: The graphics were good, but again the enemy designs and other things didn't particularly impress me.   Sound: The sound quality didn't do much for me, I found myself going on auto pilot way more often than I should've. Tension was just not there.  Gameplay: This is what killed it for me. I don't mind the idea of having to use traps or anything of that nature, I prefer the idea of survival horror as being SURVIVAL horror, not FPS. That said, this game started to get incredibly dull and repetative when the trap mechanics were being used so dreadfully often that even taking down bosses felt more like a rince and repeat rather than actually surviving the battle. There were more dull moments than I could count, which leads me to my next point  The Story: Bland. Boring, Uneventful. I knew what the ending would be long before I finished the game.  Controls: They work most of the time, but there's other times you find yourself in a situation where it's extremely difficult to do one simple task like pulling a lever under fire or even turning around to pick something up. Vexing at best.  Overall: I wouldn't pay full price for this at all. If you want to try it, play a demo or soemthing so you know if you can overlook these issues. I however, could not.",

            "review_text": "First of all I'd only recommend this game if it was at the price I bought it , which was at 20.00 USD during the Sale. Otherwise, this game is not worth the current 59.99 USD price.  I don't know if I was too hyped when I watched the trailers of 'I know who you are, what you crave, what you fear. Are you going to be able to live with yourself knowing the things I'm gonna make you do?' and 'I created this world, you cannot keep me here.'. I expected a game that would continue to get darker as we explored the Mindscape of the antagonist. The game also advertised 'Changing environments that react to players choice' &lt; that's a lie, the game cannot be more linear even if it tried. I expected hellish creatures , high tension and actual survival... which the game provides none. The enemy A.I is so bad, you can actually outrun most of the monsters in those 'Linear Chapters' or exit the room in which they are where they won't decide to follow you. In the beginning the game will seem promising, but by the end of chapter 3 the game gives you access to two of the most useful weapons in the game (the shotgun and the magical crossbow) which are simply overpowered and take all the sense of 'vulnerability' that the game had nurtured early on in this dark forest and abandoned village settings... now you know you can take on anything or simply out run it. The biggest disappointment comes when you get to the 'shoot em up' chapters, which is basically you fighting hordes and hordes of enemies... in broad daylight. There are like 5 chapters like this.   And that's my problem with the game, it tries to be so many things at once... It had so much potential. If you compared chapter 1-3 to the shoot-em-up chapters you'd think that they are two different games.  Also the 'I created this world' line is a lie, basically the evil within is an adventure through someone's 'memories' with some godly manipulation that teleports the character.  I could go on and on, Also the ending leaves so many plotholes, that it isn't worth the trouble.   ---Pro + Beautiful Environments  + Nurse Tatiana's Apathy  + Chapter 9 and 10 ---Cons + Clunky aiming that makes you miss enemies even at point blank. + Shoot em up segments, by the time you get to the ending chapters of the game... you'll unlock the | You've killed 200 enemies achievements |  + Many Story Plotholes + Pointless Adventure with no sense of progression. + Re-used enemies , over and over, and over + A lot of Nonsense, example like: You can use your knife for stealth-kills , but you cannot use the knife to defend yourself even if you have 0 ammo.  In the end, if you liked Resident Evil 4 much more than Resident Evil 1 , then this game is for you. If you thought this game was going to be a psychological tense horror thriller ... no , then this game is not for you. Even Silent Hill is much more confusing than this game's story. The game loses it sense of horror and tension once you reach Chapter 5, the game becomes predictable afterwards and you can use your right to the second ammendment to shoot out everything.",

Performance: Constant 60fps during gameplay with everything on high and no black bars. I have a GTX 970 and a Xeon E3 1230 V2.   Gameplay: 8/10  - Very satisfying and rewarding gameplay.  - If you like resident evil 4, you will love this game. It almost feels like a sequel to RE4, which isn't a bad thing.  - Some refinements have been made to the gameplay and mechanics over 4 and overall I find it much better. I like the new weapons, upgrade system, sneaking and cover mechanics, knifing, matches, etc. Feels like a mix of RE4 and RE 1 Remaster.  Graphics: 7/10 - Not as great as it could be, looks like a previous gen PS3 game. I guess they were limited by the last gen engine they used.  - That said the environments are varied and interesting, dark and grimey, just what you would expect in a survival horror game.  - The bosses are really cool too. Some people don't find them scary, but there were a few that creeped me out.   Story: 5/10 - Very confusing and hard to follow. I don't like how it's fragmented and all over the place. I've played the game a few times and there is still things I don't understand.  - The game got its inspiration from Inception, Matrix, and Shutter Island, so you can imagine what they were going for.  - I would have liked for the world to feel more connected, but you just go from one seemingly unconnected area to the next, there's no flow from one area to another. It broke the game up too much for me with each level not feeling connected to the last, but that's probably a personal preference.   Overall: 8/10  - Very good game overall, especially if you are a Resident Evil/Silent Hill/Survival horror game fan, it blends a lot of elements from these games together.  - The gameplay is very fun and rewarding, especially sneaking up on enemies and killing them silently to conserve ammo. There are many ways to play and strategies you can take.  - The story is a mess so what really motivated me to continue was the gameplay, The game was just very fun, story was really just an afterthought for me. If they can develop a better story for a sequel and iron out some of the issues with this game, they will have something great.  - The game is also very replayable, just like RE4. There's tons of challenges you can do once you complete the game, with other modes unlocking.",

Short rundown of the issues: Even after they implemented 60fps 'support' (which as far as I can tell was just flipping a switch, not any real fixes) it crashes all the time in certain levels if it's turned on. The game CHUGS in levels that aren't even graphically complex by Ps3/xbox360 standards. The optimization is a war crime. A room that is ten feet wide with a bloodstain on the wall shouldn't require more horsepower to run than Farcry4 on max settings. No, I'm not joking. It's that bad.

Upgradeable Character - Skyrim alone is proof that players love to build up their character into an invincible force to go kick some tail.    The Bad:  Ammo - The serious lack of ammo (at least the first time round) is why I have only played this game 4 hours so far. There are many better ways to make a game challenging. This is probably the worst thing to do in any game. Players like to feel like they are kicking tail, how can they feel like that without any ammo?  Cheats - When I first learned that there were cheats I had renewed hope for plentiful ammo but I have not been able to get it this cheat to work no matter how much ammo I have on hand. Why not use the tried and true Skyrim console in the future?!  The Ugly:  Aspect Ratios and Resolutions - When I first played this game I really struggled with the aspect ratio. This is something that players should not have to worry about. Most PC gamers have at least 1080p, but many are pushing beyond that now. Games should be made to take advantage of video cards as much as possible. We spend hundreds of dollars on video cards for a reason. Many of us have a 144Hz monitor so limiting games to 30 and 60 is just stupid.",

No matter how much scarier you think other games might be, the fact remains that this one provides much more variety and depth in its gameplay. Also, it generally does a better job of tying in scares with level design and gameplay mechanics, not to mention that 'scares' alone are highly subjective and rarely a factor in replayability (i.e. you might as well just watch a movie if all you want is to see/hear really creepy stuff).  Speaking of subjective factors, I liked the story - even its main protagonist. Yes, there are cheesy moments here and there, but overall it does a good job of ♥♥♥♥ing with your mind and keeping you guessing. And perhaps more importantly, everything is presented in a very polished and atmospheric setting, with plenty of morbid details to keep you immersed and uneasy.   It is ultimately a linear experience, but exploration is rewarded with both items and story bits. And as I've already hinted at, this game offers multiple, organic approaches to solving each encounter and is therefore highly replayable, especially in new game+ mode. I rarely felt like there were a fixed number of options, pre-determined by the developers. It always felt more like a creative survival effort - tense and satisfying.   I don't remember the last time a horror game kept me hooked for more than 7 hours straight, and I have played quite a few of them: the amnesia games, among the sleep, silent hill, resident evil, etc.  Of course, there are some issues with the game: -too expensive in my opinion -poorly optimized (especially considering the price they are charging on PC - thankfully most of the issues can be fixed) -low fov -giant black bars -'cinematic' camera angles can mess up your gameplay occasionally  -a few crappy encounters with gun-wielding zombies... seriously don't ever do that again ",

            "review_text": "TL,DR: It's plagued by black bars on screen and a REALLY narrow FOV. I've been playing 3d games since the N64 and have never lost my orientation so easily. I also never experienced motion sickness in a third person game before this.  Full-ish review:   A maybe great game with an issue.  The Evil Within is an interesting game, at least for what I saw of it. But, I only saw a small slice of it - literally.  The story had me interested, a nice, pretty gritty horror story. It's somewhere between Allan Wake's action, Resident Evil's pacing and, though only slightly, Silent Hill's creature design. Not a bad start. It's gameplay feels is akin to The Last Of Us or the newer Tombraider games. Third person shooting and stealth. No big suprises here.  But, and regretably, the presentation suffers from a fatal flaw. There are black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Constantly. You can't get rid of them. They're intentional. This severly limits the player's vertical field of view. Adding to that, the horizontal FOV is pretty narrow too. And even worse, you don't have absolute control over the camera. It switches from side to side based on the players movement but there is no way to 'fix' it to one shoulder of the avatar nor to switch it manually. And, adding yet more insult to injury, it often decides that, well, maybe the thing that should be the focus of your attention right now is the player character, not the environment. A practical example: You move up, through high grass, to an enemy in a village. As you come closer he walks away into a house and you follow for a stealthy kill. You crouch up to the building, leaning against the wall and want to peak through the open door inside. There is no solid cover mechanic, so, trying to be careful you move up to the door along the wall. The camera sways forward so that the right half of the screen is occupied by your character and the wall, the left half of the screen shows the enemy who you followed move just a bit deeper into the room, slowly moving out of sight. Whatever you do next, you are not only losing sight of the enemy, you will in all likelyhood be disoriented. Option 1, do nothing: the enemy moves out of sight completely leaving you guessing and in a rather awkward spot. You could wait for him to maybe reemerge, but that's neither interesing nor does it leave you protected from other enemies around. Option 2, rotate the camera to follow the enemy: as you do this, the view not only rotates but also moves just slighty to the right centering on your character. As you oogle the detailed figure that is your avatar, the already limited window into the room grows smaller. You may, if you're lucky have a small vertical line through which you can still see into the room. Since the viewing angle is getting steeper, this line has only a small chance of still showing the (still moving) enemy. Option 3, go in after the enemy: since you have no way of tracking the enemy further, you decide to head in after him. While your character moves into the doorway he nearly completely blocks your view into the room. The screen is now filled with your character, left and right of him are the outside walls. Only a few steps into the building the camera move in after him and you can make out your surroundings.  No matter what you do, you're either going in blind or are left outside not knowing what to do next. All this, while your FOV, both vertically and horizontically, is so limited as to only show your character (and even him being cut of at the bottom).",

Ran directly into the enemy, got hit twice, and escaped with ease. This is not the horror game you are looking for. It is an action game painted to be a horror game. Horror seems to be a genre that is all but dead in todays game market. This game falls directly in line with the newer Resident Evil's, and Dead Space. The Evil Within does not even pass as a polished turd of a PC port. My PC specs exceeds the recommended requirements, but is still full of choppy scenes, and graphics being over-layed mid way through a cut scene (or gameplay). 0/10",

            "review_text": "Good, difficult horror game, but not for full price.   There is a good job done on tension and strange/freaky/intense things happening.  I think of myself as someone that doesnt normally scare easy and that being said.... This is one of the few games that has actually made be jump and make my heart skip a beat. The only other games I've played that have done that are Dead Space 2 and Resident Evil 2. However, that was only a fraction of time compared to the overall gameplay. Other people may find it more or less scary.   Something I need to point out is that I personally I don’t like 'helpless horror' like Amnesia, I'd rather fight back in some way. This means the game has to have a balance between giving you power and taking it away. The Evil Within does a pretty good job at this.    It's a tid bit of a rage simulator granted I didn’t play on the easiest mode. To me, this gives you more accomplishment after you clear an area. Your character is quite weak; profoundly at the beginning and the baddies will still rip you up late game if you are not on your toes. Most of the time they are just another part of the puzzle so to speak. They're just another obstacle that you need to use your head to get around like everything else in this game. Even the main Antagonist in this game in not really something that instills large amounts of fear or hate into your heart. Although the story does give him a good amount of back story. He's a sadistic madman that needs to bite the dust for sure, but most of the time you just deal with him which isnt too difficult so long as your Ego can handle a death screen every now and then.  The controls feel solid and I think the game handles better than RE4, RE5, and even RE6 and RE: Revelations. They add a sprint feature which some horror fans seem to hate for some reason, but its a much needed lifeline in this game instead of a cheap escape. If you don’t level it up you will have a VERY bad time. If you run in guns blazing OR cowering in fear without changing your strategy you will have a very bad time. You're going to have to think a bit, try different things, and not get too angry if it doesn’t work out.  The biggest gripe I have with the game is that it seems like they had to shorten quite a few aspects of it for some reason... not sure if they were crunching on deadline or if they just couldnt make up their minds about somethings.  For starters the gameplay isnt that long for a triple A game. You can probably beat it in 15 hours or so. New Game+ is available, but you'll probably blow through that even quicker because your character will be more leveled up (which I enjoy because you can put the pain on the bad guys much easier, but they will still mess you up if you are being stupid).   Oddly enough there are a few automatic rifle welding 'zombies' in this game just like there are in RE5 and RE6 despite some people venting their angst about them. They are quite annoying and may have been better had they been left out or tweaked. For some reason Sebastian doesn’t have the ability to aim while crouching or shoot from behind cover very well. Fortunately there's not too many of them.  I wish there was an online co-op for some part of the game. Most or at least some of the story would be ok if it was a 'drop in co-op optional, but not required' game. A horde or mini-level mode(s) with co-op or multiplayer capability would be fun too and really push the value of the game up in my opinion. I know some horror fans like to play alone, but I like to jump in with my friends and doing so doesn’t have to sabotage a game.  The voice acting was a wash. Some of the actors seem like they are doing an ok job just reading really bad lines. I got the impression that some of the dialog may have been lost in translation (perhaps intentionally) because it reminded me of earlier Resident Evil games.   The story is good, but could be much better. There's quite a bit that could have been elaborated on in regards to the past of the characters, not just Sebastian, but the game never gets too deep with the narrative except for a few people. Much of the story is left open to interpretation and opinion. I would like to point out that the game does brush over some deep aspects of the human psyche that sent a tingle up my spine. I really wish they would elaborate on because it would have made more sense out of the story/game while pulling the player in even further.   All in all its a good game, but could have been much better. Especially for AAA game that would be full price for a while.",

Gameplay - to be honest the gameplay itself is just 'ok'. KB+M works fine, so no worries there. The FOV could be a bit higher, but again it's tolerable. Some fo the mechanics and gameplay choices might seem strange at first, but they will make sense as you complete the game.   If this game has one thing going for it, it's the pacing. It has a nice mixture of puzzles, combat, looting, and exploration. The game is linear, but it will reward you for going off the path from time to time and exploring.   Is this game worth it at full price? No way. If you can get it on a sale for sub-$30, then by all means grab it and enjoy it. A playthrough will be worth your time just for some of the beautiful environemtns and creepy art!    ",

The intensity and atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a survival horror game. Using your sparse ammo appropriately is always a thrill (i.e. taking out 6 zombies with one match instead of using tons of bullets). You are generally on edge the whole game and some encounters (especially in harder difficulty) are downright terrifying.  I've read some people complain about the story, but I really enjoyed it. There are also accusations that it isn't real survival horror. I personally disagree with this. Try a no-upgrade or Akumu run (or if you are totally insane, both). I'm not sure what more you could ask for.  What was so-so: The characters aren't really that great.   I absolutely loathe QTEs, which for some reason have lately been way overused (RE5 and bleh... RE6). However, this game applied them where they didn't bug me, and in some instances were quite good.  What I disliked: The controls and camera can definitely work against you. I didn't like having to do a tank like loop to turn around, and sometimes when I'm stealthing, I can't get the camera to see properly around a corner. These things don't matter too much in Casual/Survival mode, but in Nightmare/Akumu mode it can bring controller smashing infuriation (not sure that's a word, but I'm using it).   Some checkpoint restarts make you have to watch cutscenes which were pretty unnecessary. Other times checkpoints throw you right into the fray where you don't even get one second to plan out your attack.  It would be nice to have some sort of mercenary mode after you complete the game. Maybe in the DLC?  Summary: I've played through the game on all modes except casual, so it must mean I enjoyed it enough to revisit the experience. Some things definitely bugged me but not nearly enough to avoid playing it. I have a middle of the line rig and aside from some texture pop in the game performed well and never crashed (I got the game after the latest patch which addressed some issues).   Definitely going to get the DLC. ",

There are plenty of times where you have to use your surroundings or run away because ammo runs out and it can be a challenge.

This game takes the time to develop story, provide background and show how powerless you are at times.  If you are wanting Amnesia, Grey, &amp; Cry of Fear, dopnt expect it. Expect another Resident Evil spin off. Hospital, Library, Hotel, train stations, all generic themes mashed up together to give you a movie esque experi4ence. Sadly I felt this is just Resident Evil with a new facelift and monsters to expected around every turn.   I understand how he tried to make this 'horror', it is more of tense than scary. Save your ammo kill what you can and move forward is the RE formula.  The other problems is that the size of the game does not do it justice with its performance problems.

The graphics are on par I would say but nothing spectacular other than a few scenes. The graphics settings do about the bare minimum to satisfy anyone but them removing the 30 FPS lock was a big deal.  Story  At its bare bones you won't find anything signifigant in terms of story here. It seems as if they left some of it out on purpose to make room for the season pass featuring a side character from the main story. The story has some depth to it if you want to study Kantian constructivism but at base value it is mediocre at best.  Gameplay  Probably the best part about this game is the gameplay. It plays like a much smoother RE4 and even like a Dead Space game. There are lots of places to set traps in order to conserve ammo and play it how you want to. The stealth sort of falls flat on its face but the other raw gameplay is quite enjoyable in my opinion.   Spook Factor  It has its few moments of absolute terror, such as one iconic boss fight which leaves you screaming, but other than that there is a lot to be desired in terms of spookiness  Overall  I would reccomend this game but on lots of precautions as it must fit the type of game you like (action third-person, survival) otherwise I dont see any jaw breaking thing about this game that could make you change preferred genre for it.

So on one side we have crappy camera angle, awkward controls (Gamepad helps a lot, yet is completly playable on Keyboard+Mouse), save points (there are also auto-save checkpoints). Difficulty is ok, death count at the end of the game for me was 91 (sometimes you just die on purpose cause you wasted too many ammo on simple encounters or at least I did that), you can upgrade main character with currency found during the game, yet it's not obligatory, you can finish game without it, I'll take it as a good thing since you'll never hit a wall cause you didn't upgraded ammo capacity for example. Graphics are... very atmospheric, but textures on some objects are terrible (thanks to consoles), on the other hand enemy models are top notch. Sound and music are on the spot for building tension in right moments. This game is very underrated on metacritic due to same 'console port' issues but really, rate the game itself instead of crying for 30fps cap (you can switch for 60fps now). I agree that characters aren't memorable, and story left too many unanswered questions but probably we will get them in DLCs. For me it's solid 8/10 or even 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Okay after paying this game for six hours now I will give an honest opinion not just a first thought. The Evil Within is clearly a Console game that was ported to PC as a cash grab. This game is not ready for primetime PC play and I'll list why in a moment.   1. The Story- The story can't seem where it wants to go, and at times the game struggles to keep the tension up. This could be to give the player a breather or they just didn't really have a plan as to how the story would flow.  2. Voice Acting- The voice acting is on point and well done and lip syncing is perfect. 3. Sounds- The sound is well done and very immersive, I would recommend 5.1 or a really good set of headphones. 4. Controls- Using the keyboard and mouse there are a few points where it can be a pain but once you learn all the key biddings it shouldn’t be an issue. 5. Graphics- Now some players claim that graphics don’t matter and that maybe true but in a game like this they do. If your rig can run this game at high levels the graphics are amazing and very indicative of next generation games.  6. PC requirements- Trust me if your system doesn’t meet the minimum requirements skip this game for the PC. However if you do it will run fine once you tweak it to run at optimal settings. If you have NVIDA use the GeForce Experience to set it up. 7. Bugs and problems- It took me a full day to get this game to run as it should and that is not acceptable for a $60.00 game. The game wanted to start in a windowed mode and when it was switched to full screen the picture was zoomed in. I run a 2560 X 1600 screen res so to make the icons a little bigger I had the magnifier tool to 200%. I have never had an issue with this until The Evil Within, once I put the magnifier to 100% the screen issue cleared up. Next having to use a prompt menu to fix letterboxing, and FPS makes no sense. It is almost like the developers said oh screw it we’ll just have the player do our job. I hope for a patch that will fix this but I am not holding my breath. 8. Final thoughts- This game is worth the money if you go in with your eyes open and have a system that will run the game. I noticed no real graphic issues with a 2 GB card though they do recommend a 4 GB. If you like games like the first Resident Evil or FEAR you will likely enjoy this 18 chapter game, after 7 hours I am half way through so it gives you plenty of game for the buck. Just be prepared to have issues with install, bugs, and have an above average rig and you will enjoy this game. So I rate this game a 6/10 it is a good game sadly the tech issues really cost this game in my eyes.",

It could easily be called a masterpiece if not for the following caveats:  1) I highly recommend you get this game with the DLC. It's a shady way to operate, but the developers basically cut half the story out of the game and decided to release it in the DLC, so it's really necessary to play through them to get the full story. Otherwise you'll be left scratching your head.  2)The first 1/3 of the game has serious pacing issues and is incredibly confusing. I really had to trudge through it. So much is left unexplained that you spend the first 6 chapters just asking yourself 'What the everloving f**k is going on? How did I get here?' The story doesn't really get going until about chapter 7 or 8, because of this the beginning chapters really feel like filler. But I promise it's worth the agony.  3)I'm the kind of gamer who enjoys playing hardcore games like Dark Souls, and it literally pained me to switch the difficulty down to 'Casual'. But after hours of yelling at the screen, being constantly low on health, and getting one-shotted by every other enemy in the game, I finally relented and began enjoying the game SO MUCH MORE. The game is incredibly imbalanced on 'Survival' difficulty and will do everything it can to convince you to NOT change the difficulty to 'Casual'. But I highly recommend you do.   The game is brought down by a series of really bizarre choices and game imbalances, some badly designed boss fights, and crappy clostrophobic camera controls. Overall, The Evil Within would've benefited from some more focused direction and a better writer. But underneath these issues there's a really fantastic horror game waiting to be explored. There's clear talent at work here and they do a great job evoking fear in a variety of ways. The game has some of the creepiest, grossest enemies around and features some of the coolest horror set pieces I've ever seen. One level has you crawling through a city as the landscape collapses and shifts around you, while a boss fight has you run through a maze of body parts as you're chased by an incorporeal blood monster.  This gameis a must-have if you're a fan of horror games. 7.5/10",

Most games in this genre fail to deliver in that area time and time again. But the level of twisted, horrific beings in this game can be likened to that of the Silent Hill series. And unlike most, the campaign actually took me over 20 hours to complete.   The only negative side is the convoluted story. I felt like a lot of the questions I had went largely unanswered. There were just too many pieces to the story that weren't fully developed and tied together in the end. And that left a slightly dissatisfying taste in my mouth. But as a whole, I'd highly recommend this game to any fan of the horror genre.",

Pros -Cool enemy designs ( Ruvik looks very awesome) -Intense action -Nice sound effects -Some nice lighting and shadow effects -Fluid shooting controls -Interesting premise  Cons -Bad choice of Ratio aspect ( I respect the artistic viewpoint but still...) -For a game this demanding, the graphics are only 'OK' -Animations are pretty choppy, especially the running animation -A couple of really bad and overdramatic moments -Besides Ruvik, all the other characters are uninteresting -Game doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a survivor horror game or an action game. Throwing a lot of enemies at you while giving you no bullets doesn't equal horror, just frustration.   Final Verdict If you are expecting Silent Hill then look somewhere else, this game is more RE4. If you are looking for straight up action than also look somewhere else as this game has a couple of slow parts. This is a mix of action and stealth, which I think it does a decent job of. This is not the survivor horror revival game that I was hoping for but I still think it is a good game, not nearly as bad as so many people say.  Grade (8/10) Decent game just don't expect the second coming of Jebus. Go into this game knowing that it 'is' an action game with some moments of horror.

Its not a bad looking game, and it does have some pretty terrifying monsters/enemies however the story is sooo bad, i don't believe anythign can recover at this point.  It reminds you of that Weird psychological Outlast crap, but other than that its cliche. The main character is unlikeable, stiff, no feelings for him at all. His love intrest again, feels less alive than a dead or alive bimbo.   If you want a game with a good story don't get this game. If you don't really care about the story, and you want a game that is challenging, decent graphically, then give it a try. Personally it wasn't for me, but other people may enjoy it.  EDIT. AS of Feb 7, 2015    I replayed this game on casual. and my feelings have changed about it. Think of this game as the spiritual sucessor to Resident Evil four. You know how the game had a pretty crappy story, but it was still fun to play. The game has a extremely high learning curve, i suggest playing through the game the first time on casual. The game acttually displays how many times you die , when you beat the game, so IMO there is no shame starting off on Casual with this game. IMO this game reminds me of Dark Souls 2 in a way.   IMO this game is meant to be played at least twice, they give you the option for Newgame + with additional weapons. I personally enjoyed it but honestly, i don't have any desire to go in for another Go. I did change my opinion on the game. I remember when my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would pucker everytime i would have to defuse a trap, now i can do it without second thought, most of the time.   The story, felt a weak. I feel like there could of been a better story, between Joseph and Sabastian, but it fell flat. There is always a feeling of what is going on, because your constantly lost all the time. The game has this one destination approach, so sometimes you may enter a door, and find out you missed your chance to explore another house.   The ending really didn't explain much, and left it open like they were going to sequal bait, but overall it is a really fun game. I recomend it to anyone looking for a actiony, die a lot survivor horror game . This game has already been on sale twice that i know of , for like 20 dollars, and IMO at that price its a definite buy. I would rate this game a 8/10, a definite buy for when it goes on Steam Sale.",

Also they said or shall a say 'rurmored' it to be 30 fps locked to begin with.  So I have only around 30 minutes with the game. I love it. It feels and acts like resident evil 4 and I god damn love it. I also love how this game has chainsaw guys. I love it and hate it. Cause well those were the worst for me in resident evil 4 or any resident evil game.  I know there is around 15 chapters so really who knows how long this game is seeing as I have it on the highest diffcutly and well I already died 5 times. So its kinda a stealthy horror surivual game. It being diffcult thu sucks cause it will take away that fear factor in a way.   Alot of people are complaing about the enemy ai and I did come across a ai problem I guess? Where I was in the locker and the chainsaw guy just stared right at me then grumbled something and went bat crazy on the wall next to me. To be honest that made me chuckle and shudder in fear.  I recommend this game. If you want to spend 60 dollars on a game this is where you should spend it on.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR - an action horror game that fails to be both action and horror but somehow kept me playing, 5/10.  It's a shame. This game is one of those that 'have potential', however it wastes it all. Let's start with what this game is supposed to be (quote from game's site) 'a game embodying the meaning of pure survival horror.' or even (Wikipedia) 'psychological survival horror' turns out to be a poor action game with lots of gore in it.  The 'psychological' part, I think, indicates that nothing makes sense (which is sadly often the case). The story is extremely dumb and unclear throughout the whole game it's actually amazing. There was no point where I finally understood what the hell is actually going on. The way it is presented, the way the characters moves from one location to another, the completely redundant and unrelated notes, journals and audio tapes create one big confusing mess. Characters that are in the game are all stright out of 'Most cliche characters in Japanese medias', without even slight changes made. Their lines are written so poorly (or the localization to the western market was so poor) they made me cringe every 10 minutes. They have no depth, no backstory (main character's past is presented with journals we found at specific rooms, but it it absolutely unrelated from the game and also fits to the cliche model of this character), they do not grow, change, show emotion. Nothing.  The other part, 'horror', should be replaced with just 'gore'. There is nothing really scary in this game, only ugly and brutal monsters. The atmosphere is lacking, the main villan looks like he'd be down from 1 hit, multiple events that could be potentially scary are so grotesque they are instead funny. All this increases as the game goes on and it changes from a reather stealthy one to a full-out action game, that's made poorly. It tried to keep it's 'survival' part by giving little ammo (Btw I just hate how games call themselves survival just because there's little ammo and there's absolutely no other survival part) which only made it frustrating, when as it goes on the amount of opponents becomes riddiculus.  On the technical side it's no better. Even though some of the locations looked good as long as you didn't come too close, and some models were done very well (safe head!) there was a tone of blurry textures and low poly models. Despite that the games runs terribly. On a 980Ti, with framerate 'unlocked' (which also forces vsync on!) I had 30-40 FPS with CONSTANT stuttering. It looked a bit better with a 30 FPS lock, but it still often dropped to 28, causing small stutters. For a game looking like this this is not acceptable. Additionally, turning black bars and grain postprocess by the fault to make it more 'cinematic' just shows how ignorant the people behind the PC versions were, or how little money was put into the port. Another, one big technical issue is the camera, constantly jumping, twitching, stuttering, blocking on meshes, getting inside of meshes etc. Also there was a lot of other, smaller bugs, like goats bigger than men, collision-less meshes, LODs cutting off text on signs.. Really sloppy work.  However, despite all of that I kept going, hoping it will all make sense in the end. Even though it didn't, and even despite the absurd final boss fight I didn't really feel like I've wasted that 15h. I had a lot of frustration and even more disappointment which is why I do not recommend this game, but still I also had some fun.",

A lot of things don't make sense and it could have been intentional by the author, but I still can't get myself to use my imagination for this game like I do for others. It could also be that I'm just getting too old for horror games because none of the horror games I've purchased recently have been played for more than 2 hours - almost like some mental block that keeps taking me back into reality and making me realize that the game doesn't have much to offer based on what I currently have experienced.   If you haven't enjoyed recent horror games, then you most likely won't enjoy this one. It's doesn't feel scary, it doesn't feel like an action game, its stealth is easily exploitable, intro to the story is 'meh', so I don't know what to make of it besides branding it as another generic horror that's horrifyingly boring. I really wanted to like this game, but if the intro failed to pull me in, it's going to be very hard for me to change my mind and give it a second shot.   Have I just grown out of that phase where these things don't feel scary anymore? I know I've had some heart pounding experience with Dragon's Dogma recently, so I do believe that games still can be scary in some way ... The Evil Within just failed to do that. I played it in front of children who would cry from watching Dawn of the Dead, but instead, they just laughed at me running around throwing things, or getting blown up by traps in this game. I'm convinced that this game is not and will not be scary for many players. Some people might enjoy the mechanics, but I didn't. Would I recommend it? No.",

It teaches harsh lesson about ammo preservation and fight vs. flight decision making. I enjoyed how the game was at heart an omage, of sorts, to the genres roots. But if you are scared this game is just a rehash of other games, rest easy. This is a game that, while not innovative, realizes what it doesn't have to be. It is there to stress you out and force you to pay attention, which is what survival horror games do really well. The gameplay is tight and responsive, and there are a plethora of options as to how you make your way through it. The Evil Within is a promising new franchise that left me waiting, with baited breath, for more.",

I knew what bodies didn't need to be burned, I knew how to save my ammo, I knew what to level up. That being said I didn't now how to fight most bosses, so I was left in the dark there and honestly the bosses are interesting. A lot of running from one type of boss and the other boss fights are pretty simple but most of the time when I encountered the boss it felt pretty awesome.  I think I enjoyed this game more knowing all about burning bodies and how to deal with certain monsters. I can see how some people would get frustrated quickly if they didn't know before hand. So if you are interested and don't mind some spoilers of the early game, go ahead and read up about it before you buy.   I have had no issues with the PC version. No crashes and very rare frame rate drops. I really liked this game.",

You start hanging face down in some sort of butcher room. You swing around, grabbing a hell of a knife (some Rambo style knife) out of a dead body hanging next to yourself. You cut yourself loose, meanwhile the butcher is going about his business. After I fell down, I thought 'Great, the game allowes for melee combat, so ima just sneak up behind the butcher and kill him'. I sneaked up on him, was right behind him and pressed for attack, but nothing would happen, I also had no knife. Then the game displayed a hint I should steal the butcher's keys. I pressed the button for it, the character stood right up (remember I was still behind the butcher), extended his arm in front of the butcher and grabbed the keys in front of his face. Riiiight...  2. Animations are crappy, you stand halfway up in the water and bricks and dirtpiles are in your face. Also in the beginning scene of the game where you get out of your police car, I can walk 'inside' your female buddy. Didnt try the male, but should work too.  3. You run from your enemies most of the time. Makes sense, given that a hundred thousand spears and other sharp objects are lying all around.",

The whole point for both of those is for the cinematic experience (locking the frame limit to 30 FPS brings what is experienced in the game to that of a movie which is shot at 24 [thanks Peggy Hill lol]). Not only this, but the restricting experience is supposed to add to the survival horror experience. Although I am not sure this is truly much of a horror. Survival thriller with horror elements would probably be more fitting.  True, it may not have the horror atmosphere of Silent Hill, but it brings what Resident Evil 4 was best at, adrenaline rushes, and a thriller experience. The difficulty in aiming, the awkward zooms, the innacurate shots, and inability to take on a lot of enemies at once is what makes this a survival horror revival.   As mentioned before, it may not have the atmosphere that goes on par with Silent Hill's horror and unnerving nature, but this has been just as expertly designed. There is plenty of violence and gore to be experienced and lend to it's own brand of disturbing, and the atmosphere is incredible in it's own category. The smoke effects, ambient music, noises made by enemies, and interactions between the player and the environment can conjure up it's own type of disturbing nature to the game. The gameplay is fantastic, and has a feel to match. Combat can leave the player feel helpless, but has been fine tuned to make the player addictively jump back in to play more after death. I am only two hours in and I'm already loving it.   I highly recommend this game if you love single player games. If you like games like Resident Evil 4, Dead Space, and the Last of Us, then pick up The Evil Within.  Please don't listen to anyone complaining about how it is 'limited'. This isn't a competitive multiplayer shooter, it's a singleplayer cinematic experience, which is something else that has needed a revival as well.  Also for those wondering about requirements and recommendations, I have the game maxed at 1080p and have not experienced even a hiccup.

In the beginning it introduces some really cool enemies, like the invisibles that can only be spotted via trails in puddles, but right after the first hours, poof, you don't see them anymore, the game becomes ultra linear and you end up having sections where you have to kill all the enemies to proceed, the game forgets it's a survival horror and becomes pure action. And the action is also really bad, it has a stupid 'burning' mechanic that lets you burn enemies on the ground to propel to others, but it's really sloppy and it almost never seems to work as intended, some weapons don't even feel tested, like the crossbow that as soon as you aim high it covers all your screen making impossible to check where you're shooting.

            "review_text": "Performance: Don't be off-put by these terrible system requirements. They are way off as far as the GPU goes. You can play the game at 4K with no performance hit vs 1080 so any performance issues are definitely CPU related (appears to be poor load balancing on cores). Max VRAM usage is &lt; 3GB even at 4k.   You will need a processor with excellent single core performance. As mentioned above, there is poor cpu load balancing. Therefore, a newer core processor, an OC'd core i5, or a older core i7 with HT is recommended for smooth framerate if you want to play at 60 FPS.   Gameplay:  There are a few cheap sections of the game. It also doesn't maintain the horror factor throughout the game. However, if you loved RE4, you will love this game. Id suggest locking the framerate if possible (60 FPS recommended if you can do it). The combat feels smooth. The controls (kb + m or controller) function extremely well. Ammo is limited through the first run so it does force you to be a bit more strategic while playing.  Story: Imagine some of the more wacky Silent Hill storylines and turn it up a notch. The game does get off the wall crazy in its narrative so don't expect anything grounded. However, it's entertaining. Also, don't expect anything fully conclusive as the season pass obviously hints that this game is not the closing of the franchise (hopefully).",

However be warned that this is nowhere near a classic survival horror game. There are levels that invoke this yes but a good 2/3 of the game has you fighting or sneaking through various battle arenas instead of actually exploring environments.  Health and resources are indeed scarce but that aspect of the game seems at odds with how action and boss fight heavy the rest of it is. I genuinely enjoyed the weird safe room hub world and the upgrade system but it seems like you can easily screw yourself over investing in the wrong things. Hey cool there's a magnum in this game with its own upgrade path! Oh no I dumped my valuable points into it but there's maybe a dozen rounds of ammunition for it in the entire game. Sorry!  By far the worst part of Evil Within are the one-hit kills. They're cheap as hell and absolutely everywhere. I think maybe 40 of my 50 or so deaths were due to getting offed instantly due to a trap, special boss attack, or environmental puzzle. It absolutely sucks and drags the game way, way down.  Also if the model viewer is any indication you find maybe a third of the weapons in the game on your first playthrough. Why hide so much behind unlocks and new game plus for game this long and plodding?  Lastly I wanted to touch on the story: it's nonsense. Yes I've heard it makes more sense if you play the DLC but I'm sorry, no. There's no sense of place to this game because you're constantly teleported around chapter to chapter. Yes it's on purpose but it doesn't help ground anything that happens. This just happen for the sake of it and I could barely tell you what any of the characters did at the end of the game. Do not play this for plot.  If you like the idea of a game controlling like Resident Evil 4 but want something more action heavy then Evil Within is right up your alley. If you're looking for classic survival horror look elsewhere.",

The first thing graphically I found appealing was the way the hair moved around at the same time as the characters turn their heads...amazing! The simulated hairspray with it all being clumpy and shiny is great.  The collision detection and animations are clearly a step up from the PS2 era, unfortunately the clunky controls are not. There is no precision as far as controlling the main character and often it feels like you're playing with a four-way joystick.  The level design and layout is reminiscent of many games in the last few years or so (2001-2006!), but don't let that put you off because the AI is also of the same calibur and the same kind of fustrating experience is there to be had!  This is one of the highest moments of 2007 for me and I'm really glad I bought this game at FULL PRICE and didn't WAIT FOR A SALE or something...  Who knows what we can look forward to in 2014!!! Hang on a minute...  EDIT: I have been trying to play this game only because I paid for it and can't get rid of it to get some money back. If I had it on a new console, which I don't own by the way, it would be back on a second hand shelf as soon as I left the house again! If you do own a console look for discs laying around outside where people have thrown them out the window in fustration and get a copy for free!   It truly is a terrible, terrible game.  It's a dire experience provided by the same methods of a decade ago at attempting to create horror and suspense in a game when that was all the technology could handle at that time.  The most evil thing about this game is the fact they ask money for it and a full triple AAA price at that!

Wtf's going on?  I can run Shadow of mordor on maximum on every single setting @ 2560x1600 with a rock solid 60fps with V-sync. And I wouldn't say it looks any worse then this junk.  I think the recommended settings should be twice as high as they have put it at. But then very few would purchase this game, I think it was a tactical move to be honest.  At this state, with no Crossfire/SLI support and such high system demand I do not recommend purchasing this at all.",

Great atmosphere, terrifying enemies, good pacing and frightening audio combined with satisfying gameplay and visceral graphics make this a great game for survival horror fans.  Despite the various complaints about 30 FPS lock, high system requirements, this game barely raises the temperature of my system when running it at maxed settings. Game runs smoothly (for me) without crashes, lag, stuttering or freezes for me and the letterboxing adds to the gameplay atmosphere by concentrating the action into a tight spot. You won't even notice the letterboxing after a few minutes of playing because it blends very well into the scene.  Playing this with Keyboard &amp; Mouse helps a lot with precision which is highly valuable due to the scarcity of ammo which forces the player to aim precisely for headshots to avoid wasting ammo. KB &amp; M controls are smooth, responsive and easily customizable.  This game does not feel like a port at all, except for the radial inventory screen, but even then, inventory items can be bound to keyboard hotkeys so there is no problem with that feature.  Overall, I would rate this a 9.5/10. The only problem I have is with the over-the-shoulder camera sometimes which creates large blind spots especially when turning around.",

This game now works, at least on my rig, and it is reminiscent of the hours I put into Resident Evil 4. If you have a decent rig, by all means purchase this game, is it perfect? HELL NO! But support games like this! Not cod! The story is a little convoluted at times, but it is a nice little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tease until HE COMES BACK WITH SILENT HILLS! I CANNOT wait!

FarCry 4 would be great, if they actually WORKED OUT THE BUGS! But the PC version, I heard it is SHOT! This is one PC version port, JUST AS GOOD as the console version.

You can not use stealth (crouching, pfft) to work through almost any of the game's scenes either. Dying interrupts the video game experience. What's around the next corner? Darn... I died. How will the story develop? Dang, I died again. What creepy area awaits me? Argh, dead again. You get the picture. It's like playing a game on a failing computer that constantly malfunctions and needs to be reset or playing poker with someone who cheats. Quoting a character from 'Aliens': What are supposed to use? Harsh language?  But gameplay is not the only shortcoming of this hype machine. The plot is unoriginal, uninspired, and unsurprising. No narrative is told by the protagnist, who remains mostly silent aside from some dialogue here and there. To learn about him you have to read in-game documents. The 'evil' you are fighting against is not explained until late in the game, so for a majority of your playthrough you will be wondering 'Why the hell are these guys chasing me? What the hell is happening?', and by the time that is explained you will be so put-off from constantly dying that you won't really care. The characters are cheesy as they come and the only real drive you have to finish the story is to kill the annoying 'rude ♥♥♥♥' villain. It is simply insulting that the game's development team claims playing the game on Hard difficulty is the best way to experience it. Arguably, the best way to experience this game is not to experience it at all. Pretend that it's good with your imagination and you may have a good time with T.E.W.  The most appalling aspect of this game is the technical power behind it. The id Tech 5 engine is hilariously underutilized. This game would have looked great a year or two ago. Options given for optimizing this title are disgraceful. Worst of all: it simply isn't playable. I have spent hours scouring the internet for answers and all that I have come up with is that for some PCs, for reasons unknown the game just won't run as it should. It worked for me a few months ago using an AMD R9 290X and older AMD drivers, but now that I have upgraded my drivers and use an AMD R9 285 it doesn't work properly. I cannot see either the main menu or any in-game HUD. I suppose playing that way could be thrilling and cinematic, but considering that I died enough WITHOUT a HUD, I cannot imagine playing without one.   In marketing this game and hyping it, I would give the developer and publisher a 10/10. As for the game itself, I would have to give it a 6/10. There are some semi-memorable moments during playthrough when you will realize how truly great the game COULD have been. With proper imagination the game's story isn't too bad and the gameplay engine has some solidarity. But the fact that I paid $60 for game that doesn't work is appalling--I was basically robbed by whoever made the thing. As a long-time Resident Evil fan (since RE2) I must say this is a massive let-down from T.E.W.'s creator. I recommend pirating the game and seed-seed-seeding it to avenge people like me who paid $60 for broken software--otherwise just avoid the very thought of this survival-horror crapshoot. ________________________________________________________________________________",

            "review_text": "-First Playthrough Review- (SPOLIER-FREE)  Before I begin this review, let it be noted that the current vanilla and un-patched version of the game has resulted in a horrible PC-Port, the main issues that come with the port include FPS limits, limited graphical options, poor mouse support and a very cinematic yet annoyingly painfull letterboxing feature. Luckily however there have been several console commands released on sites such as PC Gamer that provide a means to unlock the FPS and remove the strange letterboxing, however doing so will decrease your FOV and possibly cause some glitches in the game.  Now as for the game itself, I am currently playing through The Evil Within for the first time on the 'Survival Difficuly' which makes enemies tougher, supplies harder to find and generally just makes the game provide more of a challenge, there is a previous 'Casual Difficulty' for an easier playthrough aswell as two locked difficultys which I assume are unlocked after completion of the game.  I will admit that during the begging chapters of the game (Chapters 1 - 3) I was very critical and judgemental about the game, I jumped right into the game believing it to be a 'Jumpscare Freakout' similar to Outlast or Amnesia, but that is not what The Evil Within sets out to be, infact if it is to be compared to any game it should compare to Resident Evil. The game focuses less on character development and explaination as to the events that occur and instead focuses actual gameplay and 'Survival' as the majourity of time is spent collecting enough resources to sneak or blast your way through the next area of grotesque abominations that act as your enemies.  When talking about the enemies in The Evil Within I first have to consider 'Which One?' as much like in the more recent Resident Evil games, the enemies will differentiate depending on the current location, unfortunatly this only really applies to the visual look of the enemies, as many of the zombie-like creatures in this game share similar statistics and you can judge them based on their 'Build' ie: Larger Enemies will have more health. I have to say that the art team behind The Evil Within have really done a great job making enemies look disgustingly horrid and creepy espically when it comes to the more signifcant enemies or 'Bosses' these characters tend to have special attributes and a unique look and sound to them which makes each encounter with them just that extra bit more terriying.  I'm not going to talk much about the story or 'Plot' of The Evil Within, mainly because I am still playing through it and don't want to make any judgements before I know the true ending, what I can tell you however is that the plot goes all over the place, during the course of my current playthrough I have had to stop and question myself as to what just happened and where/what I was doing previously as the game throws you through loop after loop of confusing segways and plot twists, I hope that the majourity of my questions will be answered by the time I reach the ending of the game as currently I am having to gather my information through in-game notes/journals and The Evil Within Wiki.  Overall I will admit that after all the port-issues and the confusing plot-journey I am still very much enjoying this game and although it is not a great game by any means It is still fun, enjoyable and a nice change from the usual 'Indie Horror' games that seem to flood the marketplace so easily, I will advise though that If you are going to play this then remember that it is, in all of it's traditional ways, a Survival Horror Game!",

First of all, the letterboxes in the game are both distracting and obstructing. They cripple your field of vision and disable you from gathering your surroundings properly. Thankfully Bethesda gave the option to disable the letterboxes. The Evil Within does look great though, the atmosphere throughout the game is always appropriate and helps immerse the player.  In terms of gameplay, The Evil Within does an excellent job of building tension by placing you in uncomfortable situations and forcing you to make your best judgment to overcome obstacles. Every resource in the game seems deliberately placed, giving you just enough to survive. The budgeting of resources causes the player to think more about how to overcome obstacles with maximum efficiency and adds alot of choices and depth to the gameplay. During your encounters with the Laura and The Keeper, the game does a poor job of communicating what course of action you should take to survive and I found myself dying alot in trial and error. The game also had too few segments which required stealth, and the game becomes heavily action oriented after chapter 10.  I actually found the story in The Evil Within to be fairly interesting despite it's painfully boring characters. It did a good job keeping me invested to the very end, though admittedly the ending could've been executed better. Nonetheless, a horrific world created from the network of psychopathic minds is an intensely interesting idea, and is the perfect playground for Mikami's horrific imagination. The premise of the game is especially interesting when you take the time to identify what memory or mental defect concieved each monster you face in the game.  There is plenty of room for improvement in The Evil Within, and I hope Tango Gameworks takes some of the low points into consideration. I think there is great potential in this new title, and I'm looking forward to future installments.  8/10",

One of the most cohesive looking games I've seen in a while, the game oozes style in its presentation, and takes advantage of some truly fantastic narrative and cinematography techniques. The story seems rather shallow at first glance, and it really kind of is, but there is quite a bit of mystery and speculation to be had if you look close enough. The best comparison I can think of is Inception, although presented much more incompetently. The gameplay works rather well, however the emphasis on combat and lack of any kind of alternative when out of ammo makes some encounters near impossible, and may force you to use exploits or janky strategies to win. Think RE4, with hardly any ammo and no melee finishers/combos. The ammo thing is a real shame, because when you have a load of ammo, the game flows really nicely, but that's hardly ever the case. Really it seems like a misunderstanding of the Survival Horror genre, like low ammo MUST mean Survival Horror, which wouldn't be a bad thing if enemies could be avoided or skipped as in the Classic Resident Evil games. Overall a decent game, and a MUST PLAY for fans of the genre and Film.",

But here's the deal: I'm just under 4 hours into this game, and I'm underwhelmed. The cool stuff I've seen is all lifted from RE4 and RE5, mostly. The scenery and gameplay reminds me of parts of the recent Tomb Raider game...but Tomb Raider did it better. The graphics and character controls are, quite bluntly, ugly and clunky here--they made me want to go back and replay a GOOD game, like Alan Wake...which is like, 4 years old and looks WAY better. Alan Wake has a much better story as well, no contest. I'm pretty much bored with this game and doubt I'll finish it. Meanwhile, it got me interested in going and and replaying both Alan Wake and Tomb Raider. So save your money on this one, buy those two if you haven't already. They are much better games.

Everything about this game, mainly gameplay, is well executed minus a few hiccups here and there when walking.   The story, as many have complained about, is good but many expected the story line to be spoonfed to them in cut scenes. This game basically takes the perspective of Sebastion Castellanos and the player meaning you both have no idea what's going on. All that you know is that you need to do your job as a detective to figure out who's behind the foul play while protecting those alive. The story unfolds as you progress and pick up assortments of documents spread throughout the game. The only things the cutscenes provide in this game are the situations you will be facing at the moment and a little bit of story behind the antagonist. This is a story where most of the back story is being told by documents in the game rather than cutscenes.The DLC is also great in it's own right because it further explains what is actually going on while Sebastion is trying to fulfill his duty as a detective.   Overall the game has tons of elements to scare the player and keep them on their toes. With the Akumu difficulty, the tension only rises because one hit is an instant kill. If you're looking for a great survival horror experience much like Resident Evil 4, without all the ammo, then this what you should play. As a fan, this game did not disappoint!",

The Evil Within composes of incredible cutscenes and fantastic gruesome environment be it the death scene or some cheeky undead fellow following you around the hallway trying to disfigure you as much as they did to him. With every weapons uncovered along the chapters and interesting weapon upgrades, the game brings about the deep darkness of a person's mind and twist it with love from jealousy and pain.  The only thing it's lacking are good character introductions, more enemy varieties, more weapon advancement and longer storyline. The only character known is the main character but the others are just some lackey that follows you around in some chapters and never to be seen again, whether there are MIA or well....... dead. While the enemies you face are plenty and has unique body effects but most of them are quite repetitive. The story could have been longer, by introducing the other side characters more and would probably get better with more weapon upgrades. Since after several play throughs, after maxing out all my weapon upgrades, the enemies still pose a threat no matter the difficulty level and certain weapon ammunition can't be found throughout the game. Although with the chainsaw and the bloody death scenes, The Evil Within still gives a good vinyl music added to the background to at least make it more terrifying.  I would recommend to play with headphones since the environmental background music can affect your intensity level. The Evil Within still captivates me with conspiracy, action-pack and awesome upgrades throughout the entire game and deserves to be played a second or third playthrough. Overall, if you love resident evil games or the movie SAW, then this game might just be your cup of tea.  Overall: 8.5/10 Pros:  *Fantastic grahics and good sound effects *Awesome storyline *Good music  Cons:  *Stories are too short *Need more variety of enemies *Need more weapon upgrades  *Updated 25/11/2016 - Please make this into VR I would buy the edition of the game",

The story itself ranges from 'passable' to 'quite impressive', with many of the latter chapters making up for the terrible writing at the beginning. If you stick with it, you will probably quite like it!  Gameplay wise, it is very close to RE4, albeit not as well-balanced as that, and on occasion you will die purely because of the controls being a tad 'slow', but in many cases your death will be because you didn't watch your surroundings, you didn't hide in time or you simply got a bit too careless.   The soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired, sadly, with many of the chapters making use of the same background music, or on occasion none at all, which doesn't necessarily make sense and it just missing.  The environments on the other hand are mostly really well done, some of the levels are really well thought-out and tie in together very well. There are a few instances where textures are still loading in (due to the game, not the hardware) which distract a little, but other than that the environments are great.  The game has gotten a lot of mixed reviews. Personally I liked it a lot once I got towards the middle of the game, so I urge you to stick with it and you'll hopefully enjoy it.  The single player campaign can be completed in around 7-9h, it is worth replaying in my opinion, you get a couple more decent weapons, and you can collect a lot more hidden extras. I urge you to find all the map pieces, you might like the outcome ;)  The DLC itself is okay and adds a bit more to the main story as you are getting to know the main characters a bit better and see their experiences in this nightmare.

Thankfully the game doesn't falter when it comes to atmosphere and the confusing/detached characters add to the mystery of 'what is going on in this place?'  I'll keep it short and sweet. The gameplay is enjoyable, the locations and options to explore every nook and cranny is very satisfying. Enemies do not revive if you blow up their heads, but they do return if you unload ammo into them and do not burn the body, ala 'Crimson Head' from Mikami's beloved Resident Evil REmake for the Gamecube (and now all other platforms!). The upgrade system works well and combat is awkward, especially aiming, which in my opinion only adds to the horror element.   It might seem strange for me to say, but in your first playthrough you should try and play on Hard (if you are looking for a good experience). I managed well on Normal, but felt mid-way that if I had increased the difficulty I would have less ammo to blast away and would be more concerned about how I approached each enemy encounter.  Yes, the gameplay does point towards Resident Evil 4 a lot, and it's to be noted that the characters are quite dull and do not respond to their surroundings accordingly, with Sebastian (main character) seemingly unaffected by the warps in his surroundings and the enemies too. He never panics, he never freaks out and screams, he simply keeps his lips sealed and walks on through. Like Leon, just... with no personality.   Nevertheless, Evil Within is an enjoyable game and the Season Pass was worth the money I put into it. It's no REmake, RE4 or Silent Hill but it does a fantastic job and keeping you interested throughout.   A solid 8/10. Not perfect, and not bad. Just right.",

            "review_text": "I'm glad that I picked this game up on a Steam sale once, because it is not even vaguely worth full price and the cost of DLC. Let's go point-by-point:  Plot: Something about some kind of psychology experiments on mental patients, who are now some kind of monsters. Mental hospitals with immoral experiments conducted on patients have been a horror plot device for as long as horror has been a genre, so this is totally unoriginal. You will have an impossible time connecting with the characters, who are pretty much carved out of wood and very hard to get into. We've got our emotionless hard-boiled badass cop, his comparatively weak and uninteresting straight-arrow sidekick, their hot chick (who runs around in heels, by the way, which seems impractical) damsel in distress, the mental patient with weird insights (again, trope city), and our scary antagonist who seems to be motivated by... well, nothing but being evil really. As another reviewer mentioned, you will get something approaching character development for about fifteen seconds when the protagonist talks about his drinking problem and his personal life, but then it's gone and you're back to shooting people. Why are you shooting people? Why have you ended up where you are? You'll eventually get your backstory but it's apparently at the end of the game. I can't even play to the end, it's such an uninspiring story. I just wiki'd it and saved myself a few hours.  Graphics: Not too bad, honestly, once you set the frame rate right and get rid of the black bars. Not setting the world on fire, but not bad.  Audio: Stock audio clips galore! I kept expecting to hear a Wilhelm somewhere. The music isn't particularly good for instilling dread and it's not very good at keeping with a theme, which brings us to...  Design: I didn't look up anything about the making of this game before buying it. You'll recognize immediately upon starting to play that this is a Japanese-made game, which means cultural presentation is going to be clumsy as far as how characters interact and their displays of emotion, as well as certain style/theme choices. Some people enjoy that, I'm not a huge fan. The overall 'mood' for the game is a complete mishmash. It's kinda like the TV show Archer where you're not supposed to have any clue what year it is. Why is there a 1940s mental hospital in the middle of what appears to be a modern city? Why is the apparently modern city right next to country bumpkin ruralsville? The clothing for the protagonist and the other male cop looks like it's pulled from some 1980s detective show, while the damsel is wearing heels for no reason except I guess she's supposed to be sexy and worthy of saving. Some of the monsters are more original-looking than others but none really stand out stylistically in the same way that, say, necromorphs in Dead Space did. You've got your people in the village with scary farm implements (trope), you've got your mutant dog thing with an extra mouth, you've got your weird thing with some human characteristics but too many limbs (trope), you've got your chainsaw dude (trope), you've got your butcher guy (trope). Basically, the memorable villains were all recycled.  Speaking of recycled things, one of the main guys apparently was a big influence on RE4. RE4 was a pretty solid game, nothing against it (it's a third of the price, go buy it instead!), but this game borrows too liberally from it. We get it, cults are scary and insane rural village people with farm implements intended for murder are scary. I mean even the Spanish influence was similar, given that most of the characters have Spanish last names. You've already done it, go do something else!  As for scariness, I'll admit I'm a wuss, but even the horror elements aren't that scary. Torture porn and boatloads of gore have been done and aren't that scary, and it feels like the game's go-to element for scaring you is putting more blood and guts on the screen. The crouching figure in the corner that turns around and they're scary and the game screams at you? It's been done to death, and this game loves to pull that on you.  Gameplay: Here's the ultimate indictment of the game. It just isn't that much fun. Gunplay is clumsy at best, camera angles aren't great, the mechanics like shocking yourself with green goo to upgrade yourself and your weapons feel stupid, and it feels like it wanted to be a shooter but just couldn't bring itself to be a decent shooter. You've got your same basic set of weapons (revolver because nobody knows what year it is, pump shotgun, sniper rifle, and crossbow with KRAZY ELEMENTAL BOLTZ) that are in a ton of games, but none really stand out. Bosses can pretty much all one-hit-kill you, too, which sucks.  Conclusion: 4/10 on a good day. You're playing a middling horror movie that lasts too long. Treat it like a bad horror movie and watch it on YouTube. Use the money you save to go buy some tasty food to eat while you watch. Much more enjoyable.",

I haven't played a Resident Evil game since 5, which was a huge disappointment for me, so it was good to see that this was definitely more along the lines of what that series used to be about. Though this is not a RE game, it definitely felt like it could've been. Enemies definitely acted 'zombie-like' and didn't talk at all, aside from the main antagonist. That said, the tone was creepy, the visuals impressive and combat engaging. For those reasons, I'd recommend this game to any survival horror fan. If you're not a survival horror fan, or don't know if you are, I'd suggest checking out this game, Amenisia, Silent Hill 2, or RE 0-4 and code veronica. Those are all solid games.",

            "review_text": "I see this game getting a lot of negative reviews for weird reasons. So, I figured I weigh in to help balance the scale.  Firstly, if you're on the fence about buying this game because the system requirements state you need an i7 or equivalent that's BS. I don't know who wrote that but they probably own stock in Intel. My rig is as follows: Intel Core 2 Quad 6600 8gb DDR2 RAM GeForce GTX 750 Ti (Gigabyte version; 2gb DDR5vRAM) It runs the game without issue at 1920x1080 resolution, 60FPS, all optional graphical elements enabled. You can check my screenshots if you want to know what that looks like, all screenshots are either gameplay or actively rendered cut scenes. I didn't cap any pre-rendered cut scenes as it is not an accurate portrayal of how the game will look during game play.  Ok, technical out of the way. This is a Shinji Mikami game. That's the creator of the Resident Evil series. I'm talking oldschool Resident Evil, not guns blazing infinite ammo RE6. Resources are extremely limited, if you want to run through levels downing scores of enemies move on, this is not your game. Finding a way to isolate your enemies and take them out without utilizing consumable resources is the goal here. Running and hiding rather than fighting will often be the best course of action, especially early in the game.  Lastly, you will die, a lot, accept this. This is not a forgiving game. You are simultaneously rewarded and punished for exploration. If you find a secret area or cache of weapons you better believe it's either booby trapped or swarming with enemies... or both.   Is this a game everyone can enjoy? No. Most current generation gamers don't have the patience to play a game at the pace this one requires. If you're a fan of the previous generation games that gave you next to nothing and told you to save the world, this game will oblige.",

Mikami revolutionizes many ideas present in Resident Evil 4, and brings back a great, sinister, brooding world, ready to end you at any moment. This is not a return to classic survival horror, nor should it be. It is the next step forward in the ideas Mikami intially created. In my opinion, this is a high quality game, and I haven't enjoyed a survial horror title of this caliber since Dead Space 2. The Akumu difficulty does show some flaws in the gameplay, that if fine tuned a tad more, would cause less frustration on the higher difficulties. However, it is still extremely rewarding upon completion. This game may not be the 'scariest', but it has some incredibly tense moments and chapters (ie Chapter 4,7,9 etc), that are blended very well with the less intense moments. I highly recommend this game and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

            "review_text": "My first couple of playthroughs on survival difficulty were very enjoyable. It's gory and creepy with Shinji Mikami's classic RE4 style combat and a nice helping of stealth mechanics. The boss fights are varied and fun and you're constantly being introduced to new enemies. Also in typical Shinji Mikami fashion, the story devolves into nonsense by the end, although I ended up liking some of the characters more than I expected to.  Visually the game is beautiful. I've never played a game where the darkness felt so imposing and dense, without ever being frustrating, but rather tense as you hear the gurgles and growls of enemies emanating from unlit corners and hallways. Speaking of growls, the sound design is also excellent.  The game falls apart to me once you play it on AKUMU difficulty. If you look up guides to beat AKUMU they all revolve around breaking the AI and using various exploits. The games mechanics aren't balanced for this difficulty and so you have to beat AKUMU by essentially cheating.  I didn't care for the DLC either. 'The Assignment' and 'The Consequence' revolve around the slightly awkward stealth mechanic, but without the ability to resort to combat when you're inevitably discovered. 'The Executioner' is basicly a first person melee combat game which is nowhere as fun to play as the main games combat.  I was determined to get all achievements and if you're an achievement hunter prepare to get frustrated. Beyond the issues with AKUMU mentioned above there's an achievement for speedrunning the game. I don't mind speedruns, but this should have been delegated to an online leaderboard, rather than encouraging players to speedrun what is mean to be a slow paced atmospheric horror experience. There's also an achievement for ignoring an entire aspect of the games mechanics: the upgrade system.  Green gel  is an item Sebastian is rewarded with for exploring and defeating enemies, that he can use to upgrade his skills and weapons. Why make an achievement encouraging players to disregard an entire game mechanic?  with all that said I still recommend the game. It's gory RE4 style fun with a couple of good jumpscares, but if you go for all achievements the game will severely outstay it's welcome.",

Should you try to sneak kill the enemies around the corner? Is it worth it to shoot them dead? After every encounter, you know you have some sort of downtime, and you want to jump for joy, but it still keeps you on edge with its atmospheric music and the noises the environments so brilliantly use. Some people compare this to Resident Evil 4, but it's nothing like it. This is a game where you make decisions based on how much ammo you may have (or not have) and want to risk using that precious bullet. Also, it's gory. Very gory.

Apparently if you're not XBox aim-aid drone, you can't play. Game assumes that PC uses 4:3 aspect ratio, in result it squeezes picture into what must be 'Wide' screen. Of course, on wide monitor that creates ridiculous aspect ratio ( 2.5:1 ?), with picture distorted and a risk of motion sickness for player present.  There is debug console hidden. It can be activated by this: 1. In Steam, right click on The Evil Within and select 'properties,' then under the General tab hit 'set launch options.' 2. Put this in to unlock the console: +com_allowconsole 1 3. Once the game has launched, hit the Insert key to bring down the developer console  ***How to remove black bars***  -'r_forceaspectratio 0' (without quotes) if you want to completely disable the black bars. This zooms picture a little though, but on wide screen distortion is gone. on W screen picture still will have distorted proportions (i.e, a cube will look like a parallelepiped)  -'r_forceaspectratio 2.5' if you want to get the black bars again with the default size.  ***How to remove the 30fps cap***  -Select the game from Steam library, right click on it and select properties.  -Add '+com_allowconsole 1' (without quotes) to Launch Options from General tab.  -Run the game and open the console with 'insert' key.  -'r_swapinterval 0' (without quotes) for fully unlock the fps.   -'r_swapinterval -1' (without quotes) for 60fps cap.   -'r_swapinterval -2' (without quotes) for 30fps cap, this is the default value.  I'm still trying to figure out if possible to enable mouse in game (again). The engine itself supports mouse, game was KNOWN to support mouse, apparently it was disabled with an update  Edit: mouse works. SHould ensure two things: play ONLY in fullscreen and do not switch between apps when in title menu. If mouse would move to different window or screen, game fails to detect it as an input device. Steam overlay bugs out too. It's a little of random thing, similar to Skyrim bug with visible mouse cursor. But when system mouse cursor becomes visible, game stops to grab mouse events. For 1080p screen one should use aspect ratio of 1.77 instead of 0 (I suppose 0 stands for default AR)   Game itself? It's an eclectic, surreal take on Resident Evil (made by creator of Resident Evil 1), but with completely different theme. Plot is impossible to describe, the game is gory and icky, but lots of details placed into scenes allow to play minigame of finding 'reasons' for everything that happens. If you liked games like Bioshock, Alone in the dark, Amnesy, FEAR - that's your game. FEAR meets Resident Evil. Otherwise I won't recommend it, for its clunkiness and weirdness.",

I am a big fan of resident evil, but don't get me wrong, the sequels of resident evils are just limiting themselves to finding guns and solving puzzles. This game is a bit different. You can hide, sneak up to the monster, distract it or just run past. Also, the player can fatigue out if you run too fast and that is what makes it a bit more challenging than Resident Evil series. I loved Resident Evil 6 inspite of all the news floating around that it is too dark. It is not. You just need to get the darkness settings right. And i love Evil within as well. It keeps you guessing. The graphics are brilliant. What I don't like is the character movement. While walking or running or sneaking past, it is fine. But sometimes, it tends to jogs around. It is not smooth like resident evil series when the player jogs like that. But it does not hassle me enough since the game is brilliant in other departments. Somehow this game reminds me of my all time favorite 'Resident evil 4'. And yes, it is not as scary as outlast or alien isolation but it does gets you moving at times. I will not compare this game to Resident evil 6. That would be unfair to both the games. I love both.",
