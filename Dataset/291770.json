    "description": "Halloween celebrations are in full swing, in the lonely harbour town of Saxton. Ghost-hunter, Nigel Danvers, doesn't believe the night is any different. He knows that ghosts exist, so why would tonight be any different? Nigel and his ghost-hunting partner, Lucy Reubans, are in for a supernatural surprise.",

I was sorry when it was over! I only had one issue with the dancing but everything else ran smoothly .  Totally recommended! (I may have to play it again...)  Cannot WAIT for Blackenrock.",

            "review_text": "As the original game was one of my very favorites, I was delighted to see this short interlude game appear on Steam. I personally hadn't had a clue there was such a thing in the works! But I snapped it up the minute I saw it, and I'm completely delighted by it.  As a caveat, you will want to have played The Last Crown (original game) before you play this, or you will lose a good chunk of pretty much everything in the translation.  Playtime runs about 3-4 hours depending on how much you lollygag around, or in my case, wander off to answer the phone and forget to shut it off.  From a technical standpoint, this game continues on the same atmosphere as the original; graphics, sounds, scenery, and character design are the same. Nigel's slightly-odd voice mannerisms are also still there (but for some reason, I find his somewhat Shatner-esque pauses endearing rather than irritating). It appears all previous voice actors reprised their roles.  From a plot standpoint, it's not particularly deep like it's predecessor, but it's not supposed to be. As a Halloween short and interlude between main games, it's perfect. Short and sweet, but leaving some questions which I suspect will lead into the next main game.  Gameplay is also the same as the previous game. Inventory, navigation, dialogue, etc. are similar if not identical. The ghost-hunting mechanics are very similar but have been souped up a little to give the player somewhat more control over the situation rather than taking static pictures and whatnot, and I appreciated that a lot.  All in all, this is worth it especially if you enjoyed the previous game. I know that I, at least, am waiting impatiently for the next installment of this series!",

There are repetetive dialog situations in this mini game which could be ironed out but Johnathan has preserved the believable ghostly atmosphere that makes me addicted to these adventures and eagerly awaiting more - soon for Christmas please!",
