Technically the game is infinite as it is procedurally generated, but figuring out procedurally generated puzzles is not as fun as say, having a little min campaign. Maybe tell us who the people are in the cabins that we are burning down?  Anyways, Check it out.          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  ArsonVille - Burninating the Countryside&nbsp;",
