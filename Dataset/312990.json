Basically just a small taste (demo) of BroForce but worth replaying in single player or co-op for speed-run bragging rights. Moreover, it's free. A big thank you to Free Lives and Devolver Digital.  EDIT: 2014-08-08. There have been both positive and negative reviews complaining about frame-rate issues, including one reviewer with an nVidia GTX 760. While I have a GTX 660, I have only played the game on a pair of other PCs, both of which have an AMD Radeon R7 260. Not once did I experience any frame-rate issues and these cards are inferior to the GTX 760. While I don't doubt the reviewers problems perhaps the game is less optimized for nVidia cards. I'll play on my PC over the weekend and comment here if I have any issues.",

If you enjoy playing those types of games, then you might enjoy this one.   The Expendabros is the Expendables version of Broforce. It has almost all the characters from the movie, all with different weapons and special weapons. This game is a lot of fun and offers a lot for nothing. Broforce costs money, but this is a stand alone and completely free. The game runs very well and so far I have yet to come across a single bug, even if I did, I didn't notice it. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone wanting a fun, free game to play.",

            "review_text": "The Expendabros was released in order to promote Broforce (a game by the same developers) and The Expendables 3, which is the movie that inspired the characters found in The Expendabros.  This is mostly a one hour long demo of the more intricate Broforce. With that said, I had fun playing what was there and I am now more interested in Broforce and at least curious about The Expendables movies. Graphically speaking, the pixel art is great. There is much attention to detail given to the backgrounds, to the explosions and to all characters (both friendly and enemy). The controls are tight and responsive while the sound design matches the artwork's polished quality. The overall presentation and feel of the game are its shining points despite being promotional software. To be fair, this game may be deserving of a small price tag even though it's only one hour in length.  Each of the playable characters are well thought out and play completely different from each other in regards to the weapons used and their special attacks. Concerning these playable characters, an interesting design choice has been made, as the player is not allowed to choose which character to use. As you rescue prisoners scattered throughout the levels and as you die, the game randomly selects a playable character for you. This means that even if you may have a go-to character for maximum damage or if you prefer playing with this or that character, the game forces the player to become familiar with all available characters. It's also important to mention that the game froze on the second to last level once and the controller bindings menu was totally glitched visually. In the end, this is a high quality, short promotional game that is worth the hour it offers of fun.  The Expendabros is good.",

The Expendabros is a 2D sidescroller where you play as the main cast of the Expendables 3, and your job is to infiltrate a variety of locations and, well, to cause carnage and destruction.  Each character that you can play as has their own methods of killing, as well as their own unique special ability, ranging from knife throwing, to grenade launchers. This also adds some degree of strategy to the levels, because where one weapon will be optimal, another could cause you to meet your death. I haven't found a way to swap between team members on the fly, but maybe that was intentional. Most of the game is somewhat easy, but there are a couple of challenging boss fights in the late stages.  The game is kind of short (took me less than a couple of hours to complete), but it's packed with fun and is free to play. In addition to the top notch combat, you also have a cool narrator voice, some high pitched enemy screams, and at times some epic music.  After playing through this, I'm now interested to check out the original game, Broforce.",

Unfortunately I'm an adult now and have errands to run. I'd rather be an Expendabro full-time.  Don't expect in depth gameplay. It's a fun button masher that does require some basic skills - get hit once and you're dead. But for a quick pick up and play it's fantastic. I definitely recommend Expendabros.",

I know, it's wrong, but after time i spent in-game, i can hazard a guess that i saw everything The Expendabros has to offer.   The Expendabros is 2D action platformer. As store page says, it's some kind of variation about 'THE EXPENDABLES 3'. Your goal? Get from left side of the map to right side, free your 'bros' and kill the bad guys. In as bloody way as you can. Simple. Game looks like typical Hollywood war movie: pumped up hero moves through countless enemy soldiers, destroying everything he can. And you know what? Even if it sounds boring and pathetic,   it can be enjoyable.   Especially when mixed with fully destroyable environment, tones of explosive barrels (2 types, one just blows up, and second flies up into the sky, destroying everything on it's way) and saws.   Heroes. Game allows us to play as one of seven characters, based on movie series. How are they diffrent? Apart of looks? Weapons. While game gives us three types of attacks (promary, special, wchih needs to be reffiled with ocassional ammo, and of course, meele), all characters attack in diffrent way. So, one rushes with two guns and sticky grenades as special, other throws cloud of knifes, or plays knife artillery, throwing them into air, another shoots with shotgun filled with incendiary ammo, and throws incendiary grenade. And thoose are only three characters. Every attack (excluding meele, same for every character) destroys place. Map gets torn apart by us, enemies, explosives, so after our game, it looks worse than worlds economy. All of this to see comical 'area liberated' after victory.  While playing, you encounter guys walking around (thay can be armed to help you) and cages. Player has to destroy cage and free his bro. Freeing enough of them unlocks new character. Maybe it sounds nice, seeing al characters and choosing one, your favourite to play with, but no.   One thing, that I really didn't like in the game is how random your character is assigned.   There's no way (or maybe i just didn't found one) to pick your favourite muscle, and how often do they change? Well, random one at the beggining of the round, randon change after freeing prisoner, and random one after death. We should be hurry to love our heros because they are gone so fast. Other thing that bugs me are controls on keyboard. I played on WASD, so fight keys are TYU. Claustrophobical, isn't it? Even though you can change controls, a) i think that developers should make a good default settings, to make game good for begginers; b) settings are aviable only in main menu. You can't change them after starting game. And you have to just look at them before play, because there's no tutorial. If you want to play, you have to figure everything out by yourself. Maybe it's better on the controller (full supported). Want to play with friends? Local Coop only. Still better that no multiplayer mode at all, right?  Even though problems listed above, i think this game is woth giving it a go. Especially, it's free to download untill December. Unless you are tired of american pathriotism, american flag, and american movies.",

You're always stuck with whichever one is assigned to you. 2) The game doesn't let you change out your weapons, making Point 1 even more frustrating. 3) The AI allies are stupid, not even being able to follow you up a wall with their knives (which is a really cool method for climbing a wall, by the way) And 4), and maybe this is the root of all my problems with it, THIS GAME IS BUGGY AS ALL HELL. Menu screen problems, button prompts that don't always appear or even function when they do, broken frames and cutscenes that stall all the time. You know, for a low-res game like this, these things should not be happening! Risk of Rain and Papers Please didn't have any of these problems. Take a look at how long I've played this game. Every problem I've listed took THAT long to appear. Hell, I couldn't even get past the second mission because of how broken the game is. My advice: stay away from this game until they patch it up.

But beyond that, it's also INCREDIBLY fun!  It'd be a real challenge to beat this one in single player, despite the checkpoints and infinite continues -- but this is a game that's really MEANT to be played with some bros anyway. The gameplay reminds me quite a bit of 'Metal Slug' more than anything else, but the rag-doll physics, explosions, and destructible stage and background elements take it to a whole new level of insanity.  Literally... when my little brother and I played through this game, we were laughing like little kids to the point of tears. ESPECIALLY at the ending 'interrogation'.   While it is a bit short, that is totally okay for such an amazingly fun (and challenging!) free game such as this. Even so, there's quite a bit of replay value due to all of the different characters. At first it irked me being randomly assigned characters, but I really think it's a strength after playing the game more. It really adds to keeping everything feeling fresh and absolutely insane the entire way through the game -- and you will unlock plenty more 'bros' as you make progress.  Based on the strength of this freeware game, I've just now picked up 'Broforce' as well -- and truly cannot WAIT to play it with some bros! If you're into old-school platformers, run-and-gun games, or anything fun in general, do yourself a favor and get this one.",
