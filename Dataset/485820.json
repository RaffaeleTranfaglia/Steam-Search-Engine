            "review_text": "This game gets alot of unfair critism because it's hard and slightly rough around the edges. But the premise of the game is good. Its a survival game, and survival is hard. Yes, there are various issues with the game that are not working ideally, but the development team has been very active and is working diligently on patches now. They have gone so far as to help individual users with virtually any question or problem, just ask. This is not a sign of abandonware or a money grab. It's a n unexperienced development team that's trying as hard as they can to make a quality product. This is worthy of anyone who enjoy's survival game genre support.  Yes, its not an easy game. There is alot to learn, and there are a few rough and buggy bits... but it's getting better, and will have a huge replayability factor once it's completed.",

Ok it isn’t a fast pace – real time game but it isn’t trying to be! There is a LOT to think about and to learn in this game, it is very in depth. And to think that has been created by a solo developer, I am impressed! Thumbs UP!",

If a game makes me want to come back to play more then its got my vote. As with most new games it may need a few patchs or fine tuning but time will tell.  UPDATE: Animal attacks are far to often. Even after a update. Every time I go out to chop wood I get attacked. Then the game changes to treat wounds and stop bleeding sim. Put me right off a great game. I hardly touch it now. Dam shame.",
