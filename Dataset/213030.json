            "review_text": "This is part 3 of the episodal penny arcade series of 4. NOTE: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. I PERSONALLY RATE THIS GAME AS 'A' FOR ADULTS.  This game is quite different than the previous games in the series. First off, it is now more traditionally a rpg in this game..the comic book style in previous games are gone and have been replaced by rpg goodness. This may turn off people that played the 2 previous games, but i think it is much better this way. Also, if you wonder what happened to your character from the previous 2 games, there is short little side game that answers that question in the game. Note that you must be used to this game to try the extra mission.  I actually like the changes they did for this game. Anyways, i recommend playing the first 2 games because the storyline is required for this series. Recommended game for new rpg aspects in it and fun dialogue and humour.",

            "review_text": "Zeboyd Games (of Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death VII and Molly the Were-Zompire fame) have done it again.  Penny Arcade is a web-comic that follows Tycho and Gabe through various scenarios. And they've been put into a game where Tycho is trying to end the universe before anyone else gets the opportunity.  Now, I haven't played the first two games but I don't feel that missing out on them is too big a worry for these, they're still highly enjoyable. It's an RPG, turn based combat. There's a load of classes atop the main class for each character. Tycho's a scholar, Moira's a Gumshoe, Jim is a Necromaster and Gabe is... well, Gabe (I forgot what his class is).  The story is humorous, the same humor that you get from Cthulhu Saves the World only not as meta (until the fourth one but that's another game review).  If you've played any old school RPG like Final Fantasy before it went 3D, or anything along similar lines, I recommend this to you.",

The class system it pretty good, but at the same time, a little confusing. I recommend getting moves that cause damage over time as quickly as possible.",

Filled with the typical Penny Arcade humor, this makes a fine third installment to the Penny Arcade Adventures series.",

However nothing in this game clicked with me, I did not enjoy the humor, I dislike the design of the world map, the combat is much less fun than in the previous games, I have never been a fan of the pixel art style so not enjoying that was no surprise. In short, it feels like an amateurish RPGmaker game, and god knows there's plenty of those already (even on Steam).  I did only play the first hour of this episode though, perhaps it becomes more enjoyable after that, but they lost me.",

The class pin system especially shines here, letting you build very interesting and unorthodox multi-class characters that are capable of some really interesting things.   The writing is hilarious, the story is interesting, the art is great, and it's so full of charm and fun that I couldn't put it down. It's also got some great little hidden gems in it, especially if you're a fan of Zeboyd Games in general. It's a well-crafted experience put together with a lot of care.   This is, all in all a fantastic game. It should appeal to anyone who loves the old SNES-era JRPGs.",

            "review_text": "It has some quirky writing which some people might appreciate and the games combat is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy 5 and 6. However the games uniqueness and quirkyness quickly gets tiresome; after reading way too much text that ultimatley says nothing and fighting way too many unnecessary battles that are way too easy the game is boring.  The pacing is also very bad with the game giving you too many jobs at once with some being very overpowered and others being totally useless. Nice graphics and unnecessary words doesn't make for a good game.  It's not a bad game by any means but if it's not up your alley then you will quickly get bored of the overuse of superfulous words and overly intelligent themes. I don't think the series spans four games because the games are good but instead they did it so they can try and sell it as good.",

Second, the music doesn't play for me -- and based on comments around the internet, I'm not the only one. I followed a few different steps and nothing helped. Oh, well, since a visit to Youtube showed it was chiptunes so I'm good.  Look, I love old games. I have hundreds of them, I own a damned arcade machine... but give it a rest, developers. It only stands out when you're unique, not one of thousands.  If this game didn't have the Penny Arcade writing and humour, it'd be hot garbage through and through.   edit: The DLC has a solid story, but unfortunately the same derivative JRPG gameplay. It's worth playing, though. OtRPoD 3 is darker than the first two games, and at first I wasn't sold, but I think it's good, especially when taken with the DLC.",
