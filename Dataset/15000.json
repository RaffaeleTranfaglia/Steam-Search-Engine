            "review_text": "I loved Raven Shield and Rainbow six earlier games, so it saddens me to say how much of a let down this game is. The best to explain how this game relates to its predecessors is by calling it a dollar store version, its as if they sucked the budget out of the game. Do not purchase this game and support shoddy game development. This game has some elements earlier games which I like, such as the realism/fragility of life, tactics etc., but spend a dollar to make a decent game, a disgrace to Mr. Clancy. There are a number of reasons to give a game a bad review, but perhaps the worst is to call it unfinished, where its creators mailed it in.   Simply put, Rating 2/10",

Tom Clancy must cry himself to sleep at night thinking about how Ubisoft has ruined his name in gaming. A name that once stood for the highest quality now means next to nothing.",

Seriously, i tell my team to breach and clear an open area and 5 times out of 10 they stannd near the door. The hostages? they run into gunfire. Luckily the hostages dont do that so often.

            "review_text": "2/10  Horrid game.  Easily the worst Rainbow Six and possibly one of the worst FPS ever made.  + For that time it had good graphics (only good thing I can think of)  - no tactic at all required, you can go full Rambo - it is not a tactic shooter or a Rainbow Six game - Ai is hopeless - motion/movement of NPCs is absurd and unrealistic to the max. - NPC damage models are random - guns sound worse than cheap firecrackers - guns have a borderline meaningless damage output, no sense of danger - guns have very limited customization which again have no purpose because, - a)when using sights, Ai will go into breakdance mode and avoid bullets better and faster than Batman - b)silencers have no impact on Ai behavior, they smell you coming anyway - basically no story - amateur voice acting - absolutely useless team commands, they did a good job later in R6Vegas - player movement speed is either Usain Bolt fast or Grandma after hip surgery slow, no inbetween  I bought it only so I can finish the 'story'.",

It's challenging but not impossible and it uses really good tactics. You can't rambo style this game. This game can be forgiving but it will also throw you into the cold. I would recommend this over 90% of modern age shooters. 10/10 for me!",
