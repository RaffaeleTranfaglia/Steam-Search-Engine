It looks very appealing and overall I really enjoyed of the puzzles although there were three of them that frustrated me just because of game mechanical reasons. There are some optional puzzles that are partially very hard, and extra stuff that you can do but don't have to do is something I already liked alot in The Night of the Rabbit.  I'm looking forward to the other part of the game and fully recomend this one if you are into this niche games.",
