            "review_text": "This game was AWESOME!  I loved this game honestly. I think it's just that I have a love for pixel games and RPG's so when you put the two together you know you're going to get a good game!  There was a ton about this game that I really liked. There were also a few complaints I had though. The major one was how short the game is.   Just know that if you buy this game you will only be playing it for a few hours before the game just abruptly ends...It's honestly sad how little hours went into this game before the end of the game came up. I wish I could've put in more. I wish I could've used all the spells that were present when leveling up.   I only got to use ONE magic spell, had less then a handfull of weapons, and to be honest the way to save was sort of weird. I would have rathered having recall potions or something to get me back to the saving point (Sort of like Dark Alliance)  All in all it is an awesome game and I recommend playing it!   Pros: -Super fun to play -Awesome pixel art -Funny story line -Lots of fun to play  Cons: -SUPER SHORT -No progressive health regeneration -Weird saving system -NO CO-OP!!!!!!!!   Have fun playing this game and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did!  P.S A word to the developer please put more story and hours into the gameplay. I would soon like to play this again and have enough time to explore the world, use all the magic, and level up my character. (ALSO add online COOP multiplayer PLEASE!)",

For a kids game it has very inappropriate materials, sexual inuendos, off color jokes, should be rated 14+ And the worst of all.. Loading screens.. yep you heard me, 8 bit graphics and loading screens. Be prepared to wait for a loading screen pretty much every time you plan to go outside of the play screen you're looking at.",
