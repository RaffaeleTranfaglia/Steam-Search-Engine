            "review_text": "Note: The Tomorrow War ended up being a 'middle of the road' game for me. It had a lot of potential, but one has to review based on what was, rather than what could have been. I was tossing up if I'd call it a very low positive review or a very high negative review. Given I think the 'average' gamer would struggle with it, I had to go the latter option.  ---    Old looking graphics.  The internal visuals of people interacting look on par with Half Life 1, so late 90's, despite the game being released in 2009. External visuals I didn't mind though. There's something nice about watching the fighters flying in formation. An advantage of lower level graphics, however, was that it allowed for a large number of objects to be on screen at a time. This is especially obvious when flying in asteroid fields.    Short missions with long delays.   The missions you perform in the game are short, often with long auto-pilot sequences with nothing going on. These long flight sequences might be 'realistic', but come across as boring filler to bulk out the game. At times it wasn't clear what you were required to do either, leading to periods of guesswork/trial and error.    Fun dogfights.   While the missions were often short and dull, the dogfights were fun. Long range missiles (requiring lock-on) and short ranged machine guns/lasers. Once your missiles are depleted, you'd often spend most of your time flying in tight circles, trying to get your target back in your sights. The AI could have been better during these fights. Additionally, some variety to the way the AI would fight, especially between different races, would have added to the enjoyment.    Rough dialogue / translations and voice acting.   The game is based on a Russian book series and has assumingly been translated after game release. The dialogue comes off very dry and flat and shows an obvious sign of being directly translated. This means at times, the dialogue isn't making much sense. Voice acting is terrible and at times sounds like computer generated voices. Additionally, while the game has subtitles, they aren't strict to the dialogue and are often played well ahead of the audio.    Very confusing story.   This is in part due to translation issues. The story would often jump all over the place and often quite quickly. For the first half of the game, you'll do a mission or two with one faction, and then you'll be swept off to another, not allowing for any development to occur. The second half of the game was where the 'primary' story takes place, but it too suffered from the story jumping and came across as poorly written (though possibly a translation issue too). I think there was a good story in there somewhere, but I think the developers needed to focus more time on developing and delivering upon it.    Difficult mechanics and lack of tutorial.   While a lot of the piloting mechanics are pretty common for this kind of game, a number of them are hidden away. A good read over the key configurations prior to getting started is certainly recommended (Especially engaging/disengaging planetary engines!). A brief tutorial at the start of the game and/or tooltips could certainly have helped.    Bugs.   The game had a number of bugs and was very rough around the edges. One repeatedly annoying bug was the game's difficulty with collision detection. A number of times you would be required to land on a surface, only to fall through that surface and ultimately die. Another issue (poor design rather than a bug) is that the mission screen would pop up when your mission changed/updated. The problem with this is that you're unable to control your ship until you close it, but the game doesn't pause, resulting in my ship crashing a number of times. A lesser issues were dialogue being played twice, skipped or played in the wrong order.    Lack of polish.   A few little lack of polish items that I'd lastly like to raise: There seems to be a personal inventory system in place that doesn't seem to serve any purpose. It seems like a feature that was discontinued but never removed; At one point you're offered the option to buy information for some side missions that you never really get the opportunity to do anything with; There's a currency system in the game, where for maybe 1/4 of the game, you're required to purchase your own weaponry / ammo with money you're earning on the missions (never enough, mind you). Now this might simply be because during that period, you're a mercenary whereas the rest of the game you're a military pilot, but the concept of the currency persist through the rest of the game.    Conclusion.   The Tomorrow War certain had potential, but I feel it was never probably finished. If you're patient and like space shooters, you might enjoy this game, otherwise it might be best to look for another title.",

            "review_text": "This Reveiwer Simply Reccommends This Game on the merrits of it Programmers, and the Integrity of the 1C Company, who developed the IL2 Sturmovik Combat Flight Simulator. I Encourage the purchase and Exploration of this Game, based on those criteria Alone I have nothing but compliments for Russian Programmers. The Cyrillic language, and the Cyrillic Alphabet that composes it allows for better math, possibly more so than english. It seems to be a linguistic advantage, that translates directly into programming as well as the mathematics. Also discussed will be an opinion on how certain part of the video gaming industry, is commiting crimes against humanity, and against our childrens educational potential. It is solely the reader's resposibility, so informed, to decide if they want to read further.  If you go back and take a look at Janes ATF, and compare it item for item directly with SU-27 Flanker 1.0. Every dam thing in the world that is modeled, is modeled with it's full motion. Just watch those Russian sams articulate every motion, that's just the launchers, then the missiles do everything right too. All flap motion is correct, and the flight physics is 100% authentic. That same principle applied to the entire IL-2 Sturmovik Series also. For its to, nothing could compare, and when real world war II pilots flew the planes they had flown in the war, they reported feeling the same sense of fear, that they had in the real life experience. Those chaps, thend to undertone their war experiences a lot, as I know from family veterans who fought in it... So when you hear the words, :I felt the same sense of dread in cobat, and felt exactly like I was flying my old Spit.', then you know, someone, has definitly not cut any corners. There are some much prettier sims out now, but the same fellow who brought you the IL-2 series is building a new incredible and final-for him at least World War 2 flying sim. Go look for it on steam, as soon it should appear along side or as part of DCS World Complete combat sim. The Polish folks are real good at this stuff too, why do you thing the Witcher Series has been such a smash hit ? But lets face it, We Americans made the most Kick-♥♥♥ controller H.O.T.A.S. available. Especially CH-Pro Combat controllers, that were made in America. When they started trying to make em all in China, they became very unreliable, because China essentially uses slave labor tactics for most of it's production in the export area. The Microsoft X-box factory in China actually has suicide nets to catch the jumpers. Yes Suicide nets. Bill and Melinda Gates should be in prison for life, for allowing and encouraging such atrocities against humanity. And he sold the US school system the COMMON-CORE school program, which he took directly from China's school systems, where brain washing is Job 1. Remember this statement, Common Core is designed to rRemove Critical Thinking Skills, and Replace them with ( Only the ability to solve problems, from resorting to a list of given test choices. Don't believe it ? Then good luck to you, and say goodby to your kid's future.",
