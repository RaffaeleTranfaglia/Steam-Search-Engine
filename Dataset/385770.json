Featuring live leaderboards and a comparatively streamlined design, this clicker title offers you fresh new incentives to qualify for a jolly round of carpal tunnel surgery. I know I'm first in line. That Clicker Heroes is a flash game and this one is made in Unity is about the only difference between the two, so don't expect anything revolutionary.  The only downside I could find is that Time Clickers is even more luck-based than any other title in the genre I played, with beating a boss stage often hinging on getting a random gold drop that suddenly allows you to triple your DPS. I'd prefer the game to be slightly more about picking upgrades cleverly than hoping for a kind RNG.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: This is a review for a free to Play game as as such, you should not take it or any other review seriously. Play it for yourself, it's better that way. It does costs you nothing after all.  Time Clickers is like Clicker Heroes, only in an FPS perspective, simpler and easier to get into and executed atleast 3 time better.  Let's start with my #1 gripe with Clicker Heroes; Prestiging and Prestige Tokens. This game has those, Time Warps and Time Cubes. Time Warps are only unlocked once you get some Time Cubes and have unlocked every ability. Time Cubes give you a permanent 20% boost to DPS (5 of them gives you a 1x boost and so on for example) and this boost stays if you spend them or not. You can buy things from the ability to start at later waves upon a reset, start with more money upon a reset, or doing a very large variety of things into categories of Gold, Damage, Abilities and Clicks.  You can buff individual weapon's DPS by 100% per upgrade, or you can decrease ability cooldowns. If you want, you can increase how much gold you get per box by buffing gold find, and even you can upgrade the number of time cubes you can get.  These Artifacts, as they're called, have anywhere from a single level to 500 and they're all wonderful, not a isngle one is useless.  Gold is given when you kill cubes which are all that enemies are, jsut a collection of cubes, only you slowly destroys parts of an enemy, effectively de-atmoizing them.  Upgrades are often-appearing, 5 being for every range of 100, and a promotion at 100s to gain access to a new range of upgrades in the next 100 levels.  All of these allow for Time Clickers to essentially have no progression walls, which every other idle game and clicker game has. There's more or less just... slow parts, at which poit you should just time warp and get a higher DPS boost so you can power through it.  The game's progression is only fast if you actively play it and is infact designed around it, many abilities buffing the click pistol in ways that make those abilities the most devastating, such as punchthrough, which allows you to ghost-shoot through an unlimited number of cubes, hitting all of them equally in the same line your shots are in.  The game actually feels rewarding, never will you wonder 'Should I spend my cubes, or jsut hold on to them' since... their bonus is never lost. Ever.  All in all, I could rant and rave about this game for literally hours on end, jsut play it yourself, it is literally like any game similar to it, only it does everything better and... it basically makes Cookie clicker and Clicker Heroes look completely boring.  I give this game a 10/10, it is Legendary, what should be the standard for future Clicker/Idle games. Once I get to the highest point, I shall determine if this recieves Godlike status.  As far as I know, there's no bad parts to this game, nothing to gripe about legitimately.",

Im gonna have to blame Kongregate for why I even have a top 10... they have soo dang many clicker games on their site...  But this game is pretty fun, they did a good job with the ascension feature, in some other games like Adventure Capitalist, and Clicker Heros, it just takes soo dang long to make ascending worth it, but this game I could keep ascending once I get to lvl 100 and feel like Im getting something out of it.  The whole shooting the blocks aspect is really well done, It still keeps to the whole defeat this enemy feature of clicker games but you can get that sense of accomplishment for destroying the individual blocks  Over all I would rate this as an 8 or 9 out of 10.",

(plugs ears with fingers)  It's awesome, and you could see that when you set the idle mode on, it works perfectly as I described!! Also sounds like you rain bullets out of an A10 Thunderbird/Warthog main cannon, but it's more of like  an anti-aircraft turret...the one that you saw in the Battleships movie.  Cool, isn't it?

What's fun about this game is that the music is good, and its rewarding when you destroy blocks. I also really love that their is no paywall in this game and the first 7 hours is just addicting. The upgrades feel well done and everything just felt rewarding. And then I finished 100 waves: and then they introduced 'time warps'. Now its a smart idea in concept. When you beat 100 waves you have the option to go back to start and your upgrade process but in return you get 'time blocks' (or something like that I forgot the name), With these blocks you can buy perks that will stay with you forever. And thats how you complete the game, play the game up to wave 100, start again with everything slightly different. And thats when I gave up, I mean what's the point of that?. But this game is still positive for a reason, this game is free and asks nothing; also the file is only 30 mb. So if I spent 7 hours of my time here and had fun? Why the ♥♥♥♥ not recommend this game so you guys can have fun for 7 hours?",

You can never make yourself weaker by spending points early. I am sure there is a optimum path to upgrade through, but it does not matter that much compared to Clicker Heroes.  Oh just a tip.

It started with AdVenture Capitalist and then Clicker Heroes. Time Clickers is my favorite by far out of these. All the other clickers seem to just want you to check in and play them for a few minutes and then leave them alone. With TC I actually want to stay in the game and play it.  The biggest difference with this game is the fact that you're not just clicking on things to kill them, you have a gun that shoots cubes to destroy them. Different colored cubes have different ammounts of health. You get to hire more shooters and upgrade them as well as yourself. There are is a mini boss every 5 levels and a main boss every 10. After defeating any type of boss the game will activate any special abilities you have unlocked for free and let you used them for 30 seconds. Every 100 levels you get Time Cubes. These are the main objective, you use them to permanently increase stats that persist over the course of your game after your resets. Even after you spend them, you still get a 10% DPS bonus for each cube.  I think they thing I love most is that the enemies are built out of cubes. You can see from watching the video how everything looks, you shoot the enemy and slowly chip away at it. I can't begin to tell you how satistying this is, it's what keeps me in the game and actually playing it. I really feel like they want you to play and have fun, not just mess with the game for awhile and then let it idle or only check it a few times a day.   I did my first reset after only a few hours of playing, with most other clicker games, this may take DAYS. If I stayed in the game, I think I could probably do it this time in 30 minutes or so. If you're a fan of these games at all, and you want to feel like you're not wasting your life clicking your way to carpel tunnel, then play Time Clickers.   ",

Sounds like a small thing, but really chances the whole game, great thing! Also nice graphics!  Also, there are some decisions differnt to other Clicker games; The Time Cubes you earn, in contrast to other clicker games, always count towards DPS once activated... even if you use them for upgrading of skills... this makes every run count... as you at least get stronger! Makes the mid to end game a bit easier to grind through...  The concept of differently colored blocks, which are worth different amounts of gold is also very clever!  Soon, there will be IDLE mode (currently you only gain very little money, but you dont progress in levels)... NIce achievements give you a reason to get going and continue. And most importantly, its really F2P.. there is no store, you cant buy anything... just beat the game fair!  9/10.",

Even when I used the simplest, most low-res graphics and animation options I could find in the menu, there was so much going on and so many flashing colors that I actually found myself feeling more stressed as I played. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wasn't prepared for it, and like I said, if you have photo-sensitive epilepsy, it's probably not a good game for you.  Still, I like the idea of this game. Aside from the cosmetic differences, it is pretty much just like any other clicker game I've played. The damage bonuses and special upgrades are structured a little differently than I'd seen before, but it was easy enough to figure out. If you want a nice time-waster and don't mind the hectic, super-bright graphics, go ahead and pick it up.

And it reminded me of the Hogan Alley for NES, mode C, where you were shooting cans with your light gun... Boy, that was fun back in early 90s! But, after the third hundred of hours in 'Time Clickers' passed by, I have to notice, this one is wrong at some point too. I don't see problem spending that much time on some strategy like Civilization or Europa Universalis... but clicker game?  Okay, I'll admit, the math behind this game is much more fair, than in case of 'Clicker Heroes'. We have on the plate: very good visuals, quite original system of grading and levelling... coming from the free-ware project... And only one (but big) downside. To prosper there, you're really supposed to click above 75 million times, crushing some cubes... C'mon, it is not that fun after second thousand of clicks, but this game expect you to go on, and on, and on... Out of the whole variety of clicker games, the one which is not trying to get all my gaming time is the AdventureCapitalist - so far, the only game which works just as supposed from that generic 'idling' genre. As of Time Clickers... I ended up being disappointed and frustrated, like 'where is the end of this thing?' You may laugh at me, but I bet you probably never were stuck walking in the unknown environment for so long, that you have to fall asleep, defenseless against possible critters and other things. Try to get lost in taiga or desert for couple of days, would ya? Bear Grylls style? And when you'll survive, I'd like to talk to you again, about reason behind playing hundreds of hours in clicker games.  Overall mark for game 6.8/10 - it is quite good, for a clicker, really.

Though there are good things about the game such as it being smooth when you aim at the blocks another good thing is that its got its own uniqe in its own way by your shooting at targets. i wouldnt reccoment this game though you should see other reviews and play it if you want to.",

You might read this and think 'it's a clicker game, it can't be different' and I would still agree with you but it's so much less polished than other clicker games and therefore I'd choose those over this.  An actual gripe I have is the DPS system. It's not DPS. The weapons you unlock and level up fire at different speeds and damage is applied individually between them, they don't fire at the same time at a consistent rate. a formation with 1.1b health, should not take over a second to die when I have 2.28c 'DPS' Call it damage. Not DPS.",

Unless you want to be looking at a screen full of cubes for a long time, go download clicker heroes instead.

At first I loved this game: Very relaxing and fun to play with a good song under it. After playing it for weeks on end though, it's become so frustrating I felt like frisbeeing my iPad into the nearest concrete wall. I played without any cheats. Finally, after weeks and weeks of being stuck, playing over 10 hours on most days, I had had enough and continued on PC at 20-50x speed with Cheat Engine just to get a little further I thought optimistically. I was also curious how much longer it would take to get any progress. Here are the facts: After playing actively for about 20 hours at 20-50x speed, continuing from my game on iPad (synced it), I've played the equivalent of at least 400 hours, or 40 days of playing 10 hours straight. That's more than a month, working weekends and with overtime each day! And you know what I got? 60 levels, or 4% further than before! Okay, I could get a lot further, but this was so slow, I got more time cubes restarting the time-line and you need time-cubes to get better and go further in the next time-line. Time-cube gains (artifacts) were all maxed out, so I was increasing as much as I possibly could. And since the game gets slower and slower as you reach higher levels, it will probably take tens of thousands of hours to get much further as it takes exponentially more time. That is thousands of ascentions back to low level, hardly getting any further for all your effort. Hell, it's even tedious at 20-50x speed! A whole day active playing for 4% increase? SUMMARY: You either put years into this game, playing hours per day, or you cheat and even then it is INCREDIBLY slow. NOT recommended!",

The purpose of resetting is to increase your damage to push farther. When that is ofset by the fact that you are increasing enemy health, which I have proof of, then I really have to question what it is that you want your players to do. I am glad that this game did not monetize to me, but I want my time back.",
