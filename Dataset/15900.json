Almost 10 hours that i have spent playing this game is enough to say 'yup, it wasn't waste of money'. If you enjoy 3-match puzzle games then think about getting 7 Wonders II. Maybe not for full price, but on sale - why not.   Keep in mind that it may not work on modern operation systems - i'm still on Windows XP so i haven't got any problems, but if you are using Windows Vista/7/8 then you can have extra trouble getting to run this.  Remember to always check system requirements to avoid any problems.  ",
