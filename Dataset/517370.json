            "review_text": "Pros:  Nice artstyle Pleasant UI Inexpensive Good story, has a bit of mystery.  Cons: Easy, at least after your first playthrough Lacking a bit of depth to the consequences of your actions  I love the artstyle of this game and the UI is pleasant. It's a fun game although I wish you could make it more difficult. I mean, on my first playthrough I only just beat it on the last day (and I'd just like to mention that I've only played story mode), but I'd been a really cautious player. Overly cautious, as it turns out there isn't really that much nessecary managing to do and your actions don't have too much of an effect on you. All consequences are immediate and small.   For example    A rogue asked me to spike a drink and offered money, I took the money but did not spike the drink. He ended up dead and another rogue threatened me 'We won't forget this'. Nothing of depth ever came of that threat. It was just a loss of population amongst a group already at 0% population in my tavern  . Immediate and small.  The price completely justifies this though. I just love the potential this game had (has?).",

It has a wacky storyline filled with mythical creates and folklore which gives a interesting vibe. I wouldn't reccommed buying, theres just not enough content involved.    5/10",

Also, this is a game of little surprises, so if you want to get the most for your money, don't watch any 'Let's Play' videos on Youtube. That said, I'd probably pay the game's asking price just for the soundtrack alone. The music is very well done, and the producer should go on to offer one's services to produce for other products. I say this especially for the mid to late game songs in the advanced factions, but that's to be expected as a reward. Better music is for better playing.",
