It takes myths and legends that have stayed with us for over 2000 years and mix them together with modern gameplay. The game let's you explore murky catacombs and follow along a classic, tragic story.",

The graphics are top notch though and the inventory system was very unique and realistic. The story to this was mediocre at best, somewhat of a cliffhanger, you can envision your own ending. Its only about an hour long sadly, I even enjoyed the scenery and messed around a little but still came out to an hour. Is it great? Naw, is it good? yeah. Its free so try it out, i'm sure if the develepors made a new game that had more to it I would pay for it.",

            "review_text": "Great shorty If I must say. It was quite a good humanitarian adventure with a moral behind it. Aside the fact that the hostile being roaming the maze was as blind as a bat or rather an old granny trying to knit a pair of socks, the game was good. I tried offering some light to the monster, with the torch in hand, so that it could see well, but I don't know why it always slapped me so aggresively and break my skull everytime... I tried making friends with that skinny minotaur, but he rejected me as if he almost yelled : 'I have a boyfriend, beat it' then proceeded to biaatch slap me so ferociously. You're taken, geez, no need to murder me. The violins orchestra behind my back during my adventure amongst the creeping hallways, which were apparently in Medusa's bedroom was quite immersive, although I never managed to give my regards to the musicians. But darn they really like creepy music... Play some Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mozart .. or do a classical-dubstep hybrid to set the mood and kick it up a notch. Good luck with the dubstep part. Throw stones at the monster, it'd be the same thing.  Now jokes aside.. This game was worth the 30 minutes of my life. It was also good for a free-to-play experience. I use the word experience, because that's what it is in my eyes. A short little adventure with a pinch of psychological horror to bug your mind a bit. The reviews speak for themselves. Guru Games did a good job. It had its gaps, I must admit that, but nothing's perfect in this world plus the gaps are so tiny, they're hardly visible unless you're one of those people who try to break the game first and then play it (like me) I enjoyed it, though. Grab it, it's free. Roam a bit in Medusa's secret sex dungeon. You won't regret it",

Even thou the sound effects and the monster you meet are trying to create scary moments.  It wasn't a horrible experience just nothing that got me into being able to recommend it for how it played out for me.  Yes, it is a free game but for me it wasn't something I would recommend just because it is free. It didn't do it for me.",

YES I WOULD i rate it a (8 out of 10 stars) good job :)",

No full screen or higher resolution! * Can't jump higher than 10cm and can't climb at all!

There is a small lore/story in the game and minimal shooting. But mostly you are walking around a creepy environment with great graphics. Takes an hour at most. Turned up volume with quality headphones recommended.  For a summer project made by students, it's awesome.",

For some reason I only found the 2nd one of the father's letters, but not the first. I gave up looking for it pretty soon after walking into some invisible wall. As I continued to explore the temple, sometimes there was creepy music and some visual effects (which were supposed to be creepy too?) but it didn't fit into the atmosphere. To me both was rather annyoing and breaking the immersion. Also I felt like the sound effects were messed up - when I encountered a creature that approached me from the right, I heard it from the left. When I pressed Esc to get to the menu, the window suddenly got bigger and moved to the right. That's the moment I called it quits, as it didn't feel like it was worth to restart the game and finish it.  Tl;dr This game has so much potential, but maybe not as a horror game. The way it is now it's too repetitive. Also the story could be a bit more immersive. At least the graphics are good and the mechancis have potential too - but they're not really used.",
