            "review_text": "For a visual novel about gender-swapped English poets as schoolgirls, the game felt surprisingly personal in the way that it discussed the heavy themes it brought up (suicide, substance abuse, depression, homelessnes, sexual assault, and many others). The characters felt very real in how they interacted with each other, and I often found myself thinking, 'I've had these thoughts before,' in response to the main character's bleak musings. Even in its gloominess, the writing still had many clever little lines that made me laugh. The few times modern world contraptions like phones and the internet are brought up in the narrative, it felt weird and out of place, but not enough to take you out of the game.  The art fits the implied aesthetics of the writing and is generally polished with the exception of some of the characters' awkward poses. The one thing that could use definitely some work is the UI; it got a bit hard to read the text when the backgrounds turned light.   Took about 5 hours to get all four routes, and funny enough, it made me want to sit down afterwards and learn about the Lake Poets. So, there's that video game edutainment angle for you, I guess.   Overall it's a great experience that's well worth the low price.",

            "review_text": "An intriguing visual novel where you can find all extremes between its multiple endings. And you need to be ready for drama, because this story deeps in the idea of love and repulsion.  On the other part, the choices are excessively defined, so you can expect what could happen next.  Nice art and nice music. Although some people can dislike the art because the girls look too young, I think that it can show you that they aren't really mature yet. After all, the are still minors.   Vicious minors.  ",

            "review_text": "I'm a huge fan of visual novels as a general concept, though I dislike the subject matter of most of them (mostly moe, fanservicey dating sims). So it's always a treat when a game like Asphyxia comes along that bucks the trend and offers something unique and interesting.   Asphyxia has a heavy emphasis on themes of depression and suicide, though it's significantly less depressing than its free quasi-prequel, 'Dejection: An Ode' (just look at that title!). I thoroughly enjoyed the story and artwork, and after you finish one of the four endings, you unlock notes on the history of all the famous poets that the characters are based off of, which adds a whole new (often delightfully clever) layer of meaning on top of the game's proceedings. This is truly edutainment at its finest. :D  If you enjoy more serious/non-traditional VN's like  Cinders  or  Analogue: A Hate Story , and don't mind the macabre subject matter and somewhat girly aesthetic, you owe it to yourself to give Asphyxia a try. You're in for a treat.",

            "review_text": "Let me just say that I haven't played many visual-novel style, indie-developed games. Life Is Strange is in my library, because who can resist time travel and the butterly effect colliding beautifully in a French-made game with beautiful indie music backing it? Yes, I compared it to Gone Home in my review, but that comes from its origins within the 3-D walking simulator type of game.   Basically, all you need to know is that Asphyxia is a game in which the major Romantic poets of the late 18th century are reimagined as cute schoolgirls. Does this work? I personally have to say that the author of the VN has certainly done his research, but also the characters are so beleiveable, so well-written, that there was hardly ever a moment where I thought, 'OK this is where they are making reference to something, or writing, verbatim, what these middle-aged male authors said some 300 years ago,' because the characters are so beleivable, the source material has been worked in almost seamlessly. The VN's writer, Ebi-Hime, is definitely on my radar now.  A lot of the reviews are coming from the, completely optional, I might add, lesbian romance side of things, again drawing a comparison to Gone Home. There seem to be multiple endings, and while there are subtextual references to how Samantha feels around Lillian, there are certainly many endings where they do not end up as a couple. I appreciate that the relationship, while somewhat forced at times, can certainly not come to fruition in what is certainly meant to be a melancholie game. I would not have purchased this game in the first place, if it was yet another teen/LGBT drama that was forced out of contrivacy such as Gone Home, however the author gave it to his audience to make of it what they will.   Samantha Coleridge is certainly a protagonist you want to root for, while she drinks energy drinks and absinthe to the point of vomiting, and stands freezing in the Scottish countryside wondering just how to win her friendship (Optional/obvious lesbian relationship) back with Lillian, you will be a part of her thoughts, which is why this is a good novelization, and you will struggle with her. Of course I have a particular affinity for redheads, and suffice it to say that Samantha is cute, like the other characters in this game, I wasn't wholly on board with all the avenues that she takes, for instance, the cigarette smoking, Someone I wanted to like smoking cigarettes I could have done without, and I parsed through the text referencing it.   Pros: A writer whose dedication to his/her craft shows throughout, with numerous references to Romantic poets. Cute, redheaded protagonist, who doesn't fall victim to gender steryotypes.  Cons: Everything just has to be LGBT for some reason. Don't get me wrong I work with gay people on a daily basis, but few people realize that less than 5% of people (at least here in the USA) so for such a small minority, they sure are outspoken. I'm not sure if this is the author's perspective, or if they are trying to appeal to a broader demographic, but it always illicits an eyeroll from me.  It's an indie game, so I can hardly count it against the game, but I wished there was a cast of voice actors/actresses.  Final Verdict: 7/10: Cute animated girls, with clever references and writing alluding to the major Romantic poets of the late 18th century. If not for the repetitive RPG-maker music and shoehorned and completely unneccessary lesbian/LGBT ties, it would have been best in its class. ",

            "review_text": "I really like this game.  The subject matter is heavy, the main character is depressed and tries to cope with rejection. She is at a really low point and is very melodramatic. The art is different from other visual novels and very pretty. The screenshots should show you that! The characters are diverse and very opinionated, for better or worse. The interaction between some characters is very interesting and amusing. The dialogue is a strange mixture of modern jargon and more flowery speech, which is no wonder considering the modern setting and the historical poets the characters are based on.",

I loved the art style, and it made for beautiful scenes. Unfortunately, the character design clashed with the descriptions of the characters. The characters appeared 12, yet their actions and activities put them in their late teens, and the school teacher looked the same age as the students.  I loved the writing style. Unfortunately, there was also too much writing with too little purpose. There were long sections of text that failed to advance the plot, develop the characters, or provide interesting interactions, and instead seemed like prose for the sake of prose, meandiring off into the land of self-satisfaction while the story was left to languish. So while I liked the writing style, I was left feeling bored more often than not.",

I felt like it was forcing bad poetry down my throat, it was over the top and a lot of the conversations felt like useless filler. That said, I kept going because I thought the artwork was very beautiful and I wanted to see them all.  After beating it the extras    explained that the characters were based on literary authors who created classic pieces and it was mirroring their lives but as modern teenage girls. After learning that I was able to see the game through different eyes, all the useless filler conversations were actually references to authors lives. The forced lousy poetry in every sentence was actually a reference to historic literature instead of the game dev's just going over the top. I went through for every ending after reading all the extras about the authors and actually enjoyed the game for a lot more than just the artwork.     I appreciate the time and research the dev's must have put into the characters backstory, and I like how they imagined puting them together as modern teenagers.",

You play as Samantha Coleridge, my fav poet - Samuel Coleridge. And you help her get through teenage nonsense. Or you know, she dies trying. The visuals are bright and cute but deal with dark concepts. Multiple endings and interesting choices to make along with several cameos from other poets. I would recommend this yes, but, mainly to people with an interest in poetry. I can see that without any sort of knowledge of the poets and their lives how someone could see this as weird and unfulfilling.   ",
