            "review_text": "Don't mind my playtime on this, as I've previously beaten this game on the iPhone version.  This is easily among my favorite, if not being my absolute favorite, of the interactive novels presented by Choice of Games/Hosted Games. If the alluring fantasy of being a sleek, cool assassin in fiction has ever appealed to you, whether it's through playing Hitman, The Darkness, or taking on the Dark Brotherhood quests in the Elder Scrolls series, or being enthralled by movies like John Wick and Pulp Fiction, this game is for you.  The writing does a great job of making your character feel formidable and impressive, and rewards how you want to personally characterize them from their personality to their skill set with a rich and interesting set of possibilities. It's one of the closest and most rewarding things I've found outside of some other conventional video games that lets you more or less live out what it would be like to be the star in a high octane action film.  I would freely encourage anyone who thinks they might be interested to check out COG's other games/novels as well (all the free demos let you play out the first three chapters, giving you a fair taste of whether it'll hold your interest or not, so you can't really go wrong there), as I've found most of them to be pretty enjoyable, but I can definitely say there's probably nothing else they can offer that's quite like this.   Of course, the story isn't 100% realistic, but where's the fun in that? If you can suspend your disbelief enough for an interactive novel the same way you would for 1980's Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, but don't want a story that's completely mindless or unbelievable, give the demo a shot at the very least (no pun intended). Not many of their games are usually $5 on Steam, but I'd say this is one of the instances where it's definitely worth it.  The first time I beat this game, I immediately started another playthrough. This is one I can definitely see myself coming back to again and again over time. It'd be a mistake not to try it if you think you might even be the least bit interested.",
