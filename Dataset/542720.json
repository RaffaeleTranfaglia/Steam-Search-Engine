            "review_text": "Very very very basic match-3 bubble game. There are no power-ups, there is no strategy and only 21 easy levels. + the background picture is so crowded that it's just difficult to see the bubbles sometimes. Very bad for the eyes.  If you want to play a game similar to this - there are LOTS of better free alternatives on the web. And if you want more serious one - get Dynomite Deluxe.  ",
