            "review_text": "  Renoir: ~~~~~   Sitting down with his back firmly rested against his own tombstone, the ghost of James Renoir, a highly decorate police officer who worked in a violent and corrupted metropolis, is eager to find out who put him six feet under. This is the story of James Renoir!  Renoir is an adventure/3D platformer/puzzle game where you take control of the ghost of James Renoir.   First, James has to find a way out of the cemetery. In this level, you will be shown the mechanism of the game as a tutorial part of this level. By the way, the tutorial is rather short but comprehensive. Very quickly you will gather that ghosts do not like light. In fact, it can kill them. What you will also discover is that you can control other ghosts, which will be extremely helpful to clear upcoming puzzles.  The puzzles are based around the light factor; you have to switch off the lights to advance into the story. In some of the puzzles, there will be other ghosts for you to control in order to help you to solve the puzzle. The trick is to coordinate the movements of the ghost/s to guide them to specific switches, turn them off and clear the way for James Renoir to move forward. Let me tell you that on some occasions, you will wish that you were the one who actually pulled the trigger on Mr. Renoir!   Renoir has a really strong storyline and I am sure you will enjoy the cut-scenes as much as I did!   This game is inspired by the black and white 1940 noir movies and the artwork is absolutely splendid! This is topped by a solid soundtrack which really gets you in the mood of the era. Control-wise, it could have been much more responsive.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Splendid artwork  - Great soundtrack - Good story and well narrated - Achievements and trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Controls could have been more responsive  If you enjoy a good 1940’s black and white crime movie, then Renoir is a must to own!  7/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
