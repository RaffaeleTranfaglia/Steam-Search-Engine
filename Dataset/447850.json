You will finish it in one hour and you will probably regret that. Just farm trading cards and hide it xD",

            "review_text": "And your next nominee in the What in the Actual @#$% game of the Year awards is ZaxiaStudio’s Steam debut of The Next Door. It’s an experimental game that is told without dialogue or text but rather through the world itself and what a bizarre and befuddling world this one is.  To be fair I got through the prolonged introduction and then got stuck in the first room. I got the television to turn on, somehow, but the only button that was working was when I clicked on the giant piece that came from the board game Sorry telling me to remember in the box. In the box, what? I searched throughout the room – from the ceiling with the colorful letters and the room all over for a box. I thought it may have been referring to the TV and I was relieved when it turned on but nothing else I clicked on had any effect. There was a green letter looking thing but nothing I did there did anything.  I admit. I lost patience with the game. There are some on the Steam store claiming that they completed the game while there are others who quit the game because it was the opposite of what they were hoping to get out of the game. Ainslie’s a much more abstract thinker than I am when it comes to these types of games so if she has something deeper to say about her experience with the game then I’ll be certain to add them here. Until then I just can’t recommend the game for the sheer reason that nothing that I did seemingly had any effect and there was nothing obvious for me to click on.  I like to think outside of the box but in this instance the box is a cardboard box that has been saturated and is now limp.
