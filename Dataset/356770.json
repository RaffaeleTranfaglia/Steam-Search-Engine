Simple in the surface but very rewarding. And for those wondering, it works fine with the keyboard,",

            "review_text": "interesting game. not for everyone. like some one previously said, you press the wrong key and well, youve screwed up. like 12 keys based on movement. good for when you are very bored. all in all, not a bad game. definitely easy to run.",

            "review_text": "Well for a $5.99 I can't really complain too much. That's not to say it's a bad game or anything, but i just can't bring myself to recommend it to other people if only because it's not quite as interesting as I hoped it would be. There really isn't a lot to do other than 'go here, wait, go there, wait, go here, wait, go there, wait, go back here, end level' all while admiring a beautiful scene of earth as you orbit around it, and the space beyond. Controls are easy if you use a controller, though they might take a while to get used to and gameplay's pretty simple and slow. pretty much your objective is to fly to waypoints and sometimes wait at them before heading back to the ship before your O2 or NO2 runs out. Bare bones and basic really. I was hoping that some of the waypoints that required you to wait by them to 'make repairs' would have involved some small hud animation or even a little quick time event or something that would involve the player doing anything while they waited so that they're not bored twiddling their thumbs. Over all, it's a time killer for people who are really into simulations. If you wanna know what it's like to float around in 'Zero G' while operating an 'MMU' this is the game for you. otherwise, you might be more interested to play 'Moonbase Alpha'",
