            "review_text": "Anyone who is familiar with the kinds of mornings involving awkward 'what happened last night?' conversations, misplaced articles of clothing and bad hangovers absolutely needs to give One Night Stand a try-- each playthrough takes about fifteen to twenty minutes, but the amount of detail the designer has put into absolutely every aspect of this work is incredible. There are twelve different endings with seemingly infinite amounts of variables, and the whole thing just feels genuine.   I'd also like to add how perfectly the animated rotoscoped visuals work, as well as the whole color scheme and 'mood' of the art in general. Adore it.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those games similar to gone home, i dont mean in game play mechanics or style but in that after you're done playing it sorta leaves you thinking about it for a while. I enjoyed the art style and animations and even the chilled out guitar riffs while you're trying to peace togeather the night before. Kudos to Kinmoku, hope to see see more in the future.",

            "review_text": "Quite an enjoyable mystery visual novel.  This game is meant to be played multiple times to discover all the different ending and dialogues. The artwork is great and really felt natural, the expressions etc...  Not much more to say. You wake up in a strangers bed after a crazy night out and you investigate. The interaction between the 2 characters felt very natural, real, believable, that coupled with the very nice artwork and animations made it great.  You will definitely get your moneys worth.  It's nice to every once in a while play a game like this to mix things up from the normal, as this game is very unique.  TL:DR; One Night Stand simulates the awkward morning after but somehow makes it an enjoyable experience that you wish would last longer.",

It takes you in with a warm hand, and you choose where to go from there.  I've never had a gf, but I've had a couple of close lady friends, and this game strongly reminds me of them. Perhaps you'll remember someone if you give this a try.",
