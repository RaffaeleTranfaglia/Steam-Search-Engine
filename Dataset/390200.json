The story as usual doesn't carry much weight, but the graphics are decent, the gameplay is intuitive and simple and the puzzles, one of which was quite tricky, are entertaining. I found a few places that I had to almost pixel hunt for where to find a scene I had found yet and the hidden object scenes weren't too overcrowded. Other than that, it was entertaining few hours of gaming.",

            "review_text": "What i love best about this title is the main character's OCD. Her baby was just kidnapped by a dragon-wielding Dark Wizard and yet she'd rather search the castle for half an hour for something to apply glue with, rather than just spread it on with her finger. She is not strong enough (or is too stubborn) to push the curtains aside, and resolves to build some scissors to cut them in half instead.  Of course, such are the tribulations of HOPA protagonists. OCD in the extreme. They cannot pick up an item until they find all other pieces of it and assemble it in the place where the initially found it (as opposed to carrying it around (btw: a barrel is too heavy for her to shove aside, but she'll not hesitate to stuff a stone column(!!!) in her pocket for later use... on a high ledge(!!!)).  But without OCD, they wouldn't be the star of a HOPA game, so it kinda goes with the territory. 'HOPA protagonist must be OCD or have similar disorders which prohibit them from, e.g., simply breaking a window to get at an object on the other side (instead they are forced _insist_ on finding a glass cutter).' It's a simple fact.  One true complaint so far: the 'knights and dragons' puzzle's description is so far removed from the solution that one can accurately call the puzzle's rules a bald-faced lie. i eventually gave up on it, tapped Skip, and was appalled at the solution which was revealed - it violated the description text at least 5 times.  And one minor complaint: ambiguous words in HO scenes upset me. One scene wants you to find a 'bow' and has both a ribbon-bow and a violin bow (right next to each other, too). Aaarrggg.  Taken with a grain of salt, and a hefty dose of mocking the protagonist for her odd ways, this journey is turning out every bit as fun a romp as most of Artifex Mundi's works. i'm liking it better than their Demon Hunter title, but not finding it as engrossing as the newer Enigmatis 2 and Eventide titles (both of which set new standards for this genre, IMO). Somewhere in between Demon Hunter and Eventide/Enigmatis. Graphically excellent. Music is... unmemorable, apparently, as i can't recall a single note of it. The voice-overs are actually quite good. The subtitles to the voice-overs have a few very minor grammatic problems, but nothing terribly distracting (look who's OCD now!).  There are some colorful characters here, like Mr. and Mrs. Piggy Bank, and some grumpy dwarves who accept the protagonist as their Sovereign Queen, yet refuse to give her the items she's searching for until she performs favors for them. As mentioned above - take such with a grain of salt, because a HOPA isn't a HOPA if NPCs simply hand you everything you need.  i had to laugh my butt off when the protagonist put her baby in her inventory. Just classic.  Oh, and having a little fairy in your inventory, useful to access certain out-of-reach places, is pretty cool.  i've gotta thumb this one up.  PS: my greatest thanks to the devs for their continued support for Linux. All of their titles i've tried (about 6 or 8 of them) have worked flawlessly on my system (currently Mint Linux 17.3).",

            "review_text": "One of the easier Artifex Mundi games, but it looks pretty, has voice acting and is still a fun game to boot. Some of the items you had to look for in the scenes were a bit archaic, but most were easy to find. The puzzles/minigames had a nice variety to them, though none were terribly difficult, and the story was passable. It was fun for a play through like every one of this companies games have been. It's also easy to pick up and play for a half hour and then leave or just let run in the background, which is why my playtime is a bit higher than others. All in all, definitely worth playing through if you're a fan of the other Artifex Mundi games.",

Not worth your time or the asking price.   I didn't go into this expecting much, but I was still let down nonetheless. Queen's Quest offers very little by way of satisfying gameplay or story, and it falls short on almost everything that should make a hidden object adventure fun.   Story",
