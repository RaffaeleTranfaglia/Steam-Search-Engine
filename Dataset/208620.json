            "review_text": "I enjoyed playing this game. I played through all of Story Mode. As someone who is new to this type of game, one feature I wish had been included was some way to have hints for the puzzles. Sometimes, I got very stuck and my only options were to either go online to find out the solution or to 'skip', which did not allow me to learn how to solve the puzzle. The downside was that in looking online, I got the whole solution, when I would have preferred just getting a starting hint of some kind. And there was one puzzle where the solution I found online did not work. It was a puzzle where you have to slide books out of the way so that a particular one can get to a particular spot. The opening arrangement in my game was different than the opening arrangement I found on the website. That said, overall, I did enjoy the game. The story was not quite as rich as the previous game (it was longer, certainly, but not as well-connected), but it was still immersive, and I enjoyed seeing how the different charcters and puzzles interacted with the main plot. I'm looking forward to trying out the third game!",

            "review_text": "2nd finished in the series. I preferred this one a little to the first, more variety of puzzles (although still mostly hidden picture type); more active story although a few times I was left wondering around trying to find out where I needed to go next. Map could use some improvement. Overall, I enjoyed the 3+ hours of game play. This game has several other add-ons which could add to the play time and encourage going back to find all the clovers and achievements (but personally, I am moving on to the third mystery in the series).",

            "review_text": "This'll serve as a recommendation for all the Midnight Mysteries. It's a find object type of puzzle game. The first Midnight Mystery had quite a few problems with objects being placed unlogically (statues up in trees etc) and objects not really corresponding to thier real size (coins being larger than a head etc) which made it quite frustrating to play. This was fixed in MM2 and remained so for the rest of the series. The other 3 games also added more of the 'use items' type of puzzle game style as well as some more interesting puzzles to solve.  Play if you like object finding puzzle games.",

If this is your way to deal with problems you should really just stop selling games anywhere. Steam doesn't fix their problems either, but you should just have just fixed your damn game instead of removing a feature completely and pulling people's average completion ratio down to zero.",
