            "review_text": "I played this game for about 15 minutes and I feel like I've experienced everything there is to see. Sure it costs less than a dollar, but this game is downright barebones. The enemy ships (and there's only one kind) have next to no AI - they just aim themselves at your ship and crash into you. They also respawn right after you kill them, which means there's basically no reason to do anything but fly in a circle. As far as I can tell there's only 2 controls, left and right mouse buttons. Although I can't be sure, since there's no tutorial. There's also almost no options whatsoever, not even difficulty. Even the first level is almost impossible. Basically, it feels like a flash game.",

            "review_text": "  The layout and UI are both very well done and the visuals are on point for the game. The music also is a perfect match for the game as it plays well with the theme of the game and also the level play. The levels seemed to get a bit more challenging with the more of them you complete and keeps you focused, because the moment you think you have the key to win every phase, you're wrong. The controls do take a moment to get the hang of because there is no 'controls layout' but even unskilled gamers shouldn't have an issue. Overall I give the game an 9 out of 10 for its stunning visuals and over all game construction.",

            "review_text": "  This game is a really good game to relax too. It has good music to go along with the amazing space backgrounds. I played some while on the road it really made the time seem to fly by. The game mechanics are simple enough to where even small childern or older people could get into it. There's not much to it, It just involves using a few keys ( the mouse buttons and Q). I like how the game doesn't have a save feature, this is because i would play some simple games such as this and the save would become curropt or not work at all and that would result in me unistalling the app and reistalling it. So if something did happen i would just need to push restart. i would rate this game 4.75/5.0 the .25 off would be for a few bugs in the game, but nothing that is devestating.  Its a good early access game overall.",
