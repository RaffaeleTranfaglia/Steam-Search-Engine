In the last bit of News, the dev said the price would increase a bit after leaving EA, which makes this even more odd, unless it is to increase the playerbase. -Contacted dev through numerous means without any answers.  +It's fun for a little bit, but unless you're willing to delve into the tedious custom animal creation and/or are easily amused... it wears off somewhat quickly.  +- Great idea, just not fully realized.   tl;dr - game is 99.9999% sure abandoned.",
