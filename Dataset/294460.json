            "review_text": "This is more a mixed review than a negative one.  I purchased Fenix Rage because the experience seemed similar to Super Meat Boy, but two factors have depleted my motivation to continue. (I'm currently in the middle of World 5.)  There is a distinct lack of enemy variety. Predominantly, all you'll see are enemies that move back and forth in a straight line, or that jump in place, which is nearly the same thing. It isn't until you've completed around 80 levels that you'll see enemies with different movement patterns, and by that point I had already grown tired of the level design. Even many of those later levels apparently focus on the straight-line enemies.  Similarly, maneuvering Fenix often involves no more than button-mashing to take a straight line through openings in between the aforementioned enemies. In most cases, you'll either mash the jump button to ascend, or the dash button to move sideways. There are no precise wall kicks or nuanced, curved jumps, and Fenix's vertical speed feels rather slow. The idea of infinite jumps and air dashes sounded exciting, but ended up being more simplistic and repetitive than I expected.  If neither point fazes you, and you seek another precision platformer, I'd say there's a good chance you'll enjoy this, even if it didn't quite meet my personal expectations. Otherwise, perhaps you'd be better off with another entry in the genre.",

            "review_text": "Fenix Rage is an excellent purchase for fans of hardcore platformers. If you like Super Meat Boy, IWBTG, Electronic Super Joy, or VVVVVV then you will no doubt enjoy this game. The challenge-level is equivalent to SMB, however Fenix Rage presents enough new tricks and challenges to make this a unique game.  As Fenix, you have an infinite number of air-jumps and air-dashes at your disposal for manuevering past enemies and traps. The goal of all 200 levels is to simply reach the blue-block at the end. Clever level design from beginning to end ensures that even seasoned platformer fans can expect a satisfyingly twitchy 9+ hours of gameplay to 100% the game.",

            "review_text": "I'd recommend it, I guess if you like speed and platforming.   It's all the rage and gets all the 90s kids in the yard when they hear 'Precision platformer'. 'Memorization' is more ...PRECISE HURR DURR. This game does have unfathomable 'record times' set by the staff. I presume they set these times with the levels having no enemies on-screen. Something to just Youtube to get over these so-called 'challenges'; Y'know, like every gamer does these days. There should be a 'use caution' button because I wouldn't want to spend $15 on this wanna-be retro Flash game (sorry, it is what it is.)  It's simple and somewhat fun. But Fenix being all floaty when you need to move fast and be PRECISE is detrimental to the whole core of the game. The reason I say this is, the levels are pretty much vertically designed. His jump is floaty, and the fall is slow. So, in closing, trying to beat any of the outrageous record times with bullethell-level amount of enemies on-screen is just dog ♥♥♥♥ So I'll just go through and just beat all the levels and not care about the times...",

I tried to like this game--significant time investment, stars, cookies, top 20 times on most levels--but after a certain point it falls flat.  I recommend skipping it.   Instead give Dustforce or Runner a try. Or for a similar style to this, the Jumper series. Or, if you haven't played Super Meatboy, go grab that now.",
