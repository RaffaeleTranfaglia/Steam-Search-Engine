            "review_text": "Good remake to the original game that initiated this extensive and acclaimed franchise.  Being a remake of the first Tomb Raider, the gameplay is predominantly focused on scenario puzzles. There's action sequences and combat, but they are few in number, thus the pace might not suit gamers looking for something more dynamic. Despite old, the game features satisfactory graphics and mechanics as well as a good sound quality. There is also a good variety of scenarios and their puzzles, which contribute to not become a repetitive and predictable game. The plot is dispensable and the end doesn't excite.  It has some problems with the camera which sometimes irritates, and despite having full joypad support, the commands presentation are for the keyboard/mouse, which can lead to disorientation. In the end it's a good game, but I would only recommend for those who love and have played the old Tomb Raider games, or enjoy games based on puzzles.  7/10",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider… This saga has been a pillar of my childhood, source of many fond memories along with Spyro the Dragon, Oddworld and so on. So, I was understandably excited in finding out an anniversary homage to the first game of the Core series, which crashed and burned after the embarrassing Angel of Darkness. And Tomb Raider Anniversary was (of course) the first game I ever played on Steam. So, after 30 hours of gameplay (20 in the first run not on my profile, and about 10 in the second), I think I have a pretty accurate opinion about this game.  First the pros: 1) I found Lara’s movements incredibly smooth, and it was pretty easy to get used to them and do things a bit more quickly than in Legend. 2) The beautiful, sometimes even breathtaking sceneries (and the fact that no spot of the areas was covered in darkness, no matter how far it was); 3) Adaptations of the structure of the levels: while I could still easily orient myself (some paths are pretty much the same) many things changed to adapt to Lara’s new abilities, but it was done in a very natural way; 4) Bossfights: I had fun during those. They aren’t a “just-shoot-until-it-dies” kind of bossfights, you actually have to use your brain. Which is awesome!  And now, the cons: 1) Bugs: There are bugs everywhere! You don’t know when the next one is gonna hit you in the face, and the more you are far from your last checkpoint, the more you get nervous, because: “What if she doesn’t grab that ledge, falls and dies, and I have to do it all over again?”. And that’s just one of many. 2) Checkpoints: seriously, what the heck? I have no idea how they thought it would be a good idea to set the checkpoints the way they did: one after every lever, but not even one right before and/or right after a very difficult piece? Are you kidding me?! 3) Pyramid ascending: the first time I ascended the Pyramid with that series of timed runs, I thought I was going to cry. It's difficult and that’s ok. What is NOT ok is that Lara points her guns at everything BUT the flying mummies (which, instead, do a very good job at killing her), or that she bugs and doesn’t grab what she must in order to finish that piece, thus wasting all of your efforts. 4) Lara Croft: Now, thing is, while one may appreciate her being more human… She is not as I remember her in TR1. She was way more cold, and killed Natla’s lackeys without a care in the world. “What? You want to kill me? Over your dead body maybe!” or “My piece of the Scion? Not before you catch my bullets with your eye, honey!”. That was Lara’s attitude, and that way I liked her. But maybe I’m just grumpy because she was the strong, devil-may-care woman every little girl (me first in line) wanted to be…  So, did I like the game? Yes. Would Recommend it? Absolutely.  But take some Xanax first. Or morphine. Meditation is fine. Whatever relaxes you the most.  And good luck.",

            "review_text": "WOW. I am thoroughly blown away by just how amazingly good Tomb Raider: Anniversary is. It is hands down one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, and I enjoyed myself through the whole game. Having never played a Tomb Raider game before, this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Now I’ll actually tell you about the game. As you probably know, you’ll be playing as Lara Croft, a British archaeologist (and parkour master) who wields two pistols and swings on a grappling hook. The gameplay itself reminds me very heavily of the 3D Legend of Zelda games (Twilight Princess in particular) in that it’s all about solving puzzles, activating switches, fighting enemies, and discovering secret areas to finish levels and move on.  Since this game is a remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, it shares the same story and environments with that game. However, although locations may look similar, the levels have been completely redesigned and are much different than the original, often involving much more puzzle-solving and combat with enemies than before.  Controlling Lara can be a bit cumbersome for you at first as the controls and camera take some time to get used to, but after you play for an hour or so it becomes very simple. The controls are greatly improved from the 1996 original, and it feels much more natural controlling Lara without the tank controls present in the original game. Now WASD actually moves Lara in the direction you press, and the mouse freely controls the camera.  The graphics are stunning for a 2007 game – the animated cut-scenes that play at some points during the adventure are very nicely rendered, the environments are extremely detailed, and the in-game models of Lara, enemies, and other characters all look great. There are, however, some minor problems with shadow casting, and Lara can on occasion appear to be floating due to wonky collision boxes on some objects, but these are largely ignorable.  All in all, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a wonderful game, and a great title to start with if you’re looking to get into the Tomb Raider franchise. Anyone who has either played the 1996 original or is brand-new to the series should definitely give it a try.",

While the mechanics and animation are good, the gameplay is rather tedious, mainly in the shooting mechanics. The bullet time/rage was a good idea, but not executed well enough to my liking. The puzzle/climbing mechanics however, are good, fluid and perform well. It's a good game, but for being released in 2007, it really hasn't aged well, the textures are low res and the models are a bit . . . well, they're alright.   I'll end this by admitting that I did enjoy the game, despite its flaws and tedious shooting mechanics and QTE's, but if you want to get into Tomb Raider, the newest reboot is a good place to start for fine story telling and gameplay. If you're feeling nostalgic, you can get the original on Steam, or get this one for the updated models.  7/10  Recommend for the story.  F@CK QTE's.",

The game has the same control scheme as the Legend game along with slightly updated graphics. All of the locations and enemies from the original are all present except with more detail and more cinematic cut scenes. There is more dialoge along with tons of bonus material to unlock such as costumes from the older games for Lara to wear. Not as many outfits as Legend had but the replay value to this game makes it worth while. The added elements to the plot helped made this game not be a carbon copy of the original. The original will forever be a classic, though it is great to see a revised version of the game that started the franchise. With hours of gameplay to endure, any Tomb Raider fan will enjoy this game as much if not more than the original game. Highly recommended.",

This game, however, has many more problems, some of which are literally game-breaking.  For starters, the story is not made as clear as in Legend. I knew why Lara was doing things and there were enough cutscenes to keep me filled in. In Anniversary though, the cutscenes are few, and they are far-between.   The main reason you should not get this game is the following: while the puzzles and parkour are much more difficult and challenging (not a bad thing), the game is WAY more picky about exactly when you hit the button, exactly where you are standing, small things like that that seem like not a big deal until you are browsing youtube for tutorials because you think you're just doing it wrong and find out you've been doing it right the whole time, its the game not letting you drag the block, or grab with your grappeling hook, or just simple things like that that wreck the game when they don't work, even after restarting the game, reloading the level, restarting the computer. Its like they released it without making sure small things like that still worked and when they don't, the game is literally broken and you can't continue even though you're doing what you are supposed to be doing.

Controls and especially camera control is very unpredictable so in many jumps Lara just jumps in WTF directions you would never expect. That with combination with the possibility to save the game only at predefined checkpoints, which are quite poorly chosen lots of times, makes a receipt for many repetitive tries where you have to go trough a long pasage of jumps just to try your luck at a difficult one. And when I write luck, I mean it, the game is full of bugs, where sometimes under some circumstances (such as particular resolution settings) you just can't make it. Some situations are also very unpredictable, because the length of the jumps varies at different places, so you can't be sure, if Lara will make it. On the other hand sometimes you ignore a place because you are 'sure' that she can't make it that far, but if you watch a walktrough - yay, that was the solution!  All of the above could be forgiven if the plot and the puzzles were really good, but neither is IMO. The puzzles are really repetitive and because of the mechanics, controls and bugs really annoying. There are only two or three really original puzzles which I ejoyed. Boss fights are really boring as well, once you figure out, how to defeat someone, there is always a phase, where you have to repeat the moves dozen of times, before it is finished.  In conlusion as I wrote In the first sentence, this is a really frustrating game with almost no fun aspects. The only possitive thing I can say about this is that some of the locations are really pretty.",

The visuals have been given a lick of paint and everything now looks much more natural. The square columns have gone and even Lara herself looks more like a real person rather than a couple of squares and a cardboard Halloween mask. It all looks great even for a game from the PS2 era.  I do find that Lara's 'grab' can be inconsistent. For example if you stand too close to a ledge and then jump back Lara will fall. Do the same thing again and she will grab the ledge. This can make navigating a pain especially in areas that have long drops. This does seem to be a minor problem and does make you play the game more carefully, which makes sense if you think about it.

Though if you want a game that is pretty much challenging as in a certain strategy to beat a boss; This remake does that job particularly well.  Some of the Music is damned great and a badass intensity for some bosses. Some pieces are remade that the first Tomb Raider player would definitely recognize.    Specifically the Centaurs Boss theme. Yes. That song rocks like hell.    The level design feels far more shorter in comparison to the original.. In a way some levels feel like they practically merged together [I played the original so I can tell the differences between the two] though the puzzles can be really difficult to some others though I beaten this game before so I can't say it feels a first time deal.  The bugs? Well mostly doesn't appear much but you do have small times where it just glitches on you or you cannot grab no matter how close you are. I would never recommend playing this game on PC. The Console versions are more fixed than this despite the graphics are great for the most part on the PC but the gameplay could use a little fix then it's all set for good.  Either way; Yes I do recommend this game but be prepared for some bugs in the game.. This is all I have to say for this one.",

( i swan dive from the top of st .francis folly to heapehstus room without dying . Iron neck Wtf?!)  Like the ammo pickups the health packs were ALOT i mean couldn't the developers just remake TR1?  but overall a very great game deserves 4.99$ i really recommend it :)",

Graphic wise the environments look pretty decent for such an old game and the scenery is still captivating. The characters look cartoony, personally I prefer it over the more realistic Lara in the 2013 reboot. The gameplay is closer to the original games with a focus on exploration and puzzle solving instead of action and combat as the aforementioned reboot. During the later levels it feels like the developers got a bit lazy and decided to focus on time based puzzles rather than complicated ones. I found the levels in the second World to be the most interesting of all. I encountered some minor bugs but it wasn't anything game breaking. This is a great a buy for its price.",

            "review_text": "Surprisingly over-the-top for a first installment (Peruvian Dinosaurs!?), Lara Jones... I mean Croft... looks sharp and tight (many times wet) and moves fluidly in the lush environments of Peru, Greece and Egypt despite annoying camera angles and somewhat tricky controls. Interesting level design (just original enough so that Spielberg and Lucas can't sue the developers for adaptating 'Raiders of the Lost Ark') and epic music and cinematics, with the occasionaly frustrating quick time event. Gameplay is both satisfying and excruciating: you really gotta work to make it all come together. Even dodging an enemy can be a challenge as you have to hit all those buttons at the right time (and time the counterattack). Maybe Lara plays better with a big joystick instead of a regular mouse and I can't begin to imagine how hard the original game was to master before this revamped version (after almost 20 years, getting Lara to do what you want remains a chore repeatedly). The younger Lara in last year's prequel is so much easier to play with. You can really have her under your thumb. As a mature woman, she's hardcore. Like most very hot women, Lara Croft is very demanding, you've got to get the timing of your moves and jumps just right or she wont reach the heights to get her multiple rewards. She can be puzzling and you might take a while before finding that sweet spot that will unlock new parts of the level or hidden treasures or even overflow the level with fountains of water. The experience with her is daunting and draining at times and I like to take it one level at a time, coming back for seconds only on a good day. Her mysteries in the tombs Vilcabamba, Greek colysseums and mythological locations remain intact and fresh after all these years (ok, they we're lifted and redone, ILM style). Also included, Lara's home, a huge manor very fun to explore with lots of objects to play with.  PS: The many collectibles (Relics and artifacts) unlock artwork and other sexy outfists (so far the sportswear is my fav). Unfortunately, the often unresponsive controls might drive you mad before you want to retry any of the levels after completion (time trials? Yeah right), I barely got through when later in the game any jump stopped by the camera angle switching by itself would be an instant death. I can't believe these problems weren't smoothed out before release, whatever happened to QA? I can't believe play testers didn't complain about this!?",

I still remember the terror when you navigate the deadly traps of the tomb of Tihocan only to be confronted by 2 fireball hurling 10 foot tall meat centaurs right outside the gates to the goal. i still remember the sense of awe when you find the sanctuary of the scion is a gigantic Sphynx statue that you have to open. i lay awake at night thinking of the creepy coridors of the great pyramid of atlantis, whose walls pulsed with blood and veins and i cry myself to sleep thinking of the gigantic meat monster that on more than one ocassion picked me up in its fist and slammed me against the deck like an oversised toddler having a temper tantrum or hurling me half a mile down the central shaft of the said pyramid, only to land in a lake of magma.   and this is the 1997 original, Aniversary has all these moments with modern updated graphics, the game has lost none of the sense of dread and actually builds on the 1997 original, this is a prime example of how remakes should be done: Properly",

It has a unique and interesting character and a fun playstyle that is focused mainly on tryling to figure out how to jump to things, but in a fun way. And, normally, I find jumpy games too dependent on rote memorization and complex buttoneering, but this manages to avoid that. The jumps are puzzle-like (and the puzzles are jump-like), and it remains both lighthearted and fun. Figuring out how to navigate the obstacles is really engaging and requires that you continually build off of previous experience. And, it's challenging, though there are a few scenes that are so difficult as to be frustrating and repetitive, but, for the most part, this game is challenging without being punishing. Again, I see why the original, after which this redefinition was based, was so popular. The game is third person, but it almost always avoids stupid camera angle tricks, and this is really a game where third person is necessary, as you really do need to see yourself to get where you are going. It's very well considered. As a final note, the art and ambience are superb. It really does give the feel of being alone and unafraid, adventuring through the ancient settings. It's just a solid, very well done game. That said, there are a handful of bugs, and the AI and pathing of the monsters isn't so good, but that's not really the reason to play this game. And, finally, bonus points for being hated by people who hate gaming:) (For some absurd reason knowable by those who have never played it...) I'm genuinely looking forward to more in this series!",
