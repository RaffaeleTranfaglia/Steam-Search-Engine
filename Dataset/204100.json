Maximilian enjoys long romantic walks to the pharmacy to get more painkillers to be addicted to, alternatively he can lick other people's painkillers to claim them as his own and establish his position as the alpha male. Max also has made a hobby of jumping through windows and slamming into walls, he discovered this passion when he jumped through a car window and caused a massive crash which left the bridge destroyed, 12 dead and 73 injured yay! Due to slamming his head into so many walls and his crippling addiction, Max hallucinates seeing words as people say them. If Augustus collects enough of the oddly placed golden weapon parts, he ascends to a higher existence and becomes Midas, and every weapon he touches turns to gold. Oh yeah Max can MANIPULATE TIME because he does so many drugs Buddha came down to him and bestowed upon him the power to control time.  Lesson learned, do drugs, manipulate time and become Midas",

            "review_text": "This was a tough call to make. I wanted to like Max Payne 3, but it just really did not want to be liked. The good news is, at the core, the gameplay is actually pretty good... when you get to play it, but more on that in a bit. The combat is true to the John Woo style of the series. The game is also considerably more difficult than Max Payne 2, but not as much as Max Payne 1, which is a happy medium. It's a bit heavily cover-based, but you do have the shootdodge at your disposal to mix things up.   Unfortunately, you will spend the majority of your gaming hours locked in sequence after sequence of unskippable AND unquittable cutscenes which smugly display the text 'still loading' when you try to skip them, despite the fact that it has clearly been 5 minutes or more. If you try to press escape, the cutscene will just pause. Once the gameplay actually begins and you start to have fun, the instant the last guy is killed you are forced to watch a 30 second cutscene of Max opening a door or vaulting a ledge, or something else you could have easily done yourself. It often doesn't even allow you time to search the room for guns, painkillers, or collectibles. When you do get the opportunity to scavenge the room after a battle, you cannot backtrack to the previous room (which is always inexplicably locked behind you) and you are CONSTANTLY nagged every five seconds to proceed forward, either by one of Max's allies or Max himself. He'll say to himself, 'I had no time to admire the scenery, I had to move forward,' as if he's in a rush to finish his own story. I suppose he needs to make time for more compelling details in his storytelling such as 'there was a security door across the hall' or some contextual remark on every bottle of pills that he finds.   The general flow of the game, as you may have guessed, between all the cutscenes is just shooting gallery after shooting gallery. In many a cutscene you have the dubious privilege of watching Max bumble his way into a room, alerting the entire mob, and spoiling what would have been a perfectly good sneak attack. And after the game spends most of its time yanking you forward against your will, in other chapters you will be forced to slowly walk or stagger drunk or wounded through the level for ten minutes, unable to actually do anything useful. It absolutely refuses to let you play at your own pace.  But that's just the story mode -- if you want to just shoot stuff in combat scenarios without all the talky talk then surely Arcade mode is where it's at... right? Ehhh, no. The only difference Arcade mode has is that it removes the *skippable* cutscenes from the game, which there weren't that many of to begin with. Wonderful. And it gives you a score at the end of the chapter, with none of the instant gratification the game so callously denies you.",

            "review_text": "***LONG REVIEW WARNING***  I’m not sure how many times I actually asked myself “Why?” as I played Max Payne 3. “Why is he doing this?” “Why did they make this design decision?” “Why am I supposed to care?” It would go from the typical reflexive inquiries, to the borderline obsessive ones. I would continue after every stumble, extending a hand to the game, picking it up and giving it another chance to attempt walking. Eventually, I just decided to drag it until we reached the end of the road and left it there.  There is not much that makes Max Payne 3 a bad game, but rather, there is plenty that makes it a bad sequel. I’ve seen and participated in various discussions on the subject, seeing many dodgy arguments as to why people liked or hated the game. There’s a clear discontent among a certain number of people, as though something was missing in the title. Possibly the most common claim being “it’s not noir”.  And that is a claim that is as hard to support as it is to debunk. Men smarter and more qualified than either you or I have spent decades tackling this subject alone. Whether noir is an aesthetic or genre, or whether it even exists to begin with. Even among people who agree that noir exists, the criteria varies, and any “List of film noir titles” on Wikipedia or in any book wouldn’t be accurate. However, the golden age of noir died when the genre became self-aware, so now it would be more accurate to call anything written in a noir “style” neo-noir.  Claiming that either the setting or the daylight denies Max Payne 3’s right to carry the banner is dodgy at best. Many noteworthy noir titles, like White Heat, were set during the day without it being detrimental to the atmosphere. There are many other reasons to say the game lost its noir charm, but such a discussion would last for an eternity with no side being able to win. Something that can be agreed upon, though, is that if Max Payne 3 is indeed neo-noir, it is of a different ilk compared to the previous two games. Quite reasonable if you consider that movies like Sin City and American Beauty both count as neo-noir while being vastly different.  The first two games were a fusion of extreme noir melodrama and John Woo-style gunplay. It reached absurd levels story-wise, often mocking itself, but also placed a character who had rational reactions to the grimdark world around him. It’s why when you completely immerse yourself in the game, you never question Max’s actions. It never tears you away from the screen. But when you walk away and think about it, you realize just how unreasonable and silly the entire plot is.  The third game makes the mistake of toning down the setting into a more realistic one. Nothing is over the top, and there’s more emphasis on realism (as far as a third person shooter can allow). All of a sudden, we are asking questions we otherwise wouldn’t have. Our immersion breaks with every conflict between what the cutscenes imply and what the gameplay implies. Not only that, but all of a sudden, Max Payne stops being about Max and focuses on the events around him. This distinction is clear when you take into account that neither the first, nor the second game offers any sort of epilogue. It starts and ends with Max. On the other hand, Max Payne 3 offers a proper “this is what happened after Max put the gun down” scene.  This difference in atmosphere doesn’t stem only from the narrative, but also from the gameplay. Whether it was due to technical limitations, or just a savvy decision, Remedy used a minimal amount of in-game cutscenes. If Max sees an object he wants to comment on, the player needs to actually approach it by moving Max. Rockstar’s approach was to force the player’s movement, whether by cutscene or just slowing Max down due to injuries or the environment. The latter isn’t even much of an issue and is a better alternative to cutscenes, but coupled with them, it sets a much slower pace. Even trivial design decisions, like taking away the player’s control when watching TV, damages the experience.  The combat also follows this change of pace. Max Payne 3’s combat does revolve around cover, which is true to the predecessors save for the addition of a “stick to the wall” button. But it quickly becomes binary. You either have bullet-time, or you don’t. You are either at full health, or nearly dead. With infinite bullet-time jumps and only putting a cap on regular slow-mo movement, the pace changes drastically. Before, Max could jump into the action guns blazing. Now? Every single enemy is a threat, putting more emphasis on the previously mentioned increase in realism.  And then, of course, there is the actual character of Max Payne, probably the biggest problem with the latest game. Someone once told me that Max is very good at lying to himself. That’s quite an accurate statement. After all, at the end of the first game, he thought blood revenge would give him peace of mind, but as the second game showed us, it didn’t quite work out that way. However, at the end of Max Payne 2, regardless of which ending you got, Max was at peace with himself. It wasn’t something questionable like “this person is dead, everything is fine now”, but merely the culmination of all events just pushing him to a realization.  And obviously, he lied to himself again, according to Max Payne 3. This leaves a branching path, where one says that Rockstar wasn’t true to the character, while the other says they were. With the latter, one has to wonder why we should even care for the character now. There is a difference between falling on tough times and picking yourself up, and actually having two opportunities to take your life back and get at least a bittersweet ending. Payne stops being a powerful determinator and turns into this Guy With the Gun bum. A person one would find hard to care for. It would be easier for those who entered the series with this newest installment, as the predecessors become one big blur called “the dark past”, but as someone who played through both events, I find it quite difficult to ignore this kind of character development.  This is not the only issue when speaking of Max, though. His mannerisms are also drastically different. Despite the tone and rating of all games, Max rarely, if ever, swore in the first two games. I was halfway through the second game recently and I’m not quite sure if I even heard a “damn” from him. He had a sort of cold composure, dealing with his issues within himself, rather than swearing, raging and generally being openly upset about the situation. The trademark noir metaphors are also close to nonexistent now. Most of Max’s statements have become plain observations, rather than actually processing the information as he did before. No melodramatic thoughts on life beyond the occasional pearl in an ocean of dry writing.   As Payne himself says in the second game: “If you had done something differently, it wouldn’t be you, it would be someone else looking back, asking a different set of questions.” And that is what the core issue with Max Payne 3 is, in the end. It’s not about Max Payne. It’s about someone else with the same problems, dealing with them in their own way. There are many other issues we haven’t mentioned, like the highly out of place shock about the organ black market, or the redundant “Do you kill him or let him live?” prompt at the end of the game. Max Payne 3 suffers from Fallout 3 syndrome. Just how Fallout 3 was a good game, but awful Fallout, so is Max Payne 3 a good game on its own, but an abysmal addition to the series.  One only has to wonder where Remedy would have taken Max Payne 3 had they been the developers. “Max Payne’s journey through the night will continue,” say the credits of the second game. Sadly, most of the levels of Max Payne 3 were in broad daylight.",

To start, you do not need to play the other Max Payne games to know what is going on in the third installment; everything you need to know is detailed throughout the game’s narrative.   The game focuses on intense shootouts and bullet-time, most of the encounters in the game will end in blood soaked rooms, riddled with bullet holes, as tiles chip off the walls and crash to the ground. Max Payne 3 is a beautiful game, with visuals that can barely be rivaled by other games currently on the market. Contrary to Rockstar’s history, Max Payne 3 is a wonderful PC port, putting their last port, GTA IV, to shame. Max Payne 3 runs on all sorts of systems and doesn’t require the most up to date equipment to run. Sadly, Max Payne 3’s multiplayer experience is a bit flawed, as it is plagued with Russians (Like Dota 2) and hackers (most of which are Russians).   Hopefully with more patches, the amount of Reds ruining multiplayer will decrease. In the end, Max Payne 3 is an experience that all gamers should enjoy, one of the best games of 2012. ",

            "review_text": "Rewriting my review since the old one did not do it justice. Max Payne 3, the sequel to the fantastic 2003 Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, is an entertaining, thrilling, amazing experience from start to finish.    STORY:   Set in São Paulo, the protagonist, Max Payne, is a retired ol' NYCPD cop. Max’s diet consists of liquor and painkillers to make him forget the sorrows of what had happened to him and his deceased family. Desperate to get out of his pitiful condition, he takes a job as a bodyguard for a rich Brazilian businessman named Fabricas Branco. But it turns out that it isn't an easy job after all, when Fabiana, Fabricas' wife, is kidnaped. The plot is full of conspiracies and sick twists and huge amazing set pieces and in the end... it pays off; it is one of the best stories told in a video game.    GAMEPLAY:   Simple yet incredibly fun, with a huge array of weapons to choose from, you shoot, jump and make amazing 'Matrix' style tricks that are not strange for Max Payne fans. The gunplay also received some polish as it is refined and perfected.    GRAPHICS:   The game is beautiful from art direction to meshes and polygons. Animations are one of the best around. Surprisingly, the game is very well optimized and it utilizes many PC-specific features such as DirectX11. (which is weird for a Rockstar game)    AUDIO:   Voice acting is top notch with James McCaffrey returning as Max Payne. The soundtrack is AWESOME, don’t believe me? Just check out 'Tears by Health' on YouTube, you'll love it!    MULTIPLAYER:   For the first time ever in a Max Payne game, a multiplayer mode is included. Many people were skeptical about it but it turned out that they were all wrong. This fun creative experience has all the single player abilities such as Bullet Time and Shootdodge in it which makes it stand out from the crowd. it is fast paced and (sometimes) chaotic and balanced.  Overall it was my personal 2012 GOTY and it still is.   10/10",

Where this game shines is in the details and the impressive challenge it can present to you. While the story is...alright, this game is amazing in how Max narrates the story and the events around him. There is a definite homage to film noir, and Max's chilling narrations are both incredibly well written and hauntingly appropriate.  Max moves in a very realistic way, turning his body and rolling and falling in a way that's very believable, despite some moments in the game where you sorta...jump the shark in terms of action. There's an IMMENSE focus on headshots and precision, and you will most certainly have a hard time beating this game if you are not a good shot. There are multiple difficulty settings, but even Normal can present a good challenge at times.  The use of bullet time is central to the game's mechanics, but Max Payne 3 uses it well, sometimes scripted in it's use, but also allowing you to use the limited function to engage large groups of enemies for Die Hard-esque cinematic style asskickery.  The game also looks fantastic, and the game runs smoothly. I haven't experienced any bugs or glitches in it. Rockstar did a great job making a PC version of this game. Aiming is responsive and won't hold you back or hinder you. It's just you, your gun, and your aim.  I definitely recommend if you enjoy shooters that take skill, are full of action, and basically just trying to get as many people as possible to stop your bullets with the bridge of their noses.",

'I started to wonder if my luck had finally run out when I realized it had, a long time ago. It's why I was here.'  -Max Payne   Good old self-deprecating Max is more quotable than ever before in  Max Payne 3 , the latest installment by  Rockstar Studios  into one of my favorite series. The above are just a tiny sample of the nonstop narration he delivers to flavor the single-player campaign experience. In my opinion this alone would justify playing through the game, even if it didn't have solid mechanics, excellent visuals and fun features like Bullet Time.    My time played (almost 10 hours as of this writing) reflects campaign completion on the Hard setting, some dabbling in the arcade mode and a few rounds of the extensively fleshed out multiplayer modes. Even a brief foray into multiplayer reveals that there's plenty of progression to be had for those willing to pour hours into it. Like any brilliant solo campaign, this one is an absolute thrill ride but feels tragically brief once finished.   The story is not what I'd call ambitious but for the most part holds up well: Max is a classic and highly satisfying tale of tragedy with dark comedy mixed in. He's simply one of the most likeable antiheroes I've come across in gaming. The choice of setting provides an interesting, colorful departure from the grit and grime of the noir style that characterized the previous games (but don't worry, there's some of that here, too). Fans of the IP will recognize a few throwbacks to those predecessors.    Gameplay is functional and engaging. Level design is mostly good, but here and there feels uninspired/recycled, which makes me wonder about the quality of all those DLC map packs I didn't buy. Bullet time is tons of fun, rewarding twitch aim &amp; fast reflexes. On Hard difficulty there were only a few encounters I had to replay, and the frustration was minor so I'd recommend that setting. Multiplayer--despite the variety of play modes, maps, weapons and avatar customizations--did not capture my interest, nor did I find the progression or social systems appealing. I'm sure it comes down to personal preference, so I recommend you at least try it out, but for me personally there are better options when it comes to online shooters. The arcade modes and time trials were also only of marginal interest to me so I won't discuss them here. The strength of Max Payne 3 for players like me lies in the campaign.   The game appears bug free and has only minor issues. During my hours played it only crashed once. It ran smoothly with settings maxed--granted, the game is two and a half years old at the time of this review, but the visuals hold up well enough to triple A standards unless you're talking about top of the line resolutions. I found it odd that weapons with a laser sight attachment were less accurate/useful than the standard ones due to the loss of crosshairs on screen in aim mode. Also a bother was how the triggered Bullet Time would force me into my 1-handed weapon; threw me off a bit if I was using 2-handed and suddenly encountered an event. On rare occasion activating Bullet Time will send you jumping over the edge of something like a building or dock, which is instant-death bad news, so be careful to avoid that very annoying problem. The last and worst offender I have to mention is Rockstar's Social Club which in my opinion is an unwelcome and failed DRM-like hoop to jump through. If when you first launch the game you can't sign into your account, go to their website and change your password then restart the game and it should log you in and let you register/activate the game just fine.   I had a great time with this one and honestly would recommend it to any gamer who enjoys the action shooter, which Rockstar does extremely well.  TIP: Use your Bullet Time wisely, as it will make fights much more manageable and sometimes save your bacon. Timing and position are important. TIP: Keep your gun reloaded to avoid having an emptied clip while downed. Downed w/no bullets = dead.",

            "review_text": "A third-person shooter featuring Max Payne and his trademark 'slow motion' action, set in a crime dominated Brazil (not very far from the truth, unfortunately).  Unlike other games in the series, Max Payne 3 attempts to address social issues instead of the main character’s personal issues, such as police violence, the gap between the rich and the poor and drug trafficking in Brazil.  Here, the rich try to live the American life style, while the poor are slaughtered. Payne witnesses a favela raid and a prison riot, in scenes reminiscent of some Brazilian movies like 'City of God', 'Carandiru' and 'Elite Squad'.  Even after facing a satanic cult, Max Payne is still surprised by the violence of the Brazilian police. In this game, the police are the real enemy, not the gangsters. The police are involved in the most heinous crimes, with the support of a corrupt politician.  The game features a São Paulo dominated by organized and disorganized crime. A Brazil that worships soccer, where poor people are killed by the police, while the rich are vying with each other through drug watered parties. Is this so far from reality?  There are two interesting characters: the American ex-cop who does volunteer work in Brazil, and the sex tourist. Both sides of the relationship between Brazilians and Americans. But in the end, Payne is the hero. Not unlike any american action movie, after all.  Good action for those who like action movies set in 'exotic' slums.  Positive points * Great action and graphics. * Multiplayer cooperative mode.  Negative points * Brazilian portuguese voice-acting kinda sucks. * Challenges are boring to complete.",

We remember the Max Payne franchise for the terrific plots and character development of every character in the story. Well, the character development was there, but the plot, since it was just Max looking doing his job and later, trying to save the girl and then, looking for revenge, wore a bit thin. We're used to those unbelieable nightmare sequences where Max was battling his own demons. Here, the only demons he was fighting was alcoholism. Sure, he's a retired cop doing a private security job in a different country but I would have loved to see the plot having some sort of intimacy with Max himself.   But the action was very realistic. One could tell how bullet time and covering behind objects was seamlessly integrated. Max even uses his hands to disarm enemies in close combat and can't carry more more weapons than his outfits allow him to. The voiceover is great, as usual. James McCaffrey did a splendid job, although it could be a little dissonant listening to Max's voice when we're trying to listen to enemies coming through a room!   You should play this game, irrespective of whether you've played the previous two games.",

            "review_text": "Max Payne 3 can be summarized in one sentence: Shooting Brazilian gang members and paramilitary forces with the use of slow motion and John Woo's Hard Boiled in one hell of a game. I used to play the previous two Max Payne games back in my original Xbox and the third game is hard to describe. The genre of the game is a hybrid of crime thriller with a sheer blend of intense firefights, containing the cinematography of Tony Scott's 2004 film, Man on Fire. Strangely enough, Max Payne is more cynical about himself and his surroundings. If you know what happened in the first two games, then you should know why he acted in such attitude. The story in the game is rather...complex up to the point that it is confusing on what's happening and who's who. The narration mixes up to Max's current situation in Brazil and his past in New Jersey and Panama Canal. Unfortunately, the story progression tends to go back and forth of Max's past and present, ruining the mood on certain points of the story. Without a doubt, the gameplay is highly impressive with excellent body movement and human flexibility for Max to fire his weapon at any position. However, the game does feel a bit repetitive and can be difficult for some gamers to not play the entire game in one sitting. Overall, the game is recommended to those who like slow motion, action movies particularly John Woo's Heroic Bloodshed films, and gun play. However, the game may not be for some gamers who are more story centric (even though there were some surprising moments in the story). The story's good and may feel a bit 'uncomfortable' in certain parts of the story. It has my recommendation.",

After completing the campaign I have to admit that it isn't bad at all. The presentation is great, Max's voice actor delivers and the whole atmosphere, though not New York, comes together. The graphics are great, the physics are nice and I didn't have any problem with the music or sounds. BUT and it is a big but: there are couple of things which simply killed the game for me. First. if either MSAA or FXAA is enabled, it screws up mouse movement BIG time. Seems like Rockstar still can't properly develop for the PC. Second: the enemies are so bullet-spongie that you can only advance with headshots which is not what I've wanted and also makes certain situations a nightmare. Third: usually I don't have a problem if games take over my character to advance to the next area/level but here it's just ridiculous. Also it constantly switches back to the default weapon which sometimes can screw you over. Fourth: weird gameplay issues like iniating a reload, enter bullet time then exiting the cover simply cancels the reload... WHAT?? Also other weird movement issues... So yeah, great ideas ruined by technical and gameplay problems. As for the multiplayer side of things: it would be a nice touch, however it's still full of cheaters... worthless. To be honest I partially regret my purchase since I didn't wait till the price was low enough. I wanted to write that ' I would only recommend this game if you want a nice singleplayer experience for couple of hours and you can get the game for 5€ or less', however after thinking it through: NO, don't get this game, watch the story on YouTube and get another one instead.",

So I went in to Max Payne 3 with a pretty open mind. I expected some wisecracks, monologue, nice graphics and a bunch of cool shooting action.  Well, the wisecracks and monologue is there. The graphics are also pretty decent at max settings. The shooting is pretty cool too, when you get over the hostile approach to PC controls the game employs, like mouse-accelleration.   However, the first thing the game does is show me a cutscene running at a terrible resolution, because I hadn't been allowed to set options yet. Then, I have to create a 'Rockstar Social Club' profile. Which I didn't really want, but apparently this is Rockstar's substitute for GFWL. It took some annoyance and the game being unable to give a report if you accidentally type a wrong password, instead it just hangs at the loginscreen. This is amateurish.   Finally, I got to play the game. Or that is, after a 15 minute long cutscene, I got to move Max around a little and shoot a couple of guys. Then another cutscene. This then describes perfectly the game from then on forward. Move around and shoot for 1,5 minutes, then just after you've found a rhythm and started to become comfortable with the controls, a cutscene interrupts the gameplay for some minutes. Most the game is just shooting 5 guys to see another cutscene, from the experience I managed to gain playing it. Which quickly became sort of annoying.  And it might be the only experience I got to have, because when I wanted to play the second time, the Rockstar Social Club once again rears its head, with the game demanding that I activate it before I can play it, even though I already had. Again, it hangs trying to log in to the Rockstar Social Club. OK. I manage to make a password reset on the account, and this time, after some waiting, it logs in. However, instead of loading the game like you'd expect, the game just hangs on a 'MAX PAYNE 3' logo that says 'loading' in the bottom right corner. Nothing happens, the process doesn't seem to do anything and after waiting for 3 minutes, the game is on a SSD, I became tired of waiting and shut it down. Maybe I'll give it another go. But it really wasn't good enough that I want to even spend the time waiting for a rescan of the local files.",

I have to admit that I was perplexed, perhaps even turned off at this idea when I initially heard about it. After all, Max Payne had established itself as a melodramatic noir crime story set in New York City, the complete opposite of its new sunny, colorful, Brazilian setting. Along with the new setting there were also new developers, while previous titles were handled by Finnish studio Remedy Games, Max Payne 3 was being developed by an internal Rockstar studio in Vancouver. This definitely raised a few eyebrows, mine especially. How did it all turn out?  Wonderfully.  Max has never felt better. Controls are snappy. The animations are some of the best I've ever seen in gaming. The story is a little lacking, but all we really needed is Max with guns, truckloads of bad guys, and bullet time.  The dark and brooding atmosphere of the first two games is replaced by an aesthetic that closely resembles a Tony Scott film, particularly the film Man on Fire. There are a lot of filmic effects overlayed on the cutscenes that distort and blur the shots as they are framed off, highlighting key moments and important plot points. The combination of these effects gives the production it's own unique feel.  Overall a must play of ANY action game enthusiast.",

As usual, I will start with the BAD stuff first:  Something I usually do in games is start right away on Hard difficulty. Don't do that here. Just don't.

They usually die of a few shots, normal stuff. However, in chapter 3 or 4 of the first Episode, you're dropped on a Stadium, fighting enemies that take WAY too much damage... Or so it appears. These enemies appear all the time later on, and they seem to take insane damage because they wear ballistic vests and all that kind of crap. Shoots to the chest literally deal nothing, so you're forced to either deal cheap and now damage to their hands and legs, or aim to the head and literally drop them dead in one hit. That's kinda dumb. It also gets really annoying on the last stage, when there are just too many enemies, and checkpoint on the game aren't really plentiful (why does it look like SAVING is a thing from the past? I think auto-saves are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). But wanna now why is it all so difficult?  Max Payne 3 tries to be realistic. IT'S F#CKING MAX PAYNE. HE SPENDS HALF THE GAME EATING PAINKILLERS, SLOWING TIME AND KILLING HALF THE POPULATION WITH GUNS, WHY DOES THIS NEED TO BE REALISTIC? Well, Rockstar though realism is what people wanted on Max Payne, so instead of getting low ammo from corpses but being able to carry tons of weapons and finding well enough painkillers while taking decent damage, you get a ton of ammo from corspes while being forced to carry two to three weapons only, while taking really high damage ON NORMAL DIFFICULTY while barely getting any painkillers. It doesn't feel like an actual sequel, but more like a weird reboot.   Lastly, the game goes full Metal Gear Solid with the cutscenes. Remember the old days when they were told in cheesy but lovable novel-like comics? Not in here, for some reason. Instead it constantly has weird visual effects all over the screen to simulate Max's problems with alcohol and painkillers, and also has gigantic letters all over the screen, capturing the important lines. However, that's like 40% of what people say, as these letters are all over the place. There's also too much cutscenes when Max Payne 1 and 2 either use comics and tell stuff as you go, here it always stops with at least a minute long cutscene were nothing interesting might even happen. It also feels really annoying that most of those cutscenes TAKE AWAY your big weapon. You're only able to carry two little hand-gun-like weapons on most of them, and if you were carrying something like a shotgun or a rifle, it's most likely gone after that. Even at times, the game takes away your second hand-gun, while putting you against enemies WITH RIFLES. Which just feels like a cheap way to keep the difficulty going.  All of that being said though, what do we have left? A more or less good story, following a few years after Max Payne 2. Now the story is NOWHERE as good as previous games, but it does the job alright to the end.  The music and sound department is actually quite ♥♥♥♥ing good. I'm listening to some of the tracks right now as I write this down, it's that good.  The levels are quite detailed, a lot of work was put on them, and there are usually some stuff you can f#ck arround with or observe on each of them.  Max's dialogue is also seriously good, and the voice actor deserves all credit he can get his hands upon. All voices here are cool, but specially his.  The graphics deserve a big f#cking mention here. The game is seriously well optimized, running at really high FPS and maxed options on my kinda outdated graphics card. There was also not much loading, and the loading screens are usually well hidden on cutscenes, probably why there are so f#cking many.   There's a multiplayer too, although good f#cking luck trying to find people on it. Although I got to play it a few years ago and it was actually fun.  Is Max Payne 3 worth it? Yeah. But seriously, play the other two first. If you haven't, then you're doing this all wrong. If you enjoyed them, then go ahead: but wait for a good sale. I got mine for arround 2-3€, and I do admit that for that, it's a really good f#cking bargain.  And remember: don't awnser that. It's a rhetorical question.",

            "review_text": "Max Payne 3 was Rockstar’s attempt at making a Max Payne game, as before it was Remedy who had done the previous two. Now right off the bat let me mention that fans of the previous 2 may or may not like the new Max Payne character as Rockstar seems to have changed him or at least the game’s tone from at times a 4th wall breaking humor to an ultra depressed middle aged man with a serious substance abuse problem. Max is still voiced by the same VO which is good because honestly I can only picture him doing Max’s voice. I can see where some of the criticism is coming from as far as the seemingly negative way Rockstar has changed Max’s character and tone towards life. However I can also appreciate the changes; Max is older, he has been dealing with the loss of so many of his loved ones that you can not deny what that could do to a person mentally. The still framed pictures or comic book type loading and cut-scenes have been replaced with fairly well done but good looking in-game cut-scenes, which some people hate because well if you die a lot then you have to rewatch every single one multiple times and sometimes it just seems to take the game forever to load that section of the level. Much of the cut-scenes have an odd video interference effect which some people complain causes headaches because it can cause the screen to flash different colors and tones rapidly. It was honestly an odd choice because it happens throughout the entire game, not just when Max is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.   The combat however, at least to my memory, I still have my old Max Payne 1 and 2 disks here, has not changed in fact to me it has been improved dramatically, some ways it is a step back but I’ll get to that. The animations, Max’s movements are very fluid and stunned me when I first saw them, Max no longer rigidly flys through the air and clips through walls and other objects, his body reacts differently to what he hits or slides along. The gunplay and shooting in very pleasing however it seems to be more geared towards being somewhat realistic as far as weapon damage. No longer can Max take hit after hit and a headshot from the enemy is an instant death, which is something very new to the series, at least as far as I can remember. The slow motion gunplay as well as gunplay outside of bullet time is quite enjoyable and a vast improvement over what it was in the past, movement and aiming is much more fluid and responsive. That being said one addition to the slow motion bullet time system that Max Payne has been known for is what amounts to a last stand, or rather if you are mortally wounded but still have painkillers in your inventory, the game will automatically pop the pills and you will fall in place while in slow motion in an attempt to kill the person who brought you own. Doing so will allow you to recover from what would have been a death, failing to find any target let alone return the fatal shot to the enemy who shot you will result in death. This plays into both this game’s improvement and a potential and constant problem; sometimes when you are put into last stand you quite literally can not see the person who shot you OR what normally happens is that Max falls in such a position that he can not actually get a shot at the target thus ending in a very frustrating death. This unfortunately happens rather consistently throughout the game so that is one major negative that I can readily ID and say “I am honestly not sure that they REALLY play tested that idea”.  The story and setting are fairly different from what most Max Payne vets are used to playing, rather then New Jersey or New York apartments, side streets and allyways, fighting mobsters. You are now fighting in Brazil against gangs, paramilitary organizations and state forces. The settings are quite well done as is the atmopher, gone are you abilities to readily understand the NPCs within the game unless they speak English or unless you speak I believe Portuguese (I could be very wrong sorry) which makes you feel very isolated and even more alone many times. The story can be either good or bad depending on how you look at it or what kind of story that you enjoy, some will like it, others will hate it, I happened to like it.  The music is another major factor to me if how I feel while playing, if a game has bad music while I’m trying to do action rolls and dodging the experience may not feel as good as a game that has a good sound track. This title however does have quite a good sound track and the music fits many of the situations that you run into especially the last level song, it really gets you pumped to finally see the end to this story, to me anyway, others have said it was too house or techno and not fitting of Max Payne. It will come to personal opinion honestly. The sound effects are really well done, from the weapons fire, the explosions and the ambient environments everything feels like a lot of effort was put into making it feel right. The past 2 Max Payne titles never really had any problems with this however I was happy that despite Remedy not making this game that Rockstar was able to keep that feeling.  The game also hits that little part of the brain for completionists, collectables for golden guns that actually have an in game benefit (mostly ammo capacity). So depending on what kind of person you are, you may end up playing through this game several times trying to get all of the little bits and pieces which can further extent your play time. It is however optional.  The multiplayer aspect is a different story as far as my enjoyment; while it is well fleshed out and not just some tacked on addition to meet the new generation requirement that every game needs multiplayer it is however not very fun. I did try to enjoy it, I even played with a friend but after maybe 4 or 6 hours of total time in the multiplayer I had had enough and to me the combat did not transition well from singleplayer to multiplayer. There are no dedicated servers so again PC gets a not so stable port for the multiplayer side of this game, it is Peer to Peer and in a game which revolves around slow motion and good aiming that is not a winning combination. Some people may enjoy it others do not, and on top all of this from what I understand there is a serious problem with cheaters and hackers.  Over all at least for the main story, not the multiplayer aspect of this game, I quite enjoyed the third iteration of Max Payne even if it was done by Rockstar. I enjoyed it and I felt that it was a worthy number to add to the franchise.",

            "review_text": "Max Payne. For any gamer who knows their salt, this name should be familiar. His publisher Take Two has released two games in 2001 and 2003 to great reviews and a decent amount of critical acclaim. Since then, though, the ex-cop has been left in the dust, barely being remembered other than that crappy movie that was released around then with Mark Wahlberg. It seemed for a while Max would just fade away, until back in 2012, when Rockstar Games, now owners of Take Two, released Max Payne 3. How was that? Well, we're taking a look at it now.  STORY: You're... Max Payne, of course. After the events of the last two games, Max is a drunken mess, he smokes regularly, he's addicted to painkillers, and he tries to find a reason to not blow his head off daily. Up until one day, when his old friend Passos comes across him and hires him to guard a wealthy family in Sao Paulo, Brazil named the Bronco's. Everything seems fine until the wife of the eldest Bronco is kidnapped, and Max and Passos go on a search to find her. That's all I can really say about it without spoilering it. It's a pretty well put together story. It can be pretty depressing at times when you see Max lose, but when he wins, which is kind of rare, it feels great. That's really all you can ask for. The story is a bit on the short side, took me 10 hours to beat it on Medium, but it's a good experience regardless.  GAMEPLAY: 3rd person shooter. You have 4 slots for guns. You have 2 slots one handed weapons, another for a two handed weapon, and the 4th one is dual wielding the two one handed weapons you have on you. All methods are satisfying enough, and gunplay is fantastic. The innovative Bullet Time from the last few games is here too, and that is great, and it has some new features. If you carry painkillers on you, and you lose all your health, you have a chance to shoot the guy who would have killed you and take him out, getting some health back and putting you back into the fight. Ammo can be a bit scarce, especially on the harder difficulties, but if you're efficient enough, you can do well. The game is freaking hard, btw, even when I played it on Medium, it was hard. The game is really satisfying when you beat the levels, and I ended up replaying it on Hardcore, which made me tear my hair out a bit but it was totally worth it. Gameplay is fantastic, maybe even best of 2012.  GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Game looks good. The favelas of Sao Paulo look grimy and dirty, the nicer penthouses are well designed. There are a lot of nice details in all the levels without a doubt. This isn't a grand open world game like GTA or Red Dead Redemption or LA Noire like Rockstar is known for making, but the smaller levels are fine. They all look great. Game runs pretty well as well, since it's a game from 2012, if you have any recent hardware you should be fine. Runs well enough on my PC, and if I can run it, you can run it.  CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Max Payne has his voice actor from the last games, James McCaffery, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, is he as good as ever. The other characters are voiced well enough too. The characters look good, Max goes through a bit of a redesign halfway through which some people didn't like, but I thought he looked fine. Overall it's fine.  MULTIPLAYER: Practically abandoned on PC, played a bit on my 360, kind of fun, but nothing spectacular, odds are unless you get a big community for it you wont get to play it anyway.  EXTRAS: In each level, there are clues that relate to the story, though you have to look for a few of them. There are also some parts for golden versions of each weapon, and if you get all the parts scattered around the levels, you get a better version of the gun every time you pick it up. Once you beat the game, you unlock Score Attack, which is basically a kill and get points mode. There's also the New York Minute mode, where you have to beat a level in a minute. Well, you get time for killing guys, but still. If you arent impressed by that, then you have New Youk Minute Hardcore mode, in which you have to beat the whole game in a minute with the same bonuses, with no deaths. Yeah... good luck with that.  FINAL VERDICT: Phenominal game. One of the best of 2012, strong competator with Far Cry 3 and Mass Effect 3 for that slot. 9/10, it's worth picking up around a sale, hell, even right now. It's also one of the few games that I keep going back to time and time again to play through it once more, so I have to give some credit to them for that. Grab this game, you won't regret it",

            "review_text": "This is what happens when you give a series to a development team that had nothing to do with the earlier entries and basically give them a small sheet of paper with some basic gameplay mechanics, and a note saying 'cast James McCaffrey as the title character': A game that doesn't feel like Max Payne, doesn't play like Max Payne, and actively punishes you for trying to play Max Payne. Oh, and don't forget needing to sign up for some obnoxious PC-only DRM service because Rockstar expects its paying customers to be treated like untrustworthy criminals! At least the PC version has some nice enhancements. Sure, they're only in the graphics department, and maybe in being able to actually customize controls assuming the console versions have that feature removed for no reason.  After this, you get to watch a long, unskippable cutscene that tells you 'game is still loading!' if you try to skip it... all before you're allowed to get to the main menu.  The menu of all things.  Want to watch it again, so you can see the story when you're not just trying to set up your controls and graphical settings? I hope you're technically inclined enough to find the .bnk file in the install directory, otherwise you can forget about that.  You're given a bland onslaught of in-your-face tutorials during the first chapter because clearly people who play games are too stupid to learn basic mechanics on their own, or in a separate tutorial- an option Remedy's titles offered. You're also given an introduction to the horrendous input lag this title has! Press a button to move, and Max pauses before doing so. Let go of the button, and Max keeps going for a second before deciding to stop. Try to shootdodge, and Max will pause before the effect actually begins. Everything feels delayed, even the simplest things like mouse movement. (I refuse to try using a controller to see if it's more responsive. I didn't buy a PC game to play with a controller. Outside of vehicle-related games, that's a bit like buying an HDTV to watch VHS cassettes on.)  Get used to seeing cutscenes, as there are a lot of them. Out of the playing time that's surely displayed with this review, I've probably gotten to spend under half of that in actual gameplay. I had bad flashbacks to Inversion while playing with the amount of '30 seconds of gameplay between multi-minute cutscenes' that was going on! Inversion at least had the benefit of not being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of an existing series of games. The rest is cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, with obnoxious and pointless effects plastered everywhere. Color desyncing, scanlines, freeze-frame of Max's face pushed to the side, the multiple-PiP effect of 24 fame, flashing lights, certain words that were  just spoken  needlessly printed to the screen... It's constant, erratic, and nauseating, especially when you're trying to actually  see what the hell is going on . Thanks Rockstar, I appreciate being given migraines when I try to play your games. There's also a strange anomaly regarding the cutscenes: each one phases between pre-rendered and real-time rendering for no particular reason. (This is most noticeable if you have recording software that reports framerate running, as the pre-rendered are thankfully very high quality despite the graphics clearly being below what the real-time graphics are capable of. Pre-rendered cutscenes 'run' at an incredibly higher framerate than the real-time cutscenes.)  Remember how I said the game punishes you for trying to play it as if it were a Max Payne game? Veterans of the series will see, in the rare gameplay segment, that trying to remain mobile and use bullet time and shootdodging will end up getting you killed as quickly as standing in an inferno. Instead, you're clearly expected to cling to cover like some Gears of War/Kill.Switch player and play it that way- including switching back to your main gun from your pistol because you're most likely in this situation straight out of a cutscene.  A few more horrendous gameplay changes are ones clearly decided upon because Rockstar wanted to make an Xbox game out of a historically PC-based series. Gone is Max's ability to hold an arsenal of weaponry and grenades that provide a variety of options for how to shoot up the next mook. Gone are even the names of the weapons! Max can now only hold two pistols, with the option to use either one of the two, or dual wield them (Ingram-style machine pistols count for this). You can pick up a two-handed weapon, but if it runs out of ammo or you want another two-handed, you have to drop the gun. If you get into a cutscene, you will have to switch back because you're forced to use a pistol again. Your weapon selection is a radial menu, clearly designed for a joystick. Painkillers now take effect near-instantly rather than healing over time, but it doesn't really matter since unless you're huddled behind cover like a generic modern TPS game your health's going to run low just as fast anyway. Run out of health, but have painkillers? Rockstar took a page from Call of Duty's book like so many other unoriginal people and give you a variation of 'last stand' - kill the person who 'killed' you and you get to stand back up. Fun! Challenging! Pointless!  Oh, and your ability to quicksave or save from the menu where  you  would like? Rockstar ignored that idea too. Can't give  too  much control to the player, right?  Overall, someone unfamiliar with the previous entries in the franchise and can stomach the awful input lag (or the thought of playing a PC game with a controller) might enjoy this, so long as constant cutscenes with nauseating effects aren't a problem. As a fan of the older games, and someone who just went through the entirety of Max Payne 2 again, I have to say this is the  true  Fall of Max Payne. My only consolation was I spent less than $5 on this thing during a sale, because I don't think I can be bothered to go any further.",

On the other hand, the game suffers from some terrible design ideas like last stand (basically leaves you a sitting duck on the floor being shot at from multiple directions), clunky controls, incredibly cramped environments, over reliance on closet mobs that literally spawn out of thin air, annoying monologue by Max about everything.. (and I mean EVERYTHING) and some of the worst follow NPC's in recent history. The story isn't particularly well written, characterization is average at best and the (thankfully) few 'boss' encounters are average at best; frustrating at worst.

Definitely worth those 35 GB.  Replay value is very high - many game modes to choose from, collectibles, 'grinds'. Oldschool mode and Max's original skin/character model being one part of it.  I've encountered 2 things I didn't like: 1.) Some visual effects related to alcohol, painkillers and some other things is too much. There are few short parts when it's difficult to watch the screen. 2.) The game crashed ~3 times during cut-scenes. Pausing the game before crash helped to solve the issue. 4 GB of RAM (+1 GB of VRAM) is probably not enough sometimes.  Other than that, the game is fantastic. I'm pleasantly surprised with its qualities.  My personal GOTY 2012.",

            "review_text": "Original post May 30 2012  gameaday-ish.blogspot.com   Max leapt and spun like a leaping and spinning thing, puking bullets in every direction, but unable to hit anything he aimed at. He grumbled to himself, dry and overly serious, deeply committed to the newfound film noir tone the original game had parodied. Max drank and took some painkillers, because that’s what haunted men do. They also shoot people.  A lot of people.  The simple joy of the original Max Payne lay in its mechanics rather than its all too self-aware neo-noir pastiche. While it did feature some truly haunting moments, the general tone of the game was a celebration of the inherent cheesiness of noir.   The fun lay in the ability to leap into a environment littered with enemies, pistols akimbo, and engage bullet-time, slowing the action to a crawl. Everything except Max would creep like molasses’s giving the keyboard and mouse wielding player razor sharp control.  Max Payne 2 updated the look but not the feel, replacing the blocky models with more polygons but retaining the bullet ballet aesthetic of the first game. With a slightly more complicated and less bizarre plot, Max Payne 2 is an underrated gem, though it does have it's own points of frustration. Like the horrific level in the first game of following a trail of blood towards an infant's screams in a nightmare, the second game has a brutal escort mission featuring a costumed character that waddles on flippers.  Max Payne 3 retains the bare bones of the mechanical joy of shooting, but, at least on console, lacks the precision necessary to make bullet time work. Combined with a corridor-based level design of cramped quarters and waist high walls, a cover mechanic is forced into the game, rendering the initial hook, bullet time, nearly useless. Only during what is essentially QTE sequences rendered in forced bullet time does the original mechanic sing.   I suspect PC will be the best control scheme for Max Payne 3 Where MP3 drops the ball carried by the first two games, it more than compensates in story.   Unlike the pyschodrama comic-book noir of the first two games, Max is a truly tortured soul in the third. Addicted to painkillers and a barely functional alcoholic, bad choices lead to Max working as a bodyguard in South America. Lost, both in spirit and body, Max struggles to make sense of the machinations and violence that surrounds him by shooting everyone he sees.  The final act outlasts its welcome, the emotional impact of the story already complete, leaving only a hollow revenge story to supply closure.  Max Payne 3 misses the mark in terms of replicating the bliss of slow motion shooting that inspires it but tells a gripping noire tale of a man descending into darkness.",

If you've played Grand Theft Auto IV, the style will be familiar, for this game and GTA4 share the same writer.  On a technical level, the game is polished to a mirror sheen. Rockstar has redeemed themselves when it comes to PC ports- the game has next to no technical flaws, the controls all work as intended, the graphics are beautiful, and the loadtimes are reasonably quick. The framerate remains a smooth 60, and for once, Max Payne 3 takes advantage of multiple cores and other oft-neglected features from day 1. Aim assist defaults to its 'off' setting, greatly reducing aiming frustration and making shootdodges and bullet-time a blast.  Overall, I strongly recommend this game for Max Payne veterans and newcomers alike.",

Max Payne is no longer a cop, he's now a bodyguard for a wealthy family, but that does not mean he has stopped the drugs, the booze and the smokes. The story is about a gangster clan wich kidnaps the daughter of your boss. While Max risks his life often enough to find her, he discovers the streets and 'background'-crimes of brazil and also a few plot twists about bad guys lying and ♥♥♥♥.   The story is a bit thin compared to the previous games, especially those moments where you don't really care about a few important characters of the story.   The gameplay is very similiar to the previous games. Max shoots his way through tons of badies while using bullet time and pain killers, a very fun combination that has always worked good. One point is a bit sad though: You can only carry 2 handguns and a 2 handed weapon (and if you dual-equip the 2 handguns you actually drop your big gun). I personally think the massive amounts of guns you could carry and use whenever you wanted from the previous games were a better solution. Also there are no more grenades for you to use. Allllllso: no more quicksaving. A bit stupid if you have to fight the same hoard of enemies again and again :C  The game has a very high graphic standard. Most of the time you'll have high quality textures and good exploding effects. The voice acting is good, especially the monologues of Max burn into your memory. The soundtrack on the other hand is a 'funky' version of the original soundtrack. I kind of dislike this, the 'hawaii five-o'-theme song would probably been better...this is no longer a 'sad' max payne, its a 'depressed and angry' max payne in a zoo full of partying gay flamingos.   Conclusion: I recommend the game for the sake of having max payne gameplay, while I dislike most of the setting of the game. There are a few flashbacks that play in New York, but its just never the same anymore.",

The story is well-written and engrossing. Dark comedy, quick quips and striking metaphors exceptionally voice-acted make this game's dialogue possibly the best I've ever experienced. But the story itself is also unpredictable, well thought-out and emotionally engaging. This is no Michael Bay movie--it's a well thought out drama, a reflective man's tale, and the script is one among many strong pieces in this complete game. The visuals are outstanding. The settings are diverse and colourful; the animations are varied, smooth and solid; and the graphics themselves top notch as expected. In fact, on the whole, the attention to detail in this game--in its script, graphics, sound, voice-acting--and on and on--is simply outstanding. Example: when you pick up painkillers (the game's form of health) you will get a new thoughtful sound clip almost every time.   Last but certainly not least is the gunplay--and 'gunplay' is how I would describe it. The formula is simple, but it works. Flying through the air in slow motion putting holes in bad guys' heads doesn't get old. The game is incredibly violent, which isn't always ideal, but in this case it suits the mood and theme of the game and adds to the many jaw-dropping moments throughout. The term 'adrenaline rush' comes to mind when thinking of my first few hours experience with this game. There is so much more I could say, but perhaps the best compliment I can pay this game is that as soon as I finished my first play-through, I began another on the SAME day. The only real bad thing I can say about this game is that it had to come to an end. Picking this up at $10 or less is a no brainer if there ever was one. 9.6/10",

Now if you are worried about if in this game isnt enough weapons then you are wrong there is a lot of them and they are really fun to use, especially when you collect golden parts for weapons so your weapons will be gold plated (i think that is a nice addition to it :D ). 10/10  Graphics: The graphics are smooth and nice to look at, but in 2015 its not that much of a wow but games get older as us do and i am not personally like a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ (explosions do look really good i must admit :D ) 8/10 - 2015 10/10 - 2012  Level Design - This game has really detailed seroundings alltho i would really love to see Max Payne 4 in a open world because in this game you cant really go anywhere exept forward (its liniar thats what i am trying to say XD ) and i was hoping that i could explore some of these locations more like the Panama or New Jersey and other places that are in the game but i guess thats how it goes in Max Payne games. 8/10  SoundTrack - Now this game has an AMAZING soundtrack that follows tension,action and the desperate times of Max Payne that you really feel for his loss and that you understand why he cant get over it. 10/10  AI - The Enemies are smart,they will hide behind corners or other things and will proceed with caution and strike only at the right time,sometimes they will even charge you to force you to flee or shoot them (depending on difficulty level) 9/10  Difficulty Level - Speaking of difficulty i must say its pretty hard on higher difficulties then normal (if you get shot 2 times on hard difficulty you are down) but its not that bad as it sounds like because you can find a 'plenty' of painkillers around the level that will help you stay alive. If you will go down you will be in a mode that i called 'shoot for your life mode' that is simular to Borderlands one, basically what you need to do is to kill the guy that shot you to 'earn your life' (if you dont have painkillers you will just die) but there is a little problem with this mode,when someone gets you down and he has just hid behind a way you will die and that can ♥♥♥♥ off so thats a minus but for the most part its good. 7.5/10  Multiplayer - Surprisingly this game still has community playing the multiplayer and they have a damn right to play it because this multiplayer is really really REALLY COOL because you can trigger BULLETIME in a multiplayer session and that is glorious. I have not experienced any lag issues or problems playing multiplayer (and i even have crappy internet) and i think its enjoyable. 10/10  my final verdict on this game is 93/100 because this game is truly at its finest,buy it now! :D",

I found myself running head on into situations that were impossible to overcome and the controls felt like they were designed for a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard. The mechanics behind game were solid, bullet time was useful at times but the AI were just Batsh*t crazy. I found it hard to hang back and plink them off one by one with them suicidally sprinting at me and constantly throwing grenades and it made the game feel too fast paced and random over, being speedy and action packed how I prefer. One thing I found most unsettling is with me constantly dying the game decided to crash a lot which DESTROYED the flow of the game and its play ability. All in All I will keep the game installed and try to play it, but the game still needs some TLC, especially with the AI and crashing after the 3rd death. This game is not perfect for me, but great for people who use a gamepad and love a good fast-pace shooter!

            "review_text": "After a long, nine-year-long sleep, Max returns with all the galantry and badassery we´ve come to expect, but this time he does so with some cool new additions which elevate this third entry above its two counterparts.   Some flashback sequences aside, the action has shifted from the cold, dark alleys of New York to the sun-soaked favelas of Brazil, a first in the series, and boy does it suit the franchise well. This setting is Rockstar´s perfect opportunity to boast some incredibly detailed scenarios and astounding lighting effects, not to mention Max´s life-like reactions and breathtaking cinematics.  The story, while engaging from the get-go, does get somewhat muddled by the end, with several different names flying by without giving you a second to give a face to them, but then again, the story has always shared this trait in the previous offerings. What never gets old are Max´s quirky remarks dotted throughout the 12-hour-long campaign, which have become a trademark of the cop´s adventures. The visual design works wonders with the narrative feel, as key words are highlighted when a cutscene hits, giving the title a distinct feel above other, more generic third person shooters.  Of course, what would Max Payne be without bullet time? Dead, that´s what. But fear not, because this aspect which made the first two games so appealing is back, now packed with more over-the-top situations in which to try it out. A cover sistem has been introduced for the first time, and it feels way more natural than just standing behind corners like a big ol´ chump the Max from nine years ago did. Also, this time you actually see your character taking painkillers, instead of just magically regenerating your health for no apparent reason. These cool new features, added to the increase in guns and varied level design, give the title at hand a new dose of realism, to the point you actually feel this guy could totally exist in the real world.  Last, and most probably least, is the multiplayer portion. While it carries over the amazing slo-mo kills and over-the-top action, it can´t help but feel tacked-on, a way to lengthen the game´s overall duration, but definitely not in a good way. It does provide a fun few hours, but that´s probably all you will spend in it.   Overall, Max Payne 3 is an amazing experience, proving Rockstar is not only the master of open-world games, but also really good at trying its hand at relentless, third-person action. It could use a bit of tweaking here and there, and the multiplayer portion could have been better implemented, but that shouldn´t distract you from what this game really is: a fantastic, dazzling, non-stop thriller which will grab hold of you and won´t let go until you see it through.  Pros:  + Intriguing, if somewhat muddled, story + Fantastic audiovisual design + Max´s character, a fascinating insight into one of gaming´s most beloved anti-heroes + Bullet-time and all the spectacle it provides + Social Club integration + Voice acting is once again top-notch  Cons:  - Lackluster multiplayer - Some of Max´s remarks don´t quite impress like they used to back in the day - A co-op mode would have been gratefully accepted  Final grade: 9.4 (Amazing)  ",

Just shooting lots of heads, in sweet, graphic slo-mo.  The story kept things rolling along nicely and the narration and simulated alcoholism were nicely done, as were the graphics. Despite the special effect being basic by 2013 standards, the detail that has been put into this world is exceptional, with tons of things to smash and explode.",

MP3 gameplay is plodding and it doesn't help that it takes you out of the action CONSTANTLY with cut scenes. Graphics are good and sound it top notch, presentation wise the game looks great. The story however leave alot to be desired. The original MP was a punch in the gut and heart wrenching...it's mood went beyond dark...almost a sinister feel to the atmosphere and world around you. Both games were a bit of head trip. MP3 story is pretty much straight forward and you will never give a damn about any of the characters, it definitely tries to get you to care but you don't...it feels emotionless.",

But ultimately you dont much care. Max inner voice try to show his nihilistic side, but I didnt felt much connected. Enemies are just cannon fodder, thrown at you to just slow you down. You didnt feel any respect, any form of satisfaction when you clear the room. You can see spawning points miles away, you know those doors will be breached in 5 seconds.

It comes down to preference and I was just not into the way this game was designed to be 'a cinematic experience'.  Basically this is half a game as you spend half the playtime in cutscenes or 'press 'w' to 'game'' sections. The ridiculous amount of cutscenes is what ruined it in the end for me. Control is taken away from you too often and there are plenty of sections, where the time between cutscenes is so short, that you wonder why they even bothered giving you the control between them in the first place. All this to deliver a 'dark and twisted story', which perhaps it is but it fails to be engaging or original in my opinion.  As for the gameplay, it's pretty much the same as usual (thankfully) and works great. The controls feel smooth and you just feel like a badass, zig-zagging between bullets while delivering headshots left and right in slow-motion. It's one of those games that really makes you feel like you're in an action movie (and an R-rated one even!). The difficulty scales nicely but on normal mode, the game is sometimes a bit too forgiving and generous when a section is giving you trouble. The change in style and atmosphere didn't sit right with me at first but I appreciate Rockstar for taking chances and going in a new direction.   TL;DR: I liked playing Max Payne 3 when it was actually a game but the amount of unskippable cutscenes got very frustrating and will probably keep me from playing this again.",

The campaign is pretty linear, shoot people, advance, shoot more people, advance, so on. You get some rewards by exploring not so obvious areas in the game, among some easter eggs, but that's it.   The story is pretty good. Good balance of emotion and shock. I haven't played the first 2 games, so can't comment on how it compares to those two, but I can say it's pretty good.   One of the things I loved about was Max's commentary throughout the entire game. He comments on his actions, past memories, etc, along with quite a bit of dark humor, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Speaking of Max, his voice actor is great. Other voice actors do a great job as well, but you don't hear them as much as you hear Max. And the actor made every line enjoyable. The game also comes with a very nice score. It perfectly matches the feel of the game.  Game mechanics and combat is really good. Shooting people feels rather realistic. Max's abilities are really cool and essential in higher difficulties. Shooting people in slowmo along with the kill cam is so satisfying.  The game's graphics are good, for it's age. Shading and lights are a bit plasticy, but other than that, it looks good. Character models are very nice and realistic. It's also very well optimized. It's old, sure, but it barely even stressed my R9 280X while running maxed out at 1080p. GPU utilization was about 40-50% max.   The game is great, but R* ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM is not so much. You need to be online to play (every time I tried playig offline, it said it needed to verify) and other people had bigger problems with it. I personally didn't have that much trouble playing the game, but siging in everytime you want to play is a hassle.  Another super nitpicky gripe I had with the game was the camera effect every time Max drank alcohol or took a pill. I know it was necessary to show Max as the 'drunk, Payne (hehe) killer addict' he is, but it was a bit disteracting. Not a big issue at all obviosuly, but I felt I had to say it.",

            "review_text": "Max Payne 3 is almost the perfect example of how not to treat customers.  The awful Rockstar Social Club kicks off the experience off by, well, just existing. I struggled to create an account using the in-game overlay and ultimately couldn't. I had to register using a browser instead. The overlay keyboard flakes out, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't and fights with an actual physical keyboard.  It's exceptionally annoying when - after mashing enough keys to gain focus - the feedback on invalid entries is only returned after creation; and then capatures and passwords have to be re-entered.  Creating an account using a browser is only slightly less frustrating. You need a unique username because the username is some sort of necesary primary account key; even though the account is accessed by email address. Good luck finding a meaningful unique name - ♥♥♥♥YouRockstar was unfortuntely not allowed.  Finding a password is a lesson in how not to do security. I use pass-pharses, strong and easy to remember. Rockstar are fine with a couple of characters provided one of them is special. Which is both weak and annoying.  Finally the Captures only seem to work about one time in three. Also Incredibly annoying as they must be re-entered Every. Single. Time Rockstar decide a field is invalid.  Social Club account created; I tried actually logging in in-game. More Captures and an overlay keyboard that still doesn't work. Button mashing finally got me through. But the ordeal wasn't over.  Next is linking a Steam account to a Social Club account. Almost painless except for a very brief message that pops up telling me that my Stream account details will be visible through my Social Club account and I must go to some website to opt out. Of course it popped up so briefly I had no hope actually reading where to go to opt out. I found it under privacy settings in my profile. Turn. Off. Everything.  At last I got to start the game and that's exactly what happend. The game start playing in an unskippable cut-scene with no chance to change graphics details beforehand. You can't even tab out because the cut-scene pauses when Max Payne 3 loses focus.  And that's it. That's where I gave up. All my play time is not actual in-game play time but simply me trying to start the game.  If you value your user experience then avoid May Payne 3. I just can't be bothered.",

            "review_text": "Personally I can't recommend this game. To be honest I expect a lot more from the trailer and screenshot, and even though I know the game will involve shooting most of the time, the gameplay makes it really hard to enjoy.  Pro:  - Great graphics. - Interesting, profound and funny dialouges. - Very interesting plot.  Cons:  - The gameplay is very dull, you have to follow the storyline so strictly, which makes the game very hard to enjoy. The idea is to hide, dodge some bullet, save your painkillers for the rainy days and shoot anyone on sight. The world of Max Payne 3 is strictly restricted to the plot, and makes the exploration very dull. You can hardly interact with anything, except for weapons and objects that help progress the story.  - Weapons are few and somehow uncreative. Most of the time time you either find pistols, Uzi and shotguns. Even when you almost finish the game there aren't many new weapons to try. Worst of all, the weapons don't give you the feeling that they are different: a lot of time using diferrent guns feels so similar, which is, again, dull and boring. And, dude, you can't even melee unless you get too close to the enemies.   - This is minor, but the cutscenes are sometimes painfully long, and you cannot skip because it is 'still loading'.  - The game is too intense, even for easy mode. The player is required to use bullet time extremely wisely, because if it runs out then you are either screwed or will have to waste a lot of bullet for one guy. That alone makes it hard to enjoy the game to its full extent, whatever that extent is.   - For a game with massive shooting gameplay and number of enemies, sometimes you will expect to go stealthy and take out the enemies wisely, but in this game, 'stealthy' doesn't exist. You always have to shoot your way out, wich makes the gameplay, again, predictable and dull.  - Why the heck is this thing so heavy???? I understand the graphics are guilty of this, but 35 - 40Gi??   For those reasons I above I didn't really enjoy the game, but this is only my opinion, those who loves shooting entirely can try, but I can't recommend this.",

The story started like a bad hangover and only got darker from there. Things went from fine to f***ed up in about a second. Before I knew it, I was wrapped up in shootouts, kidnapping, corruption, organ theft, and worst of all, a bout of forced sobriety. Most of the characters were rich parasites with delusions of humanity; the kind of people who end up in glossy magazines or body bags, depending on how their luck runs. Almost all of them ended up with a target on their foreheads, whether I liked it or not. Sure, there were a few guys trying to play good, and there were more than a few saps getting dragged along through the game. I didn't know which of those two categories I was in, but I didn't have a lot of company either way.  When you pull a trigger in a lot of games, all you usually get is another notch on your guilty conscience. But this time around, I felt like I was in control. Diving into action felt like breaking the seal on a fresh bottle of whiskey. Getting hold of each new gun shouldn't have been so satisfying, but I was never one to question a healthy vice.  At times, certain video games were mocking me, the same bad joke I'd heard a hundred times before. The settings changed, but the rest was all too familiar. With Max Payne 3, I thought I was back on the same path, and I knew where it led. But before I knew it, I was in too deep. I don't know if it was the pills or the booze or if it was genuine emotion for a change, but I felt something with this game. A feeling I maybe didn't deserve, but that I damn sure bled for:  Total satisfaction.",

Fans of MP2 (like myself) will surely miss the grittyness and surreal, almost insane setting. MP3 is more down to earth, more in your face. The cutscenes in which Max breaks down are a little naiive and may appeal to younger players. Adults surely won't buy the over-the-top alcoholism and pill consumption displayed in the (partially non-skippable - why, oh, why?) sequences.  On the other hand, as the storyline unfolds, the game starts rolling, pulling you in. It's fast paced and action packed, which does a good job at making you forget about MP2. MP3 needs some time to get you into the mood, but once you start roaming the favelas, you get this good old depressive Max Payne feeling.  The controls definitely need some getting used to, but after you manage that, the game really starts paying back. A downside is that I almost never used the shootdodge technique, for which the Max Payne serier is so famous for. Too bad, it surely was a thing I was looking forward to. One thing that positively surprised me is its length. Aproximately seven to eight hours to complete the main storyline is quite ok these days. The learning curve is quite steep, so bear that in mind. It's by no means an easy game. There are also some graphical and sound bugs, which can be managed using the methods mentioned on the internets. I encountered only some sound problems which I got rid of by setting my speakers from 5.1 to 2.1. It surely didn't mess up the gaming experience.  So, do I recommend Max Payne 3? Yes, even though I definitely think it's inferior to Max Payne 2.",

Think about getting a Twin Peaks movie written and directed by Michael Mann... it won't be the worst movie in the world, but it will inspire plenty of headaches.)  Even the mechanics of Max Payne 2 are superior to what you'll get in Max Payne 3. You will be relying on hiding behind cover and exploiting sloppy shooting mechanics throughout Max Payne 3. In a third person shooter, the player can put the crosshair on an enemy while the player's model is still behind a corner, resulting in bullets hitting a wall instead of the enemy in the crosshairs... or at least that's what happens in Max Payne 2. In Max Payne 3, if your crosshair is on an enemy and turns red, then the bullet will land... Max's actual position in 3D-space be damned...  That being said, it's not a terrible game. On its own, under a different/new IP, this would have been a good, maybe great, game. But they called it Max Payne 3, and as such it fails to hit the mark on many levels.",

Suicidal boat rides, condemned buildings, scum-infested ghettos: It's all the same to Max, like picking off a scab and scratching until its numb.  There is no substitute for the dark, bitter grit that is Max Payne. ",

Features like Bullet Time and the ultra smart and diverse enemy AI are icing on top of the cake.

The game does a lot right, delivering quality graphics and sound to match with a notably good soundtrack with decent voice acting. You really do feel like Max Payne himself, thrust into an alien and hostile environment as a naive gringo.  In my opinion the game fails mainly in terms of its... feel. It can feel tense and overwhelming at times as Max faces wave-upon-wave of enemies, with sometimes only as little as a baggage trolley for cover (not ideal when the enemy AI likes to flank Max). Yet you have the Max Payne series gimmicks of diving forward with bullet time, which can more often than not end up spending one of Max's pill bottles and gaining little compared to if he had just stayed behind cover. Is the game supposed to be fun? I'm not so sure and I'm not so sure games even have to be. But there is a real contradiction between the absurdity of a single American Rambo tearing down actual armies, the diving forward with bullet time; and Max's frailty. It's very easy to find yourself on the wrong side of a Retry screen if you play recklessly, yet intuitively this feels like the sort of game in which you should. Instead, often it is better to retreat and find good cover than it is to dive forward clutching not one, but two Uzis and letting rip.  This is not Max Payne 3's only failing. The story, to me, was completely unengaging. Which is especially problematic when Rockstar insisted upon making most cutscenes virtually unskippable. This would be fine if they were few and far between but I have never encountered so many cutscenes in a third-person shooter; so many situations where the player loses control, loses agency for Max to simply walk through a door, or for Max to simply crouch behind cover. The player can do this! These do not need to be cutscenes! This was definitely a deliberate choice by Rockstar and in my opinion, a terrible one.  Collectibles like Clues and Golden Guns were particularly annoying in my playthrough of Max Payne 3. Golden Guns are sometimes hidden in levels in various nooks and crannies for the player to find, but Max Payne talks to himself saying things like 'I had to move fast' - encouraging, perhaps unwittingly, the player to move on and leave the collectibles behind! The collectibles felt more like a hindrance than anything else.  Overall this game frustrated me as the potential was truly there. Varied locations; good graphics; good sound; strong animations. But the feel of the game turned into an arduous slog, weighed down by its self-important, overbearing story with its serious tone in an absurd situation.  Not recommended.",

Countless cut scenes slowed down otherwise action packed gameplay. Sections where you're forced to walk at a snails pace through streets for no real reason, alongside jutting cinematics really made parts of the game boring. In the action, there was a good balance of the some fights being difficult and requiring a more methodical approach, but others were more simple and could be rushed into to keep up the action. Multiplayer doesn't even count into this review, as I could not get into it at all, it didn't feel built to be a multiplayer game, anyway.

This turns the game from merely another third-person shooter to a crazy skillshot fest.  And you're gonna need to use that ability a lot, because on the higher difficulties there are lots of enemies, and you die quickly. They make it even harder by strapping armor to the enemies, forcing you to aim for weak spots like the neck and eyes.  It has a surprising amount of replayability.

There are built in god mode and infinite ammo options, as well as the standard easy, medium, hard, realism (bullets do different damage based on where they hit, so a headshot on you is an instant kill) and 'old-school' (you die upon your damage meter filling up instead of going into a 'second wind' mode where you have to kill the guy who shot you to survive).  The story is interesting too. I liked the writing. It's nothing special, but I liked that it gave context to what happened and wasn't super crazy.  What I didn't like:  The filters. Jeez they hurt my eyes. It's way too bright.   I didn't like how on some levels there were invisible timers. Like I understand why they're there (without spoiling, people are kidnapped and you need to save them before they get away) but they really prevent you from exploring to find guns, pills (health), and collectibles.  Also the final levels aren't the best designed. They're basically open rooms with sparse cover, guys with LMGs and massive amounts of armor, and you. If you're godlike you can actually drop these guys by putting a bullet into this tiny, tiny, TINY spot where their visor is on their face or the thin slit of their neck, but otherwise, you're dropping easily over 20-30 rounds into each of them. And you better be good with that bullet time, because you're gonna need it when there's only two walls, enemies coming in from 3 directions, and you with only 2 berettas.  Also I felt that the weapon attachments could be expanded upon. Like sometimes your pistol comes equipped with a surpressor and/or a flashlight, but other than toggling the flashlight, there's not much you can do with it. And the surpressor is useless like 95% of the time anyways, and you only get them on certain missions.  Final Verdict:  It's a fun game. And it has tons of replayability. Get it on sale. 8.5/10",

The story is the real gem in this one, and it will keep you guessing for a lot of it. It's expertly delivered via voiceovers, continuing the brooding film-noir feeling the series is known for. Only just behind it is the graphics which genuinly suprised me. The animations in paticular are very lifelike and the gunbattles all turn extremely cinimatic, as though every bullet is planned. Control is smooth and responsive, and the bullet-time effect is still very satifying. Rockstar are well aware that they were the creators of this now ubiquitous gameplay mechanic, and they still do it best.  Adding 'golden-gun' parts to each level encourages exploration; it was one of the games that after finishing, I went right back to playing it again, to see if I could find all the hidden items. It doesn't hurt that trying to get through each room more effeciently is part of the game's charm: there is nothing better than bursting through doors and laying waste to everyone without taking a scratch.

Like others, I had some issues getting it to run on my machine. Some things you'll need to know 1) it requires a social club account. I have no idea why this really matters to the game. 2) If your game doesn't run on launch, the first thing I would attempt is turning off the steam in-game community settings for this game. I found that the steam community pop-up interfered with the social club pop-up which is required to activate the game. 3) For Windows 7 - 8, you may need to set the compatibility mode and the .Net framework structure (according to forums). No worries, it's easy. 4) Lastly, I made the mistake of starting a new game (I think) and all progress on my old game was immediately dumped, so be warned.",

Controls wise the game handles smoothly, the weapons have a good feel to them as well as some of the scripted sequences (yes there are some like where time slows down and you have to shoot all the enemies in the room or in one case during a boat chase)  The story so far keeps with the Max Payne feel of Film Noir style naration using some video effects and pop up text to give it a narative style instead of using the Comic Book Style from the previous games.   Music like always is amazing including the return of the theme song thats still chilling and amazing sounding.  I have yet to finish a game in the multiplayer mostly everyone is playing the new Deathmatch Made in Heaven mode and haven't been able to finish a game because people are leaving during the match  I would say its a good game if you like a more story driven action game that has great music and is not the usual military shooter.",

            "review_text": "Seriously, play this game. It is one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in gaming. The story is quite good although feeling somewhat angsty at time, albeit that is not a bad thing in a game made by Rockstar. Overall the story and presentation was mind blowing and the connection felt with max was unbelieveable. I truly think Rockstar outdid themselves on nailing the handling and shooting of MP3 making it feel as weighty and dare I say realistic as possible. Much of the plot (without spoilers) revolves Max providing security for a family of rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and his path of revenge. As expected of a Max Payne title, there are somes seriously messed up moments in this game which I won't spoil but more than a few times did my stomach grumble at the violence/horridty displayed. As for the visuals, they are outstanding to comment in the least. Lighting is spot on, character models for even the typical cannon-fodder enemy are incredibly detailed and don't even get me started on the weapon modeling. I could write a whole paragraph at how entertaining and intriguing it is to simply watch the show of firearms, well firing as shells fall smaking from chambers opening and recokcing repeatedly it's simply beautiful to watch a game truly nail gun operation visually. As a Max Payne title, you will be spending quite a bit of time shooting and it's quite a delight to know that the shooting is akin to the other aspects of the game, outstanding. Enemies use the euphoria procedural animatiion system which realistically models and renders physical impact (e.g enemy getting shot in the arm, his shoulder will flench) and the detail Rockstar put into the wounds and 'gore' is a little unsettling at how convincing it can be. There are several weapons to acquire which include the plethora you'd expect, assault rifles, submachine guns, handguns, and even a high caliber sniper rifle at one point in the game. I won't go into more detail about the gameplay and visuals as I mentioned, I could go on for days about how good it really feels and looks. Additionally, the characters and cast are SUPURB although some characters are slightly annoying, you really feel as if they are people at times and even disdain others due to their deplorable actions. That's basically all I can spout about the game without revealing too many plot details (which you will be in for some suprises!) Overall, Max Payne 3 is probably my favorite Rockstar with a close seconds being Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 2. Typically the GTA series outshines Max Payne as Rockstar's signature series, but in almost every aspect (disregarding the world size) in Max Payne 3 is more enjoyable in my opinion. If you have a spare 20 dollars, you most likely won't be dissappointed in this game at all, as I pre ordered it when it came out.   This review is my personal opinion and subject to your own interpretation :)",

I do not like most of Rockstar games because of the kind of graphics they use and the graphics in this game reminded me a lot of Grand Theft Autos graphics. Meaning its more cartoony. My biggest problem with the new graphics is that it uses a way to bright of a color scheme. Im sorry but if the storyline is dark so should the world it takes place in. Its more immersive that way. The storyline was not that bad. The multiplayer kinda sucked, there was way too many glitches and most of the games I got into were really laggy. I think If they had put a little more into the multiplayer its could have been a lot better. I will always recommend playing the first 2, this one just didn't do it for me.",

Basically it is 5 minutes of shooting or walking in straight line from door to door then cutscene and we start all over again. I have got a feeling that creators wanted to make a movie and those moments I can take control of character is pain for me and for them. Do not get me wrong that movie would be great. Story is well written and engaging. In fact it kinda feels like good David Ayer's police movie.   I do not know if I can recommend this game because as such it suck.

If however, you're opposed to cutscene heavy games it's not for you. The cutscenes are an essential part to the story and by skipping them all you will miss ALOT of the key plot points and twists.  Gameplay in Max Payne 3 is rock solid. Nice physics with incredibly fun and 'cinematic' action sequences and ofcourse the notorious bullet time will ensure a very enjoyable 10 to 12 hours of gameplay. Shooting feels great and the 'meaty' and gruesome hit detection makes for some brutal combat that will at times make you cover your mouth and go 'oooooh, that must have hurt'.  I recommend this game to all Max Payne fans. The custcenes really don't take away from the experience. They give context for the shooting segments and move the story forward. What was done with the comic book style story telling in the original Max Payne games, are now done with regular cutscenes.  Replay value is high in my honest opinion, all the collectable gun parts and clues that you might have missed on the first playthrough are more than enough of a reason to start from the beginning and finding all the pieces. I will infact play through Max Payne 3 again just to find all the gun parts and clues.  When it comes to multiplayer, well to be honest multiplayer to me has never been needed in a Max Payne game and I will treat Max Payne 3 as that. A singleplayer game.

I just played some Max Payne 2 and it reminded me that I really had to review this game. I feel as if I'm the only one in the world writing a negative review about this game but to be honest (and I'm always honest when it comes to reviews) I feel as if all the major writers have been bribed to write something positive?   Ok let's get to the point that's been the most bothering. Rockstar totally killed the franchise. I'm sorry but it's the way I see it and it's true. Max payne 1 was good, Max Payne 2 was freakin' awesome and a real piece of art. And I LOVE games when they are a piece of art. Everything that was loving and special in part 2, i.e. the voiceacting, story and sound effects.. they were all special. Even though it was sometimes an over the top noir story it felt immersive and real to me. I even still play it from time to time which is a sign of a very special game.   Max Payne 3 turned into a 3rd person Call of Duty with no real story anymore, no atmosphere and the most repetitive gameplay ever. Shoot through this linear path here, now shoot there. All the small passionate pieces of work that used to be in the last games gone and we are left with a triple A industry polished diamond. Only the diamond is a lie. They scammed you with a fake plastic. And this is what really frustrates me, cause HOW can people not see this? Have they never played the previous parts? Do they not appreciate games for what they can be and is this actually a good game for mainstream audience?  I don't know. If you appreciate works of art when it comes to games you don't buy or play this one. Especially if you loved the other parts cause Max has turned into a plain B actor from a mediocre Hollywood movie.   4/10",

The Sound is real frustrating too. During the cutscenes the dialogue is way to quiet to hear without cranking up the volume, but then once I eventually get to actually play again, the volume is 'normal' in it's loudness so I was constantly adjusting my speakers.

It completely ruins pace and momentum in order to hide poor level design.  The gameplay that's there is decent. When you don't need to take cover to survive and can use bullet-time (which has been rolled back from what it was in Max Payne 2) the combat feels fun and engaging. However, every single thing you do is interrupted by in-game or recorded cut scenes. Which are unskippable.  On top of this, the game is plagued by a VHS and after-image effect which makes no sense in the context of the story, its characters, or the presentation. There is no rhyme or reason to this effect, just a frequency which bests Max's unending monologues. What was completely endearing in the first two games has become, with Max Payne 3, a crutch which ruins the original charm and overstays its welcome. What was once a treat now feels like a punishment.  I wouldn't even recommend this game on a steep discount. Play Max Payne 2, instead.",

Great fun was had shooting up large, detailed facilities, neighborhoods, old buildings, etc. The story, however, started alright, went okay for a while, then fizzled into a depression mash of regular thoughtless shootouts and and endless, annoying stream of Max's self-depreciating mutterances. (Mutterances is now a word!) I expected a lull into negativity in the middle, like any story goes, but it never really came out of it. Music was irritating after a while, always repeating Max's theme. It was very nice, but got tired after so many loops.   Although the story is supposed to be about bad guys good at being bad guys, Max managed to outgun Rambo and Chuck Norris, and he sure lucked out that every police/swat force he slaughtered his way through managed to be horribly inept at defeating one guy.       What kind of 'family man' shoots their way out of a police station without concern that these cops have a family back home? Really?)    The ending was an ending, but I was more glad to get back to my life and not have to deal with Max's attitude any longer. I've never played MP 1 &amp; 2, and I'm not sure if I even want to go there now. ;(  Graphics 10/10 Audio 8/10 Story 3/10 Control (keyboard/mouse) 7/10 Overall 7/10  It's fine if you love shooters, but if you care about the story, plan to have your own anti-depressives on standby!",

The objective of this game is to make it start on your PC.   - The first level is long, but easy. You have to download 30GB and wait for the installation process.   - The second level is harder, you have to understand why you have to sign yourself to a 'Social Club'. When you realize that is mandatory, and accept the cruel reality, you start the Sign In. The problem is that whatever password you choose for your new account, the system keep telling you that you have not to use 'symbols'. It's not important that your password is number or letter only... So, what's the secret here?    You have to use at least one capital character and a number in your password!     - The third level is really tricky. After you validate the email, you have to link this 'Social Club' with something. I choose not to do it. What's the problem? The game won't start. You give it the correct email and password, and it says that the user is not found or the password is wrong. So you try with user and password, although the form is clearly asking for your email, but the result is the same, user not found or wrong password. The solution is quirky.    Yuu have to disconnect your Social Club account from your browser (i.e. log out) and log in within the game     The Final scene is about connecting your Steam Account with this Social whatever thing, that you never asked for, but you are forced to use.   PS: There is also a secret level, that is constantly present while you are gaming. It's all about asking yourself why a thief, with the '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version' of the game, had not faced all this problems, multisocials, keys-everithing, useless stuff to do?

The game - when you eventually get into it - isn't anything special either. The earlier games were sharper - movement here is laboured, reloading/choosing weapons is clumsy and your bullet-time moves often don't quite work as planned. You will get the hang-of-it but it's not a step forward imo  Every level is a sequence of set pieces with corridors inbetween for exposition - but the feeling the early games had of there being a 'solution' to each set-piece isn't so obvious here and there's no progression because you're still the same cliched and addled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Over time enemies gain the ability to survive direct headshots/multiple shotgun blasts to the face and ammo becomes scarce because - well - let's assume they tried to make an action film in which you drive the 'shooty bits' but a game which also gets harder and those things don't mesh.  Watching an action movie, you don't want the hero to fail - you don't want them to stumble into stuff - you don't want bullet-sponge enemies who don't drop - you don't want the hero leaping gracefully into a wall/sign/fence, you don't want the hero shot to death over and over as they figure out what the developer intended (repeating the story in case you forgot it from 20 seconds earlier)  Progress here has not been useful.  tl;dr - Play the earlier ones first and then play them again",

MP3 retains a lot of this basic gameplay, but wrecks the damage model. You get dropped far too easy. The soccer stadium level is the worst mission in the game. The steep ramp-up in difficulty happens relatively early too; what the hell?  But it gets better as it goes. In terms of feel, this is no Max Payne game. The setting and writing are more GTA than Remedy, no doubt. But the graphics, music and gunplay makes this edge it out for an overall positive rating.  Barely a thumbs up here; a 3/5 if I ever saw one. But the good things here outweigh the bad. And even if it only outweighs it 55/45, it still outweighs it, so this game is recommended.",

As like other Rockstar games, the social club is nothing but a nuisance but is 100% worth the hassle. I would prefer if Rockstar used REAL gun names though other than like, P92. I hope in the future, that Rockstar will use a more GTA/Saint's Row approach for Max Payne; meaning, open world, with shops, cars, holicopters, planes, jets, homes... I mean, it's Max freaking Payne we're talking about, not just some schmuck like Hitman.  Bullet time is still his Trademark but this time, it's a lot more immersed into the game, along with the new 'last man standing' that may often save your butt. The fake realism in Max Payne is the best!! Hanging off of a heli... come on, that's totally bad a$$!! Don't over do it like SR but don't under do it like GTA... Max is of course a bit more extreme character than any other icon in video gaming.  You cannot be upset after playing Max Payne, it's just that fun of a game.

You only watch movie few minutes, run and shoot enemies, movie, enemies... boring. - World. It's linear. You go though one door and can't came back because of it had become blocked. Levels are simple, you can move only in one direction. - Competition. I played on last difficult level. It wasn't hard at all. Last boss took some time to pass. But that's all. - Bugs. Weapons disappear from time to time, enemies can shoot you when you and they can't see each other. - Graphics. Nothing special. - Replayability. There's no replayability. You can play a multiplayer match or look levels for gold parts of guns, nothing more.  If you're Rambo or Chuck Norris or Terminator fan you'll probably like it as it's thriller and main action is shooting targets. Otherwise, I recommend you to save your money and time.",

Some plot-twists, mystery and lots of Hollywood-style action sequences and stunts. It's obviously a sequel to the previous Max Payne games but I'd say you don't need to play the older games in order to enjoy this one.  Gameplay wise, Rockstar's engine is what makes everything look and feel amazing. Great graphics that are well optimized to run on older machines, amazing gameplay with some of the best gunplay I've ever seen and an awesome use of the physics engine when you're diving around in slow motion. The Story Mode lasts for a while and after you're done with that there are some extra time trial modes. You can also replay story levels to find all the golden weapon parts and make all the golden weapons.  The game also has a multiplayer mode that isn't amazing but it's ok for a couple hours of online fun. It uses a CoD-style progression system: as you level up you unlock more guns, loadout slots and perks. You also get to customize your character with a nice amount of clothes and other accessories.  Now, the cons are: Story Mode is VERY linear, it has a LOT of long cutscenes and you will feel angry at some point after the game constantly interrupts the action to show cutscenes that sometimes didn't need to be there. The game is still quite long for a modern shooter and when you do get to shoot some stuff, it feels great so maybe you will be able to forgive that linearity.  If you like these Hollywood-style action games with a movie-like plot and great Rockstar gameplay and graphics, get Max Payne 3!  Score: 5/5  Simolius - December 2013",

Many detractors of the game tout the 'endless' unskippable cutscenes. The cutscenes are there for a reason: to tell a story. And they blend seamlessly with the interspersed gunplay so you're not drawn out of the game, and instead, you are taken on a wild ride of constant gunfights, gripping story, and awesome visuals. What's not to like about that?  The gameplay of shooting and dodging work very well. Max ducks into cover, and the added mechanic of having your character go into a sudden death mode when you run out of health, if you have one or more pill bottles in reserve, means you get a second chance if you 'die'. And the slow motion bullet cams and death cams when you take down the last of a group of enemies is just cool as hell. The music is good, the environment (Brazil) is well-done, and the settings are well-thought-out and levels are very detailed.  AAA game all around!!",

Set some years after the events of the first two games, Max Payne 3 throws an alcoholic Max into the mix of troubles in Brazil. Max shoots his way through bad guys as he does his job of being a body guard only to find his efforts failing.  I enjoyed that unlike many other FPS games, there are long sequences of cut scense to deliver the story in good portioned chunks. If you reduced the amount of bodies Max leaves behind him by 75% this could make a decent movie as the plot has at least a couple twists that are worth wait.

The graphics are very good even on low settings, but the game is optimized well enough to run smoothly on a year-old low/mid range laptop. Fans of the previous games made by Remedy may be disappointed, as 3 has some major stylistic differences. The graphic novel storytelling has been replaced by cinematic cutscenes which, while competently made, have a visual style that I personally found irritating, and the game is very cutscene-heavy. The film noir aesthetic is almost completely gone and the style is more reminiscent of something like Die Hard 4. The story is also heavier and more serious than the previous games and doesn't have any of the weird/quirky humor.  The gameplay is generally fine, though again, fans of the previous games might dislike the more modern design choices such as heavily cover-based shooting and limited amount of weapons you can carry. If you want to play this like the old Max Payne games, I recommend playing on Easy, as the game is quite challenging and the Medium difficulty already had some tough firefights that might become frustrating for the average player (they did for me, at least).   As you can probably tell, I came into this game as a fan of the series, and overall I was slightly disappointed with some of the stylistic choices Rockstar made, most notably the heavy reliance on cinematics. Still, Max Payne 3 is by no means a bad game, and it's easily worth the price, especially when it goes on sale (which it does frequently). I'd give it a 7/10, probably an 8/10 without fan bias.",

The main campaign was lengthy and satisfying enough without being overly frustrating (although it came close in a few places) and the variety of extra playmodes looks great, but I haven't checked out any Multiplayer modes because I suspect I am overwhelmingly late to the party on this one for the amount of attention I can give it.  I really don't understand why it's 30gb, though.",

It's got some really nice environments and due to playable flashbacks in the plot, it doesnt all take place in exotic locales-- theres a decent amount of gritty NYC areas (which are my personal favorite), too that help tie it in with the rest of the series.  The shooting mechanics, even though they are obviously similar to 1 &amp; 2, are more centered around head shots and using bullet time as a way to get precision, so it has a totally different feel.",

            "review_text": "Bought this game during the midweek madness sale for 7 bucks with all DLC. Gotta say, definitely worth the $.  The singleplayer campaign is about 8-10 hours long depending on if you take the time to go through and find the golden weapons parts. It's also one hell of a ride, with a plot twist that does a good job of hiding itself, but afterwards feels almost obvious. If it were any other game, this might've been a downside, but you get played as the depressed american ex-cop being dragged along for the ride without really knowing why or by whom to the point where it works. Max is also probably one of the most depressing characters I've ever seen, to the point where you half expect him to put a bullet in his skull at the end. (Spoiler Alert: He doesn't.) Again, this would be seen as a downside, but since this is pretty much the basis of the entire game and they pull it off so well, it works. The constant monologuing can become a little much, though it has its moments of charm when you pick up a random pill bottle or secret. All in all, I'd give the singleplayer an 8.5/10.   For a PC port, the controls were actually really solid. I usually play third person games with the 360 controller, but the kb/m controls worked well enough for me to stick with them. I could definitely tell that the game was made with a controller in mind. At the same time though, I didn't feel I was at any disadvantage for not using one. The gunplay is smooth and it's not hard to pick your targets. Bullet time is done well. You have a bar next to your ammo counter that refills as you move and take out enemies. A full bar will give you about 10-15 seconds of bullet time, which is plenty of time to pick off 4-5 guys in a room. If you take too much damage and have pills on you, you enter a bullet time sequence where if you take out the last guy to shoot you, you get a revive. This works most of the time, but often I would find myself holding my gun at an angle that I couldn't shoot the guy until the weapon was eventually at the magic angle to shoot him. Often, this would lead to me dying since I would run out of time to shoot him. I don't know if this is a bug or just an oversight but it happens enough for it to become fairly annoying. Overall though, I would have to give the gameplay an 8/10. The gunplay is great, the controls are tight for a PC port, and the bullet time is fun, but the bullet time revive is fairly glitchy and can lead to some annoyingly slow deaths.  Unfortunately, multiplayer seems to be pretty much dead. I played a few games, all of them being 1 on 1. It's a shame,too. The multiplayer isn't all that bad. The gameplay is fast paced and they even found a way to incorporate bullet time into it. I half expected it to be dead though. This isn't the game you spend months playing, but rather the game you pick up and play through on a weekend and then bury in your catalog for about 6 months. I'd give the Multiplayer a score, but I don't feel I've been able to experience enough of it to give it one.",

Max's world is dark, painful and corrupted, but he doesn't get 'in and out' of it, like Agent 47 does for example, but tries to fix things, even if he knows that he's just a little man in a vast universe which will likely start back again after he'll have left. And while fixing world's sh*t, his tools'll be tons of guns and bullets, which are the core parts of the gameplay about which I have nothing to say, 'cause is a good TPS with the enjoyable bullet-time feature and a good multiplayer mode. The 'american noire' atmosphere of this game, apart from the common gameplay, is IMHO what makes it beautiful.",

When you die you shouldnt press 'enter' to retry fast as this can lock the game up forcing you to go to task manager to close it.   The game.. Story- Preachy, as in 'very' Max Payne a guy who kills hundreds of people telling you 'Look at this rich scum lording over the trash below having fun and rubbing your nose in their antics and lifestyle' Oh and he does this while hes drinking so much he passes out and popping so many pain killers that the game should just be a quicktime event of Max eating a bottle of pills while chugging fifth of Kong wiskey and passing out then aspirating in vomit. Or lying in a hostpital bed dying from a failed liver. But to make his behavior ok, the writers throw in some organ harvesting involving hundreds of ex-cops, ex-military, and gang members that he points out are idiots yet not one of them thinks of informing the press of this horrible plot to steal thousands of poor peoples organs? Talk about the low opinion of the writers of this drivel for the common man. The only thing that could cause a person to keep quiet and go along with that would be absolute horror and fear, the cops and soldiers didnt seem opressed they seemed happy with their role. Just my opinion of course, because Im aware that in the past plots of this nature have existed.  So, if you enjoy visual novels that preach to you constantly at you while you pop pills and pass out drunk because of your inability to overcome past mistakes and inability to protect your loved ones from bad people you enraged because you believe youre Charles Bronson then its perfect.

They do throw in the occasional chase scenes and Max's dramatic bullet time entrances, but the ratio is far heavier on the arcade style.  Max Payne 3 is heavily story driven just like the first two games. I personally don't like the execution of this game, but I also admire the development team for trying something new.   Overall.

Often enemies will insta-kill you. And it doesnt help that you take damage when ever you do a long dive. LIke is that really fair? it almost seems like they are penalizing you for doing bold and crazy things  -despite max payne being a great protagonist. ... The rest of the characters in the story are pretty bland. They are all very one sides, and you never really care about any of them. And many of the main antagonists are rarely on camera, and dont reall give you enough time to really hate them. Like the final enemy, who you literally find out is your enemy like a chapter before-hand. There are just too many plot twists to make the narrative cohesive, and too little time with the characters besides max to make them interesting   -Movement can be very sluggish and awkward. Especially when your trying to get max to turn around. also when your trying to dive backwards max takes a little too damn long to do it.   The MP did not seem too interesting so i did not try it and can't write on that. But still, without a doubt worth a buy, even if its full price  9.4/10",

If the story were at all compelling or well executed I might be more interested but the full summary is that the main character's life sucks all over South America.   The abundance of cutscenes doesn't help. It seems like combat is always being interrupted for a pointless mini self loathing monolouge. The mechanics aren't particularly exciting either. The slo-mo shots and death saving mechanic can be cool at times but become trivial by the end. Most of the gameplay is like that of many other third person shooters. The game does have a few moments that made me truly feel like a badass, getting 6 headshots in a row while sliding in slo-mo down a something feels gratifying.  For all I've heard about the series, the game really doesn't live up, and I would not reccomend it. If the final quarter of the game offers something new and exciting I'll revise this review, but I'm not expexting anything I haven't already seen.",

In this mode, you need to complete each mission within one minute, freezing the time by collecting the checkpoints.  Now, for the multiplayer, Max Payne 3 had an ambitious gameplay for the mode. By 2012, Rockstar Games made an tremendous marketing on the multiplayer, showing their plans for the game. Now, IN 2012, the game HAD an competitive and addicted multiplayer. Today, this is no more. The multiplayer mode is abandoned by Rockstar, and is very difficult for you to find a server to play. The last DLC launched for it was in 2013 and since then, none great actualization was released.  Thus, Max Payne 3's singleplayer mode would be the great reason for you to buy the game. For the multiplayer, would be the last reason.  Max Payne was frozen in time by Rockstar Games, and we'll not be seing him for a good amount of time.",

The plot is still dark and serious, though, and Max comes across some pretty emotionally disturbing ♥♥♥♥ over the course of the game.  If you're in it for the gameplay, this game is one fantastic third person shooter. The addition of a cover system to the Max Payne series might seem like a turn-off at first, but it works very nicely since it's mainly there just as a way to give you a few precious seconds to plan your next move; if you try to sit and camp like it's any other traditional cover shooter, the AI will severely punish you by either strategically flanking you or flushing you out with explosives. Some cover is destructable anyway, which pushes the player to always be on the move. The bullet-time/shootdodge mechanics are still all there and they feel as good as ever, and you'll probably end up relying on them more than the cover system anyway. The soundtrack compliments the feel of the game perfectly, the sound design is top-notch, and the level design is great too; it's pretty linear, but that's just the kind of game Max Payne's always been. And the set peices for intense firefights are layed out pretty much perfectly.  The only negative things that I can think of are the fact that multiplayer is pretty dead, and the story's departure from the tone of the original games. However, both of those things didn't matter too much to me, and gameplay-wise Max Payne is phenomenal. Pick it up if you're looking for a fresh old-school shooter.",

Sometimes you aim something while covering yourself behind a wall and your shot hits the wall (but your aim was at the enemy's head). This happens a LOT in this game. Not a big deal? Try that with a grenade launcher and you're dead.  I'm a brazilian and i really liked their adaptation (history takes place in Brazil). Max narration still good as hell, the graphics are cool, the history as well, everything's cool. But I can't stand playing broken games anymore. Even if you play on medium, you need to tap your TAB (to eat pills) like a machine. At the middle till the end game you will find some armored enemies that... damn man. If you miss the head, they won't fall. And max all craved in bullets over all his body eating freaking painkilllers for healing. Could be more realistic or... I don't know.

Diving through a plate glass window with two pistols raised firing at criminals all in slow motion is just another day at the office for Max Payne, and soon enough you'll start to feel comfortable in his shoes. The game controls well, feels good, looks fantastic. And all of this is wrapped up in the noir themes and Max's constant brooding, satirical internal monlogue.   My main gripe is that the 'Old School' difficulty setting is only available after completing the game on the Hard difficulty. Not a big deal, but as a veteran of the first two games the other settings just didn't feel right. Without old school max is more of a bullet sponge, the medkits of the game are far more effective and the game gives you several second chances if you die. That's not the Max Payne I grew up with. Luckily the Old School option makes Max just as vulnerable as he was before. And if you die, you're going back to the last checkpoint.   In conclusion, if you like shooty action games you should give this a shot. A real AAA experience that doesn't suck ♥♥♥.  Edit: Can't believe I forgot to mention the superb soundtrack.

The things i loved about the game were of course the iconic bullet-time feature that allows Max to leap through the air in slow motion and kill enemies at the same time. Which never gets old. Also I loved the difficulty of the game. The game is suprisingly really hard. You could be killed with one bullet depending on where you get hit. The script was another thing that I loved, there are so many awesome phrases and one-liners in this game.  The things I disliked was the story, I felt it was a pretty generic action movie storyline. Also the game doesn't have much replay value. The only thing that would make you replay the levels was to find all the golden weapon parts to get golden guns.  Overall it's a very fun and action packed game, I recommend giving it a try, especially with the Rockstar sale going on at the time. Give it a try.",

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's hard to give it an unconditional recommendation. It has a decent story (for a game), impressive visuals, and good cover-based gunfighting gameplay with the familiar bullet time mechanic. Some of the set piece battles are quite impressive and most of the gunfights are engaging. There are a couple of bad vehicle combat scenes which I just hate in general but they are few and far between. My biggest pet peeve though are the constant in-engine cutscenes that are constant throughout. I appreciate the attempt to inject story but it really distracts from the gameplay. Also, the constant post-effect-color-blur-flare thing gets annoying very quickly. I think it's supposed to show you how hung over Max always is but maybe actually giving the player a headache was the wrong way to go about it. Anyway in summary it's a relatively short but well put together action game with a few flaws but if you're a fan of the first 2 it's probably worth playing if you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "Is it a good game? Yes. Is it a good Max Payne game? Sorta.  Sam Lake, who wrote the first two games, as far as I know did not work on this one. Rockstar worked hard at making the game's story sound and feel like the previous two, but there's no denying the typical Rockstar edges showing from behind the Max Payne screen. You'll occasionally get a very slight Grand Theft Auto vibe.   Let's face it, the narrative style of the first two games was heavy-handed, to say the least. It was written like a hard-boiled crime novel with a bit of supercop and a hefty dash of antihero, but as appropriately gritty and dark as the atmosphere was, it was obvious that every line in the story had been hard-pressed between two Thesauruses. Rockstar tried to emulate this style, knew its fans would expect it, and while it's considerably less archaic, it swings wayyyy too far in the opposite direction. The writing is sometimes forced, usually hit or miss, and the exposition is frequently unnecessary and downright boring. Rockstar's writing is about 'dark but funny', and it just doesn't quite fit. About halfway through the game, if not earlier, you'll simply be bored of Max's self pity.   I don't suppose I've ever thought about what would have happened to Max after the last story. His life destroyed, his revenge sated at the expense of the biggest fictional company Sam could muster and most of New York City's mafia. I suppose having him become a raging alcoholic and painkiller addict was only natural, but I didn't expect him to take on a job protecting a few rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Brazil. The whole story seemed, I don't know, beneath him somehow. As though John McClane from the Diehard series went to the beach. Many times I asked 'Oh Max, what are you DOING in this place?'   The graphics are amazing. Point-blank amazing. As an added bonus, I think this game has the most realistic rag-doll physics I've ever seen. If you jump into a sideways dodge and there's a wall there - you smack against the wall and drop, not just slide off of it. Enemies respond to where they're shot, there are nice impact physics, cover is highly destructible, and the bulletcam closeups can be gruesome. My only complaint is MASSIVE overuse of some bizarre double-vision/highlighting/hue tint effect. I think it's supposed to represent Max's withdrawal (or possibly overindulgence on those painkillers), but it's excrutiatingly annoying and not a single cutscene goes by that doesn't bombard you with it.   It's a good thing the game is sheer joy for third-person shooter fans, because it's a corridor shooter. Sometimes enemies will corral themselves through a doorway for you while you pick them off. This wasn't overly common, and was the only time I felt enemies were stupid. The AI is pretty good, they'll work together to bring you down, change spots, and so forth. Moving with your gun drawn is a plus, though if you have any sense of tactical movement, you'll find yourself sometimes skipping the cover and simply picking enemies off with line of sight. Although you can pick off enemies with headshots, should they have body armor it can take a ridiculous amount of ammo to bring them down on just the medium setting. The problem is you can shoot AROUND the armor, but it doesn't seem to make a difference in damage calculations, which means it can take half a dozen rounds in the upper body even though you hit all flesh. Late game you feel as though you're gunning down intractable zombies rather than people.   I hope you didn't get overly attached to the old school style of hoarding guns in the previous two games, because you'll be dealing with Rockstar's selection wheel. You can only carry two single-handed guns (with a third slot to wield them together), and a single slot for the larger guns. The problem here is that in EVERY cutscene, Max switches back to a single handed weapon, which means when you get back to the action (and probably have people to shoot), you have to hit 4 to re-select your bigger gun. This is intrusive, takes a second, and although the game is pretty good about starting you out behind cover, was something easily fixable. In spite of these limitations, you'd have to be pretty bad to run out of ammo. The game is also fond of randomly taking all your ♥♥♥♥ away during cutscenes, even if there was no particular reason why you should have lost the extra weapons.   WHEN you go down in combat, you're given the opportunity to shoot your attacker in bullet-time, which will auto-consume one painkiller and leave you on the ground. While this conceivably prevents many game overs, Max is pretty clunky in that he has to get up all the way and THEN re-assume cover, eating bullets in the process. Painkillers are more common, and should you die, you won't lose them at the checkpoint. You do, however, lose all your bullet-time in a 'last man standing' bit, however unlike the previous games, bullet time doesn't necessarily require kills to regenerate.   One minor complaint I have is grenades. You don't get any. Ever. Your enemies sometimes do, but while this mechanic was hardly ever abused, it was certainly noticeable.   The checkpoint system is better this time around. It's not perfect, and there are some longer stretches that will have you uttering whole streams of curse words when you die.   The whole game is very cinematic, which is good because it's short. All-told, the campaign is roughly 9 hours long. I definitely recommend it for third-person shooter fans.",

Well, I say kinda because the story kinda shows how bad Max Payne 3 is at his own job, even if he completely invested in doing the job right. Also the game can be hard as hell with AI able to take you down in seconds if you don't be careful. Multiplayer can be fun but because of other games and the fact that this game was only released in 2012, I don't know if the mulitplayer is still active by the time you read this. If you want to get the game, I strongly suggest getting the game by itself first before getting the dlcs as the dlcs are mostly for Multiplayer only content. Also make sure you got a big hard drive, this beast with all the dlc can consume at least 38 to 39 gb on your hard drive.",

It's also quite challenging in spots. If you are a fan of the first two games, you should know a lot has changed. The noire aspect has been toned downed and there are no comic book style cutscenes. On a technical level it is fantastic; the bullet damage on enemies alone is shocking.   It’s all high production level material; it just isn’t necessarily Max Payne. Tonally, it is a little too self-absorbed. As much as I admire tragic/fallen characters in fiction, the amount of self-deprecation that goes on in Max’s monologue is overwhelming. Also, be prepared for Metal Gear Solid level cutscenes in terms of length. There are a lot of them.   Rockstar knows how to tell stories really well and Max Payne 3 is a shining example. If you can get past the lack of charm the first two games possessed and the absence of their self-referential humor, the story here is, for the most part, engaging. I wouldn't put it anywhere near the level of the first two games, but as a gritty, standalone story it works. Max Payne remains a compelling character.   It's a gem to look at and the bullet damage on enemies is downright brutal. Worth noting: the game is ultra violent.",

Which makes the game an ordeal to play. I actually avoided using the cover system as much as I can. I merely just peeked out of cover - 'old school' style. It worked better than using the damn cover system.   As for the multiplayer. It sucks. Hate it. It seems like dual weilding guns are the best way to kill in this game. The rifles are practicly ♥♥♥♥ in comparison. It is quite easy to get headshots in this game, and everyone is getting them left and right. You get a headshot, so does the next guy. I was constantly in a live-die cituation. I get a kill, and I get shot by the guy behind me. It's probably because the spawn points seem to be on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of the scale. They should have spent more time on the single player instead of this ♥♥♥♥ MP. They could have made a master piece out of this game.   The story is meh, and sort of boring.   The graphics are ok.   Overall, I give this game a 6.5 out of 10. It's so annoying to play. After a long week of work, I want a relaxing game to play. To take my mind off things, to let off some steam.

Attempting to skip them will prompt you with a 'still loading' message at the bottom right; but I am highly suspicious of the message when, while running the game from an SSD, that cutscenes become skippable when they transition from the previous area's closeout to the new area's setup, and never sooner. It seems like the game is torn torn between never showing you a loading screen, but also trying to let you skip its cutscenes, in that it can't let you skip the initial portion as its still using those assets to play the in game cutscenes, and can only do so once it swaps scenes. In the end what you get is a game that will happily force you to watch atleast half of the cutscenes in full again, should you decide to play through the game another time.  Gun play is average, much like all third person shooters they pay too much attention to keeping the weight of your character and their gun's position. While thats great and all for realism's sake, the crosshair on the screen is completely fixed and can give you mis information of where Max is actually pointing his gun. I'd prefer less realism in turn for more responsiveness, as some of the actions feel so shackled by the animations. Tapping A and D rapidly will make Max's animations clip, and he'll shuffle, its quite amusing the first time you do it.  Mechanics wise, the stickiness of the cover in the game just makes that part of it just boring and bad. Enemies will hide behind cover for ages if you do the same, and just play out a slow whack-a-mole shooting gallery. Because of that, I would just avoid using cover whenever I could, save for the parts where the game has gimmicks like a sniper who can rapid fire their weapon at you.  Virtually every cutscene you pop into from one gallery to the next will most likely force Max to pull out his pistol, regardless of how much ammo you have left in it. In others, also regardless of the ammo of the pistol(s), you may also find your rifle discarded. Nothing like waiting for that long cover zoom in, just to aim at the first guy and realize, once again, your spent pistol is out for no reason.  I'd even forgive the game for not having borderless window as a display option if the windowed version wasn't so terrified of the top of my screen; but unfortunately, I can't even anchor it so that it covers the majority of my screen. My attempts at 'forcing' borderless window just cause it to crash, fun.",

DO NOT recommend this game at all, it's not a good Max Payne 3 game, it' is Still Buggy, I still get a lot of crashes from this game and the port is not all that good... well, it's a Rockstar game (Rockstar = Horrible PC Ports), it's no GTA4 terrible level of porting... but it's still bad.",

It's a joke, a stain on the game, sparsly populated, awkward, confusing, and it does not do the game's mechanics justice, as those mechanics are best used for mowing down enemies en-masse, not for player-to-player combat.

Gameplay-wise, MP3 is still incredibly difficult, but much more forgiving; multiple failures will restart you at a checkpoint with more painkillers and ammo. Bullet-time is still a thrill to run around in.  And probably one of the more impressive aspects of MP3 is the animation. Max twists his body around to maintain his aim, enemies fall down realistically, and Max won't magically slide down walls as he's jumping to the side; he'll smash into them. Realistically!

            "review_text": "Ok, I will begin by saying that I had massive expectations for this game. It being a Rockstar game and I being a massive Rockstar fan. Honestly, it kinda disappointed me. Let me tell you why. It's a fairly bad console port. Out of all the things that impressed me positively or negatively, that's the biggest one. It reeks of console-specific 'features', that, of course, are useless and annoying on PC, and every self-respecting PC gamer should be able to identify and condemn these specific 'features'. First of all, is the aiming. It's bad. It doesn't allow you to finely control the sensitivity, the sensitivity is controlled in big chunks, so it's either too fast or too slow. Even if you put both horizontal and vertical sensitivity on the SAME value, it's still different, and you can't get them to match perfectly, because, I said previously, the horizontal-vertical sensitivity difference is fairly small, and the values to which you can adjust the sensitivity are big. So it will never match. It's annoying. Then it's the movement and sprinting. Sprinting is done Gears of War style, when you press shift you basically become a tank. Super-slowly moving either left or right while you race ahead. Not the best way to do sprinting. Movement is very wonky. It's one of those cases where Rockstar tried to make the movement more reallistic than it's fun to play. And that's not fun to play. Max stutters a lot when he encounters an object, and switching quickly from moving left to right is a nightmare, it takes AGES! Not very good when you're in a tight situation. I crouch a lot behind cover, a habit from the old days, when you didn't stick like glue to walls to the press of a button. Crouching is also a nightmare, it takes 2 seconds for Max to switch stances, and that's only when the button decides to work. If you press it too quickly, the system goes crazy and Max freezes in place like a massive idiot, becoming a glorified bullet sponge. But what are you going to do, it's easier for console scrubs to press a button and become glued to the wall, than to actually manage moving while crouched... Between all of these control and aiming issues, the game became quite challenging even on Easy... I'm used to more responsive games, coming from a background of mainly Counter-Strike, where the aiming and movement is supposed to work perfectly, like clockwork. And more and more modern games suffer from this issues, because they don't spend enough time to polish the PC port, so that it becomes decent. Like I said, I was a little disappointed by this game, I didn't expect to have so many issues with a Rockstar game. The story is a good Max Payne-like story, I enjoyed it until the end, and it's really worth playing. The multiplayer on the other hand is very disappointing. Especially now, 3 years down the line. Again, this being a Rockstar game, and quite a good one as well, I expected more people to play it. But it's a wasteland down there. The only mode still being played, although you have to wait a few good minutes to get any players at all, is Team Deathmatch, the most popular gamemode in all of online gaming... The others are barren as a desert. No one playing them. I had to get a friend to buy the game, just to try the coop horde mode it had, since no one was connecting to my lobby. And when you finally do get matched with someone, it will mostly be with very high level players, which all of them have better guns, better perks, better everything, so you don't stand a chance. Again, probably because of the very low player count, it had to match me, a level TWO (2) against a team of level FIFTY (50) or close to that, otherwise none of us would be playing any multiplayer any time soon. All in all, I would recommend the game for singleplayer, it's a good story, about 8 hours long, the rest I spent in multiplayer, and if you're not a very picky gamer, like I am, you could get easily used to the control issues the game has, but don't have any expectations from the multiplayer aspect of the game. I bought it at a sale, I recommend you wait for one as well.",

Storyline seems very interesting so far (currently doing the mission, where i have to rescue my bosses daughter while chasing enemies with the boat).   Bottom line is i really enjoy playing this game and recommend it to people who like to shoot at people:D Defenetly seems one of the best games.",

I have a brand new Lenovo Ideapad with Windows 8.1, Nvidia Geoforce, Intel core i7, and 8g ram, so its not like my laptop is outdated. So when the game started, it automatically opened up in fullscreen (which it should) but it was opened in 800x600 resolution, which looked awful and was barely usable on my 1920x1080 res screen. Then I had to signup for a rockstar account (i dont care about signing up for stuff, but it didnt load my account creation for 10ish minutes because I could barely read anything on screen.) After the aggrivation of the signup, I started playing the game. It ran well at a solid 60 frames, but it had a serious pausing problem. Every minute or two, it would pause randomly, which was the icing on the cake. I was done trying to put effort into the game at this point, but it looked promising enough to at least try and find a solution. So I went to steam to find a solution. No one has a very good solution that works across the board, so I decided to google it. I got a lot of forum results, and a lot of them recommended shutting off background apps. So I did (but any decent game doesnt require this crap, but whatever) and it didn't work. So until this game gets a solid update that fixes the bs, I will not be playing or recommending this game. I thought rockstar could handle their sh** but apparently not. This bug has been around since the game released and hasn't been resolved. Sad, Rockstar. Sad..",

But I'm glad I decided to try it because there is, as always with Max Payne, a story and an explanation why he's moved south and is sporting a new look. The action is amped up, the soundtrack is perfect, the gore is ample (especially during sporadic kill-cams), and the story is classic Max - mysterious power players with ulterior motives responsible for some pretty heinous stuff.

It's even challenging at times.  It really is worth playing on easy for many reasons. I started on hard difficulty like I almost always do with every game, and it was too frustrating to play. I stopped playing because it was too tedious and annoying. It might be a good technical chanllenge, but the FUN is taken out of the game.  The game is still about plenty long enough and interesting.

It's Graphically beautiful and the Physics are amazing. Flying through the air in Bullet time whilst simultaniously mowing down your enemies is one of the most satisfying mechanics i've Witnessed in a game. The multiplayer left a little to be desired however and felt a bit unbalanced to me. It was a pretty long game for nowadays standards and was certainly very challenging even on the mid level of difficulty. If you enjoy great story telling and shooters, you've got a very solid game here. I'd rate it overall 9/10.

Max Payne 3 (Nightmare DRM edition).  Once I got past that. Changing graphics settings caused the picture to slide off screen to the upper left hand corner of my monitor. Oddly, after it did that my login screen on my OS became compressed into that corner as well. No idea how that's even possible, but glad to know a game can mess up my OS like that.  Finally get the game running and the key mapping isn't set up for an xbox 360 controller, nor will it let me configure a keyboard and mouse control.

Two things stand out: the mechanics are improved massively over the first two games, although Max as a drunk, bitter cynic in 3 feels exaggerated.  Complaints about the cutscenes are unfair. Though frequent, they tell a narrative and lead into the action seamlessly. The style of intermittent pieces of dialogue on the screen is great, as are the dizzying distortion effects when Max is drunk, injured etc. The voice acting is also spot on, James McCaffrey's gruff, harsh voice over the sound of gunfire is always really rewarding. Rockstar are usually useless at PC ports, GTA IV was abysmal, but MP3 runs perfectly. The settings are beautifully put together.  If you have the time to engage with it, do. To me Max Payne is about storytelling, not storming through levels.",

A developer not afraid to discard the elements that weren't working, and really explore and develop what made the original games special in their time.   You no longer yawn through cliched 50's style monologues, but instead actually listen to what Max says because it's gritty, funny and relevant to the story, which is simple yet ever twisting.  The thing that's great now about Max as a character is that he's a bas-♥♥♥ but not the brightest guy, and as such he's not perfect and you can relate to him more as a result.

Lastly the shooting system is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing i luv the shooting in this its so good that its one of the reason i bought this game agian. (I RECOMMOND BUYING THIS WHEN ITS ON SALE)",

            "review_text": "Right. Max Payne 3. The end of a trilogy (perhaps?).  Well, I was incredibly satisfied with this game. Sure it deviated a bit from the standard Max Payne esque game, but it was all explained in an impressive manner, and Max - as always - was a blast. Anyone who says this is a duck and cover shooter is playing the game wrong. Yes, you can take cover, but you're not supposed to want to. Instead, you're supposed to want to dive through the air, blasting guys in the head with your double pistols or SMGs. It rewards you for doing this, it makes you feel amazing.  The fights can get difficult, but the majority of the game is what you'd expect from a Max Payne game. Save for one QTE fight, I found the game incredibly satisfying. 10/10.",

            "review_text": "Oh man this game.... this gem, the Max Payne series were the first games that I've played on PC ever. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is for me, the epitome of a great noir-crime game.  When I heard that there was a Max Payne 3, which was completely unbeknownst to me, I IMMEDIATELY bought it. And did it deliver...?  Yes, it did. Max Payne 3 looks very different from its predecessors. The rundown, bleached buildings and shadowy sidewalks of New York have been replaced by the hedonistic nightclubs and baking heat of São Paulo, where Max has taken a job working private security for wealthy businessman Rodrigo Branco. Unsurprisingly, things don’t work out for Max: Rodrigo’s trophy wife, Fabiana, is kidnapped on Max’s watch, which sets in motion a chain of events that draws Max into a much larger, more sinister story that just left me in shambles.  Story: 10/10 It touches on the disparity between rich and poor, and how resentment and desperation can fester in the slums and the penthouses alike. This isn’t only tackled in the main story, but also in nice scraps of incidental narrative recovered in clues dotted about the meticulously-crafted environments. The single-player story lasts around 10-12 hours.   Graphics 8.5/10: Not the best looking game around but environments are impressively detailed and performances sensitively captured.  Cinematics: 8/10  The action set-pieces seem a little muted, especially when compared to, say, the spectacular recent capers of Nathan Drake. But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  Sound: 9.5/10 Stirring and evocative soundtrack by the LA rock band ''Health''. Bound to get you pumped.  Final Verdict: 9.5/10 New gameplay elements like the cover-system are implemented very good, but the lack of innovation makes the action a bit tedious towards the end. Nonetheless Rockstar delivers a good game and even more important: it deserves the name Max Payne.  There are plenty of games which are critically acclaimed for their gameplay but lack anything in way of story or character. Max Payne 3 is a different type of proposition. The gameplay is simple yet.. satisfying, but it’s entirely in the service of a strongly-authored narrative. Players aren’t at the liberty to roam, to explore, or to shake things up. Some might find this too controlling, but in return for your freedom, you’re rewarded with a mature genre piece which is also a finely-realised character study.",

            "review_text": "I'd rather give this game a neutral review but Steam doesn't allow me. Then I thought for a while, since this is a single player game but Rockstar forces me to connect to its useless Social Club, Finally I chose to give it a thumb down. Good job, Rockstar, here is what you deserved.  OK let's talk about the game itself. First of all, I haven't played the others in the series before, and I guess I won't because the first two are just too outdated. I don't know if my opinion would change if I've played them, but the story is just ... ordinary? A story you always see in TV shows or movies, just another lonely hero action movie, like that. Nothing unique nothing special nothing worth talking there. There's a twist? so what? you see no twists in movies? Not to say it's totally predictable at about halfway.  Max is really an intresting character though. Thers's too few explanation to his background in the story, which is ... a pity to new players to this series.  Graphics is awesome considering this is released in 2012, even now it can compete with mainstream games. Though I normally don't care about graphics too much, I have to say very impressive work, Rockstar.  Gameplay is not such impressive, however. You you can only recover health by painkillers. And enemies are quite smart and precise, there's often someone trying to flank you, the guy you are aiming at tries staying in cover while others be more aggresive, These all will make the game much harder than other shooters. So they give you the Bullet Time ability, using it just lowers the difficulty to normal level, and pull the game to an average shooter, too.  Max's narrative helped a lot in the shooting parts, to make it feel less repetitive and boring. Yes I mean repetitive and boring. You are using your handgun half of the time, of course you can stick to it all along if you'd like. Picking up assult rifles from enemy? Well that doesn't make any big difference. Most guns feel quite similar: damage(you can easily headshot with Bullet Time you know), shooting speed, even the magazine size. There are maybe 2 sniper sections and a few driving sections, except that you just go from point A to B to C, and face waves of enemies each point using your FAVOURITE handguns, in a 8 hours playthrough.  Some cutscenes are the most dumb things: while you are facing sereval guys pointing their guns at you, just no one would pull a trigger, although you've already killed dozens of their men, they wait until you fight back. And this happens AGAIN AND AGAIN, almost in every chapter. I'd rather have plain gun fights from the beginning to the end, that's much better seriously, at least this way I won't feel the gap between deadly AIs in combat and dumb enemies in cutscenes.  After all, It's still not bad after one playthrough, but I don't want a second one.",
