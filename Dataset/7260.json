    "description": "A fantasy voyage through the great mythologies, Loki allows the player to take on the role of one of the four heroes of the game, each drawn from a different mythology: a mighty Norse fighter, a fierce Greek warrior, a powerful Egyptian magician or an Aztec shaman who masters the secrets of the spirit world.",

The controls are clumsy, the UI is not intuitive and the animation is amateur. Not saying a game needs to look good to be good, but it's the whole package that doesn't cut it especially when there are so many other games that are much better out there.",

Combat is a little bit lacking, but that might be because NOTHING EXPLAINS how to play. I don't generally mind games that 'make you work for it a bit', but there should be SOME kind of introduction to the game mechanics even if it's just a written guide. I played through the forest area only for the game to crash to desktop. This shall sit unplayed in my library...",
