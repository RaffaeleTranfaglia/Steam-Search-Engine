            "review_text": "It's a hidden object game. It's a fantastic game to shut down and relax to so don't come here looking for an amazing plot line or game mechanics that are revolutionary in any way. You go to a scene, find the objects, move on. And for that, it's worth 5 bucks as its a game I can repeatedly come back to and put some hours in. And I'll also admit that a few of the items on some of the levels are hard to find so it really does give you a little bit of a workout for your perception. You can view my profile, I'm not an old man I enjoy a wide variety of games, and I can honestly say I will recommend this to anyone. Just straight forward dumb fun.",
