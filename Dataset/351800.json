It has both laughs and tears and will make you want to die at some points. It is all worth it in the end because you get to help one developer live out his life long dream of publishing an indie game. Also you get a prize at the end.",

            "review_text": "*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Downloaded Dev Guy. Had a few laughs at the outside-box thinking of this game. To be absolutely honest, this wasn't as good as I expected. The game was too short and even though it had some alright jokes, there just weren't enough / most of them weren't funny for me to catch onto. It took me less than 20 minutes to complete this game (as I recall.)  At first, the gameplay was ok. Like a puzzle game, you have to go around and find items to unlock other things. You play as a disgruntled games developer who wants to upload his game, but everything goes wrong for him! (&gt;_&lt; Unlucky guy.) Who has to end up hacking everyone else's computer as a last resort to release his game!  Each computer has a minigame attached to it:  One about a stickman who gets 'lucky' in his dreams. (Seriously, it took me guts to put quotes around it. I'm not going into any more detail...)  One about a box.  One about jumping.  One about ponies.  And one about dating people ._.  However, towards the end, It contained WAY too many ponies towards the end even though the main character didn't like them. It really killed the game for me and all it tells me is that the actual developer is a Brony. (True or False, If I was one, I'd do the same in a game!)  TBH, fandom completely aside, I'd rather play a game which is 'All-Ponies' or 'No-Ponies', rather than 'We'll build up the story and then put ponies in.'  Then I Accidently pressed [Tab] and got all the commands for the game.  6/10. I recommend. Not One Finger Death Punch standard for an indie game, but not the absolute worst either. Best played only in short bursts (or if you completed the game flawlessly, so you can see what the game overs look like.)",

One on jiggly mode, one on normal mode, and one on a speedrun for an achievement run. And, honestly? I'm REALLY surprised by this game. Not only it made me laugh and giggle, but, it also was quite appeticing to watch. Yeah, I know it doesn't have the best graphics around, I know it may be kinda cheesy and goofy.. But, honestly? I LOVE this game. This is one of the FEW games I can look at, and say 'I loved it'. It has a really nice use of FX, it has some pretty nice music, the plot is dumb, but at the same time is pretty funny.. As an indie game fanatic, I REALLY suggest you to try this game. There's nothing to lose :P  It manages to connect both the anime and MLP fandom in a fun way! I'm not a fan of neither of those visual styles (Nor the animations), but, I had a great time playing through the 'dating' sim that ended on you having some... Interconnections with a firewall, and galloping as 3 ponies through the clone of 3 shields. I loved controlling stick's heartbeat (Even if it was a pain in the butt), and I actually got ADDICTED to the 'Just press Up!' game.  Daniel, if you're reading this comment, I am FULLY supporting you on each one of your future games! Heck, I'd f*cking love to compose a song for your next installment!  9.7/10  A must-play.  OH! One little easter egg. If you press T and say something.. You can use a TTS engine!  You can imput any commands from moonbase alpha, and they work just fine! Even the songs c:",

            "review_text": "Some people might be wondering why I am reviewing a free game when I could be reviewing one that costs something more than free. After all, a free game is one you can try and decide if you like it or not, and all you lose is a few minutes, compared to the money you could have spent buying a particularly tasty pack of gum. I counter this argument by saying... ...nothing, really. I just felt like reviewing this since I blindstreamed it yesterday for some friends and had a grand time with it.  Let's talk about the positives first, which highly outweigh the negatives. First of all, it's pretty funny. I got a kick out of it. Some people might counter this claim by saying that many other people have made fun of typical game genres/My Little Pony lovers/car tow-people (I'm sure there's a few out there). I counter this counter by saying it's still fairly amusing. Heck, I love visual novels/anime and I enjoy My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. That doesn't mean I protest the tongue-in-cheek representations of them. I laughed, my friends thought it was funny, that's good enough for me.  So what about those other pesky things, such as graphics, music, and, oh, I don't know, gameplay? The graphics are fairly minimalistic, but they work. I was rather endeared to the legless protagonist I controlled, Warren, and his faithful companion, Everlasting Cigarette (which my significant other suggesting he gets the same brand Snake has). Sure, he's a dirty thief, but after the garbage he goes through, I can offer some sympathy. Other than him and the minimalistic world (which really doesn't need anything beyond what it has), the graphics in the minigames vary wildly, and the ones that look like they are out of MS Paint look like that to make a point. It's a joke about how bad some games do look that are made by indie developers. The 'better' ones have nicer graphics. Props for the cute cat girl.  Music is... well, I didn't notice it much. My computer was being a piece of junk last night and lagging thanks to my capture device. The music actually cut out in the last minigame and the credits. Before that, I wouldn't call any of it special. None of it was offensive to the ears, so there you go, neutral opinion is neutral.  The gameplay is, overall, pretty good. As Warren, it goes smoothly, with only a few keys being needed to get around. The minigames are fine too. Other than the afformentioned lag, which was not the game's fault at all (I tried it off-camera and it worked without a hitch), I had no problems with the controls. It does what it needs to do, and that works for me.  There is little to mention about the plot, other than that it connects a bunch of jokes in a straightforward fashion. The minigames it leads to give achievements, and they are all reasonable to get. You can actually skip the minigames, which is a plus in my book. I mean, no, I didn't skip any, because I'm an extremely stubborn person who insists on doing everything... and to me, they were fun anyway. But to have that option certainly doesn't hurt. I particularly enjoyed the three-pony game, which evidently is based off a game I have never heard of. IOW, I need to check that game out too.  Oh, and it has interactive credits. Yay interactive credits. (I mean that sincerely, interactive credits are neato.)  So, negatives. There aren't many. The main one I have is about the last minigame. It's a long haul and there are no checkpoints. My initial thought was that you got checkpoints at every percentage met (25%, 50%, 75%). Nope, if you die, you start at the beginning. That got annoying. Since the obstacle course looks pretty much the same in each portion, I kept forgetting where certain traps were and would fall for them multiple times. Partially my fault, partially the game's for not having many significant cues to remember, and it would have overall been nice to have checkpoints, like the other minigames did.  Other than that, there's the lack of proofreading. Don't get me wrong, the game is fine in terms of understanding it. I was never left questioning what something met because of errors in grammar and the like. But there were words spelled incorrectly, and there was a constant lack of capitalizing names, periods where appropriate, and the dreaded 'your/you're' and 'lets/let's' sprinkled about. Never hurts to have a proofreader check for that sort of thing.  There is also no way to save. I do have to ding it for that, but it isn't as bad as usual. Without the lag and camera problems I had, I probably would have finished it in an hour and a half, and that's mainly because I try to find/examine everything possible. My guess is most people could finish it in an hour. It's not hard to set aside an hour to run through it in one go. The lack of frustrating areas also means you're unlikely to get annoyed and want to exit out for a bit. Still, a save feature would have been nice.  For the low price of free, this game is definitely worth it. Even if it cost something along the lines of $2-$3, I would still recommend it. It's a fun experience and a nice break from long/srsbusiness games (I played this after some Downfall, so... yeah, talk about mood whiplash). Give it a go! At best, you get to be amused. At worst, you lost ten minutes deciding you hated it and can never get said ten minutes back. A tragedy, to be sure.  Le Fin.",

Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.

Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.

We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!    Oh, this is so hard!    Heating, cooling",

The art style is cute, and even though it isn't the best, it's a free game; how could I complain? It also has a reasonable difficulty for people not familiar with all of the different genres, and I caught on quickly to the things I didn't know. It was very clearly expressed, and although there were some typos here and there (I couldn't help but detect a comma splice early in the game, sorry, just took an English test,) but it was nothing to bicker about either.  The only problem is...I never actually completed the game. I got pretty far into it, and just when I thought the conclusion was in my hands, I had to play CyberPony. Oh dear. This is where the difficulty spiked and I couldn't bear it. It's a simple enough game, but at the same time, I couldn't help but exit the game feeling dissatisfied with myself and it. Some walls were practically impossible to clear without at least clipping it which felt frustrating and out of my control. Not only that, but the controls as well. Towards the end is where I always got the game over, not only because it was difficult to perfect moving at such a speed with a cramming area, but also because the controls seem to break there, and looking into it, I'm not the only one with this same issue. The keys won't respond enough, causing the player to lose their mindset quickly and to ultimately fail from something out of their own reach. It's almost inexcusable, as I noticed no issues with controlling until that one point. It could just be a thing intended to screw us up on purpose, but that gains no credit from me, and it almost feels like a dirty trick if that's even what you meant to do. Don't even get me started on the repetitive music and gameplay here either, I don't want to waste any more of your time writing about it. I'll just leave it at I had to mute the game during that.  That one minigame, however, was your only setback as far as I'm concerned. It was a nice little adventure to set off on, and I'm sure the rest of it was just as great, if there was even that much more left after CyberPony. Perhaps one day I'll return to it and see if I can complete it next time. I have to admit, I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to retrying one game over and over, so that may just be a bum quality on me, but nonetheless, it's a pretty solid work. It was enjoyable, and the fact that I got enough kicks out of it for free is certainly enough for me to recommend it alone.

You find the thumb drive, and it has been formatted and your game has been lost. You now have to break into other people's apartments (who also turn out to be game developers) and steal their games, so you have something to release. Cool concept, eh?  Many have criticized the game for the minimalistic way it was made, but for a free game, it delivers what I expected. And maybe the minimalism is what is so compelling about Dev Guy? It's simple, but maybe that's the point.  The minigames you steal from the other devs are surprisingly pretty decent games on their own (although some more than others) and they do provide some insightful commentary on the current state of video gaming. I even enjoyed that one joke that was completely directed at people like me. Just play the game, you'll know what I mean ;). Realistically, these games were probably all just demos the developer had no place for until he came up with Dev Guy.  Dev Guy is a playful and surprisingly insightful indie game for a suiting price... what's not to like?  Score: 8/10 - Excellent",

'Dev Guy' is really a game that's trying to be a bunch of other games while trying to make a cynical statement about the video game industry- and the only decent people out there are the indie developers who steal other people's work and don't care about how they go about it.  The gameplay is very minimalist and uninspired. The different minigames you play aren't developed enough for you to want to keep playing them, ironically enough. And above all that, there's very little story to be invested with.  You just show up, lose your game info, lose your car, find your USB, steal people's games (without learning about the creators), and the game ends and tells you about EVERYONE'S epilogue.  As you can tell, this is masterful video game narrative, right here.  There very little I can say about Dev Guy. Nothing in it stood out. It looks very cheaply made. It's got a poor message underneath it's surface. And the story and characterization were wank. I'm giving 'Dev Guy' a 4/10. It's possible to find some enjoyment... but this is an otherwise very dry game.",
