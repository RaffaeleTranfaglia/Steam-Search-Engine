            "review_text": "Short game about a vampire looking for a cure to become human and live with his/her true love. Twilight City will offer several jobs and shops to customize your character and your home and several abilities to increase and spells to learn in order to complete some quests. The game's title is certainly unfortunate and the gameplay is repetitive but the character design is good and the possibility to buy pets and furniture together with the spells and quests makes this game a curious mix between a rpg, the Sims and a hidden object game.",
