            "review_text": "I suppose that to the completely uninitiated, Tales from the Borderlands plays out like an action-comedy caper film set in unfamiliar surroundings, but to those who already love the Borderlands games, it feels a bit like coming home. I really love the way Telltale designed the opening sequence, menu screens, and opening credits in the style of the Borderlands games, so from the very start this is exactly how the game feels.  The artwork from the Borderlands series is a great fit for the Telltale format, and allows the setting to blend seamlessly into the graphic novel-style artwork Telltale uses to render its stories. The music of Borderlands is pretty distinctive too, and the team did a fantastic job of incorporating that into the story as well (in the case of the episode one boss, quite literally).  The story is very fast paced, with a lot of twists and turns and flashbacks. With two protagonists — a Hyperion corporate lackey and a Pandoran thief — you also quite literally get parts of the same story playing out a little differently from two perspectives. Narratively, it reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction with the perspective jumps, as well as the rapid-fire pacing and snappy dialogue.  The action sequences are amazing (if not completely plausible) and really keep you engaged with the story. The dialogue is hilarious, and it was fun picking some of the wittier options and seeing how the scene played out. The voice acting is great too, though I did find it extremely odd at times to have conversations with some of Pandora's bandits and psychos.  If you're the impatient type, you might want to wait until all the episodes come out before buying the season, as it looks like they're going to be spaced a few months apart. I plan to update my review as the episodes are released, but so far I really love the story and the characters. I can't wait to see 'cameo' appearances by some of the other vault hunters and NPCs from the Borderlands games, and I also can't wait to see what happens with the new characters Tales From the Borderlands has introduced.",

Alas I can't say, how this game well actually graphic novella feels to a person who has never played BL plus has no knowledge of Borderlands saga. Just pretty craphics and a to me pointless QTE. I really don't like QTE, feels like Telltale had consoles in mind. But I can't give a straight raiting. Because I know so much about the whole Borderlands thing and was impressed how they Telltale fit their story into whole game universe. So I still recommend this game. For BL freak, it's a must :)",

            "review_text": "Tales from Borderlands (as of Episode 3) is an outstanding companion to the Borderlands games. Not only did the plot sit nicely as a side-story/sequel to the franchise plot, the two main protagonists - Rhys and Fiona, allowed player to explore unique perspectives from the 'evil' Hyperion corporation and as a Pandora native.   The game itself is humorous, filled with crazy moment that meld seemlessly into the crazy backdrop of Borderlands. The meeting of Rhys and Fiona for instance, which was re-told as recollections from Rhys and then Fiona perspectives, allow players to unfold the truth of the tale in a entertaining fashion, like how Pulp Fiction unfolded the the somewhat puzzling opening scene with Ringo and Yolanda, with the scene Jules (and bathroom-bound Vincent) in their 'transition' period at the end of the movie.   The confrontation scenes across all three epidsodes (thus far) were largely whimsical, befitting of protagonists. Yet, they are always filled with comedic moments or funny narratives that make these confrontation feel more like action sequence in a comedic movie. The final confrontation in episode 3 for instance featured some of the best moments - such as Fiona fending off two bounty hunters while hanging upside down and Rhys travelling at high speed on his legless loader bot, which felt like watching Charlie Chaplin or Indiana Jones in action.   Entertainment aside, Tales from the Borderlands highlighted the innate problem with Telltale games. There isn't much gameplay to speak of, other than quick-time action. Most choices and exploration are pretty close to pointless, like how your choices and exploration wouldn't matter in any linear games (e.g. Final Fantasy, Left for Dead, etc.) other than to uncover easter eggs (alternative dialogue, narratives, skins etc.). Consequently, the game felt really short and unsatisfying, making the interval between episodic release more painful than usual. It's a blessing however, knowing that I could clear all three episodes in five fun-filled hours again before episode 4. Can't wait...   For lovers of Borderlands, don't be despair with the absence of CL4P-TP. Tales is littered with other familiars like the vault hunters (Zer0, Brick, Mordecai and Athena) and NPCs (Scooter and Handsome Jack), not merely as fan-service, but were involved in pushing the story forward.   Bottomline: Tales from the Borderlands is an excellent piece of work thus far (after three episodes), that should bring out a chuckle or two.",

Telltale transforms it to a narrative driven, episodic point-and-click adventure.   I was never fan of the game series before. But Telltale converted me with their terrific writing of characters and dialogue. World of Pandora has never been this interesting and fun! The story itself, isn't that remarkable. It's told by two characters, both controlled by the player. What shines in the writing is the hilarious dialogue. Characters have great personalities and are very memorable. Some characters are new and others have been introduced earlier in the series. Besides some familiar characters, there are other nods to the games too.  This is the best looking game by Telltale so far and It's also faithul to the style of Gearbox's games. Every episode has an awesome intro sequence that sets the mood for the game, it's accompanied by a great soundtrack. None of the five episodes felt filler at all and the last episode especially holds up. You get to see how your choices mattered and the familiar quick time events bring on a twist almost like Street Fighter style.   Tales from the Borderlands is a welcomed change of pace for Telltale, their other recent games have all been so dark and gritty. This takes them back to the tone of Monkey Island and Sam and Max games. But no puzzle solving this time either.   [Score: 89]",

Pros:  -Game is funny as hell  -The choices are personalized  -You get attached to the characters.  -Borderland feeling is there for sure.  - :D zero.    Cons:  -Controls sometimes are not as responsive as I would like.  -mashing buttons never been fun and never will.  -Looking around is limit useless. Just go on with the story. But this is only for the first part I guess.  -Short. I completed this first part in nearly 1 hours. I suggest to pick this on sale as it does not worth 30$ for part of a game. Seriously.   All in all, the game is really amazing. I love borderland and this is just a perfect sequel. Maybe I would suggest to play with a remote. The mouse pointer can turn invisible sometimes making quick decisions complicated.  Can't wait to play all the chapters straight.  10/10 is hype as ♥♥♥♥!  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Update 1:  Episode 2 was cool. We learn more about the story. We feel the weight of our actions from season 1.   'Kiss the sky' is one my new favorite songs.  Lot of places to explore with little reward. Still, a lot of plot twist.  it was okay. I devoured it so I guess it was pretty good.  9/10 Story is very confusing. Interesting but confusing...   //////////////////////////////////  Update 3:  Ok now I am on the middle line.   Half of me loved some new twist to the game, the other half is very desappointed.  Pro:   -Precedents items are FINALLY useful. (Inventory is still useless to look at tho...)  -A bit more dynamic. Gives you more shooting occasions.  -A person DIE (The ones who played knows)  -Making you regret certain choices because you feel like betraying someone.  Cons (and there is more than pros....)  -That's it? Was that any kind of devloppement to the story?  -New characters? Yay. Would be nice if they had more personality.  -What are those glitches? Frame skips, texture lag, scenery which loses focus. Lot and lot of rough rendering.  -I laughed once. Thanks little robot.   -You have 3 choices, each of them leadinga t the same place. Do we still have any impact on the story?  There was a few moments where you have to do something... but doing nothing is not an option. You will simply remain there indefinetly. Waiting. Expecting a second choice.  &gt;Press the button. (But it looks suspicious...) Look around... no other options... WHY DID I HAVE THE OPTION IN THE FIRST PLACE? MAKE IT PART OF THE ANIMATED SCENE!  -I just feel like I watched a long cutscene where I had to press buttons sometimes.   -Still have the button mashing problem. Why so many button mashing occasions? It's not fun.  conclusion of chapter 3:   We can notice a few improvements. Sadly, these improvements are buried under many more little problems. I did not enjoy the time spent on this chapter as much as on the other ones. The decisions have no impact on the game. Which basically kills the idea behind this kind of game.  6/10  cute cutscene.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update 4.  I know I skipped one chapter because I felt I would have bashed it way too much. I was not happy.   As for chapter 5. I feel like I played a whole new game. so...let's go with pro and cons.  Pros:  -Neon Genesis Evangelion simulator 2015  -FINGER GUNS pew pew pew pew  -Choose a team of elites (or not)  -some good story devloppement ...I guess.   -Fuuuu ♥♥♥♥ is dead.  -epic loot.  Cons:  -Might as well make a movie. Choices are still limit useless. Not much impact beside some details that you might not care about at all. A lot of situations you are given control and yet.... you wonder what was it for? Did you really need to do that single clic?could it not be part of the video (same as chapter 3.)  -This could have been a whole different game. New characters. new gameplay. I wouldn'T have seen the difference.  -Weird loopholes. Characters desapears and appears back again later. No reason given. Moments you can swear something tragic happens and yet... nothing too bad as the character comes back pretty well. (Sasha mostly and Athena)   -It feels as if they rushed so many parts of the story. I know they had a short window to come up with the chapters (people urged for the chapters to come faster). They got what they asked for. Unfinished material. Plenty plot holes and the finale is out without much explanations.  I give chapter 4-5 together a mark of 6/10   SOOO  In conclusion.  Yes I still recommand this game. I recommand it only to borderland players. The whole game is filled with insides about borderland games. You'd miss half the jokes without some knowledge of the lore.  Idon't recommand it if you follow telltales games only. This is probably one of their worst if not the worst.It really makes me sad since it was the one I anticipated the most.  it began as something I was so hyped about. I was so happy about a sequel of borderland that felt different and yet, this anticipation has never been met.  I give the whole set a 7/10 too much water. No but seriously. This game could have been better. Pay for it in sale. Get it and play all episodes straight. Don't expect anything spectacular. Just enjoy the ride while it last.",

The storyline is good with a creative way of telling the story and interesting plot developments along the way, which is what I've come to expect from TTG.

This game has taken that title by miles. Tales from the Borderlands is both one of the most heartfelt and the funniest story to come out of Telltale, and manages to maintain the style of the main Borderlands games while having a far better story and much more realistic dialogue. The characters in this game are far more relatable than any of the previous protagonists, and you will probably care far more about them because of it, especially in the moments when Telltale pulls their signature 'everything went wrong' moments out. But through all the drama it maintains a generally lighthearted tone, with lots of laughs from both physical humour and great writing. It also has the two best action scenes in any game of this genre. I won't go into details for fear of ruining the surprises, but believe me that you'll know them when you see them.  This is a must play whether you care about the main series of Borderlands or not. If you've never played the originals, they're good games in their own right, but a wiki summary of the series will be enough for you to get a great experience out of this one.

The Graphics fit perfectly to the Borderlands Games as they are basically the same. The Episodes were pretty well made and really emotinal, there was everything in it from crying to laughing.   One of the most important things to say about the Tell Tale Games is that it is always like watching a movie but controlling the actions and making the decisions of the characters and feel their consequenzes.   It is always very difficult to make a review about these sort of games because everybody is experiencing something different due to the multiple choices you can make. But at the end of the Game, those were your choices and you will be happy with it.  It is a wonderful story with alot of nostalgia points, which will remind you on other moments you had in the borderlands games.  Even if this is not your usual kind of game I would recommend this to any fan of the borderlands series and of course to any Tell Tale Games Fan.   Also this game is an easy 100% for your perfect games collection.

            "review_text": "Tales from the Borderlands is definitly my game of the year for 2015.  Pros: .Telltales' artstyle and the borderlands artstyle work together perfectly .The characters are amazing, funny and likable .Full of 100% Borderlands humour .The story is amazing .You get to meet characters from the Borderlands Franchise .Best ending I have ever seen in a Telltale game .The music and cinematic intros are AMAZING .Your choices effect the ending in a very different way to how you might think they do .  They Actually give you the option to ship Rhys and Sasha YES!!    Cons: .Episode 4 lacked compaired to the other episodes but was still good .I would have liked to have met Lilith, since she has been in all the previous games but oh well .  When it came to picking you vault hunter team I would have liked if you could pick any vault hunter that was still alive from the previous games like Gaige, Krieg, Maya, Salvador......etc   .Small mistakes that only devoted Borderlands fans would know like some characters holding rocket launchers backwards (This didn't bother me so much)  The games is for everyone. If you dont like the Borderlands shooter then thats fine because this is still playable and if you love the borderlands franchise then you will love this game. There are some Borderlands fans that say 'This series doesn't have any impact on the actual borderlands universe, it's just a point and click spin-off'. This is not true, Tales from the Borderlands has a very big impact on the universe which becomes quite clear in episodes 4 and 5.  One other point that should be brought up is the fact that the episodes took a while to release and I think It's quite bad to see that the only reasons people have been giving this game bad reviews was because they...  1.Don't like point and click adventure games but bought this one and are now criticizing it because it IS A POINT AND CLICK ADVENTURE GAME (These people are really stupid, 2 seconds of research and you would have found that out) 2.They don't like the artstyle, which again 2 seconds of research and you would have found the artstyle from the previous games or seen the trailer for this one 3.The episodes took too long to be released, which is not the games fault it's the developers fault, so people shouldn't write bad reviews about something that is not the games fault and will become completely irrelevant once the full game is released.  Episode Ratings:  Episode 1:AMAZING Episode 2:Very good Episode 3:Very good Episode 4:good Episode 5:AMAZING  Final Verdict:  Artstyle: 97/100 - Couple of texture glitches brought it down Sound/music: 100/100 - No words for how good the music and voice acting was in this game Characters: 95/100 - Very few characters I didn't like or I felt had problems Story: 98/100 - You can't predict the masked man Engine/Optimization: 80/100 - The Telltale engine still needs alot of work  Score: 94/100",

            "review_text": "I liked Borderlands and I liked TWD. So this was kind of an obvious choice for me, I was sceptical at first though, couldn't imagine what kind of a story could be told on Pandora TellTale style. As it turned out, I really loved it. You take control of two main characters, A gal named Fiona and a guy called Rhys. Both come from completely different worlds and carry some heavy baggage with them. You'll get to make dialog and story choices for the both of them while considering their unique points of view, which is pretty cool and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I don't wanna spoil the story and there isn't really a way to explain it in a short way, let's just say it's about vault hunting (duuh), there's mind blowing plot twists and robots and you get very close to banging! Identical gameplay to other TT games - quicktime events and dialog timers. Rarely puzzles.  What I liked:  - The humor! I laughed at every other scene, it clicked very well with both my mature and immature senses of humor. And no, I didn't mind the memes, I think they fit the borderlands kind of a world pretty fine. Maybe I'm too old to find them cool and I don't give a damn. - The characters. They're interesting and likable, I enjoyed watching their stories as much as simply watching them ;) You will meet new people and some old friends. - The music, not only licenced songs, also the ambience music really brought my goose bumps up. Opening intros were something I looked forward to much like with the original Borderlands games. - The story is pretty amazing and nicely paced. Not once I found myself bored of nothing happening or confused from too much action. - The illusion of choice, still works pretty well in my opinion. I understand why the choices cannot have real impact because that would mean creating 20+ games for the price of one. There are exceptions though, see in the did not like section.  What I did not like: - Save system, sometimes I made a rash dialog decision or forgot to collect items and wanted to reload, not without replaying the last 10 minutes though. - Some dialog responses made no sense, especially characters' reactions to my being silent. As I sometimes honor the old saying 'talking is silver, silence is golden', I chose to remain silent, especially with the fallen antagonist. To my surprise, nobody really minds and Rhys/Fiona kind of continue their animations and face expressions just with closed mouths. Maybe it's just me but I'd be super weirded out if somebody kept quiet in a 1on1 conversation with me. - The forced romance. Don't get me wrong, I liked Sasha. But since the first moment I only had eyes for Fiona and I felt like a jackass telling Sasha to 'screw off' all the time as it wouldn't stop shoving convenient situations up my throat only with her. - Bleeping and replacing the F-bomb. I know this is nitpicking, but COME ON! Is one word really that much of a deal?  This game obviously isn't for everybody. It's mostly an interactive movie and I think it's worth it if you're into that at least a little. Sorry I can't give the highest score since I did find some flaws, but that did not stop me from replaying it many times and now recommending it to you with the count of   9/10  !",

Familiarity with the series is not a prerequisite for playing and enjoying this game, though; those new to it won't catch specific references or be acquainted with some of the characters, but that doesn't hinder their ability to follow the story at all...they simply won't get the fullest experience possible, and if you intend on playing the main games, there are some minor spoilers you may want to avoid (though I've yet to finish Borderlands 2 and wasn't bothered by learning that a specific character dies at the end of it, so your mileage may vary). For existing fans, this game is a treat as it not only further explores the setting of Pandora and its characters, it provides a conclusion to the Borderlands saga with episodes 1-3 taking place before the present day events in The Pre-Sequel and episodes 4-5 being the final events in the series. For the first time in the series, you do not play as a vault hunting action hero armed to the teeth, but rather a Hyperion company man and a small-time Pandoran con artist (each accompanied by a supprting character) who cross paths and find themselves far out of their depth. This 'fish out of water' trope is brilliantly executed here, as the narrative is strong and weaves between multiple character perspectives; though it follows the tried-and-true Telltale formula (point-and-click &amp; button prompt gameplay with branching dialogue choices), it features some new abilities such as a cybernetic eye that reveals hidden environmental objects which either further the plot or provide humor.  Of all the Telltale games, this is probably closest in tone to The Wolf Among Us, though it's a much more lighthearted, less hardboiled mystery. Much like the three main games in the Borderlands series, Tales from the Borderlands is larger than life - the settings, characters, and story feel like they're straight out of a comic book or pulpy sci-fi adventure novel. I've enjoyed every chapter, every nod to the series, every action set-piece and bit of humor, and every decision I was faced with (though the overarching plot remains largely the same regardless of your choices, different choices result in entirely different scenes). Fans of Telltale games are almost sure to enjoy them as well, though fans of Borderlands who enjoy it for its FPS and RPG elements may or may not depending on how much they like this type of game and whether or not they care to experience the complete Borderlands saga.",

That being said, this is what other Telltale Games series boil down to: they're 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books mixed with quicktime events and pixel hunting games. Go in expecting a FPS like Borderlands, and you'll be disappointed. Go in expecting an extremely well written, well acted animated cartoon series with limited control, and you'll have an absolute blast.

The characters are voice-acted wonderfully and the dialogue is well written; the game does a really good job fitting in with the series while having its own style.   The process of anxiously waiting for each individual episode was unnecessary and I have learned my lesson if I ever plan to buy another episodic game like it. You are much better off waiting untl the series is finished (which it is, now) and playing it through that way...if you're impatient as I am. I say this mostly because the intense buildup of waiting per episode impacted the quality of the final episode, at least in my opinion. It felt very thrown together at the end, and rushed--in comparison to the other episodes, at least. I may play it through again another time and see if I feel the same way about it.   If you think your choices truly have any impact on the story and 'change' it in real way, you're just kidding yourself. Some people continue to complain about that fact, but as a player of several Telltale games, I've come to expect that. The choices merely differ certain responses and relationships between characters, but the overall story is all laid out beforehand. So, get ready for some frustation with that, or just accept things may not go exactly the way you want in the game and just enjoy the ride.   Knowing that Gearbox plans to treat this game as part of their canon is also very exciting. Without spoiling too much, it's safe to say that this game has introduced plenty of interesting new characters and possible situations for any upcoming Borderlands titles.",

The story wasn't rushed even with the small number of episodes, the characters that were made for you to love and hate did their job specifically well and the most important part, the choices actually matter! Even the smallest detail can change some outcomes. Everything was detailed and the fact that this game had big changes to the canon story made it even more enjoyable! They made sure to have the spirit of Borderlands in check every moment of the game. If you played Borderlands, buying this game is a must. IF you're a fan though, not having this game would be criminal. I absolutely loved every moment of Tales from the Borderlands and honestly, I can't wait for both Gearboxes' and TellTales' next game to be released.   Great job to both developers for making great games overall. In my opinion, this game would be a 10/10.  Pros  -Great story -Choices that affect many situations and outcomes -Keeps the spirit of Borderlands alive -Every episode adds something to the story -Good pacing of the story -Great music  Cons   -Glitchy animation from time to time -Loading at very important points of the story that ruins the immersion -Quite a few Ex-Machinas  tl;dr Great game for a Borderlands player and a perfect game for a fan of the Borderlands series.",

            "review_text": "If the name 'Borderlands' means very little to you, then you've probably been living under a rock. When it first exploded onto the scene, full of humor, color, and plenty of character, it was a refreshing take on the dreary, brownish-grey FPS market that had been dominating the genre, planting one foot in Action-Adventure, another foot in Sci-Fi, and the last with RPGs, Borderlands quickly garnered a lot of popularity and a sequel soon followed. On the other side of the gaming universe, The Walking Dead by Telltale Games had exploded in a similar fashion, riding on the success of the tv show as well as the graphic novel series, it was soon realized that the game was holding its own with thought out characters, growth, and a foreboding world around every corner. Serious, engaging, and mature were some of the words used to describe The Walking Dead, so to a good portion of people, when it was announced that Borderlands would receive a similar treatment, they were surprised, but as time went on, it became more and more apparent that it was the perfect marriage as the world of Pandora had a LOT of lore and lands to explore and a LOT more badassitude to dish out.    Gameplay: 96/100 A 'Try to roll with the fall!'  For those unfamiliar with Telltale's signature style with The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, it essentially boils down to a fancy point-and-click adventure game, one of the most basic and oldest of video game styles, but out of that simplicity arises a lot of room to grow and stretch which TTG has taken full advantage of, even if the whole experience seems like an endless QTE (Quick Time Event), you never find yourself complaining about it like one. A fair amount of the game is timed and reflex based, some ends in a game over, others result in something else happening or not happening. Just as with the games before it, you are given choices throughout and most on a strict timer, often not giving you enough time to think about the consequences or advantages of your choices. This system has both major pluses and minuses, yet the overall effect is achieved and doesn't really take anything away from the characters who all have their own styles and attitudes. Exploration is another major factor while playing and just like the dialog, you don't be able to get everything.   Audio: 99/100 A+ 'There ain't no rest for the wicked...'  Soundscapes, to me, are one of the most important aspects of a game, it helps flesh out the world just as much, if not more, than the visuals and it couldn't be more apparent in Zer0 Sum. From the ambience to the dialog, everything feels fitting to the world, clear, and thought out. Everything sounds familiar and yet so alien. And of course the music is superb, going from catchy rock tunes, to ambiance, epic suites, and calm, only to go all around again, but it is the voice casting that I must place at the top, from Nerdist creator/comedian Chris Hardwick playing the, well, nerdy Vaughn to the deep, monotonous, and emotionless voice of Patrick Warburton fitting the massive ♥♥♥♥ of a human being - Vasquez, to a T. Everything about it just seems so natural and expected.    Visuals: 96/100 A 'He has an ECHO eye implant.'  I do not recall who came up with the comic book style first: Borderlands or The Walking Dead. either way, it doesn't really matter, point is that the aesthetic is form fitting, much like the music, each compliments one another, from character designs, clothing, the vehicles, the buildings, explosions, environments, and everyone's favorite - Skags. Borderlands has a style all it's own, when you see it you know immediately what it is, just like Tolkien's Middle Earth or H.R. Giger's Alien - it stands out. The game also doesn't suffer much in quality no matter the visual setting, the idea is there and runs smoothly on mid-range machines. Speaking of that smoothness, it also seems like TTG may have finally nailed down how to do those QTE's and dialog choices in a way that isn't sluggish.   Content: 98/100 A+ 'Wow...I could not have timed that better, that really helps dramatically to make my point...'  Replay galore, that is what Telltale is best known for and if you want to know every possible outcome, you have lot of hours of exploration and experimentation ahead of you, but if you're in it for the overall story, well, there's still plenty there. I had planned on playing the episode in small sections, but ended up going through the whole thing in a single sitting. It grabs you by the bootstraps and drags you along for the wild opening ride.   Story: 98/100 A+ 'She's got a gut full of dynamite and a booty like POW!'  Since we're on the topic, the story may not be the most complicated around, but it does what a good opening episode should do - establishment. You know who you are (and that other person), questions are raised, motivations are put into motion, it hits all the nails in the boxcar that is Zer0 Sum that makes you want more. I'm trying hard to avoid spoilers, because this does have some, especially if you haven't played Borderlands 2, but it isn't a deal breaker if it does get spoiled for you, as far as I can tell, it is only one episode after all. Who knows where this one will go.    Design: 98/100 A+ 'How does math work? Does this skin make me look fat? If a giraffe and a car had a baby, would it be called a caraffe? Life's big questions man.'  Telltale has really learned a lot from their recent successes and it shows in every aspect here, taking other source material, staying true to form while maintaining the integrity of the source lore. Everything is in the right place, counterparts compliment one another instead of fighting for dominance. It is yet another testament to not just Telltale, but gaming in general, that graphics or unique gameplay is what makes a great game, but simply a well made, thought out, and passion based ethic and it shines. I can't repeat myself enough when I say that the sounds are right, the voices are right, the landscapes are right.   Verdict: 97/100 A+ 'Directive one: Protect humanity! Directive two: Obey Jack at all costs. Directive three: Dance!'  If it isn't obvious by now, I will make it clear here, Tales from the Borderlands is not just what you'd expect, but more in terms of story and feel. It can still be frantic like its FPS counterparts, but it can get intimate and shows a much different side to the series. Still full of colorful landscapes, characters, and language, but also explosions, humor, satire, and solid acting, something Telltale has been experts at, being able to make characters you can relate to, sympathize with, or utterly hate, yet one thing is for sure - this is a fantastic start to what is sure to be one hell of a ride across Pandora and who knows where else.",

I think I wasn't alone who thought this was going to pan out when they first announced 'Tales from the Borderlands'.  To start off with, the engine is the 'same old', the gameplay is the 'same old'. What is different is the story, the environments and the characters. Nothing too surprising there, is it? The game takes place on Pandora and Helios, you play as two different characters (Rhys and Fiona), going back and forth between the two in your quest for revenge against Hyperion - the evil corporation of the Borderlands universe. Since this game is HEAVILY story driven, I don't want to write anymore about the story, it should be experienced first hand.  In the end, the characters are likeable (some more than others), the game looks decent and the audio is great (especially the voice acting). A fun game to be played for somewhere between eight to twelve hours, depending on if you explore everything or not. But not the best Telltale has done, at times I felt bored when playing it, but the end made it all worth it.",

Besides the occasional piece here and a quicktime moment there, there isn't much. And that's okay. They obviously didn't feel the need for puzzles in the game. Other than that, it's your usual Telltales stuff. Nothing bad.  Music: The score is pretty great when you hear it. It has nice little memorable tunes all over. But the real fun is the licensened stuff they add in every episode, and it's great. They kept that good ol' Borderlands tradition, and for this game, went with some 70's/80's homage synth pop. All the tunes are pretty great, and 'To the Top' and 'Busy Earnin'' seem to be my favorite of the bunch.  Graphics: Originally, this game didn't look too great. And that was fine. I mean, in a game with hundreds of different diolougue and animation options, that's pretty accepted. However, I seem to find with every new episode release, the models and textures appear more refined and overall just better looking.  Story (no spoilers): Writing this right after playing episode 4... Wow. Just wow. This is some of the best writing, characters, and plot Telltale let alone Borderlands has ever seen. Your choices matter more than ever, even in the first episode. I haven't been this in love or involved in a game's story since Bioshock Infinite. When they weren't creating new characters, we were seeing different sides of already beloved Borderlands characters. It still of course, keeps that Borderlands charm and even sneeks in quite a few referances to past games, especially Pre-Sequel. Any Borderlands or Telltale fan would love this. If your both, then well, this is even more of a treat.  I might be a little bias because I love Borderlands so much, but I honest to god can't find anything I don't like about this game. As a Borderlands fan since the sequel, I love this game. I haven't played many Telltale games before, but after this, I will have. Absoshootly recommend.",

            "review_text": "okay so if you are new to telltale games they have a style that no other game can create, basically these are movies (and im not talking bad movies i am talking about great movies) with quick time events but trust me these quick time events aren't bad at all and it has one of the best story's i have ever heard from a video game *SPOILER ALERT* okay so you have bought the game and finished it here are some of my thoughts on the story ep.1 zero sum, pretty good setting up the background with how and why rhys a hyperion worker would be on this hell hole of a planet known as pandora anyways i didn't like the how they forced in shade but he still was at least a little funny the whole 'scam' carry's on until the end of the game which i like because it is how fiona and rhys met the suprise of zero was so funny and the emotes he used were also pretty cool and i have to say i like zero in bl2 anyway bossanova i wish we knew more about him but he is basically a useless side character they don't dive into which is fine because they kill him off then you find the stash which sets up so much including handsome jack appearing for the first time gortys how your decision to explode or tell loader bot to run away will effect how he treats you oh and speaking of, i haven't talked about my favorite character, loader bot the action scene with him is great and then he becomes one of the best member's of the group august is a jerk in ep 1 and that is basically it ep.2 atlas mugged it dives deeper into who the characters are with fiona finding the gifts athena turning out not to be a assassin and setting up the kind of side characters like vallory gortys august and more i trusted fiona at the end but jack would have wrecked the place the almost endless wandering in the desert was kinda nice and relaxing allowing me to get to know rhys more and the way they split up rhys and fiona was kinda nice anyways i don't have as much to say because most of it is character building and new characters ep.3 catch-a-ride arriving at the more humid and jungle like area was nice the battle between brick fiona and mordici or however you spell his name was a great fight the new ability that fiona got was great and really cool along with the slow moving chase scene with rhys was great and so funny loader bot and gortys got some more of the spotlight and the shocking ending of how gortys's last piece is on helios was very suprising and it was great ep.4 escape plan bravo i think i should start this off with a sad note scooters death it came out of no where and i know everyone who played the game (unless you are doing like a evil run or something like that) honored scooter i put up the only thing he ever wanted anyone to hear 'CATCH-A-RIDE' but remember all this is cannon so scooter is dead for bl3 then the shocking discovery of yvette being a traitor it also came out of no where but since yvette didn't get much screen time it was too heart breaking the random finger gun fight was so much fun and had me laughing the entire way and so did the creepy handsome jack vip tour with their wierd masks made it so much fun for me anyways getting into jacks office and either trying to help by being the leader of hyperion was a twist i thought i needed to choose but then i found out what jack planned to do anyway the happy go lucky personality of gortys when we were getting arrested was so so funny but this plan comes at a cost ep.5 vault of the traveler the heartbreaking death of loader bot had me crying so hard jacks endless jokes tho made me cheer up a little the crash site with jack still alive a little was a shocker but then removing your cybernetics to stop jack was just gruesome finding vallory shooting at gortys and your supposed dead sister i had to kill finch or what ever his name was but after the death of vallory you have to kill gortys to stop the traveler then finding vaughn with the laser pointers was very funny but the unmasking of your kidnapper to be loader bot just made me fill with joy but then finding out his plan to kill the traveler to make it safe for gortys to live again was awesome but the best moment was fighting the traveler it was epic i picked august springs and zero anyways i am about to reach the limit so my rating is 9.9/10",

All this game needed was 10 hours to hammer it's way through the ranks of my carefully selected and highly prized list of favourite games and land on a solid first (maaaaybe second) place. That takes a downright unspeakably amazing rollercoasterride of a game to accomplish that, but Tales From The Borderlands managed to do it with ease. It even blew right past all The Witcher games - take a look at my profile and let that sink in.  Get this game if you're at all into storytelling in games. You don't even have to be a Borderlands fan. This story and these characters are sure to take you on an adventure you won't be forgetting for a loooong time.  I have a cat named Gortys now. ",

Its unlike any other Tell Tale episodic game as the main emotion you have while playing this game is happiness, and not sadness mixed with anxiety. And while I like the Borderlands franchise, I never felt a connection to any of the characters. However this game made me care for the protagonists and thier family and friends. If you havn't played either a Tell Tale game or a Borderlands game before, I recommend this game as a starting point.   ****SPOILER****   Every episode just got better and better, and finished with an epic fight, Megazord *wink wink*. Loader Bot was awesome and made me laugh and cry on more than one occasion. I also like the cameo of the vault hunters, it made this game feel apart of the Borderlands lore and world. I am looking forward to playing this game again in the future.",

You play as the two main characters Rhys, the Hyperion desk jockey looking to be the next handsome Jack and Fiona the con artist . The characters interactions are fabulous and will have you laughing. There are many many characters you get to meet and you enjoy every single one of them. There are twists and turns I gurantee you will not see coming. Voice acting is also really good. The game has some super gross moments in it which are hillarious .  At times it feels like your choices don't matter and that gets frustrating especially when you choose to be the good guy but you get forced to be the bad guy and everyone leaves you to die but in the end there was to much positive to outweigh the bad . In the corporate world of Hyperion on Helix you settle differences with finger gun fights. You get to have a finger gun fight with 60 guys. I mean c'mon bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.

            "review_text": "-WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, READ AT YOUR OWN DESCRETION-  So, for starters this review is long over due.  But, I still feel obligated to make a review of this game. For the reason that there is obviously going to be a sequel in the near future.   So to kick things off, 'Borderlands', the tag itself is suppose to represent the 'Mad Max' in space FPS experience. But that is not at all what you'd expect in this game, granted 'TellTaleGames' haves never done that, since they do Third-person decision based stories. Which is what I love from this company, but they seemed to almost perfectly get around that by having what we'd expect in 'Tales From the Borderlands', although it's not an FPS, it still contains more then enough action, with an enemy at hand around every corner and different location. Now obviously this all takes place after 'Borderlands 2' which is the last game of its title, with the exception of 'Tales From the Borderlands' where our infamous Anti-Hero, Handsome Jack has died after vault hunters fought him. So the way 'TellTaleGames' decided to keep Jack relevant was they had posters all around the planet Pandora, but that wasn't enough. They made an A.I. (Artificial Intellegence) version of Jack, that only one of the two main characters could see (Rhys). I enjoyed this very much and was very surprised to see the Anti-Hero of the whole universe come back in such an unexpected fashion. But of course there are negatives about everything in life. So I'm just going to go through them a little quickly. Okay for starters, and this goes for all 'TellTaleGames' mind you: The decisions you make, some of them do not tailor to how you play, and don't carry over to the next episode, which kind of defeats the purpose. Another thing is at the end of the game, when you chose the special character, you can only get ClapTrap even though it's a great surprise to see ClapTrap and have his wit be carried through the entire last half of Episode 5. One other thing is when Sasha 'dies', now I put quotes on it because she dies but then cheats death with her adoptive dad's (Felix) gift, now I'm glad they didn't lose someone they loved, but it would've opened up to so much more story and plot development, and a potential climax. But they shut that down. Now, even though this game has some more flaws, they're not as major. But overall this game is good, I recommend it.   I give it a solid 7.5/10  w/ recommendation.   ",

The journey is full of humor and creative mini-game like battles(The last one is a must play, just for the experience alone.) As for player choice effect, while I haven't explored what other options will do, it's rather obvious certain events will occur no matter what(Major plot events), yet it does appear possible to influence npc perception of your characters(With regards to relationships and who 'helps' at the end).   The graphics suitably match up with the style from the main Borderlands games and work to benefit as it's close enough to Telltale's usual style. I only noticed a couple texture flicker issues throughout my play, mostly with character costumes but it wasn't distracting.  The music works well and is the same as the Borderlands themes albeit with more of a soundtrack feel now. I did run into a glaring glitch regarding audio towards the end; some audio clips of voiceover and music failed to play close to the end resulting in some awkward silences. I would suggest having subtitles on just in case.  Overall, I give it a 9 out 10. I very much enjoyed it and will probably play through it again sometime.",

It doesn't have lots of gameplay, since most of your time is spent either watching stuff unfold, choosing dialogue choices, or answering quicktime events (and there are tons of those), but the story it tells is a beautiful one and easily the best I have experienced in a Telltale game. So if you're on the fence about this game, do be warned that you'll mostly get a long movie where you get to make the odd choice.

            "review_text": "Episode One Review  Coming to this first episode as a fan of both the Borderlands series and the recent Telltale games projects, I admit to being a little skeptical. The strengths of the Borderlands franchise was also more in its loot &amp; shoot gameplay rather than its stories or its characters, which doesn't seem to suit it well for an adventure game. At the same time, while I am a big fan of Telltale's recent Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us episodic endeavors, earlier attempts at properties that were a bit more action oriented and less walking and talking like Jurassic Park and Back to the Future were less than impressive.   I was pleasantly surprised, then, when I came away from the first episode of this series with a grin on my face and a sense of excitement and anticipation for the remainder.   The game plays like the recent Telltale adventure games mentioned above, like The Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us. Unlike the early telltale adventure games, Tales from the Borderlands plays out less like a traditional adventure game and more like an interactive episode of a borderlands TV show. This may sound like a bad thing to some people, but I would assure them that it isn't. At least in episode one, this isn't a game about picking up inventory items and combining them to solve puzzles using some sort of Elpis Logic. In fact, there really aren't any puzzles at all. Instead, imagine a well animated and entertaining Borderlands miniseries, except you get to make all the major decisions and live with their outcomes, from how you treat a guy you are asking for directions to whether or not you betray an acquaintance. Most of the gameplay involves this kind of dialogue choosing or decision making, almost all of it on a timer. The rest takes place in rather well done quick time events that take place during the action scenes.   A quick note on QTEs: I'm normally not a big fan of these, and playing with a mouse and keyboard I still don't like the whole 'mash the q button' one. But, overall, they felt smooth and unobtrusive. For the most part, it consists of pressing a directional button or clicking a moving target on the screen. They make up a decent portion of the game, especially the climax, but I never felt particularly annoyed at them, and they almost never took me out of the game or its story.  A game like that may not sound that much fun, and it might not be if the story and writing weren't so well done. I won't go into much detail on the story or the characters, but I found them to be quite entertaining. The main story is told as the main characters are recounting it to a third party, giving them the opportunity to bicker about how things really happened, a trick that I enjoyed. The story itself begins as a heist which is always a lot of fun, and the writers know how exactly how to hit the beats of the genre to keep the story moving and for comedic effect.   In terms of comedy, while there were some jokes that didn't land, most of the game is pretty funny. I had a couple of laugh out loud moments, and there are a lot of little touches that made me laugh or smile outside of real jokes. I think the key is that, with a couple exceptions, the games humor either comes organically from the characters (often as a result of a dialogue choice you made), or from the nature of the world of Borderlands itself. It doesn't really feel forced.   I particularly enjoyed the cast of characters that they have already drawn so far. While the they are a little cliché, this actually works to the games advantage, as it allows you to choose, through dialogue, whether you want to play them against type or to the hilt. This makes them feel surprisingly well developed for a game series that usually paints its characters with nothing more than some joke filled catchphrases. In the end, I actually want to see where the story is going, not because of the plot, but because I want to spend more time with the characters and see how much (or how little) of themselves and their relationship changes over the course of the story.   And that is the feeling that I was left with at the end of the game- anticipation. I had a great time playing, and If I could have moved onto the next episode right away, I totally would have. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Borderlands, or who wouldn't mind a more light hearted telltale adventure game than the Walking Dead.    TLDR: Surprisingly entertaining and well written. Recommended.    A last note for those of you who don't know the Borderlands Universe: Given that I know it pretty well, I'm not the best person to talk to, but I think the game is pretty approachable to the initiated. As I recall, none of the major plot or comedic notes hinges on an inside joke or knowledge of the games, so you should be fine. Most of the issue will be not knowing what the planet is like and the kind of people who inhabit it, but given that one of the protagonists comes in as a relative outsider that might actually be fitting. If you wanted to do some research, maybe look up a short plot summary of Borderlands 2. ",

Being a developer myself, and preparing for releasing one of my games on Steam, there are many things we notice in a game that most people usually do not. Whilst this is not exactly a good thing, it gives us the possibility for a far more deep evaluation.  I must say that the most impeccable present thing within the game are not the characters. It's not the scenery. It's not the dialogue. But the music. The soundtrack. Once you start play the game, at each episode, when the intro music comes out and a slow scene starts to open, you'll notice that it could NOT fit any better. There was NOT a single second I didn't treasure while the music was playing at the beginning of each episode.   The focus of this game is the humour. And I don't even know how to start. I'm hard to be pleased, but it is impossible to not notice the amount of work and intelligence put on the humorous scenes. You can't play this game without feeling inside a Borderlands game. It REALLY does the universe some justice. And it gives a great ending to a well deserving villain from Borderlands. This game has SERIOUS effects on the plot, I wonder how it will affect the next Game.  To put it short, if you are a fan of the series, or like the Telltale's way of storytelling, or are looking for 'something more', you should get this game. If you are looking for seeing characters you've played before in Borderland 1 and 2, you should get this game. If you are looking for some good laughs, you should get this game. If you didn't like any of the previous Telltale's games you've played, then you should wait for a discount, but you definetly should try this one. I'm sure it's one of their best so far.",

The character's personalities has been thought through and designed very well, with different vibes depending on your choice of response, especially when it comes to one of the main characters you control, Rhys, which i found to have the most interesting personality.  I often found the responses to choose from, very well fit to the situation, i never had a point where i thought 'Why would i say that?' like i had in a other Telltale game before.  The story itself caught me quickly, with early on action and quick decisions to make, also the moments where you had to notice the details made me really live into the story.  my review here is perhaps lacking on some details, but that is in order not to spoil to much for people who have not gotten the game yet.  IF i have to set my finger on 1 thing i 'dislike' would be that sometimes you have to make to quick decisions on dialogue responses, but not enough to make the gameplay seem 'lackful' or 'rushing'.  overall i must say, an amazing game, didnt even notice how fast the hours went while playing this!  10/10",

The Tales from the Borderlands boasts a fantastic and unqiue graphical design, similar to that of the original Borderlands games, your story follows Rhese a lowly Hyperion employee desperate to move up in the world.  Rhese in a sense is what you'd describe as an anti hero, similar to that of deadpool, his actions although heroic at first glance lack in conviction and drive and infact are often self-motivated, himself being thrown into the wilds of Pandora, a rough dangerous planent filled with criminals and phycopaths and It's your job to control your anti-hero and guide him through the game to become the ultimate vault hunter.  The Tales from the Borderlands is a fantastic addition to the Borderlands games providing a refreshing change of pace, really fleshing out the world of pandora and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoy's the Borderlands style of humor and story.",

I was kinda bored with Borderlands lately because there were too much of it. Too many DLC for the 2 and the reviews and critics for the Pre-Sequel were not really appealing, but this game reconciled me with the franchise. For the first time in a long period, I wanted to play a Borderlands game again.  I was kinda sceptical about how Telltale will add all the actions of a Borderlands game and all the fun/gore part in a point and click. But they managed to do it with brio. I laughed so much playing this game. The action is well brought with some quick time event but not too muchand clearly what makes this game a must have resides in its writing.  All the characters are great, funny and you get attached to them. Rooting over some friendship, shipping a romance between this one and the other one.  You get to meet some of the previous game characters and the new ones are also pretty cool and funny.    Scooter :'(     The story of Rhys, Fiona, Vaughn and Sasha is probably one of the funniest I've played in a very long time. I'm really hoping to play these characters again in a canon Borderlands game like the 3 or maybe a Season 2 of Tales from the Borderlands.   There are still some things that need changes.

The overall experience is just so amazing that I couldn't put it down from beginning to end. A must buy game!   PROS  -Long engrossing story -Fun cast of characters -Improved QTE mechanics -Choices actually have effects!?    CONS  -Can't skip cutscenes after death -They killed my favorite BL Character :'(   STORY   Unlike previous Telltale games this game actually puts you in the roll of two protagonists. Rhys is the first you meet, a young man who worked for Hyperion. He starts out in the middle of the desert searching for someone. He eventually gets ambushed by a lone masked bandit &amp; is dragged off. During his capture the bandit asks him to tell him a story about how he ended up where he is. Rhys then starts The Tale from the Borderlands!   One of the more brilliant parts of the story is how each chapter begins. They all start off in the normal borderlands style of 2D page by page cutscenes but then as you get through the chapter you're treated to a great opening every time. You could say every opening to a chapter is like getting a new Borderlands intro. Each one is simply amazing to witness.   As Rhys is dragged off further he is brought to a camp where you meet the second protagonist, Fiona who has also been taken prisoner by the bandit. She's a professional con-artist who got a job involving Rhys &amp; everything went to hell. In the aftermath they ended up forming a neccessary alliance in order to survive their ordeals together.   The bandit has captured them both in order to learn what he calls, 'The Truth.'   GAMEPLAY   If you've played other Telltale games you know what you're in for. Mostly QTE segments within the cutscenes with choices of dialog. Inbetween cutscenes you will have small puzzle like elements. I say 'Puzzle-Like' because they're all so easy they barely feel like puzzles at all. I really wish Telltale would spruce up the puzzle elements of their games &amp; make them more challenging. They mostly consist of 'Find this item' or 'Hit this switch'. Actually, that's pretty much all their puzzles consist of &amp; it just feels tacked on to break up the story.   I guess you could say the real puzzles in the game are within the dialog because they effect the outcomes &amp; what happens within the game. A good example appears in later chapters with Fiona where she is given options to shoot with elemental properties. These are all pretty easy, though &amp; involve simply choosing the right element for the corresponding color. You could also say that unlocking specific characters for the final chapter is part of the puzzle element within Telltale games.   GRAPHICS   The graphics are of typical Borderlands &amp; Telltale style. It's almost as if Borderlands was meant to be a Telltale game because they're both represented in such similar fashions. Cellshaded &amp; outlined. The game does have some graphical glitches every now and then with flashing character models &amp; lip sync issues. Other than that though the game looks &amp; feels great. The QTE segments also tend to make cutscenes look off. Unless you time it properly it will look like you teleport. This isn't really a big issue but more of a nitpick for me as I'd prefer much more fluid transitions.   AUDIO   The music is fantastic &amp; perfectly entwined with the whole Borderlands world. Opening cutscenes playback with probably the best music they could use &amp; everything just feels natural for the whole game's aethstetic.Voice acting is also very well done to the point where I have no complaints about it.   OVERALL   If you enjoy Telltale games or Point &amp; Click style gameplay or just an enjoying experience full of laughs, drama, &amp; more laughs then you should probably pick this game up. I had more fun with this game in particular than I have with any other Telltale game &amp; that says alot. This is absolutely the best Telltale game currently on the market &amp; I hope there will be more Tales from the Borderlands games in the future or at least something similar to them.",

It's not so great if you don't have a controller though (Personal opinion) as you'll constantly have to sit with your keyboard and mouse incase something happens and you have to interact.  But wrapped up in a blanket, having it run on the tv with a controler in your hand, just lean back and enjoy the story. You feel like all the conversation options and choices you make actually have an impact on what happens throughout the story. And you get attached to the characters (No matter how annoying they might be) . But as a game, it's all just quicktime events and conversation options. So you have to keep a bit of an open mind going into it.  Over-all, after finishing the game in about 12 hours (This includes ~2 hour breaks), I really, enjoyed my experience and the story. I got a lot more out of it than I was expecting, and the story made me laugh, smile, annoyed beyond comprehension and had me really depressed in some parts, making me truly regret the choices I made.

From the beginning to the end, 'Tales from the Borderlands' will draw you into its spell with charming characters, great writing, perfectly timed dialogue and jokes; a fantastic selection of licensed music and composed soundtrack.  I loved every second of it and I can recommend it to every fan of story driven games, Telltale fans and even hardcore Borderlands fans.   However! While my highest praise goes out to the creative team and the programmers getting it running, I wonder why the game doesn't get the attention and love it deserves with it's Steam release.  There are no pinned threads on the Steam forums for fixes and bugs Sometimes the game decides to talk about analog sticks, even tough you play it entirely with mouse + KB There is an unfixable crash when trying to log into your Telltale account No individual graphics settings like AA or anisotropic filtering Actors zap around in some scenes or obstruct vital scenes...  This all could have been long fixed long ago and it baffles me that Telltale seems to simply don't care about this Steam release, when the game itself is so lovely crafted.  In any case, buy this game. It's worth every minute and every cent you spend on it.",

I was afraid at first because i only briefly played Borderlands 1, so i thought that i won't understand or recognize lot of things, but this was extremely great game even without having huge knowledge of Borderlands lore. You can still clearly see that it is game from Telltale, but it is very unique in many ways and in my opinion a lot better than the other titles (even though i love them all). Extremely good storytelling, characters, voice acting, the way the story is presented, unique style, almost Tarantino-like and one of the greatest soundtracks ever.",

Characters; new and familiar, each character is lifelike and brings quality to the game.

While Borderlands 2 improved over the first game significantly with at least making you take notice of what was happening in the world  a little , Tales from the Borderlands made you actually care. I'm actually invested in Borderlands canon now singlehandedly thanks to this game, as long as future Borderlands games don't ignore what happened here and make some of the big storyline developments have consequences in further games.   So what makes this so great? It's really the characters, fully embodied by the great voiceover work from the entire cast. The overly busy Troy Baker might've made his mark playing Joel from The Last of Us or Booker DeWitt from Bioshock Infinite, but I think he's just as good here as he was in those games. And you also get some great performances out of Laura Bailey, Patrick Warburton, and many, many others (even Chris 'I used to host Singled Out!' Hardwick). And a special shout out should go out to Ashley Johnson, who absolutely killed it as GORTYS.   What also worked? Choice mattered. Maybe they weren't earth shattering, and maybe everyone still got to point A to point Z no matter what happened in between, but when I arrived at that critical episode 5, I realized that things I had done and forgotten about really did carry over.   The fact of the matter is if you've enjoyed any of Telltale's other games, you owe it to yourself to play this. It might not be a 'gamers' game' (whatever that is), but it has enough amazing characters, a fantastic story, memorable songs, genuine laughs, and plenty of heartfelt 'This is a Borderlands game and I'm almost crying?!' moments that you shouldn't even care if it's really a game or not.",

Like any TellTale game it pulls on the heartstrings and knows how to impact you in such a way.

This game is more like a movie for borderlands which is why i like it, so if you are expecting a shoot em up type of game, YOU WILL NOT GET THAT HERE, please do research on your games before you buy them for those of you who bought the game without knowing that... What you will get however is an actual story being told to you and it pretty much follows the Walking dead episode games, so everything in there you can expect it here. You will make valueable decisions that will affect you later and you can expect to get laughs from the dialogue choices you make as well as references that you would only understand if you play the borderland games. Overall for a game that actually gives me a story about borderlands and makes me want to see and hear more dialogue choices, i say point and click games are now just fine by me. 8/10 (i gave it an 8 because it left me wanting to see the rest of the episodes now) Spoiler Alert!  i always wondered where those bandits get that shield from with the midgets on them",

            "review_text": "When I played it the first time, it honestly enjoyed it. It was my first game in this 'choose your own adventure'-book style, and I enjoyed the funny and over the top story. Some parts in Episode 4 and 5 were unexpectedly sad, but I still would have recommended it for the earlier episodes, and brilliant scenes like the    employee gun fight on Helios station   .   A year has passed, and I have played 'Life is Strange'. Since I enjoyed 'Tales from the Borderlands' the first time, I started a second playthrough. That was my mistake. 'Tales from the Borderlands' is by no means a bad game, but I noticed how horribly unpolished it actually is.   First thing I noticed when I started it was the language. I am not a native English speaker, but I always play in English (if that is the original language of the game), because of the superior voice acting. For most of the games I own the language is set by the Steam settings, it used to work for this game too. Seems like they patched that 'bug'. The in-game language is now the system language/region of the computer.   After I taught my computer English I could finally start playing the game, but I gave up after 2 Episodes.   1. It is impossible to skip dialogues. Or cutscenes. Not even the recap at the beginning of an Episode. If you played the game once, and know that a certain part of the dialogue or scene is not interesting, have fun watching it again, completely. That alone does not sound too bad, does it?  2. It gets frustrating if you are trying to test different choices, because there are so few checkpoints. Decide to reload from the last checkpoint to see how the conversation could have turned out? Prepare to watch three minutes of cutscenes again. Or more. The same happens if you actually manage to die during the fight scenes.  3. Controls and Camera. In some parts of the game you can move the main character in third-person view. Usually you have to scan things with his special ability. That works sometimes, but every time you are in a big room game desing fails completely. The controls are clunky and slow, there are tons of invisble walls, and the camera angles are set. Even the camera angles for the scanning ability are set, depending on where the player is standing. That would be fine for a game with 1D-movement, but they give you an illusion of exploration. It is impossible to stray even a little bit from the rails they put you on. It would actually be more enjoyable if just 1D-movement was possible.   Maybe my mistake was playing TftB again after playing 'Life is Strange'. I know that TftB is older, but freedom to chooose the language, skippable cutscenes and voice lines, as well as a decent camera system is no rocket science.  If you dont mind paying more than 20€ on a 12 h movie go ahead, its not bad. But don't expect to be able to discover all the choices without a lot of frustration, and don't be disappointed if you just want to look around the usually well designed environments.",

It just goes 'running' and acts as if its about to start going, but then quickly syncs to some download that doesn't even register as a single byte, and cancels out. I delete preferences, try to run as admin, and search various forums and community support for a fix, and although other people have experienced start-up crashes after fixing resolution, none like mine seem to have existed. I have no black screen or white screen, the game just 'starts' for about 7 seconds, then quits. There's no fix apparent to this issue besides maybe a re-install and waste the other half of my bandwidth and another 8 hours just to load the ****ing thing again and hope that it resolves the issue.  One other solution MAY be that perhaps I need to make an account with TTG to get server updates, but this is bull****. This is an OFFLINE GAME! None of the other TTGs I have seen or played that even use stats from all over their userbase have ever needed separate accounts for this ****. You shouldn't need server updates, or any mandatory updates for that matter, through any avenue besides Steam for a game that doesn't even have multiplayer! I don't even know if that's the issue or not either, and I don't even know if I can even make an account since I cannot even launch the game anymore!  I bought this game and loaded it up a year and a half after launch. Bugs this bad on PCs that cost 1.5k shouldn't be happening, especially for a game with a license this big. Its a disgrace.  The Wolf Among Us didn't have this problem for me, Poker Night 2 didn't, and The Walking Dead Season 1 on my PS3 didn't either. Why the **** this is happening for this game just blows my mind, and its a shame since I was really looking forward to playing it since people were saying its one of the better written TTGs.  0/10 until I can fix this issue. **** this ****.

            "review_text": "I dunno. It's not terrible I guess. I really wasn't expecting much here, and that's exactly what I got. It's probably the best Telltale game, and definitely the most consistant--every single episode had at least something noteworthy in it, and they didn't pull out the carpet from under us like they have many many times before.   The game starts out slowly and does not really leave you expecting much. The story extends naturally out from the ending of the first episode and doesn't really pull any twists whatsoever, with one very abrupt and honestly shocking exception. You can probably map out the entire story by looking at the episode screencaps. Rhys and Fiona get trapped on Pandora. Rhys and Fiona get *more* trapped on Pandora. Rhys and Fiona go somewhere exotic and get cornered by the villains. Rhys and Fiona go back to Helios. Rhys and Fiona confront the stranger and deal with a vault. I suppose if you haven't played Borderlands 2 before, you might be surprised by some of the story hooks, but at the same time, if you haven't played Borderlands 2, I strongly reccomend you do not play this game. If you've read the store description you probably know why. The story doesn't have any of the huge gaping flaws that TWD and TWAU had. Instead of being a total trainwreck, it's more like a boring train ride, and you forgot to bring your 3DS.  The very predictable and dry story is exacerbated by Telltale's failed methods of production. It's already hard enough to remember the characters and choices you've made with them being so innocuous, but when you have to wait four months inbetween each episode, it gets even worse. It doesn't matter too much to me, as I'm reviewing this game as a finished product, but I have to say on behalf of everyone that waited to play the episodes on release that it was an extremely frustrating ordeal. If Telltale sticks to this design methodology again then I'm convinced that the paychecks straight from the multitude of publishers who want their games 'Telltale style' are more important to them than the satisfaction of their customers.  I said at the beginning of my review that this game was 'not bad', and that's probably because it's not much of anything. Puzzles are limited in scope, take less than a minute to solve even by someone with horrible problem skills (me), and don't really have any reason to be there except in one particular instance. Choices are far more limited and provide far less consequences and contrivances than they ever have. QTEs are barely even there except at the very end of the game. But I don't really care, because all of the above are aspects of Telltale games that are frequently horrible. By getting rid of these elements they saved me a lot of frustration, but I can't really applaud Telltale for getting rid of virtually all of their game's content instead of improving it, especially since the Borderlands series is the first licensed property Telltale has touched that actually has gameplay, and therefore looks particularly odd without it.  Overall I can't really reccomend that someone pay upwards of $15 for this game when there's a multitude of different youtubers that put what is basically the same experience on youtube for free, and I can't really feel bad for telling people to not pay Telltale for their work when their production schedule is completely unacceptable. As a story it's servicable. Rousing campfire tale, but not a cinematic experience that's going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Honestly, the times I enjoyed myself most with this game were the dialogues where world progresion was indicated, like   Rhys recovering the deed to Atlas and potentially attempting to revive the corporation.   That kind of stuff was great, because it makes me wonder if they're going to implement that in Borderlands 3. And that's really all this game was. Waiting for Borderlands 3.    Also, Zer0 has a different voice actor in the last episode and nobody mentions it. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ was that?  ",

I recently upgraded my htpc and was looking forward to playing all my telltale games on the big screen. I'm running windows 10 and an xbox one controller with the new wireless adapter. The game does not detect the controller when running in big picture mode. I read the suggestion of launching the game as administrator which does make the game recognize the controller, however the buttom prompts aren't always correct - it will say RT when you actually need to press LT. This makes is frustrating to play.   I also tried two other telltale games and they had the same issues. If you want to play the game with a controller don't buy it unless you have an xbox 360 controller!",

I cannot reccommend this game at all as three months without even a mention of the next chapter outright offends me. I can't even remember many of the details of the story now which means I'll have to re-play it when the next chapter comes out and even then theres a whole 3 more chapters to go!

Alternately, you might have just a few seconds to select one of three different dialog choices, and depending on which you chose it may alter the flow of the story somewhat.  It felt like playing 'Space Ace' or 'Dragon's Lair' (early 1980's laser video disc games), in that you didn't really interact with the game very much. For most of the game you are a spectator watching TV. That's not what I had in mind when I bought the game. Sigh.  I will admit that the story line is a bit intriguing, but it doesn't really tie in with the other three Borderlands games, so it was hard to really care about the story like I did for Borderlands. Yeah, it's in the same basic universe, but you have different characters, different motivations, and a different setting to boot. So why do I care about these people again? I really had a hard time getting into it.  The other downfall is that the entire game only lasts about 2 hours - maybe a bit less even. Sure, once you've finished you can re-start and select different dialog to see how the story changes, but honestly the outcome is going to be nearly the same no matter what.   They say there will be more content coming soon, but even if there are more stories, it's still boring to watch. Not my kind of game I guess.",

The humour in this game is top notch, and as a fan of the Borderlands series I was worried it would delve into sophomoric bathroom humour as they occasionally do, but so far it's been the dry humour I've enjoyed from the series.

That is the moment in which I felt not a penny had been wasted on this game. It had me snickering many times, but that single moment was enough to make me write my first ever review and strongly recommend this game.  I read from other reviews the QTEs went too fast, but maybe it's the brashness afforded to me by whiskey, but I've never felt they went to fast.

Its hard to review this like a normal game and so I will just try to explain my experience.   Do not think just because this is a Telltale adventure game that you will be bored with a slow paced point and click.  First thing's first, play this with a gamepad if youve got it. It just feels better. That might be more opinion than anything but try it out.  The characters are fantastic. They are certainly doing the Borderlands mythos proud. They are all lovable in their own way and even though you have control over many of the two main characters action you tend to feel the urge to make choices you think that specific character would make and not just playing yourself through two different people.  The story is paced amazingly well, it provides a few spots you could probably stop for the night, but like a Tv show, you might feel the urge to binge it all in one shot like a Netflix-travaganza. I did. And I cannot wait for more.  This is just plain fun on all accounts. And Funny too. Never does this game break its back for a joke. Its all written very hilariously and very well.  I really feel like my choices matters and could have effected the outcome of this chapter as well as the whole game. We will see. Second playthrough on the way.  Cons: I was hoping for more inventory based puzzling, however it seems that may be in the future. There is a barely used inventory system in the game and it seems to me that it will come in use later.  Big con for me, its not all out yet. I waited for this to come out, and beat it in a few hours and now I have to wait for the rest.  Final verdict? If you want a change of pace, buy it. Now. This is not assassins creed or even mario so comparing it to something like that is apples to oranges. ",

In the case of Tales from the Borderlands, they didn't only manage a good story, but they also kept up with the Borderlands humor. I would even say they managed to surpass it, the dialogue response options are hilarious at times. The atmosphere and visuals are also spot on, especially since Borderlands already used cell-shading 'cartoony' look. I hope they will keep this up with the fuutre episodes. It's by far the best Telltale series start, and in suuuuch a contrast with the grim (but also good) Game of Thrones episode 1.",

With much less running around screaming at your friends or reviving them though, so that's nice.  Honestly, I love it for still telling a very Borderlands story without the bulk of the grinding the main series has. Though I am kind of sad that there aren't achievements dec\\dicated to doing the dumb actions that a Borderlands player goes for.  My bigger issues with this game are just not having the ability to skip dialogue that you've already seen (if you messed up or are going for a different path) and the apparent 4 saves only (and the fact the name space is too small to write talk ♥♥♥♥ get hit/talk dirt get hurt)",

The writing is exactly what I hoped from them, the cast is well-rounded, the action scenes were plentiful and exciting, the use of music was so pleasing, and the amount of content in one episode is perfect and more than I'd expect.  So we have two groups of cast members, Rhys's Vaughn and Yvette, with Fiona's Felix and Sasha. Like I've said, this core group was very well rounded, and I enjoyed each character. Yvette may not be the most used, but Felix and Sasha provided great perspectives in terms of dialogue and those quiet scenes the game puts us through. As for Vaughn, he's that whiny character that balances what most people dislike with some realistic caution we as a player should consider. Status: Currently Dreading Everything. Finally, the other side characters(but very important ones), August, Vasquez, Bossanova, Zero. All incredibly entertaining to see on screen. The villains were plentiful, as well as the Borderlands references.  As a Borderlands game, and me being a huge Borderlands story fan(I understand it might be hard to see the story the the gun-toting gameplay of the main franchise, but Borderlands 2 really impressed me with it's world), Tales From the Borderlands gives me the exact feeling I get when I appreciate a Borderlands Lore and story point, but then lets me savor it with the typical intensity that TellTale game has. Even if you don't like Borderlands, try this game out. It's a good, more stand-out display of what's so good about the Borderlands world.  As for direct references, I have two things to say. The music and the... references. The music is usually direct from Borderlands 2, and as a big fan of the soundtrack, I'd say they used all the music with pinpoint accuracy. The joy I felt when Southern Shelf Combat played, oohhhh man. Then you have those moments where they reference the plot of past games, like in the World of Curiousities(I won't spoil what you find there). However, the game mostly references DLC story content from Borderlands 2(and a bit of 1). I loved those moments, though, as well as the action scenes. As for decisions, you have a hand in the arsenal of your loader bot, and there are some creative decisions you'll have to make, like saving your only bullet throughout the entire season. I used it this episode, but what if I didn't? It gave me two chances to just in this episode.  Either way, this game is 10/10, I can't WAIT for the next episode. The writing is actually a bit surprising in it's intelligence, as in, the plot is pretty clever. I didn't expect the episode to be so long, it was definitely over two hours long, and A LOT happened. That plot description about the vault key and stuff for this episode? Yeah, going into episode two, we have a whole different set-up to head toward, and I'm ready for it.",

I'd played Borderlands before this, and while I thought that game was about killing ♥♥♥♥ and getting loot, this game made me realise that the Borderlands universe has such a huge lore to be looked into, and I'm actually going to go back and play the Borderlands to see if I can really learn more about what happens.  If you enjoying laughing and an insanely addictive story, this is the game for you. I'd say you don't even need to play Borderlands to play this game, however you'll get a lot of the references if you have and that will make you respect it that much more.  Basically, buy this game.

Set after Borderlands 2 this story follows Rhys: A semi-ruthless businessman looking to screw over his new boss, and Fiona: a street-wise Pandoran con-artist after her next big score. By their sides are Vaughn: a pen-pushing accountant and Rhys' partner in corporate crime, Sasha: Fiona's sister and fellow grifter, and Loader Bot: Pure awesomeness. Through 5 chapters, these unlikely (and unwilling) partners unravel the mystery of The Vault of the Traveller. (Or traveler if you're American). From the signature comic book styling to the extremely clever storyline, this is another classic creation by Telltale.  Pros: Great art design, Intricate storyline, Signature British-style Borderlands humour (Psychos included), Relevant choices with far-reaching effects (obviously, It's Telltale), No technical problems on my (relatively high end rig) laptop.  Cons: Like the other games you get a list of your choices at the end of each chapter, however to get all of them you have to go through the hassle of making a Telltale account.  General warnings: If you are not familiar with the Borderlands universe don't play this game, you will not understand it at all, If you do not have the sense of humour that you find skags being killed at opportunity funny, I advise you avoid this game as you would avoid Boris Johnson on LSD. (Unless you are familiar with British politics then that joke is cruising over your head).  All-in-all I highly recommend this game for the player that knows what they are getting into. It has everything a Borderlands/Telltale fan could want and more besides. If its on sale, you have no excuse.",

(Not to mention an excellent original score by Jared Emerson-Johnson, accompanied by absolutely deft use of soundtrack songs during key moments. So good.)  Even if you're not a serious Borderlands fan, 'Tales' weaves a compelling story that manages to blend and mash up all the best elements; from heist capers to road movies, treasure hunts to shootouts, and more, all capped by a pinch of romantic comedy (or comedic romance). My biggest complaints (aside from the usual occasional Telltale animation/3d jank) are the clumsiness of the keyboard controls. While the mouse control is fine (even preferred), there are several sequences that have you doing something that approximates classic point and click adventuring, and controlling where your character walks in a scene is clunky, to say the least. It's not impossible to deal with, by any means, but it does take you out of the game when your otherwise well-animated character spazzes across the room, driven only in cardinal directions. Hardly enough to knock it, however, and it remains my favorite Telltale game to date.",

The game does a pretty good job of advancing the Borderlands storyline. The two lead characters are both great, especially Fiona. The game also makes a great use of the existing characters from earlier Borderlands games. Out of the supporting cast, Sasha was really the only one I didn't really care for.  On the gameplay front Tales from the Borderlands is much less impressive. The gameplay is your usual Telltale fare, heavy on QTEs, light on any kind of compelling gameplay. At least the game does a decent job of providing you with an illusion of choice, even though it's fairly clear that most of your choices will only have minor consequences at best.  The game also suffers from some technical issues, including horrid mouse lag that forced me to play through this on a gamepad. I also encountered a few graphical glitches and some seriously bad animations.  Despite these faults, Tales from the Borderlands is worth playing through for the superb story. Recommended for any fans of Borderlands series or Telltale adventure games.  The good: - Great story and characters - Good use of existing Borderlands characters and lore - High quality voice acting - Great art style  The bad: - Weak gameplay mainly consisting of QTEs - Sasha is pretty annoying - Mouse controls are broken  The ugly: - Some graphical issues and wonky animations",

Knowing fully well that Borderlands is all about jokes and killing with little backstory, I still expected Telltale Games to create a very touching, emotional game in which the player has a lot of sympathy for the protagonist(s) just like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.  This is not the case in Tales From the Borderlands though. This game, a ¡Telltale Game!, actually made me laugh, instead of cry(due to their emotional games like The Walking Dead). The protagonists aren't as lovable as Lee/Clementine or Bigby, the story isn't as grasping as other Telltale masterpieces and the game doesn't play with your emotions while The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us did this all the time.  So, does this mean that this is a bad game? Does this mean that this game is not worth to be called a Telltale game?  I believe this game, though unusual when compared to recent Telltale games, should be seen as a masterpiece. Where this game lacks certain emotional and story traits, it completely makes up for it through humor and funny protagonists and characters. Besides, a Borderlands game without the jokes and violence wouldn't really be a Borderlands game.  There were numerous events in the game in which I laughed out loud and especially protagonist Rhys is a blast! I especially refer to the scene where Rhys blows the Vault Key seller's mind as one of the funniest scenes so far!  On a final note:   I do believe that The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us take first (TWD) and second place (TWAU), but Tales from the Borderlands should definitely be considered a great game. And who knows, maybe the game will prove me wrong. Second place may be up for grabs…",

I was shocked to find that scenes actually transitioned smoothly without any stuttering, this also includes actions made and when you pick your choice of dialogue (Which is a little sad honestly). Telltale managed to give actual character to the bandits and even the freaking Loaderbots! The bullet sponges you would normally shoot at in the main Borderland games!

The story was gripping from start to finish, playing as two interchanging characters from different backgrounds gave all of the environments from Borderlands a chance in the light. The story was accompanied by a variety of interesting (and fantastic) characters that you easily get invested in - whenever characters were in danger I physically wanted to make sure all of my 'friends' made it out alive. The game switched between slow-paced dialogue/exploring scenes and action sections frequently, with the exposition being constantly interesting and the action making you feel like a badass every time (my favourite scene is the beginning of episode 2, taking down the Hive). Telltale kept the perfect balance of humour and seriousness throughout, and keeping to true Borderlands themes kept the game 18+, the humour and the action is no holes barred. Moving on to my favourite aspect of this game, the sound design was especially exceptable - every episode I would be looking forwards to the next intro song, and they have all been added to my Spotify playlists.  Overall I believe this game to be Telltale's magnum opus so far, I honestly don't know how they will top it (though I do look forwards to being blown away yet again, as I was with this after the walking dead). If you're at all interested in Telltale or story-based games, give this a try; if you like the Borderlands games and don't mind a story focus, give this a try. I would honestly recommend this to anybody though.  It usually takes a lot to make me truly love a game, the only other game that did this was probably TWD S1, but anyway I give Tales from the Borderlands - 10/10.",

I finally caved and picked it up during a Steam sale and thought, since I've already spent the money, I'll give it a shot, which turned out to be a great decision. As expected, the action is minimal and exclusively limite to the quick time events, but there was never any question about wanting to finish the game and find out how the story ended.  It's difficult to call what TellTale creates 'games' as they are little more than an interactive graphic novel, peppered liberally with quick time events, but the quality of the story writing comes through in a big way. What you get with this game is another trip through the wastelands of Pandora with an interesting story populated by both likable and hateful characters, and thats enough for me. ",

If you have played any of the recent TellTale games than you know their format, which more or less is a visual novel with a few puzzles, rooms, and choices. This isn't to imply that they are bad, just that they have less interaction than most games. So if that sounds of that throws you off, than you should avoid this game, since no amount of charm or production value is going to win you over. With that said, Tales from the Borderlands is one of, if not the, best TellTale adventure games.  The reason for that is that the game has high production values (musical intros, good VO, and great recap sequences), good writing (funny dialogue, likeable characters, dramatic moments) and nice visuals (art, animation, and cut scenes). The game has so many things going for it, and only a few going against it.  The only thing that I personally dislike about the game was that it was overly positive. There is some lose and pain, but for the most part, everything works out for everybody. And that kind of undercuts the serious moments and ideas from the game.  Overall if you like TellTale adventure games, or point and click adventure games in general, then I think you should pick up this game. It has a few flaws, but nothing that ruin the experience.",

I never felt that my ideas of who the characters should be was at odds with the dialogue choices either, something very few story-driven games capture, and characters reacted in subtle, believable and often surprisingly considered ways. It has the sense of travel and time passing that few adventure games really capture too, and does so better than anything I've played since Grim Fandango.  The typical Telltale mechanics are all there but are subtly played with, better fit the story and very rarely feel intrusive. The choices you make throughout the game feel like they have a genuine impact on the relationships between the characters, and the way in which you have played the entire game shapes how the ending plays out. A combination of excellent writing and clever use of the mechanics make this the best implementation of the Telltale structure to date.  TL; DR: It feels like Borderlands and does Telltale better than the others, with a brilliant cast, great story and wonderful sense of adventure.",

The story was extremely good, the writing was amazing and the art style (duh) absolutely gorgeous.The ending was, even though it was a bit of a cliffhanger, quite satisfying!  Now, this was the first Telltale Games Series for me to play, but from what I heard, it´s apparently their best one. I can understand why. I´d give it a solid 9/10.",

            "review_text": "While different from all the borderlands games it was still a interesting part of the story. Was the first tell tale game I have played so it was a bit different for me.  BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS PROBLEMS first off the higher your screen resolution the laggier your mouse will become. This has nothing to do with how good your graphics card is or anything its just a problem with the game so if it causes issues drop the resolution done a bit and that should fix it (But seriously TTG this shouldn't even be a issue at all)  Second problem is I played this all in one sitting (granted it was a long 10 hr sitting but hey rainy day amusement) and right near the end of the 5th episode lines of dialogue where just plain missing. I won't say where just to make it spoiler free but since I played it all in one sitting without a single issue with the voices its safe to say my audio settings and everything was fine so its purely a problem with the games. Considering this game is pretty much completely based on dialogue and very little on game play I think its a pretty big problem.  And while making choices is fun and all its not really clear in what context you’re going to say something, Sometimes when the pair are together you’re not even sure whos going to be saying the part you just clicked. But that being said your choices really don't have a huge impact on the story.  Apparently its all cannon but I'm sure if they make BL3 they will explain a little of what happened. So I don't think there is any harm skipping this if its not your thing. But seriously that voice bug really ruined it for me, if that didn't happen I would probably be all praises. Shame there is only a yes or no recommendation. If you’re really into borderlands and cannot get enough of it then yeah get it. If its not a big thing for you then probably no loss skipping it",

            "review_text": "TL;DR We all knew TellTale could do drama, but it turns out they're just as good at comedy. This might be their best game to date.  For those of you that have time to spare:  Tales from the Borderlands is a story based (sort of action-adventure) game. If you played other TellTale titles, it's all the same, if you haven't, it centers around you controlling a character's dialog options to craft your own experience. More than anything else, it's an amazing comedy. TellTale always had a knack for drama and the fact that they chose to make something this lighthearted (and be this good at it) is more than surprising. TftB (or just Tales, however you prefer it) is a never-ending thrill ride, a mixture of parody, dark humor and witty one liners. It's everything you thought TellTale had up their sleeve and more.  In case you haven't played other Borderlands games (don't worry, I haven't either), the story is set on an alien planet: Pandora, where criminals, mercenaries and big corporations fight over information that will lead them to vaults: stashes of alien goods. That's all you to need to know. The game doesn't require prior knowledge of the Borderlands universe and does its best to fill you in on everything you need to know along the way.  So, our main characters are two corporate lackeys: Rhys and Vaughn, and conartist sisters: Fiona and Sasha. You as the player take turns controlling Rhys and Fiona. There's a bunch of side characters as well, but these four are the main protagonists. The plot revolves around them trying to find a vault (big surprise there). Along their journey, they encounter a number of obstacles and twist and turns that are bound to keep your face glued to the screen. That being said, the story does rely a lot on coincidences and sheer luck to keep the plot moving. It won't bother you much, since the game doesn't try much to make sense, but rather entertain the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.  The thing that'll really keep you involved are the charecters. Altough they'll continually make you laugh, they are more than just comic relief. They have their own fears and desires and you'll learn all about them. The sisters are on a path to escape their life of crime: Fiona weighing her worth among the frightening and often ruthless vault hunters and Sasha leaving the slums of Pandora behind to explore the rest of the world. Rhys pursues his dreams to become a corporate god, but quickly realizes how much that would cost him, and Vaughn is pushed out his comfort zone and finds out there's more to life (and himself) than he believed from the comfort of his accounting chair.  These charecters are what sells TftB. You'll care for them, you'll want them to succesed, you'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll feel sad when they fail. The performances only add to their relatability, as they are amazing (Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, Erin Yvette, go look up the rest if you're interested). The same stands for the rest of the cast.  Unfortanatily, there isn't much good I can say about the gameplay. Yes, this is a story based game, and yes, gameplay isn't the main focus, but it has to be judged just like the rest of it. There'a a decent variaty of dialog options that lead to a decent amount of different outcomes. I say decent, because this game won't provide you with a million different ways to change the world and you shouldn't expect it to. The variaty that's there is more than enough to make the experience feel personal and that's all it needs. Maybe it's just me, but I've found the time limits enforced on you to pick a dialog option encreasingly annoying. I know this is a standard TellTale thing, but I feel the game would have done just as well without them. I've frequently been pausing the game to examine the options before choosing and that just kills the flow.  Quick time events make most of the combat (I'm gonna resist my inner urges to preach just how evil QTEs are). The controls aren't too smooth, so it's easy to miss one and get a game over. Repeatinig them isn't fun at all and they soon becomes a hassle. Though, there are instances where they flatter the action scenes and let you feel like a total badass. As for the times you get to freely control your character, they are few and far between as well as short and constricted. The extra things you get to do in them (buying skins and getting new information on things) are only fun on your first playthrough. I get the feeling TellTale's been cutting them short with each new game and forcing the QTEs instead (which isn't an appeling direction to push your games towards).  The animation is the standard TellTale cartoonish look, but it fits TftB better than any of their other titles. The Borderlands series have a very similiar look, so TftB feels like a part of that universe without even trying. The style felt more natural here than any in other setting TellTale used it for. It suits the carefree attitude of the game. The character designs (and all other designs for that matter) are awesome.   I haven't payed much attention to the soundtrack that plays in the background, but the parts of it that deserve your attention are the opening sequences. TellTale got a bunch of licensed tracks for those and they're all awesome songs. They usually have good intros for their games, but the ones they did for Tales are just out of this world good. They pump you up for each episode and remind you just how cool this game is.  Overall, I'd says Tales is my favourite TellTale game. I might be biased because of how silly it is in contrast to the doom and gloom they usually serve, but it is one of their highligts none the less. It suffers from the same things all TellTale games do: the often tedios action scenes and general gameplay constrictions, but shines in almost every other aspect. Forget about the nonsensical parts of the plot, and what you have here is a rare gem amongs comedy games with awesome characters and a satisfying payoff. I would gladly give money for a sequal.",

Of course, knowing how the events played out would make the experience richer, enjoyment will not be restricted if you happened to never finish the game. It doesn't assume you know the events and if you do it gives you plenty of options to address them.   Despite the fact that Borderlands is a first person shooter game, Tales from the Borderlands is very much a Telltale game. Dialogue, quick time events, and point and click exploration of areas make up the bulk of gameplay but that doesn't mean the gameplay is always 'Slow' quick dialogue decisions and life or death scenarios can quickly get the blood pumping as quickly as running through an area blowing things up, in the main series, can.  The characters are charming scoundrels all with something to love and dislike about them. With Borderlands' trademark humor and telltale's practiced drama the episodes can have you laughing until you snort or feeling on the verge of tears.

The only way the end is effected is who you get to choose from for the final battle.   Nevertheless, I enjoyed it a lot. The story was interesting, but what really hooked me was the way characters interact and react to each other - just the right combination of humor and real emotion. I found the gore a bit off-putting, along with how most of the bosses died. Overall though, it was a lot of fun. I might play it again to experiment with different choices, but probably not more than once.  Tip: if you pick a new save slot at the start of each chapter, your choices from the chapter before are lost, and replaced with game-generated choices. If you want to keep your choices, you have to use the same save slot every time. You can't re-do your last choice, but you can reset to the start of any chapter.",

            "review_text": "I just finished the first episode last night. If you like Borderlands then you should like this one. It has the same art style, kind of on top of Telltales engine. It works pretty well. The writing is very reminiscent of Borderlands. It definitely feels canon to me. You play as two different people (at different times obv). One is a Hyperion corporate ladder climber who was supposed to get a promotion, but was overtaken somehow by an evil corporate stooge. So you get smashed back down to janitorial. Of course now he wants his revenge. Go down to Pandora to do some stuff and meet up with the second player character – a street con[wo]man. They are both smart in their own ways. The guy has an eye implant that can scan things, though I haven’t really come across much of a real purpose for it. The girl has a family in the thieving business. Her sister and an older mentor. You only play as the two, but the others are frequently there. There are many bandits and bad guys (including epic bosses, I think from BL2) mixed in. There are occasional appearances of Vault Hunters (so far just ZeR0). It’s clear that to them, you are just a minor sidecharacter that doesn’t at all matter. Which is pretty interesting seeing a vault hunter from that perspective. People don’t really like them.   Gameplay – it’s a typical Telltale game. It’s definitely more of a slightly interactive movie. You get the occasional dialogue choices, which really only change the story so much. There are occasional bits where you actually control the character, but they are generally pointless. There are quicktime events where you die and go game over if you fail. All the sorts of things every telltale game has, which I don’t mind, but it’s not for everyone. I’ve kind of played this as my cool down game, when I need to calm the brain before bed.   Guns (a very big part of any BL game) are all but missing. One of the sidecharacters has one. The main guy does not. The main girl has a one-shot derringer that you can choose to use or not in different situations. But the characters are not gung-ho shooters like Vault Hunters anyway, so it’s fine…I guess. Guns are a lot of fun in the BL universe.  ",

It's totally worth it's full price.   About structure and mechanics - It is typical Telltale game, you need to have 5 episodes, you need to have them all to know the whole story. About game mechanics - point and click. More like interactive movie than action game. But that doesnt change that you are always involved in action and decisions...  Yes! Theese decisions! Things aren't black and white on Pandora. You will get that to your mind... There are some decisions that really change the story, even the whole episode! You will have to finish the game three times or even more to know all the options!   Telltale did a great job making a Borlderlands world. So someone who have played BO or BO2 just have to buy this game. Counting easter-eggs and references is pretty imposible! Characters are memorable and you actually care about them... sometimes even to much ;)  You know game will be great when you get to menu, and you just listen to the theme :D. All over the time great music is with us. Visuals are also good, I love the drowed like style of Telltale.  After final... I were crying, couse' I ended one of the best games I have ever played, farewell with Rhys, Fiora, Sasha and Voughn, Loader bot and others were hard... I'm looking up for the next season, and if you haven't bought season one just do it now, you got my recommendation right from the heart! You won't regret this ;)",

The pacing throughout the episodes is consistent and very engaging. I can't recall there being any 'dull' moments. The dialogue and voice acting were enjoyable as well. Overall it's a great adventure/comedy game, and I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Good job, Telltale.",
