            "review_text": "UPDATE BELOW:  Here's what I originally said after playing the first chapter of The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 in Early Acces:  'Ah Germans, the greatest storytellers of the modern gaming industry. First Daedalic, now KING Art, I wonder what would they bring us in the future when they already gave us the most amazing modern adventure games in recent years ?  I didn't play the first The Book of Unwritten Tales, but I did play another adventure game from KING Art - The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief. While the game had good story, great gameplay and somewhat likeable characters, it also had horrendous camera, awful facial expressions and mostly terrible voice acting. Luckily, The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 doesn't suffer from technical issues (besides bugs, ya' know, Early Access) and moreover, the game is already perfect.  The story can be described in two words: MIND-BLOWN. At first, I thought it was just a typical tale about a princess, a gnome and a generic dude with beard who's destined to save the world blah blah... but I was wrong. TBoUT2 is more than that. It's full of witty, funny jokes and pop culture references. You can easily find something related to Harry Potter, Batman or Game of Thrones throughout the story and of course they're not misplaced at all. You will love the characters, no matter how they look and what they do. You will laugh until you fall of a chair, a lot. You will drop your jaws because of how beautiful the world is. You will scream 'I WANT MORE!!!' after the chapter ends. However, I'm still a little bit disappointed with the ending, as many subplots are still unexplained and the game kinda ends on a cliffhanger.  You want me to tell more about the game ? I'd like to but I can't. Experience the game by yourself. Even in 30 minutes, 1 hour or 6 hours, you won't regret visiting the wonderful world of The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.  Now, are you ready for a new adventure ?'  And it's been nearly a year after the game came out, and my point still stands that it's one of the best adventure games of 2015, standing on the same line of Grim Fandango Remastered, Tales from the Borderlands and STASIS. A title full of energy filled with remarkable writing and memorable characters, and you just simply won't find any fantasy point-n-click game with this kind of production value in this day and age.  My only complaint is the ending, the game ended so abruptly on a cliffhanger and a lot of sub-plots weren't dealt with. It seems like Book 3 is definitely happening and the story will truly end. That said, the ending isn't so bad that makes the game pointless, the thing that matters most is the journey itself and Book 2 did it fantastically.",

            "review_text": "The greatest old-school adventure game of all times?  Close, but that is still actually a pretty legitimate statement for The Book of Unwritten Tales 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the tremendous The Book of Unwritten Tales 1, a point-and-click adventure game set in a fantasy world. What is even more surprising is the fact that certain parts of the game alone put so many classics and modern games of its genre to shame. It is hard to believe that after so many years such a gem can still be created. A gem with some flaws though.  Firstly, the Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is without any doubt the best looking point-and-click adventure game to date. An improvement from the original’s already colourful aesthetic, it can be clearly seen that KING Art pushed the visual fidelity with this game. The way the 3D camera and objects orientate around the characters gives such a pleasant ocular effect to the environments. The backgrounds are mesmerising and better than ever, packed with so many tiny details. The character models are also superior than in the original game; Ivo and Nate, two of the protagonists of the series, have received excellent character redesigns which feel both mature and a bit less cartoony (in a good way). And of course, let’s not forget Wilbur's (the main protagonist) new mage outfit which I personally dig. Visually, KING Art just outdone themselves, but that is not to say that they cannot go even further than this. Additionally, the soundtrack has the right vibe for a fantasy setting, especially with its memorable theme tune. The English voice acting is once again strong, but if there is one criticism about it is the fact that during certain situations some of the spoken dialogues lack urgency -- like if you are falling to your death and you do not feel like screaming out your dialogues.  The humour is back, and it would not be The Book of Unwritten Tales without mocking and making funny references to tropes, movies, TV shows and video games. Once again, there are plenty of moments of laughter to be had. When it comes to parodying pop-culture and paying homage to the classics, this franchise does it best. It is truly the spiritual successor of Monkey Island when it comes to comedy.  The puzzles in the game have the right balance between easy and hard, but for comparison, the difficulty got bumped up a notch compared to the original game. As a result for those who thought it was a bit too easy in the first game, then the good news is that in this sequel they are a bit more challenging, especially in some areas. While the brilliant character-switch mechanic is back, it does sadly feel underused here. Personally, I really wish there were more puzzles involving all the characters working together than the game has to offer. There are few puzzles which require some backtracking that may ultimately cause some pacing issues with the story around the middle. Nonetheless, it is good to see that at least all the puzzles are logical and, more importantly, fun to solve.  Unlike the original game’s story which was more or less The Lord of the Rings in a nutshell with its own distinct flair, this time around it is a lot less on that epic scale of good versus evil. And no more encounters with (new) dragons, orcs, goblins and taurens (spotted the WoW reference yet?). In a way it feels more intimate, especially with Ivo and Nate’s relationship, with more time dedicated to character development instead. Of course, the whole 'a new evil force is slowly growing in the world of Aventasia in secrecy and our heroes have to prevent it before it is too late' is still present. As a whole, the story is solid and on par with the original, with enough plot twists to keep you engaged for what is a very lengthy adventure game. On the other hand, it could have been enhanced by introducing a lot more new interesting characters since the game seems to oddly do the complete opposite by bringing almost the entire cast from the original game – which is great to see all the old faces - but it does not have the same spark the second time around. Though, that is not to say that the new few characters are not appealing; for instance, the owner of the adventure shop is actually a pretty cool character. But then you have characters like Miss Kiki who just feel a bit out of place and Bennie, the genie, who feels like such a missed opportunity and only gets about five minutes of screen time. If there is an area where The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 kind of falls flat on its face is in the heavy reliance on the old supporting cast (including revelation of the main antagonist) to drive what is a solid fantasy plot -- almost as if the game wanted to play it safe, take no risks. So in that regard the first game still has better, more memorable moments than in this sequel only because of its novelty. Evidently, there are a handful of moments which are also brilliant in this sequel too.  However, the developers have done it once again with yet another rushed cliffhanger at the end which left more questions unanswered while making you scratch your head until you cut your scalp. It is hard to comprehend how they could replicate the same annoyance found in the original’s ending in here as well. The ending is clearly left opened for another sequel, but the last five minutes feel very rushed. It is almost impossible not to feel like the ending ruined some of the experience, which it did for me to an extent. 'Wait what?', 'But how?', 'Urghmm' and 'That was it?' will be the common phrases running through your mind when the credits start to roll.   In conclusion, The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is the best point-and-click adventure game that there is in this day and age, even with its few issues. While it does not reinvent the wheel and is not perfect the way I maybe wanted it to be prior purchase, it did enough to proudly earn its place amongst the greats such as Monkey Island, Longest Journey, King’s Quest and many others in my book. I cannot think of a better and more fun game of this genre from the past decade than this, with the exception of maybe the original game. Great characters, interesting plot, best visuals for this kind of game, hilarious conversations and the list goes on. You cannot go wrong with this game if you are a fan of old-school adeventure games. Whoever makes such games nowadays must learn and take notes from this series, except on how to make endings. I only wish the ending was more cohesive and not so rushed. That is something which this series still needs work, pronto.  Bring on The Book of Unwritten Tales 3.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game. One of the best adventure games all time. I've played every King's Quest (5-8 i play at least once a year), grim fandango, longest journey, etc. And this one ranks among them. Easily. The muscial score is outstanding. The voice acting is excellent. It doesn't take itself too seriously and its puzzles are logical (no sierra logic, which the critter chronicles had a lot of (getting the penguin drunk?).   I never got too stuck in the game. Each puzzle can be thought through logically. Maybe I'm a sadist, but this was my only complaint about the game is that it might have been TOO easy.  Overall, if you've liked any of the great adventure games I listed above. You will enjoy this. And you'll have a few laughs to boot.",

            "review_text": "Pretty much everything about this game is superb: the characters (most of which are from TBOUT), the dialogues and voice overs, the visuals and locations, the puzzles and how they are tied in with the story.  I especially liked how in mere 15 minutes the game manages to pay tribute to the old adventure games, Back to the Future, and The Big Bang Theory (directly quoting Sheldon Cooper in the last case). And it doesn't stop at that, being funny and inventive for the whole 20+ hours.   Alas, for such a long game the ending feels rushed and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Obviously, King Art has plans for TBOUT 3, but that's still not an excuse for a cliffhanger plus a lot of plot holes.  Anyway, this is still one of the best contemporary adventure games along with Deponia trilogy and Sherlock Holmes series. A must buy for any fan of point-and-click adventures. The best thing is, you can play with your kids. Yes, they won't probably understand all the puns and references, but it's still a great family game.  9/10",

I don't normally write reviews for games but that is not because i don't feel the games aren't good enough, its just that i didn't feel the urge to express my complete love and awe for them as i do for this MASTERPIECE of a game!! You guys have created a pure gem of a game (and series) and i simply can't get enough of it. I just love everything about this game. Its perfect in every single way. You guys have taken the point and click genre to a whole new level. You have taken the traditional gameplay formula and unravelled it and have polished it up with the most up to date references of other games, movies, books,etc and such a perfect sense of humour from juicy biting satire to the most ridiculous hilarious jokes and anecdotes etc.. I constantly have to go back and save moments in game to shoe my family as the comedy is priceless and so hard to replicate and produce in this era. Seriously guys you know what you are doing and I just pray and hope that the Book of Unwritten Tales series continues. Please don't stop what you are doing, you guys are perfect and keep this genre alive and kicking!!!! I LOVED THIS GAME and recommend any adventure lover with a sense of humour to try it out!!!! If you grew up with Monkey Island then this is your next step!",

The tasks you have to perform don't seem as well thought out as they were in the first game. There's also at least one bug where if you combine objects in a certain way, you can't finish the game unless you go back to a saved point before you combined those objects. But then you have to replay a chunk of the game that you had already done, possibly following walkthroughs to avoid any other bugs, which makes the game just a boring exercise.   That doesn't take away from the first game in the series, which is still a great game on its own.",
