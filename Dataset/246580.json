I am not sure if this game is something that could teach you how to type fast since it seems more like a testament to how fast you can already type because of previous courses you took or just pure experience. If you want to get this game on the whole idea of learning to type you might want to play this in sessions like 30 minutes to 1 hour a day and not overplay it so that it has more long term value and feels less reptitive to you. If your a keyboard warrior and just want to enjoy mowing down zombies with your skills then why not?   You never know though, I am sure this has helped some people out.",

            "review_text": " The Typing of The Dead:Overkill   The Typing of The Dead series, probably the only games to have 'Typing' 'Educational' and 'Zombies' in the one sentence.   PROS   + For the Keyboard Warrior  Everyone loves a good typing/educational game right? no? Well not everyone is a huge fan of educational games. But this game puts a video game cliche on it and makes it about killing zombies! You love killing zombies don't you?  Even if you're not a huge fan of a zombie game this one can certainly improve your speed AND accuracy as a typer, trust me, nothing gets your fingers typing faster if a zombie is running towards you.  As one of my friends said 'If you can type fast, you'll love this game'  + T-the story?  Why, why did I care for the story? This game is basically a mod of House of The Dead but instead you use your keyboard to kill the zombies. But for some reason, I really enjoyed the characters and how they reacted with eachother.  + Not a fan of the typing aspect? No problem!  I only tried for the first level of this because I only really bought this game for the typing, but if you don't enjoy the typing aspect you can always try out the PS3 port of House of The Dead where it becomes an on-rails shooter instead.   CONS   - Short, Like. Really short.  So this game has a total average playtime of 4 hours with 7 hours if you're a completionist. That's not that great, while I did enjoy the short and sweet storyline, that doesn't mean I don't want more action. Even so, you can team up with a friend for multiplayer or try out the minigames.  - Somewhat, easy.  So I suck at Video Games and according to my friend, I even suck at typing. but even at the normal difficulty I was able to plow through zombie with easy. I guess that's why hardcore mode exists. (Seriously though, hardcore mode 2hard4me.)  - Broken mechanics?  As I was playing I started to notice quite a few bugs. for one theres a lot of the sound effects and dialogue being cut for no reason, it wasn't even in the middle of a cutscene. Also I noticed while typing to kill you didn't actually need to press the space key when it was two words, I looked over it and still pressed space but that does feel a bit cheap.   Final Notes and Score   -This is probably one of the best typing games out there so if you're looking to improve and have some fun, I suggest purchasing this.  -I haven't tried it, but the DLC looks interesting aswell, making you type like Shakespeare should up the difficulty right?  -If you find this game great, I suggest looking into the older Typing of The Dead series, there really good and even harder.  -Before you go, I leave you with   this masterpiece     Final Score: 9   SPOILERS AHEAD  -  I found the last boss great, I wish they had more gimmicks like that in more of the boss fights    -  Why did Varla need to die ;_;    -  Clements a Mother-lover  ",

This is the game that makes me wonder, 'why don't we have more typing-style games?' It should be a whole genre. Seriously, the typing part of the game is challenging and fun. Plus, for the price of one game, you actually get two, because it comes loaded with House of the Dead Overkill as well (it's the mouse-based version of Typing of the Dead). If you missed this game the first time around, now's the time to check out the foulest, most violent, and most gruesome shooter game of them all. Grindhouse fans, this is for you.",

Pros Amazing compelling story voice acting well done blood splatter cheesy acting  Educational use with your keyboard Immersive Gameplay  Cons bugs in which when shooting an object it doesnt pick up sometimes  Note: In my opinion this is a great education game for kids, due to now a days kids find it hard to type while not looking. With this game kids can finally actually learn stuff and have fun instead of learning something and being bored. This is a great game but if your trying to get your 7-10 year old kid to learn this type of stuff i would recommend it, only downfall would be tons vulgar language in game so if bad language isnt on your book for your kid to learn stuff i would recommend downloading or getting the orignal typing of the dead",

The cutscenes in the original TOTD weren't supposed to be funny. Overkill clearly is, but the contrast between the allegedly serious (if badly executed) House of the Dead 2 and killing them with keyboards is funnier than when the game is already trying to be funny.  2. Far more crucially, in the original TOTD, the words were completely random. In Overkill, the words seem to be joing about the circumstances. Early playthroughs of the first level would give lots of words about horror movies. The boss characters even less random. I failed against a mutated cheerleader boss. Starting the battle again, I was getting the same words, all cracks at the mutant cheerleader's weight. I personally think the massive library of phrases the original would dispense randomly was far funnier and less boring to play.  These probably sound like nitpicks, but they sapped my enjoyment of the game. I'm sure I'll go back to it someday and play it to completion, because I love typing games. But I can't really recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Good but not great  Its a fun niche game with a ridiculous (in a good way) story. Typing out 'okey dokey doctor jones' while fending of a horde of zombies is a great feeling. However I must compare this to the previous Typing of the dead game.  Much of the uniqueness of the first game are not present here.   The boss fights are poorly suited for typing in this game.   Gone are the sentence drills or answer a question fights of the first game. The boss fights are not much different from the regular zombies of just typing the word(s) before they attack. Another problem I feel with the game is that   it is too easy . Disclaimer: only ran through once on normal mode. Throughout the game the difficulty between levels was not noticable. On the last level I was still getting words that were 5 characters long. Maybe there were some marginally longer sentences to type out but i would not say it was significant increase in difficulty. Compared to the first game, the difficulty was very noticable with some zombies having very long words to type out. Also in the first game, when you die the difficulty changes dynamically.  The difficulty in this game is not dynamic compared to the first. The game also has some general buggy-ness . I had to restart once because when I finished typing out a zombies string, it disappered yet the zombie was still there rendering it impossible to me to beat him. Also the audio cut out many times when I had to face rage zombies. Probably the biggest knock I have for the game is that I came across   repeated phrases in a single level   (occured multiple times). I have never seen this happen in the previous game but there should be no reason I see the phrase Killing Twins twice in one level.   This too happened with the DLC I bought  . I believe the dlc is much much smaller than i expected it to be.  As many problems the game has, it just dumb and fun. Not many other games you can type and kill zombies. Buy it when it goes on sale. Or torrent the superior previous one. I highly recommend the latter.",

Luckily though, the story is humorous, cheesy, and rather compelling for some reason. While it can be quite crude and rather silly, it is probably worth the laugh. The mechanics are simple, however it can be challenging given that you can type only a wee bit faster than a turtle can walk. Everybody is bound to have some sort of fun with this title! Really though, name a person who doesn't want to write a novel in order to kill a zombie, err, mutant. The graphics have improved a bit from the Wii port of House of the Dead: Overkill, which by the way is included in this purchase. The mechanics for that, however, are odd considering that you do not have a motion controller and must point and click to shoot. It's definitely a decent buy for fans of the series, and is definitely worth buying, but if you'd rather have a gun in hand and shoot your CRT television set with lasers, I would recommend playing the original few games.

To many times you will start typing a word for who you think will attack next only to be completly wrong and have a different zombie attack. There should be some kind of numerical or color code as to what will attack you next so you can apply a priority. I also felt a words were often nonsensical. I feel more could have been done to apply clever puns or more interesting phrases to contribute more to the theme.  The graphics are pretty horrible. Its like they didn't try to hard or thought that the cheesy b movie theme could carry it. The movie grain effects often get in the way and cause some eye strain when played for to long.  The story is pretty bad even by B movie standards. Its is uninteresting, non funny, and depends on scraping the bottom of the barrel.  The boss fights are more interesting than most of the game but still leave a lot to be desiered. The later bosses feel more luck based than anything else.

Updates to HoTD include a bolted-on (and somewhat irrelevant) unlock/levelling system, a new story and characters, and a multicolored galaxy of funny and grotesque new assets. I would have liked fewer, more significant, unlockables and more variety in the typing mechanics of the boss fights, but the deliberately silly story and dialogue worked for me. Likewise, the gross-out visuals and overall aesthetic, which is remarkably consistent and well-executed throughout. Shooting on rails may feel flat to some, but here the level design seldom misses a trick and the colorful remake injects a lot of verve. Add to that the surprisingly effective typing mechanic (my touch-typing skills have definitely improved) and you have a unique gem of a game.",

Although there are many other games that require a lot of typing, this has a lot of variety. The enemies are different, and this would be from typing a letter within milliseconds, or a single a word within a second. They have zom... MUTANTS that will rush at you and explode vomit, small animals like mutant birds or monkeys (they vary which mission you play, but they kinda have the same properties), and a couple more. You just don't type a sentence within a time period, you have to choose which mutant you want to type first, as they will throw things at you, while the others attack you. If you type 57-60 WPM without errors, you will be fine, but there are opportunities for extra damage in boss battles for those who type a couple million words per second. The level design (well doesn't matter since it's a railshooter), is pretty as each level takes you into a completely different place, as the setting fits each level fine (The train level is really cool.) It even contains the full 'House of the Dead: Director's Cut' from the PS3 version, so you can mouse click all you want. The graphics are meh, as animation is sloppy (although the executions are satisfying), the lip-syncing is not good, some textures are blurry, and Washington's bald head doesn't have enough polygons. It's good enough, as the lighting (in my opinion) is very nice. It's optimized, as I get over 60FPS in 1080p (with a GTX550Ti), so you should be able to run it on a crappy computer. The cutscenes has a lot of film grain/texture, a narrator with a cool voice, and the story resembles a movie-like plot. The game is hilarious, ♥♥♥♥ING FILLED WITH PROFANITY (NO JOKE), and the main two characters are likeable (but some are just really flat and don't have much to them). The dialogue is really odd sometimes (not the cursing), but it might be just me. It's has a lot of laughs, has some horror here and there (great maps), and overall a great buy for 20 dollars (although I got it for 6 on the humble bundle, which was a steal.)

I've always kind of enjoyed typing games, and while I don't think this game has much merit in teaching you how to type properly, it's a fun game with an interesting sense of humor.  There's not too much to talk about with the gameplay. You type as quickly as possible, using Tab to pick up secrets and power-ups. What's more interesting to discuss with this game is how it's presented: as an old, low-budget horror movie. It tries very hard to be as cheesy as possible. Sometimes the phrases you type relate to the level you're playing, which gets pretty funny in the strip club level. This game is a bit lewd at times, and the swearing is excessive... not saying that's a bad thing, but it's something you should know going in to it.  Typing of the Dead: Overkill also includes House of the Dead: Overkill. The story is the same, but you play a standard rail shooter with normal controls instead of typing. I like switching between the two, just to change things up. House of the Dead is a little older, but as far as I know, this the only way to play the game on PC.  If a rail shooter or typing game sounds fun to you, then this would be a good game to pick up. There's a lot of content in this game, so at $20, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Rail shooters and typing games aren't for everyone, and this game probably won't win you over to the genre (unless the movie aesthetic really appeals to you, I guess), but I've had a lot of fun with it so far, and I plan to keep playing it for a little while.

            "review_text": "' Suffer, like G did? ' --The House Of The Dead 2   OVERALL:  Sega and Modern Dream did a really good job with The Typing Of The Dead: Overkill! From a style standpoint the game is a convincing and loving homage to grindhouse flicks and video nasties that left me laughing. Looking at the technical end, the port runs smoothly even on a mobile i3 with integrated video, and the developers have paid particular attention to the control scheme.  The Typing Of The Dead: Overkill is a prequel to the rest of Sega's lightgun horror(?) series, and it's a very well-made one at that! The series' hallmark corny writing and amazing soundtracks are there as usual, but everything is much more deliberately integrated: In something of a contrast to the rest of the series' style, the homages to classic grindhouse films and B-movies are more obvious and lavish amounts of effort have been put into making the game really seem like something one might see featured along with other modern homages to the genre like Planet Terror or Machete. As a bit of a movie fan, this is a detail I really liked!  Moving on, I mentioned some ingenuity with the control scheme. Though Overkill did not get an arcade release like the rest of the series, the core gameplay is still very much in the vein of Overkill's lightgun-based precursors. This integrated logically enough with the Wii's wiimote and the PS3's sensors, but how does one adapt a game like this for a platform with no good analogue for lightgun controls? Sega opted to simply cut the gordian knot here and change the game to a typing-themed edutainment game! Don't be fooled, though; This is far more entertaining of a typing game than  Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing  or  JumpStart Racer . You'll find yourself blowing away scads of undead abominations by typing out a variety of amusingly absurd phrases. This is a time-tested approach on Sega's part: PC versions of previous House Of The Dead games were handled in a similar manner, though it seems like the boss fights were implemented in a more varied way with past releases.  For those who would rather not fight their way to victory through stenanography, a mouse-and-keyboard based mode that foregoes the typing in favor of more lightgun-ish gameplay is still there. as of my writing this review, though, I have not been able to take that mode for a spin yet.",

            "review_text": "Holy ♥♥♥♥ I love this game.  Ok ok, remember when you were a kid and you went to the arcade and decided to pick up one of those guns and play one of those game? Well, this game works almost exactly the same except instead of actually aiming and shooting like a peasant, you succumb to the master race and use a keyboard to masterfully press keys in succession to murder zombies.   Sure, that doesn't sound particularly entertaining. I mean, who really wants to type an essay when playing a game, right? Not to worry, the game has hilarious over-acting and voice overs. The pacing of the game is varied enough to keep you on your toes all the time. You don't really know when 30 zombies are suddenly going to be around that corner.   The pressure to not make any mistakes is big in this game, as exemplified by the combo meter. For each word/phrase that you don't butcher, you get either a silver or gold bullet in your top right barrel-thing (that's the technical term). The more of those bullets you get in succession, the higher your combo reward is. This prevents people from just rolling their heads on their keyboards until enough letters are thrown out to form the word on accident. I mean, sure, you can still do that, but don't. If you do, you're a moron... Unless you do it systematically with your nose or something. If you can do that, props to you.  Anyway, the only major gripes I had with this game were: I found myself mashing TAB all the time because I wanted to pick up all the things. I'm a completionist and bottles are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because I don't have large backspace key (Who makes mistaeks?) so that made that difficult to cancel out of a word to hit the bottle before I took damage. But aside from that, the game is excellent. It will also encourage people to learn to type without looking at the keyboard, which is an essential skill for anybody ever, especially anyone reading this because they're using a computer. So go out and buy this game. It's on sale as of the time of posting this... I think. EVEN IF IT WASN'T, YOU SHOULD STILL TOTALLY PICK IT UP, IT'S GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.",

Unlike the main games, though, this one comes packed with plenty of swearing (do not say I did not warn you).  The few complaints I have about this game is the multiplayer. I wish there was a local setting so I could plug in another keyboard. A few more include enemies glitching into scenes and enemies having no words, making them invincible. Last but not least, I have some issues with no words appearing right before a enemy/boss attacked. This gave me no chance in getting in a hit, and i would have to wait until I got hit.  Other than those downsides, I believe most of the glitches happen if you play on Hardcore mode. Just play the game normally and you will have a blast!",

            "review_text": "Typing of the Dead: OVERKILL is one of my dream games. The surprise release of this almost made me scream my pants. I loved the original 'OVERKILL' when it was on the Wii. After finishing that one, I wished SEGA would revisit it with the typing tutor treatment, like they did with their oddball 'Typing of the Dead.' For a game filled with profanity and lulz, it just cried for it. I very happy they did.  Providing your typing skills are up to par and you have a desktop to run it (This game HATES laptops) it's as fun as the original. For the port of the original OVERKILL, the mouse doesn't always substitue well for a light gun and the cutscenes animations aren't always stellar. (Mouths move up and down like hand-puppets; animation and dialouge isn't always synced.) The menus could've been redesigned for PC in mind, especially the 'Memorabilia' screens, which are tedious to browse through.   Don't get me wrong, this is still a fun game. For being a rail-shooter on the PC, it's ported decently. I'd much prefer a light gun, but I see OVERKILL as a proof of concept: that you can port an arcade-style shooter to the PC. In that regard, I'd love to see childhood favorites like Time Crisis 2 and CarnEVIL make the jump.  Ah, but we're here for the 'Typing' aspect of the game: why would they even bother if that wasn't the case? Well, if you've played the classic 'Typing of the Dead' you know what you're getting into; this time, though, no skimping on the gore and no in-mission challenges.   As a person who needs to look at the keyboard, and also having studied a freind with mad typing skills, I can assure you that the typing portions are well-executed, though may be unfair during the boss battles and any instance where you have to juggle zombie killing with shooting projectiles. Some of the boss battles can also be unfair; like the Screamer in Ballistic Trauma, who at one point hides behind zombies and is unable to attack until they are all dispatched. (In contrast, in the regular mode, you can just Handcannon her to death.)   Your milage may vary on the record-breaking F-Bombs, crude humor, and the comically offensive scenarios and characters, but you need to remember that they're going for the faux-sploitation style (See 'Planet Terror', 'Machete') and in that regard it's well-executed; wonderfully over-the-top. Exploitation/Trash film geeks should look out for nods to the classics. ('I don't try anything, I just do it!')   I like to end with a note to those who ported this to the PC: it should've been better optimized for the common laptop. This game is a few years older than some newer SEGA titles, which have run decently for me in the past. Failing to get this to work on my laptop almost pushed me to demand a refund. If OVERKILL can be ported for Android phones without much problem (albeit the trims), there's hardly an excuse for someone to have to use duct tape and user suggestions to get it to work.  All-and-all, despite the laptop issues and porting hiccups, highly recommended.",
