            "review_text": "It's been a while since I played a game that's this lovingly crafted and that felt like it came from such a strong emotional space that exudes throughout the entire journey. Brothers is a game that deals with many different themes, some fantastical in nature, and tackles them head on and with a touch of nuance. It's also a very charming game that overcomes any technical limitation through great art direction.  Its basic concept of controlling the older brother on the left analog stick and the younger brother on the right is one that may turn off some at first but truly comes into its own as the game progresses with a thematic payoff unlike anything I've ever seen in a game before. Brothers also has excellent pacing that carries over into its puzzles. They are simple yet I never felt like they were braindead easy. They're always fresh in some way and play off of mechanics I learned before without ever showing a tutorial on screen outside of the beginning chapter.  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was an excellently developed puzzle platformer that wasn't afraid to go to some dark places but also knew when to highlight a truly joyous moment. And this was all through gameplay. These special moments or sections were rarely shown through cutscenes only. It wants you to experience these parts through gameplay as much as possible, and it very much succeeds at that. But it's a climactic moment near the end that truly brings that idea home. A moment so brilliant and emotionally resonant to me that it'd be a shame if people missed out on this because we're on the cusp of a new console generation transition. Don't pass this game up. It begs to be played.",

            "review_text": "I don't know what should I tell about this game that wasn't already told. You control the two brothers with a controller's two bumpers, or with wasd + arrows. Despite the game states that it requires a controller to play, it actually works fine with keyboard. The game is just wonderful, and keeps you at the edge of the seat - there's only a few sections where timing counts, most of the time you can keep your own pace, but as you'll pass hills, caverns, mountains there's always something to concentrate on. Most of the time it's the brand new ideas the game presents - the store's screenshots are from the game's first (maybe) 2 chapters, most of the game's content is pretty different and presents you with new experiences. You always have to pay attention to the movement if you're playing alone, but it's not overbearing, and it doesn't require pinpoint accuracy. The biggest challenge of the game is to not to mix up your two hands and which one controls witch brother :) While all you have is direction keys and an action button, this game is nowhere near an average walking simulator. The landscape goes though incredible changes as you progress, and you have various means of transportation that are both unique and makes excellent use of the game's control scheme. This game is a beautiful, albeit short journey which in turn has absolutely minimal downtime. It's a great purchase or it makes an excellent gift for anyone who's willing to try out the game's controls and loves traditional tales, as the game takes place in a similar world. The game contains darker tones, it's not really a kid-friendly game - the Teen rating is fitting in my opinion.",

            "review_text": " Brothers  is a deceptively simple puzzle platformer that has quite a bit going on under the covers. Its story is told almost entirely wordlessly, with a lot of little side excursions that paint a world of fairytales that is actually quite dark. Don't let the bright graphics and cartoony characters fool you -- while there are some funny and uplifting moments, this is not a feel good game. It's not deliberately out to depress you either, but it's more brothers Grimm than brothers Warner. I'm not saying you shouldn't let your kids play it, but I am saying you may want to look over their shoulder if they do.  Believe it or not, this is the game I bought a controller for. I borrowed one to see if the game was any good (it was) and then I completed it after buying one for myself. It's not easy to convince a hardcore mouse and keyboard guy to twiddle the sticks, so it deserves credit at least for that. It deserves some more credit for possibly being the very first game to use its control scheme to evoke an emotional response. I can't get into details (spoilers!) but you'll know it when you get there. It's beautifully done, and you'd need to have a heart of stone not to be at least a little bit affected. If you remember 'press F to pay respects', this is pretty much the exact opposite of that.  The gameplay is just about right. It's not very challenging, but it's not a cakewalk between cutscenes either. The game does make the most of its controls, and coordinating two characters requires your full attention. Liberal use of checkpoints means you're not likely to get frustrated from having to replay bits, though. If the game was much longer the mechanics might wear thin, but its length works to its advantage here. My only gripe, if I can have one, is that one or two achievements are almost impossible to obtain without a guide, not because they require skill but because they require some very unintuitive actions. Still, this in no way detracts from the experience on your first playthrough, and the game allows you to replay chapters at will, so those who want the achievements can get them easily enough.  Whether you want to pay the full $15 for 4-5 hours of game is up to you, but even if you want to wait for a sale (or another bundle), this deserves to be in your library at some point or another. Two thumbs up, one big and one little.",

            "review_text": "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is nothing short of fantastic. The player controls both characters, where the player goes on an epic journey across all kinds different landscapes just to find a certain important object, which can save a certain someone. I don't want to give too much away b/c this game is absolutely epic, personal, and moving.   Brothers: ATOTS is basically a cross b/t a platformer, puzzle-game, and adventure game (like say a very-linear Tomb Raider game made before TR 2013) - but, there is absolutely no combat here what-so-ever. Brothers feels like it is something straight out of a classic fairy-tale or fable, drenched with tons of personality in its art direction &amp; art design. It's nothing short of wonderful, with its excellent story-book look and feel. This couldn't have been done any better.  Most things here are not said to the player via dialogue or any sort of narration, they are shown to the player. There is no English dialogue - everything here is spoken in a language that sounds like its right out of The Sims' own Sim-language of gibberish. You come to conclusions, based on what you see on screen and how things are laid out and presented to you. Everything is meticulously placed, from the environments to characters - and a lot can be inferred given just how an area is laid out, how a character is placed, and whatnot. This kind of subtlety does remind me of how sometimes Dark Souls tells stories for namely those who are really playing attention, without even cracking one word of dialogue at times - except, this game never cracks one word of dialogue.   When played with a X360 controller (which is how I played this game), the player controls one brother w/ the left stick + interact w/ object w/ one of the left triggers, while the other brothers is controlled w/ the right stick + one of the right triggers. Nothing else I can think of feels like this, gameplay-wise. This feels extremely unique, in which you are basically playing a Co-Op style game...basically all by your lonesome self. It's genius and absolutely brilliant. You will need to control each brother at the right time sometimes; simultaneously sometimes (which can be confusing at first, and then joyous and awesome once you get the feel down correctly and execute a set-piece correctly); or do things in a certain manner to advance further in the game and story.   All of the set pieces here are fantastic and extremely well put together. From every story set-piece to every gameplay set-piece, everything is put together in such a manner in which it's integrated extremely well with each other. Each brother has their own advantages and disadvantages - one brother is much taller + stronger, while the other brother is smaller + skinnier. This can help lead players on how to figure out what to do in certain situations + encounters. Maybe the big brother needs to give the little brother a boost, so they can reach a ledge. Maybe the younger brother can squeeze through bars that his bigger brother can't get between. Thankfully, the puzzles aren't hard, obscure, or ridiculous - but the player likely will have a bunch of 'Aha!' moments, once the players realize how to make the brothers work together in the correct context and manner. Everything (difficulty-wise) is, as Goldilocks would say, 'just right.'  While it likely won't take players likely very long to finish, Brothers is an absolutely unforgettable journey that must be experienced. Players will be moved by this fantastic experience, once it reaches its jaw-dropping conclusion. Taking my time, it took me somewhere around 4-5 hours to finish. It is a delightful experience, every single solitary step of the way. This game should be experienced by every gamer and should not be missed. This story-book, fairytale-like, and fable-like experience here is brought to life absolutely beautifully.  Grade: A.",

It is a simple and soon game, it will end soon but the emotions taht it offers are from an other place.. I had long time to play such an excellent game. Ofc some tiems it lucks into some controls or graphice, you cannot make it run 1080p HD but itt looks so pretty and smooth.   I got it on sales, so i didn't pay much, which made me enjoy it even more! I would recommend it to all of you to try it, it is a sweet and nice game",

            "review_text": "A clear 2013 Game of the Year candidate, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a third person puzzle game that gets absolutely everything right. The story is a simple one - your father needs help desperately, and you have to go find it. Throughout the journey you'll feel many emotions as you quickly grow attached to the brothers. This attachment is due to the fact that you control both brothers at the same time and you need to have them work together to fight through adversity and move on in your journey. The lack of lengthy cut-scenes and a made-up language were interesting choices that also worked 100% with this game. It makes you become even more involved, not just sit back and watch a movie play out in a game.  Graphics-wise, it's visually beautiful without the need of heavy tweaking. The game environment immerses you to its fantasy world instantly. Houses, farms, towns, cliffs, castles, mines, caves, water... all the environments are well-made and polished. The way you get to interact with animals in particular was phenomenal in my opinion. A lot of small interactions with people, items, and animals are not necessary to move on in your journey, but they add fun and depth to the game experience and gets you even more immersed.  It's recommended that you play with a controller, and I could see why. You control one brother with each joystick, and a lot of times you'll need to interact with both at exactly the same time to solve puzzles. I thought that the teamwork between the brothers was spectacular, and not something you see every day in a single player game. No gameplay bugs or annoyances to speak of. You just need to learn to work together with yourself :) The puzzles themselves are very simple, yet brilliant in how you go about to solving them.  All achievements are fun to attain, not a chore. If you missed an achievement during your first playthrough, you can go back and play each chapter separately. I finished the game in 4 hours. Others have finished it between 2 and 6 hours. The game was so much fun that I purposely had to put it down so that I didn't play through it in one sit-down.   I'm not going to spoil anything whatsoever regarding the story. All I'll say is that you'll experience many up's and down's throughout the journey. Which again, it's something that the game got 100% right. Right now I can't think of a single negative to speak of. I guess the game length would be the only negative since it's such a great and fun game that you'll wish the journey had lasted longer.  TotalBiscuit called Brothers the best game he's ever played, surpassing his previous choice (Deus Ex). I also happen to think that Deus Ex is one of, if not the best game ever made. I do understand why he would place Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons so high up the game ladder. I haven't played The Last of Us yet, but I would strongly make a case for Brothers as a 2013 Game of the Year candidate. I'm not a recognized game reviewer person or site, so it's just my humble opinion. But go ahead and buy Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons if you want a great, emotional gaming experience :)",

            "review_text": "Brothers is a game where you control two brothers on a quest to save their father. The game is optomized with an Xbox 360 controller in mind, no doubt. Or at the very least, a controller. It can definitely be played with a keyboard and mouse, but I wouldn't recommend.  Now that I got that out of the way, I'll let you know why(if you didn't already know) this is one of the best games of the year. The way you control both brothers binds with the story so well its absolutely amazing. We all know when it comes to gaming there are two basic factors that make a video game: Mechanics and story. I think a game can have very little of one or the other, and still be a good game. However, it is extremely rare that the mechanics practically make the story. Its absolutely amazing how well it is done. I'm fairly sure its been done in similar ways before, but not in a way like this, in a way that makes the story what it is. The story wouldn't exist without the mechanics, its amazing how they flow.  There is no dialouge, yet the story is one of the best I've played. How the hell does that even happen? It completely took me by surprise. I didn't think that was possible until Journey, and now Brothers has done a very similar thing.   To be honest, while the mechanics do make the story, they don't come without bugs and issues. There were several times where the controls got in the way of me being able to complete a task. I don't entirely blame the game, I blame my brain for not always being able to keep track of both characters and coorespond that with the correct stick on the controller. Also, I ran into a few different glitches, but nothing broke my game. However I have heard of glitches forcing some people to restart entire chapters, which is not ideal.   I'm not going to tell you this is my favorite game of all time, or even my #1 game of the year, but that doesn't mean the game isn't amazing and plenty of fun. I would have been happy paying the full sale price, but at $4.49, its an absolute steal. Brothers gets my full recommendation. Buy it now(at this time it is 4.49) or at 14.99, it makes little difference. The game is absolutely worth every penny. Play Brothers today to experience one of the best blends of story and mechanics I've ever seen.     Buy At Full Price    ",

Starbreeze Studios and Josef Fares made a masterpiece of a game here. With excellent graphics, soundtrack, storyline, unique gameplay mechanics and all that it just feels so perfect. The controls for the two brothers is at first a tad confusing (I used PS3 controller) but the gameplay makes you master it with time.  There's puzzles, platforming, wonderful/sad story, immersive world, great soundtrack, good game mechanics colorful characters to fall in love with plus you get to ride a Mountain Goat (awesome stuff for real).

            "review_text": "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a third-person linear co-op game and inspired by games such as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus due to their similarities in gameplay and aesthetics.   The premise of the game is following two brothers, Naie (eldest) and Naiee (youngest), through their journey across different lands searching for a magical tree which has the cure that can save their dying father. Being a very narratively driven game, revealing any details about the story would ruin much of the game’s charm since that is its main driving force.  The game plays exactly like a co-op puzzle-platformer where you control the two brothers through their journey. Throughout the game, using a controller is strongly recommended as playing it on keyboard, whilst still doable, can result in some awkward coordination between the two controllable protagonists when they start bumping into each other or objects like two drunks. The actual gameplay itself is satisfying due to the nice blend of “puzzles” requiring both brothers’ participation throughout most of the game. The difficulty of these “puzzles” may eventually feel disappointing after a while as they do not provide any concrete challenge to the player(s) (hence the inverted commas), although that might have been deliberate for the integrity of the game’s pace. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is, indeed, one of those games where the difficulty requires being at a minimum for the narrative to be at full throttle. Remember, no one wants to get constantly stuck solving complex puzzles in a narratively-driven game as it subsequently ruins the game’s pace.  However, where it lacks in challenging puzzles or even perhaps rewarding gameplay, it compensates for its narrative which in actual fact is the heart of this game. The journey, albeit disappointedly short, transports you in a world where you believe you are in a place like Middle-Earth; travelling through various mesmerising landscapes on your quest for the cure while the suiting soundtrack plays in the background. All of its narrative is achieved rather through visuals and gestures as there is not any comprehendible dialogue in the entire game. That in itself is commendable as not many games can pull it off as successfully as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons does. Frankly, each gesture or visual representation is easily and surprisingly understandable. Besides all that, the game also offers in its storytelling a handful of moments of happiness, laughter, seriousness and sadness without feeling schizophrenic with its mood shifts. The game‘s narrative can have some amazing set-pieces, but also a couple of clumsy ones.  And that is as much as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons can offer to players. On top of its colourful charm, or even some of its darker undertones, there are two main complains I personally had with this game in my first playthrough which ultimately felt detrimental to an extent towards my overall enjoyment. On a technical level, I encountered three game-breaking bugs which would not allow me to continue to the next area. Whilst two of them were solved by looking up online forums, the latter required restarting two prior chapters since simply restarting the current one was not sufficient to solve the problem. As of now, I still have no idea how those bugs triggered when it seems that the majority of people never even encountered them in the first place. Still, having to restart two complete chapters is bothersome. Then lastly, the ending. I will honestly be one of those in the minority who was not totally satisfied with the story’s conclusion nor did it have an impact on me. Even as I wish to critically evaluate it in this review, I cannot do that without simply spoiling it. But I will say this: I understood what they tried to achieve with the coming of age approach, but reflecting back through the entire journey, the writing at this point was sloppy and felt more of a cop out in the end to me. It also made me realise how Naie was not fleshed out as a character as much as his younger brother, Naiee, making a certain event not as effective as the developers would have hoped for, to me at least. Perhaps that is because the story might have been moving a bit too fast for things to fully develop.    Conclusively, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one those video games where you delve in exclusively for the storytelling experience. Nothing more, nothing less. Without even sounding remotely pretentious, It is hardly the “masterpiece” everyone clams it to be, although it will definitely, and respectfully, leave a lasting impression for many people regardless, especially for youngsters. But not for everyone. Mechanically, it has a solid co-op experience with extremely easy puzzles to solve and backed up by artistically appealing sceneries, a fitting soundtrack and a simple, yet immersive, narrative despite a few clumsy set-pieces and a somewhat unsatisfying ending. At full price, however, I would definitely not recommend this due to its short length (2-3 hours at most) and limited replayability as there is not much reason to revisit it anytime soon now that you know how the story wraps up. Conversely, considering it always goes as low as £1 during virtually any Steam sales, there is absolutely no excuse not to try this, and that is why I am recommending it in the end. Despite some of its flaws, I truly had fun playing it and thought it managed to do what it was aiming for mostly pretty well, even if I will probably not reflect too much upon it in the near future.",

Let's point out some things first:  The music and the graphics are simply amazing, you can't argue about that. The controlling of the two brothers was new to me, so it took time to get used to it, but it's not hard at all. There are no speaking in the game, just gesturing and some mumbling. Because of this, i just simply cannot form a connection with the brothers. Okay, i'm controlling them, but i just couldn't care about them much enough. And it really affects the game, i think.   Some SPOILERS INCOMING!  I loved the   dead giants valley, it was gore, it was epic, and yet still beautiful in some way. I was totally amazed by the map design there  .  But there's one thing, that almost made me quit immediately, and give this game a negative review:   That girl at the end, turning into spider. Was that really necessary? I don't have a problem with spiders, nor do i fear them, but it just wasn't filling in that word, or even in the game. I was shocked, and not in a good way. Can't really express why, but that was a big minus for me  .  Overall i'd recommend it, but there are things that holds back this game to be a very special one...",

At no point does the game translate the words used in the game, and that is probably for the best. What this results in is a phenomenally good told story. The game doesnt need to rely on voiceacting to be understood, you can tell exactly what to do even though you can't understand i singel word, whether it be through gestures or the inviorment.

            "review_text": "Summary: Brothers is an engaging, fun, frustrating and immersive afternoon's fun - requiring a pad.  It's a tough thing to talk much about Brothers - A Tale Of Two Sons. The game is compact; so there's little you can draw reference to without spoiling anything, and to ruin this beautiful little tale would do the reader a great disservice. That in itself should serve as a recommendation, though it comes with several caveats.  Firstly, there is only one reason why you would logically ever play Brothers twice, and that's to get achievements. As sad a statement as that is in many games, here it's in the games' favour, as the achievements here take the form of vignettes which occur off Brother's beaten (and entirely linear) path. These brief scenes take a variety of tones and forms, and some are more enjoyable than others (of course). The merit of this approach is that the achievements enhance the game rather than detract from it, and for this Brothers should be applauded. Find all of these asides from the main tale though, and that's it - nothing more to see here.  So, the game itself. Brothers is an isometric overhead adventure, in which you guide the titular big and little brothers (who call one another Naia and Naiee in the game world's language, whatever those words may mean) around various obstacles on their journey to find a cure for their ailing father. As we have come to expect, the game and soundtrack are both beautiful, with a visually realised and aurally rounded world waiting to be explored. The manner of exploration is probably the most talked about and easily discussed mechanic of the game, which to summarily recap, involves simultaneous control of both brothers. On a standard gamepad set-up, the left stick controls the big brother, right stick the little brother, with left and right triggers serving as each character's action/interaction button, and left/right bumper rotating the camera. This control scheme may be both the game's key draw and most off-putting mechanic depend on how you personally handle the remapping of ingrained controller use - the operation is fairly fluid and has a gentle enough curve to allow you to get used to it, and I personally found the system engaging and enjoyable, but I can see the same aspects frustrating and annoying many gamers.   Nonetheless, overcome the fact that you WILL at times be constantly running one brother into a wall while the other calls out to his counterpart for no reason, simply because the little brother is positioned to the left of the big brother and your mind has once again mapped the left stick to the left character and vice-versa, and you have a wonderful ride ahead of you.  And you will need a controller. Yes, the game has keyboard controls. Be aware however that the game itself will warn you that it is designed, specifically, to be controlled with a pad. On a keyboard certain tasks requiring rotation of both thumbsticks simultaneously... do not map well. I can't honestly recommend the game to anyone without a controller.  As to the story, events and specifics of the world - they should all be experienced for oneself. So long as you have some sort of empathy within you, this is a great little journey which will draw you in fully for three to four hours. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging at any part, there's no choices or branching story lines - and you won't mind. It's refreshing how streamlined and conservative Brothers is with it's mechanics, puzzles and set-pieces, and it deserves to be played both for and because of these aspects. The tone, whist initially whimsical, darkens considerably, to the point where I'd advise against playing the game with younger children. To give it a cinematic comparison, it starts off in Jim Henson's Labyrinth, moves into The Never-Ending Story, and ends... not joyfully. However; I wouldn't change a thing about it.  It is also very worth saying that just because you'll see the entire game in one or two play-throughs, it is still extremely re-playable and enjoyable each time. I fired up the game to check out the keyboard controls while writing this review and I felt an urge to play again immediately, which would make a fourth run at the game.  This really is a beautiful, innovative and rollicking yarn which asks for very little from the player and gives a ton back. The only hold-ups are the aforementioned potential control frustrations, and for those to whom it's a factor, the price. Not wishing to seem ♥♥♥♥♥rdly, for your average player, £12 for a three-hour game isn't great. When you take into account what you get for that price of entry, I'd have to say that yes, it is worth it, but I can't say I paid that for it as I picked up a cheap key. At half price this game is an absolute steal and should be purchased without reservation, at full price, give the points raised here a little thought before committing.  8.5/10 He Ain't Heavy",

Well, I don't know about the latter, but  Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons  is indeed  awe some. Every scene and every image may induce awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping gazes upon its on-lookers thanks to fantastic art direction by Starbreeze Studios. Who'da thunk the makers of The Darkness and The Chronicles of Riddick games could make something so bright and colorful? But then again, maybe we shouldn't assume too much about Starbreeze's new-found love of color just yet. Even in the span of the game's three-hour playtime, there are several instances of “dem feels” to be had.   Brothers  may also wreak havoc on your thumbs and cranial wiring thanks to its unique control scheme. Each brother is assigned their own analog stick and trigger allowing them to move and carry out context-based actions independently of one another, leading to some pretty hilarious moments. I can't count how many times I've let go of the wrong trigger while one of the brothers dangles precariously from a ledge or chain, only for him to meet an untimely demise. The worst is when you have the brother controlled by the left-side of the controller on the right and vice-verse. It's a bit like trying to do a math problem upside-down. I dunno know, though; I'm pretty bad at math.  All these eccentricities of game design culminate into what is one of the best ending sequences in a video game to date. This is one you just have to experience for yourself, so I'll leave it at that. This is the kind of story-telling that the medium has been striving for the past couple of years thanks to a booming indie scene. If Siskel and Ebert were here today, they would have said, “Thanks to a severe case of carpal tunnel, we can't help but give  Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons   Two Thumbs Up! ”",

Firstly, you *need* a twin stick controller to play this - you *might* be able to kludge your way through with the keyboard, but you really don't want to. If you don't have one, go in to the City and buy an XBox 360 controller right now - I'll wait.... OK, you have one? Good.  Now, I love a game with a good story, but let's be honest - in most games the story and gameplay are somewhat disconnected from each other and could just as easily be presented as two separate pieces of art. Heck, there are some games that would have done better to throw away one (or two!) of those pieces altogether!  This game is different - the story and the gameplay are both perfectly intertwined. Sure, it still has cutscenes, but the story is largely conveyed while you control the brothers throughout their journey. This game has managed to figure out how to use the unique properties of a video game to tell it's story, rather than relying on techniques from movies or novels like every other game.  There is also, no speach - well, at least not English. The characters do use body language and speak some kind of made up language to effectively convey emotion and meaning, without distracting from the story or journey at hand. If you have ever played The Sims or The Singles it's similar to the spoken 'language' in those games.  The story is very moving - I don't really want to spoil anything, especially as the game is not all that long and I couldn't do anywhere near as good a job as the game itself does. The basic premise is that the two brothers have to go on a journey far beyond their village, past troll mines and Giant's cities to find a tree that produces a healing exiler to cure their sick father (or so I gather - no English, remember?). I won't say anything more - you need to play it.  The gameplay is also pretty unique - at it's heart it's really a puzzle platformer where you have to use the strengths and weaknesses of each brother to manipulate levers to move obstacles to allow both to progress on your journey. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult, but they are still satisfying and there is enough variety that the gameplay never outstays it's welcome.  What makes the gameplay unique is that you control both brothers *simultaneousely* with both of the sticks on the controller. This can lead to a bit of brain♥♥♥♥ at times - often coping with that that was more difficult than the puzzles themselves, but it doesn't take long to get used to and is never a serious problem (so long as you remember which button is which brother when you need to let go of a ledge).  You can usually pick this up from Green Man Gaming (unlocks on Steam) with whatever 20-25% coupon they have on offer at the time.

            "review_text": "This is an intense experience, albeit a short one.   The journey leads you through a quite surrealistic fantasy world which fluctuates between being joyful and depressing, though it clearly drifts towards the latter over the course of the game. There's not that much of a plot actually and as there is neither any on-screen text, nor any spoken language other than the unintelligible fantasy language the characters are using every now and then, the main focus clearly is the emotional impact rather than the actual plot. This is working great, though.  This cannot unconditionally be said about the controls, however. Controlling two characters at once with an actually very basic setup (using one analogue stick and one trigger per character, plus two buttons for camera control) is an interesting concept and nicely supports the narrative in certain ways, but it's really easy to get confused, especially in sections demanding that both brothers are simultaneously moved more or less precisely. You can certainly get used to it, but it might take a while and the game might actually already be over at that point ;)   You can easily plow through the game in three hours or probably even less. There's some replay value because of several optional parts - in fact, all of the game's achievements are completely optional. Then again, not each achievement is unlocked by an additional puzzle of some sorts, but sometimes simply by interacting with the right object long enough. The puzzles in general might be a bit too easy and for the most part they rather test your patience than your logical thinking. Pretty much all of them make great sense in the context of the journey, though - there's no tacked-on riddle solving that feels out of place.  All in all this game does indeed deserve the praise it's been getting ever since its release, and it is very easy to ignore the lack of challenge and the basic nature of the plot as it still delivers some satisfying gameplay and an emotionally impactful and visually beautiful experience.  For comparable titles, see Journey (PS3), Papo y Yo, and maybe Limbo.",

There were numerous moments where I was just blown away by the beauty of this game. It's something you don't expect in the beginning when you see the Unreal Engine logo.  They make up for the low polygon count of the characters by beautiful textures, great lighting effects and the best camera positioning you have ever seen.  TL;DR: Short but oh oh oh so sweet. Just have a controller handy (unplayable with keyboard and mouse). Definitely worth it.

The sounds in the game are simplistic, but they work perfectly to set the atmosphere - the game doesn't even need dialogue, the actions of the characters and the random noises they make say all that needs saying to let you understand what is going on and what you need to do.  The graphics in the game are beautiful. The art-style I would say is in the same vein as Fable, which again suits it just right, and will leave you wide-eyed at the various environments the brothers must progress through on their journey.

I used a controller for my playthrough, and controlling both the brothers was easy to get the hang of, it quickly became second nature. I was also pleasantly surprised by how this seemingly simple mechanic was continually used and expanded on throughout the game, in turn setting up some very clever and memorable moments.  On average this game takes around 3-4 hours to complete, sometimes this causes people to hesitate on the price. I'd like to think that after most people are done they will see it's worth every penny. And if you manage to catch this on sale then it's an absolute steal! This was originally recommended to me by a friend and I'm very grateful so I decided to attempt to do the same for someone else.

The gist of it is that you control two brothers simultaneously to solve puzzles and complete action sequences. It gets awfully clever on you, and there are only very minimal cues in the game. That is, it rarely tells you what buttons you need to press. In fact, you've only got the movement controls for each brother and a button to make each of them separately interact with stuff in the environment. There's dialogue but it's audible only in gibberish and only serves to convey character emotion and build on the personalities of the cast. Through the journey you come to know the characters by the quirky way you control them, i.e. you'll probably end up paying more attention to one brother, while the other larks off in some other direction (keeping track of two characters at once is deceptively difficult.)   It's only a few hours long, but the price is right. It's almost criminal that during the last steam sale I was able to get it for something like $2.50.

Beautiful graphics so I recommend playing on a higher-end PC for the full immersion.   +Beautiful graphics +Cute little story +Appropriately short game length (IMO) +Simple game, not a lot of thought is needed gameplay-wise.  -Annoying voice acting (it can get a bit repetitive) -Annoying controls. The idea of using the two joysticks is cool but it gets a bit clunky. (I'm looking at you underwater and flying scenes...)  Definitely Recommend. Picked it up for 1.20€ during the sale so can't really complain about anything.",

My only advice without giving anything away would be: Don't rush through the game. Take your time. Let the little brother play some pranks on the village people, be kind to animals and have a rest on a bench once in a while.

The only con I'd give it is the price, since the replay value for me will be very low.

No cons here. * The voice acting (they speak in an invented language) can be a bit mediocre at times but it does the job.  So why is this game so good? Everything works together and the mediocre elements of this game, since they are so well implemented, instead of dragging the game down make it better.

It's a little short at 4 to 5 hours, but it's worth it.  The game was designed for an xbox 360 controller. You can play with a keyboard, but you will have a problem at 2 parts in the game. You can get through these parts, but you will have to hold a button down for a few minutes at those 2 parts instead of about 10 seconds. You can use other dual stick controllers (I used a PS2 controller), but you will probably need to use a small free program called x360ce which is an xbox 360 controller emulator. This will tell the game you are using an xbox controller and the program will let you map the keys on your controller. If you are using a PS2 controller and the right stick doesn't map correctly, search online and there is a patch that will fix it.",

You won't know where you are going until you get there, but the journey to the brothers' destination is beautiful and fascinating to see unfold.   Although there is a notice saying that the game requires a controller to play, I did so with a regular keyboard. Just use WASD and spacebar for the elder brother Naia, and arrow and Ctrl keys for younger brother Naiee. Whatever you do use, controlling the two brothers simultaneously can be a bit disorienting, and I recommend keeping each brother on the side of the screen that corresponds with the side of the keyboard/controller where their buttons/joysticks are located. It is pretty fun to figure out the little puzzles along the way, as much of the game requires the boys' cooperation to move the story along.  Even though it is short, Brothers is worth every penny. If you can catch it on sale, as it is at the moment of this review being written, you really have no reason not to buy it. If you find yourself frustrated occasionally, give yourself a break and pick up the game again soon. You will want to play it through to the very end. (And grab a hanky when you get there.)",

            "review_text": "Increible and charming game.   The control scheme allows for a set of unique and very creative puzzles. Although they are fairly easy and straightforward, they are well thought and entertaining. The fact that they where designed with the brothers cooperation in mind makes them quite unique and you won't see anything like it in any other single player experience. Contrary to what the store page says, it appears that the game CAN be played without a controller.   The excellent and yet simple storytelling in this game is yet another proof that well-designed videogames can be a form of art. Through a made up language the characters interact with each other and is up to the player to decipher what's going on by paying attention to the characters' body expressions and gestures. The game is obviously designed so that the story and emotions are easy to understand without the need of explicit dialogues, allowing the players to immerse themselves in this beautiful story by their own interpretations.  The game makes good use of the Unreal Engine, creating a fantasy-like universe with consistent elements with the overarching story and interactions between the Brothers. But it doesn't stop at that, as the game manages to create different environments for each chapters that are one more breathtaking than the other. From the remnants of a giants' battlefield to a glacial landscape filled with singing whales, every path the Brothers traverse was meticulously designed to resemble the syle of a pop-up storybook. This manages to convey the huge scale of the world that surrounds the characters and the significance of the journey of the two Brothers. I can't find words to describe how much this concept is enhanced by playing the game in 3D. Making the game work with a 3DTV is fairly easy with some software like Tridef 3D (I guess Nvidia's 3DVision should work aswell). And I must say, it looks like the environment objects and the camera angles were designed specifically with 3D in mind (and I suppose it wasn't like that, seeing as the game does NOT natively support 3D). This was easily one of the best 3D gaming experiences I ever had, and I look at the 2D screenshots I took while playing and unfortunately they feel extremely underwhelming compared to the sense of scope I felt during those parts.  Overall, this game is a must-buy/must-play. Even if you can't find a way to experience it in 3D, the art design is strong enough to stand on its own and the beautiful story of the two Brothers may still be something to catch you by surprise and actually make you feel for the characters. The lenght of the game is approximately 3 hours. Maybe more if you decide to go for a second run in order to get the achievements you may have missed, but they weren't much an incentive to me.  One detail (Spoilers?): I still can't figure out if this game was designed for kids, or if it was made for grown ups. It begins as a colorful and charming game, but it quickly turns dark and gritty, full of scenarios I'm not sure how a kid would respond to. The easy puzzles also trew me off. But either way, the game is still something that should be experienced from beggining to end, even by adults.",

Controls are a bit hard or challenging, especially if you're using the keyboard as in my case-- it sometimes gets frustrating because you are controlling two characters at once. It's also hard to take screenshots especially in interactions because I think Steam prevents the user from pressing to many buttons at once.

It is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, with its highs and lows and sad parts and whatnot, and the story is certainly what's pulling the game together.  However, the actual game is a pretty good time too. A lot of the platforming is very fun and feels quite good to play and a lot of the levels have interesting puzzles, although most aren't too difficult to solve.  Now, yes, this game is short and has little replay value, but you'll certainly get $15 worth out of it, or just pick it up in a sale for $3. Definitely worth it then.  All in all, buy this game.",

Even if you aren't a 'Gamer'. Its such a great and heartfelt experience. Seriously, go and play it. Its downloadable on PC, PSN and XBOX Live.  I finally got around to this gem after spending months going through my backlog of games. I am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to play it now.   The controls are very awkward, but simple. A controller is more or less a must for this game, as you control one brother with stick and another brother with the other stick. Trigger buttons to interact with the environment and shoulder buttons for camera rotations. That it! Simple. You will immediately think that the game will be boring with such limited controls, but you would be wrong. The level design and mechanics of the game turn the simple controls into a story of its own. The artwork is breathtaking. The game is one of the most gorgeous around. And that story...﻿",

The controls are simple but can still confuse as you go on in the adventure. The puzzles are quick to understand and can be solved without experiencing much frustration. Sometimes, I think it might be a little bit too easy. There is no part where you can get stuck or that is really challenging in my opinion. Still, I don't see it as a problem since the game is not about feeling awesome after solving a hard puzzle or bypassing a large obstacle and more about telling the story of the brothers. Difficult puzzles would maybe ruin this experience.  The narrative of the story is just fantastic. Even without using an acutal understandable language (the characters in this game speak some a made-up language + there are no subtitles), it is always clear what the characters in the game are saying or what they are talking about (also because they use gestures which helps out a lot). The story and (if existend) the relation of the individual characters is easily understandable.  Sure, the game is pretty short (it took me two hours to finish it without having all achievements) but I think it's the right length. Since the gameplay is simple, you can only do so much to keep it fresh and entertaining. Maybe one level more wouldn't have hurt but I don't think it's necessary either.  All in all, Borther - A Tale of Two Sons is an entertaining, small and also emotional experience. If you're looking for a quick and fun game and you're not the most sensible person out there (*sob*), definitly check out this game!",

The basic premise of the game is that of two brothers who have set out on a quest through a fantasy world to find a mystical cure for their ailing father.  To be reductive, the game is a simple puzzle-driven adventure game in which you control each brother with one of the analogue sticks and perform context sensitive actions using the triggers. It's through this control scheme that makes you fully see the Brother's reliance on each other and while the game is by no means hard, you'll find yourself focusing on the emotional context of the puzzles rather than the solution (which is almost always pretty straight forward).  The game has a sort of breezy (no pun intended) dream like quality to it. You'll travel through beautiful fairy tale-esque environments, non of which overstay their welcome, highlighted by gorgeous camera angles. There's an incredible sense of scale, distance and perspective and for a 'small' game it's amazingly impressive.

            "review_text": "Brothers bills itself as an “epic fairy tale”, and while I’m generally hesitant to endorse that kind of hyperbole, two playthroughs left me with little doubt that it deserves that lofty description.   For one, Brothers unquestionably succeeds as a fairy tale, conjuring up a large dose of the whimsy, scope, and spectacle that one expects from the genre. In the space of a few hours, you’ll tiptoe past giants in cavernous mines, gaze upon the aurora borealis while crossing snow-capped peaks, beat back wolves in a menacing forest, swing through the ruins of an ancient castle, and hang glide through a forested valley. Brothers understands that fairy tales succeed in part because they appeal to the wild, unconstrained parts of our imagination, and it parlays this knowledge into a whirlwind journey that transports the player across a series of diverse Scandinavian landscapes. This Scandinavian character manifests itself in far more than just the game’s gorgeous setting, however. While Brothers is undoubtedly a fairy tale, it is a fairy tale in the image of Hans Christian Anderson and other masters of the genre, a story that eschews the simple platitudes of children’s narratives for a complex, emotional story that is not afraid to confront more mature themes of guilt, loss, and personal sacrifice. The game certainly has a number of light-hearted moments, and they are essential in the development of the story’s unique charm, but it also has distinctive moments of darkness, searing images that wrest us from our contentment and remind us of the risks and dangers inherent in such an epic undertaking.   On a more mechanical level, the control system, which allows you to manipulate both brothers simultaneously, can best be described as “stripped down”. Each brother’s actions are mapped to one side of the controller, with one button (the trigger) solely responsible for all potential actions. This streamlined control scheme saves you the trouble of having to simultaneously execute advanced button sequences, and substantially reduces the learning curve of what could otherwise have been an overly complex system. As it stands, the control scheme holds up well. It takes a little getting used to at first, and there are times when you might wish that you could toggle actions (some actions will require you to just hold down the trigger for extended periods of time), but within half an hour or so you’ll be zipping through the game’s gorgeous environments with relative ease. It isn’t wildly innovative, but it pushes the traditional boundaries of single-player gaming enough to make the game’s numerous puzzles seems fresh and exciting, even if they tend not to be overly difficult to solve.   While I loved the story and appreciated the simple elegance of the controls, I think my favorite part about Brothers is the frequent, subtle nods the game makes to the playfulness and insatiable curiosity of childhood. Our titular heroes may be on an epic journey of life and death importance, but they still have the realistic mannerisms of kids who are just soaking up the wonders around them. They laugh in amazement when a friendly giant helps them ascend a steep cliff. They playfully interact with strangers on their initial journey through their village. They gaze in awe at the stars, pointing upwards at the luminous constellations which light their journey. These small but frequent touches humanize our protagonists and connect them to the player. We might not be able to empathize with the precise struggles and concerns that the brothers face on their epic journey, but we can all relate to the sense of wonder we feel when we witness something heretofore unimagined, a sense that lies at the heart of what makes fairy tales, and this game, special.   It certainly isn’t the only thing that makes this game stand out. The music is as effectively stripped down as the control scheme, a subtle tour de force of haunting chanting and mournful viola and piano melody lines which mirrors the grim nature of the brothers’ task. The environments are lush, beautifully animated, and incredibly diverse. The graphics themselves aren’t particularly cutting edge (rather reminiscent of Fable, actually), but the level design is nothing short of breathtaking, with the traversable parts of it every bit as gorgeous as the wonders visible just off the beaten path. But in the end, I think this game succeeds most as a plaintive ode to the curiosity and wonderment of childhood, and as a reminder that there are moments of joy and laughter to be found even amongst the most dire of circumstances. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better way to spend an evening.",

And, controlling two people at the same time is certainly novel. No, you can't play this game by moving one person and then the other. You must be able to move them both simultaneously (or nearly so) to be able to get through some areas. It can be played without a game controller. I played the entire game using  only a keyboard  (after remapping the keys), because my controller just died. I am sure that added to the time it took also.  I am glad I played the game, so I recommend it. However, it is with some reservations. (1) I would not recommend this to a very young person or to anyone that might be easily affected by negative imagery. Besides being heavy on emotional situations (sadness, despair, ...), there are areas I can only describe as gruesome. And, the overall story is bittersweet. (2) Don't buy it if you want hours and hours of game play. To really enjoy the game you must think like you are on travel and want to see all the sites, scenery, and animals. That's important because the game is very easy to get through quickly. I did it in 10 hours, taking my time and getting all the achievements, and even replaying some really cool parts    (maneuvering the inventor's glider)  .  (3) Would I play this through repeatedly like I did with Portal or Knights of the Old Republic? No, I probably won't. It doesn't have that kind of replay value. The story is very linear.

            "review_text": "This is the first game that I bought and played on steam.  Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a marvel of storytelling and clever gameplay and a must buy for players who enjoy such.  The first thing that I should say is that unlike what the notice says on the store page, this game does not require a controller to play.   Gameplay and story: During the game you control these two characters with the arrow and wasd keys as the camera adjusts itself to the area that you are playing. The game itself is relatively simple and linear, requiring the player to overcome easy obstacles in the way of the protagonists' journey to save their ill uncle. In the course of their quest, they assist others in need and grow closer as brothers. It is slightly challenging to get ahold of controlling the brothers simultaneously at the start of the game but becomes much more fluid and easy as you progress through the levels even with a keyboard. Complement to the controls, the challenges along the way begin to require more ingenuity as you learn to control the brothers.  Graphics: The areas themselves are beautifully designed and the game pauses every once in a while to allow you to enjoy it. From climbing crumbling ruins to scaling massive caves the game uses every area to show you just how beautiful and well crafted it is.   Sound: There is no major dialogue so to speak but everything in the game is clear without it using too many words. What the lack of dialogue gives way to is a wonderful soundtrack that captures the emotional range of the story in ways that dialogue would never have. As the game becomes darker the longer you play, the sounds and music mature likewise.  Overall:  On the front, Brothers may look like a simple, light hearted puzzle adventure for a casual player. Playing it, I've come to appreciate the subtle and fine ways that this game was made elevating it in quality above many of the other games that I play. The story and gameplay are simple, the music complements the graphics excellently, and the entire experience is an emotional journey as two brothers enter dark and dangerous worlds to save their family.   I cannot recommend this game enough and constantly badger anyone who would listen. It is a quick (approx 6 hr) playthrough and the ending left me sobbing. I have to say, this is a different caliber of gaming. I've never experienced anything like it  10/10 ",

It's easy to play.  -Controls are hard to learn (If you are playing this alone) -Story was a little bit too short  I can definitely recommend this game. If you don't want to spend your money, you 100% should buy this game when it's in sale! :)",

            "review_text": "I better start off with this: I was recommended to play this by TotalBiscuit, as I had seen his 'WTF is' before I played the game. He said that this game might be the best game ever made in his opinion, and I started the game with that in mind. Now, as to whether or not this is the best game ever made, I will let that be up to you, but I can say that I don't think it's the best game ever made. It was a really nice movie.  Yea thats pretty much my opinion There isn't a whole lot of actual gameplay in the game, it is mostly running from point A to B, get up this cliff, get over this bridge. And the gameplay that was there, could be a bit confusing, because you had to control two characters at once. It was pretty easy to get past, and the times I got confused wasn't really enough to pull me out off the game. I think this game could be defined as a story driven puzzle game, although the puzzles wasn't all that hard, and more often than not, they were very simple. I didn't really encounter a puzzle that really had me think, and all of them was pretty much obvious. The gameplay of this title is in my opinion the weakest part of this game, and it is pretty weak. If the story and world hadn't been there I would say it was a pretty bad game. Speaking of the world. I got sort of a Zeno Clash vibe from the world, because it had the same way of having wierd animals, trolls, and oversized buildings lying around. It had sort of the same psychedelic dream setting, although not anyway near as weird as Zeno Clash. I really liked the setting, and the game uses a system with some benches that function as vistas as you sit on them, to show off the world. The world definitely had a lot of wackiness to it, and the chapters where sort of themed, as you pass through the different areas. The graphics wasn't anything good, and it was obvious to see that the game is optimised for xbox (although I have heard it shouldn't run all that well on xbox). Textures weren't all that high quality, but that didn't really matter as the art style is a cartoonish style. Although it came for xbox first, the pc port, if it even is a port, is pretty good. I had a steady 60 fps all the way through, and not a single lag spike. As for the controls I personally played with a controller, which seems to work the best as well but I tried the keyboard controls and they seem to play just fine, so really don't HAVE to play with an xbox controller but it is recommended. I saved the best for last: the story. The story is definitely the strongest part of the game. The story is really good, and Starbreeze somehow managed to convey the whole thing without a single real word. All spoken language in the game is pretty much gibberish (it might be a real language, but you aren't expected to understand anything from it). Even though everything said is gibberish, it is really easy to understand the messages conveyed between the characters of the game. And there is absolutely no problems in understanding the story. The story is very emotional, but it didn't make me cry, as it did TB (guess people really are different after all ;)). Although single manly tear at the ending. So is this worth buying. In a way, you can think of as this: it is pretty much the price you would pay to go see a new movie in the theaters so if you are looking for a great story, in a game Wahtzy could beat in 2 hours 33 minutes, this would be worth it. If you are looking for an actual game, I would say this isn't worth the full price, and if you aren't interested in story at all I would say you should pretty much just avoid it. As for replayability, I only managed to get a single achievement, so I guess there is a reason to play through it a second time. TL;DR:  If you are looking for a movie length game with a great story then BUY IT. If you are looking for a game to play, secondarily with a good story, then: Buy it when its on sale.  If you are looking a game, but aren't interested in story at all: AVOID.  Edit: I corrected a lot of spelling errors. Turns out I can't spell opinion.",

            "review_text": " Short but sweet.   This is a wonderfully imaginative adventure with one or two truly memorable moments - moments that will live with you long after this game has sat gathering dust on your (virtual) shelf, kind of like  that moment  in Bioshock, or  that moment  in Final Fantasy VII. If you've played those games, you'll know what I'm talking about, and once you've played Brothers, you'll know exactly which moments I'm referring to.  It's a very pretty game with some great scenery aided by the fantasy setting. The closest comparison would be Fable. The palettes never get boring because your journey takes you through some incredible and progressively dark and dangerous landscapes, so you really feel like you've wandered far, far away from the comfort of your peaceful village where your biggest concern was the local bully.  Audio is also decent. There is speech of a sort - the inhabitants of the world speak a sort of gibberish language similar to what you'd hear characters in The Sims speaking. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. In a longer game it would become repetitive but as Brothers is a short game, it never feels samey.  Speaking of length, I personally feel that the length of the game was just about right, but I'm aware not everyone may agree with this. Clocking it at about 3 hours, it's a short game for the price. However, I picked it up for half price during a Steam sale and would say it's well worth the money. It's well-paced and I'm glad the developers didn't try to pad it out any longer or drag it out unnecessarily.  Moving on to the gameplay - the control system is unique and innovative (perhaps it's been done before, but I've not played a game like it) - it's effectively one-player co-op. Playing with a controller, you control one brother with the left stick and make him interact with the environment using the left trigger, while you control the other brother in exactly the same way using the right stick and the right trigger. This did lead to me getting my knickers in a twist and trying to walk both brothers off opposite ends of a cliff repeatedly (don't worry, they won't) and takes some getting used to, but it's a great system. The puzzles are extremely simple and will barely slow you down. In fact, the trickiest puzzles (and that's a relative term) come from obtaining the optional achievements, none of which are required to complete the main story.  In conclusion, if you don't mind paying for a pretty, casual (read: easy) 3 hour adventure with little to no replay value (other than wanting to re-live  those moments ), then I couldn't recommend Brothers highly enough.",

The control system is both simple and innovative. The world that the characters inhabit is beautifully drawn, and the atmosphere is completed by a fabulous score.

            "review_text": "'Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons' is my Game of the Year for 2013. 2013 is the year I started to move away from 'AAA' games and start looking at indie games. I've played a few great ones, but 'Brothers' transcends the gaming medium into an experience you would expect from a television series or a feature film.  The most obvious thing about 'Brothers' is the control scheme. You have not played a game like this before. One controller (and you do need a controller, though a keyboard can be used, despite what the store page says) controls both brothers. Stick moves, trigger is a context-based 'use' button. Left for older, right for younger. It makes sense, and it works 99% of the time. The only trouble is when they cross over (you'll want to keep the older brother left of the younger brother) but that's easy to fix, stop them both and start with one, then add the other. You might notice my Steam avatar is from Rockband; the same technique is useful there as well when playing guitar or drums. Start with one beat, then add the others one at a time.  Most of the puzzles are fairly basic. When you realize that a ladder out of reach means the older brother has to hoist the younger brother up, you'll use that a few more times. However, the game doesn't feel redundant. It does challenge you in new and different ways, but the mechanics are all generally the same. Pretty much, once you get the hang of it, the puzzles seem to come second nature, which is necessary for this game to work the way it does. You aren't meant to get hung up on puzzles; rather, you may fail a couple times, but once you have that 'A-ha!' moment and realize what you need to do—it just clicks.  The story is all kinds of wonderful and amazing. There are things about it I just can't talk about. It's like a film, you don't want to give away what happens in the second half, or the last two-thirds. Most of these scenes, I'm sure, will come out in the next few months, as more and more people play it. The ending will be given away. It was actually spoiled for me, or at least a part of it. I still found it incredibly moving. There's this thing that happens, and I just couldn't believe the game made me do that. And then afterwards. It's been about 6 hours and my mind is still being blown when I think about it.  $15 for a 3.5 hour game (that's about what it took me) seems high, but it's worth every cent. It will probably go on sale, but this is one you will want to play before all your friends. Because hearing about those incredibly moving parts, wouldn't be the same as actually experiencing them.

Let it first be understood that I have an affinity for casual games with unique elements. That being said, Brothers has everything that I look for in a game: an interesting plot, a unique game mechanic, and a beautiful universe, among many other things. The first thing you notice about the game is the truly unique control system. The player controls two people simultaneously using the two analog sticks and just two buttons. This takes some getting used to but the game eases you into it before throwing tough puzzles that require some rather ambidextrous fingerwork at you, all the while providing you with a great soundtrack and one of the most beautiful and interesting surroundings. The world these two prothers live in is never said aloud but it was most likely inspired by the game writer's Nordic home. Although the brothers start in a small coastal village, they soon journey throughout their world, passing through neighboring towns, trolls' fortresses carved into mountains, cities inhabited by only frozen citizens and invisible giants, and even an epic battle fought between men taller than mountains. In each new place the boys enter, they try to save someone in need, or avoid getting sacrified, eaten, or frozen. It is worth noting that throughout the entire game, not a single word is spoken in any understandable language. Despite this, the game manages to elicit intense emotions as the brothers struggle with the world around them, those they meet, and each other on their quest to save their father. I have no shame in admitting that I may have shed a tear at the end. Overall, this game is one of the best I've ever played and would recommend wholeheartedly to anyone looking for an adventure of a lifetime.",

A very balanced one at that - the levels are not too easy to figure out, but not so difficult that make you resort to walkthroughs. It is tricky, but very interesting, to control two characters at once - and it does feel like you're playing co-op with yourself. While it's just a matter of moving the sticks and pressing the triggers, it doesn't feel repetitive because of the variety of actions that the brothers perform when pressing the trigger - plus, the little extra activities (that give you achievements) are a nice touch that break from the normal mechanics of the game.  Story wise, I have been blown away. The characters are brilliantly defined for a game that has no in-game lines. The way the two brothers interact differently with the same environmental items or NPCs work perfectly to give insights on their personalities in an indirect way. The main plot is quite standard, but I personally did not anticipate the ending, nor of course the various 'challenges' the brothers face on the way to their goal.   The game is also stunning graphically and musically - the theme is heartwrenching and the environments (beautifully designed) are illuminated gloriously, and they can be observed via the use of well-thought panoramic benches through the game. Tl;dr - this game is a joy to the eyes (and the ears).  Overall, play this game and you will not regret it. The only downside is that it's short (please don't look at my gameplay time on here - I played offline so that's not accurate, but I'd say it's probably around 4 hours) and because of the fact that puzzles can only be solved one way, I don't think there's much of a replayability factor.

You soon forget its linearity in favour of the unique artistic style and story, which is further enhanced by the use of a game controller to make the most of the dual character mechanic; sort of reminiscent of Banjo Kazooie for N64.  While it's not a difficult puzzle game, the characters help you become sucked into the story and you find yourself attached to them.  It's good for about 4 hours playtime with some replay value even if its just for the screenshots alone! I'm proud to say it's a 100% completion game which I can't recommend highly enough.

It's one of the few experiences that actually reminded me of how I remember my childhood: it started with a strong fairy tale feel where something is not quite right, and gradually grew progressively grim as the brothers were thrust into a world where children are not immune to hardship. Before playing it, I was concerned it would be another recycled story about annoying/sad/bratty stock-character kids, but I'm pleased to say that it's one of the more balanced and mature portrayals of children that shows them as human beings with an actual personality.  In terms of gameplay, the way they combined it with the story development makes Brothers one of gaming's gems: all the story is told through the environment and the interactions the player has with the world, and there is no (comprehensible) dialogue.   The best story moments are twists based on how you control both brothers in different situations. One of my favorite examples is an area where you need to avoid detection from a monster by hiding in specific positions behind frozen statues. Another is a battlefield for giants, where navigating the environment becomes a nice twist. All the areas you explore are filled with little contextual interactions that will make you will feel like you 'toy'with this unforgiving world and its inhabitants, just like a child would.   Complementing this approach is a truly special and stylized art direction, the kind that makes me stop and take screenshots every minute or so.The amount of soul &amp; care put in the details of this game, from memorable story moments to little interactions in the world, is rare to find in games nowadays.

You are dropped into a world which has a delightful charm on its own and control two main protagonists in which you solve puzzels and explore the fantasy world that Starbreeze has created. You are taken on an adventure with epic proportions with some helpful (and evil) characters who can help guide you and create a great tone for the game. One thing that I really found interesting about the game is that even though its charm gives off a somewhat happy tone for the game, however Starbreeze has shown in this game that no matter how the game looks you can also give off a very grim mood as well and I am glad that they chose to create a somewhat mature story that people can understand and possibly relate to the characters. The Starbreeze developers we're able to create a world with great visuals and also had a very simple goal in mind but allowed you to choose for yourself what really happened story wise by not giving the characters much oral interaction. Even though there isn't oral interaction between the characters (that we can understand), you can easily tell what emotions the characters are feeling and I think it was a fantastic feature.   I hope you enjoy this game as much a I did. I also hope that you forgive me that I left out a lot of information about the story because I would like you to experience it on your own and my input would most likely affect how you feel about the outcome.   ~Ratings~ -Visuals 10/10- -Sound 9/10- Could have seen maybe more ambient sounds at some points -Gameplay 9/10- Great puzzles however some trouble sometimes haveing the characters activate some keyparts in the puzzle or characters getting stuck (VERY RARELY) -Replayability 7/10- I would say if you beat this once you will most likely not play it again.

The scenery is gorgeous and the puzzles are fun (if not a little on the simple side). My favorite chapter is the one where you're traversing the corpses of fallen giants. No explanation is given or needed as to why there are newly fallen giants all over the place; in fact, each level has its own charm of unexplained circumstances. Nevertheless, the level design is superb and the mysteries of the chapters do not detract whatsoever from the experience. My only complaint is that the game is relatively short.",

The handling of the 2 brothers works perfectly with using the left side of the controller for 1 brother and the right side of the controller for the other brother. It is really confusing sometimes, specially when the brothers switch places, but the controls stay the same. I caught myself often using the wrong controls for the wrong brother. (left = long guy, right = small guy).   Also at first i been looking for language settings because they used a language I could not understand.

I received my Steam Controller a while ago and decided that I needed to get into the groove of using a controller. I've always used a keyboard and mouse combo, and this seemed like a great game to use the controller with, and I couldn't cheat and use KB/M since it is controller only.   Controls: The controls are very simple to use. A joystick to move and the trigger allow the brother to use their special move. The twist? You have to control both brothers at the same time. On the steam controller this meant using the joystick and the right touchpad. Was it useable? Definitely. Not to mention that it was easy enough for a controller noob like me to get used to.  Graphics: The graphics are very indie-ish. This isn't a demanding game at all, but what makes it special is how the graphics interact with the artwork and the background to create the story. The creators place benches around the game and through the brother's special moves, you are able to sit down and observe the scenery.   Music: The music fits the mood perfectly. From the funny and entertaining interactions that the brothers have with the other characters, to the scary and odd moments that leave you satisfied with the way that the scenes end.  Overall: Highly recommended. It is basically an interactive movie. The cut scenes meld together with storyline, audio, art and graphics that allow you to forget that you are playing a game. You will love entering the world of brothers trying to save their single father, all the while speaking an unknown language, and will have you crying by the end.",

With an emotional storyline placed within stunning landscapes flooded in vibrant lighting, Fares and Starbreeze perfectly combine single player co-op in the fantasy adventure of a lifetime. Rather simple in gameplay, both players who prefer casual and exciting gameplay will find something to enjoy. Players are faced with a variety of puzzels throughout their journey and also discover amusing (and depressing) achievements along the way. Chapters include beautifully animated cut-scenes that tug at the heartstrings. Gameplay will only last a few hours, but will leave players yearning for another day to play through this wonderful story.",

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an epic journey to understand what life is and create an everlasting bond with family. this is so well directed, written, designed and programmed.    Play this game, i recommend this. it's an enormous experience filled with joy, sadness and a heartfelt story. 10/10",

While the characters do not speak English, the body language, tone, and inflection they use makes it clear as to what they are trying to convey. The music matches the tone of the game and adds another layer of imersion to the story. Some people may try to turn you away from the game by saying it is short, and lacks re-playability. While these two points are true, the same could be said for a good book. Just because you do not intend on revisiting the work, doesn't mean that the amount of enjoyment you gained from playing it is worthless. It was worth every penny, but if you have doubts, wait for it to go on sale. It took me 3 hours to play through it, but it was non-stop because I had to complete the story before I put down my controller. The mechanics of the game are imaginative and innovative. You feel the weight of the characters hanging on the ledges because you control their ability to stay up there by using your own grip (LT/RT). If they fall, it is because you dropped them. You get to interact with so many different parts of the game. There are even different interactions put in for the different brothers. If you interact with a person/object with one, the other may do something silly instead. While those choices do not often affect the game, they can be pretty entertaining. I would reccomend this game to anyone and everyone.",

You explore, solve puzzles, and survive. I wasn't blown away much of the time by the diversity and quality of the interactions, but overall pretty good.

Turns out it's a fantastic adventure game with some pretty original ideas. Basically you play as two brothers. Playing with a controller, you control the older brother with the left stick and left trigger and the younger brother with the right stick and right trigger. The older brother is stronger and taller than the younger one who can get through tight places. Then you start making your way to this huge magical tree to get its healing juices for your dying father. During your way there you encounter lots of different people and creatures, some of which are bumholes and some of which you'll want to help. There's some puzzles and lots of platforming, each of which needs the brothers to bro-operate in order to get past the various obstacles.  The world feels huge, and not just because there's giants everywhere. You go from a tiny sort of swedish village to troll dungeons to winter wonderlands and graveyards. All of the dialogue is in gibberish and yet the game manages to convey the story and the feelings of the two brothers perfectly to the player. Without spoiling anything, there are things in the world that make you wonder what happened there, or things that are currently happening that make you want to know the backstory of it all. It gives more meaning to the world around you, while leaving the details to your own imagination. All of this combined with the great soundtrack creates a really magical atmosphere where it feels like some sort of a very depressing but beautiful fairytale fantasy world.   All in all the game is very enjoyable and emotional. The idea of controlling two characters at the same time in this way is something I personally haven't seen any other game do before, and it works.

Note that the keyboard is only able to register 2 keys pressed at once, not 4.  2. Incredible Story I love how touching the story is at the beginning, although I do begin to doubt the wisdom of the physician. Sending 2 young kids to search for a magic water while putting their lives at risk does sound a bit irresponsible.  3. Imaginative and Immersive World Trolls, Giants, Giant Orcas, Ice Sea Turtles, Invisible Ice Monsters, Spider Woman, Blood of Giant Tribes, Hippogryphs, Hang Gliders, Monster Roots/Trees, these are just some of my favourite things.  4. Interactions It's amazing how you can interact with so many things e.g. Spitting into a well, each additional well you spit into adds another spit droplet. Picking up balls and playing basketball. Not only that, each brother has his own unique interaction with an object.  5. Puzzles Easy for kids and fun to pick apart. E.g. Trapping the troll in the cage while hiding behind walls.  CONS 1. Slight repetition Some of wall puzzles show some similarity to previous puzzles. It does not make sense that so many locations conveniently have a broken ladder for you to climb. ",

            "review_text": "Recommended, but not the masterpiece it's hyped up to be.  I don't remember how I came to own this game. Probably a Humble Bundle, but not sure. What I do know is that I didn't pay the asking price of $15, and it's not worth it at that price.   So, what is it? It's a game about two brothers trying to find a miracle cure for their father, who appears to be terminally ill. I say appears to be because nothing in the game is actually explained. You're expected to come up with the how's and why's of everything you encounter, similar to a 'create your own adventure' type game, only your adventure is down a straight and narrow path.   The controls are simple. I used a 360 controller and everything comes down to four buttons. Left stick controls older brother, right stick controls younger brother, left trigger makes older brother grab things, right trigger makes younger brother grab things. Simple as you like.   Let's get into the actual game, shall we. For roughly two hours, you'll guide the two brothers to their destination, doing very basic platforming, repeatedly. There really is no challenge to it, no thought required. As you do the very basic platforming, you come across some rather interesting landscapes. Herein lies one of the two main issues I have with the game. You'll come accross some interesting stuff in your journey. However, nothing, and I do mean absolutely nothing, is explained. As I mentioned earlier, you're left to come up with your own reasons for what you're seeing. Some people may enjoy that. I really didn't. Thought and care obviously went into the game world, so why not give an explanation as to what is going on? SPOILERS AHEAD:  For instance, one part of your journey takes you through an area littered with the bodies of freshly dead giants. The actual gameplay through this area is quite brilliant, but I kept thinking to myself, 'what happened here?' The answer never appeared. Soon, I was traversing through a new part of the land, the giants completely forgotten.  The other problem I have with it is how MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:    The older brother dies. Let's recap his death shall we? They rescue a girl from some religious fanatics. The older brother shows her the map of where they need to go, and she leads the way. Eventually, she guides the brothers into a cave, where she inexplicably turns into a spider and attempts to kill them. What transpires is a very easy boss fight in which the the brothers work together and rip off her legs. Of course, while ripping off her last leg, the older brother gets stabbed in the chest. When this happened I just said to myself. 'alright, you ripped of the other five legs with no problem , now you get shanked? Lol.' Also, why would a spider posing as a girl get caught by religious fanatics? This happened a good distance away from her cave, BTW. As in, she had no reason to be there.  Also a small gripe I had is the ending. The ending is very somber, yet the music has this fantasy action hero type vibe. It's really strange and didn't fit at all, at least to me.   All in all, this game was decent. Had the potential to be great, but forcing the player to come up with reasons for everything happening in the game really took away from it. The platforming was also so basic that it didn't feel like much of a game. It felt like reading a pop-up story more than playing a video game. There is no replayability here. The $15 asking price is way too steep. Thankfully, the game seems to be on sale a lot. If you don't own it and want to play it, $5 or less is what you should pay.",

I was just a seconds away from breaking down like a little girl. What an emotinal journey.  Ahem. OK, here's the review. The game follows the story of two brothers who go on an adventure to save their father, who has a serious disease and the cure is literally on the other side of the world. They overcome lots of different problems (mostly platforming) on their journey and they even escape some life-threatening situations.  The developers managed to create an incredible world filled with hundreds of little bits of lore, something even some AAA titles, with huge budgets and an army of lore-masters, cannot manage. The atmosphere just pulls you in and never lets you go until the end. I really regret that I had to play this game in multiple sessions instead of in just one sitting. I suppose the atmosphere, the satisfaction I felt after I finished the game would be much more profound that way.  The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. The game has one of the most goosebump-inducing soundtracks I've ever listened to. It suits the mood, the story so well that you'd think they made the game for the song, not the other way around.  The game is made with Unity engine (I think) and the graphics are very nice. I mean, it's not like they are cutting edge but the style they used for the game is incredibly atmospheric. A photorealistic game engine would really ruin the mood instead of enhancing it.  I played the game with an Xbox controller, and I have to admit, even with the controller the game was sometimes really difficult, some puzzles difficult to coordinate. Still, I had no real trouble. I really, really suggest a controller though; the game would probably be impossible to play with a keyboard.  All in all, I haven't felt this emotional thanks to a game since To the Moon. If you're looking for a game with an emotional story, perfect soundtrack and a cathartic ending, this is it.",

It's powerful plotline and course of events even made me do something that I have not within a very longtime; cry for the brothers' and their hard life, and also wish that they would not have had to go through this tough endeavor.

            "review_text": "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is an adventure game where a single player controls two brothers as they search for a cure for their fathers illness. While in many games the function of controls is to be simple and allow the player to function as easily as possible, Brothers uses controls for more. The older brother is moved with the left stick and performs actions with the left trigger while the younger brother uses the right side of the controller. Initially this feels weird and you may get your movements criss crossed. But over the course of the adventure (which runs between 3 and 4 hours) you will get a feel for each brothers movements and characteristics. Not only does technical control increase over time but also a very strange physiological-emotional connection forms. This results in what I felt was higher emotional payoff during key parts of the game, especially the ending.  The game has an absolutely beautiful presentation. The characters are all charming and the multitude of environments are all very screenshot worthy. The world of the game is well constructed and feels very active in the places you only see at a distance. I got the feeling that I was in the middle of some northern european folk tale. The soundtrack is often sparse, using natural sounds from the environment, but when music is used it is done so for maximum emotional effect. There is little to no dialog in the game, just the brothers calling each other's names or expressive noises. This is fine though because the characters use very expressive body language to get information across.  This is probably one of the more unique games I've played in a while and I'm really scrounging to find something I didn't like. Its not very long, but a lot happens and its an enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend this game.  As a side note apparently this game CAN be played with keyboard and mouse. I tried it and would discourage this. This game was made with a controller in mind and the controls are an important part of the experience.",

            "review_text": "The game lacked a lot of impact for me and the story wasn't anything to write home about. However it was still a nice experience and the art style and graphics are quite nice.  (I played this game entirely on the xbox 360 gamepad by the way.)  This game felt like a dark childrens book, it was quite whimsical at times, very funny and silly, but it got hauntingly dark too. And thankfully, without remorse. That, is a very strong mark for this game. I think this may be a spoiler, but I was really expecting it to undo what it had done. I am very glad that it didn't.  Before I get to where I want to go, I want to talk about the controls. The controls tangled your fingers up into a knot, I don't really mind that. But with the very simple control layout, this game controlled very basically. The controls were not interesting in the slightest and really it just boiled down to building a control scheme onto that same controller in essence. Wasn't really anything ground breaking. You could change your camera view, move two characters with the analouge sticks. And then you have two action triggers/keys, for each of the respective characters. So really you'd just move around and press the action trigger/key and see what happens.  By the way, this game's store page lied, you DON'T need a xbox 360 controller to play this game. You can play it on the keyboard too as I could tell in the options menu.   Anyway, I don't really know how to explain why it felt like and experience to me over a story. Perhaps it has to do with how shallow everything felt regarding characters. I felt like absolutely no one had a real backstory or depth besides the young boy. Using them to interact with the world had very expressive reactions. The older brother was boring, he was completely neutral the entire story and just struck me as a faceless robot kind of chugging along on this quest. Even his 1 flashback was really shallow and boring and felt irrelevant. It just reminded me of the father i'm trying to save. It didn't give the brother any face-value and only seemed to show aggression to his brother at time when his brother was unokay with something. That or he'd just show leadership or be protective of his brother. Other than that, he had absolutely no depth whatsoever and he was easily forgettable. Really, I felt only interested in him cause he looked cool. I didn't like the little brother because he looks like a doof to me. But after watching the little bothers events and personality and backstory unfold a little bit (not enough I'd say) he was much more interesting and likeable.  Next up is the graphics. Graphics were good, I mean. I am unsure about the detailing, at times they felt not shaded enough, detailed enough, or they didn't flow together well enough. Though the graphics and displays and scenery was good enough to definitely warrant a second playthrough with your finger on the steam screencapture key, that's for sure. Definitely good desktop wallpaper material in here. Also can be aspring for some artists I can imagine.   There were some moments of tenseness in this game, surprisingly. As the game got progressively dark and took a really unexpected dip into limbo-like depressive stuff all of a sudden. I think there was only one or two parts that really made me have to actually pay attention to my controls, very sure it was once only. And that was a damn good part, glad it wasn't necessary to the story, felt very important to me though. And I like that, i'm glad I got a opportunity to side-track in the game and find things that were important to me instead of the characters. It was nice.  That being said, this games trip into darkness and doing scenarios that aren't often done in video games was truly surprising and i'm really glad they didn't regret any of the decisions they decided to do in it. Because I feel like that's what saved the game for me a little bit. It was a nice journey and it was fun and relaxing. Most deaths in this game really only occur when the controls are a little too unclear, but you figure out what went wrong almost immediately, so it's not big deal.  That being said, I'd really like to give the developers a BIG thumbs up to one part they made me do. It was something I never want to do in a video game ever again, it just felt all kinds of wrong and messed up to me. I'd like to compliment another part about it, but. I won't, cause spoilers. But, it was good. And i'm glad you didn't reverse it.   Also, lastly. The music. ...It was really easy to ignore it. It really was. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything to remember. When my mind actually did pick up some of the tracks, I was instantly dissuaded to bother youtube searching it because that same track felt like a reoccuring theme in any 'deep' moments. Whenever something interested happened or a cutscene happened, tracks that sound like that song I heard. Sounded just like remixed versions of it with added or removed instruments and spacing between instrument play times and so on so forth to fit the timing they wanted to match or feelings they wanted to convey in the cut scenes. So the only interesting track was pretty much just rehashed to me in a uninteresting way and most of the scenes were impactful. Even the ones that were supposed to bother you. Also with that, I don't get why they put this skyrim-sounding song at the end of the game. It really made no sense, it was all epic and then nothing happened. After everything that happened in the game, it made absolutely no sense when it played. It didn't match the mood of what was going on at all. I don't know who's choice that was, but it wasn't a good one.  Anyway, while the game was lackluster in personality I feel, as far as experience goes it was quite something and it was definitely a pleasurable way to spend my morning and part of my afternoon. I would recommend this to someone who wouldn't mind going on a enjoyable light puzzle/adventure. If you want to get your hands on this game, sure, I suppose 14.99 is a fair asking price. However I think paying ten bucks for this product is a good buy, any less than that is too low for what you're getting.   Anyways, thanks for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to get this game or not. Have a good one.",

The game requires a controller to play which kinda sucks and doesn't make it accessable to all but it's SO worth it if you do own one. You control two brothers at the same time and make your way through the world one adventure at a time by solving simple puzzles. This way you experience co-op play like never before. On to some details without spoiling, all Im saying is that I have never ever been this emotional after finishing a game, the ending is just overwelming and amazing. The weird thing about this game is that it has no dialogue, I mean it's weird right? But they speak in this random language that you can't even figure out at all but you actually don't need to know what they are saying because it helps you form the story for yourself. Most of the cutscenes are quite long but extreamly touching esspecially near the end! I wish it was a bit longer though and DLC would make it even more epic but worthy buy. Simply just great, emotional and such an awesome story!",

This game features an absence of dialogues, which allows the player to imagine what the characters are trying to say from their nonverbal communication and a journey filled with challenges and puzzles that are only solvable if both brothers cooperate with each other. Besides the superb and engaging plot, the environments are truly amazing, the soundtrack is great and the game mechanics are pretty simple. I recommend playing with a gamepad, as it's much more immersive than playing with a keyboard. Every single aspect of this game is just superb and Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons triggers an emotional response on the player as it portraits how families stay together and cooperate to overcome problems in the most difficult times. I highly recommend Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons.",

            "review_text": "I'lll be honest: I can hardly recommend this game.  It does not mean that it's a bad game, far from that.  Let's start with the  cons :  Life-time : the game took me less than 3 hours to complete, and the only motives to replay is to obtain the achievements. So yes, the game is incredibily short.  Gameplay : it's very original because you can control the two brothers at the same time, and it's also very simple, you just use 4 buttons (two analogics and RT and LT). But unfortunately is also very confusing and it's almost impossible to domain it perfectly, it just messes up your brain, it's very hard to control two characters at the same time, specially when you have to control them in diffferent directions...  Puzzles : They rarely challlenge you, pretty basic from the beginning to the end of the game. The only challenge here are the somewhat frustrating controls.  Now, the  pros !  Story : A beautiful and simple story, but also very cold, dark and sad. Nothing too original, sometimes predictable, but still emotionally strong, even the coldest person will have his heart touched.  Graphics : Colorful, detailed, fairytale-like, sometimes it even makes you stop in the game just to watch the background, the nature, etc. The scenarios are also very varied!  Sound : It's incredible how the story is told and so well understandable through mumblings (the characters speak a Sims-like language). The soundtrack is also good. Nothing too extraordinary, but it does well its job.    Final thoughts: A real, simple and pure fairytale, told without words, that turns out epic with his sad moments that makes your eyes sweat. The thing is, even though the game is really good, it's also very short, specially when it costs 15$/€, and the gameplay is unimproved. So, I'll highly recommend it to you if you find it in a sale (I bought it for 3€ in Summer sales 2014), but for the fulll price I can't say the same thing, it's very expensive for a so short content. So, it's up to you!  Still, a great game that you can't miss (for the right price)!",

The controls we're alright, kind of hard to get use to especially on the controller. I also ran into a bug half way through that didn't let me move on for about an hour. That was pretty frustrating and probably skewed my whole experience with the game. The different places/levels we're really cool to go through.  My recommendation is to play this all in one go. It's not very difficult, the puzzles we're all pretty easy. The hardest part is remembering which controls go with each brother. Hence why I suggest doing it in one go. You'll know the controls better by the last half. If you encounter a bug, change the resolution - (the bug I'm talking about is the rope swinging one. You'll know it).   Overall, very unique game. I didn't really connect with any of the characters. It's not really surprising what happens in the end but you get emotional anyway. Not comparable to a really sad game like A Bird Story but still good. I don't think this even jumps into my top games but it's a nice game for 15 dollars.",

            "review_text": "Long rant here:  There's a lot of things it does very right and few thing it does very, VERY wrong.  B:ATOTS does a good job at world building. It has its own made up language that characters spout as you walk through the ruins of places meant for people bigger than you. It's actually a lot like Shadow/Colossus in that sense, made less lonely by the fact that there's 2 of you. The town you start off in has a great deal of character in itself and even though it's linear, there's still a sense that it's a real place that you just happen to know your way around. This is helped by the camera, which some people have complained about because the game can't decide if you should be able to move the camera on your own or be subject to cinematic angles, but I'm one of those people who drives around in GTA in cinematic mode so I got used to it pretty quickly. It gives a sense of guidance in some of the more open sections of the game.   The core gameplay is basic 3D adventure/platforming made unique by the fact that you control 2 characters at once, the big brother with the left stick/trigger, and the little brother with the right. The game is probably too short for most people to fully get the hang of these controls, so aside from the core mechanic, the game is very easy. Easy might be a negative for some of you. I don't know.   If you aren't really worried about your dying father, you can interact with almost anything in the game. You can sit down on a bench and enjoy the view, which the game never falters on making sure is nothing short of eye candy. On top of that, you can butt in on other people and examine objects, and there's a good amount of character development for each brother because they interact with everything differently.   The differences between the 2 brothers is also expertly displayed in the gameplay. There are a handful of people/things you have to interact with in order to progress. The little bro comes across as carefree/immature with everything he interacts with, and is no help in getting to the next part of the game. The big bro is calmer but takes initiate when needed. Also, a lot of the puzzles involve playing to each brother's strengths. The only thing the little bro can do is sqeeze through tight spaces, but the big bro can operate levers, lift things, carry the little bro while he's swimming, and ward off wolves. In the narrative, almost everything is from the little bro's perspective.   Basically, little bro is the 'main' main character and big bro is someone you depend on. Being an oldest child, I find this a little exploitave, but whatever, it's done well. Most of the early puzzles start with big bro taking initiative and hoisting little bro up somewhere so that he can return the favor. There are a few later moments where little bro carries the load but for the most part, big bro does the work. In the end when big bro gets dies (oh yeah spoilers btw), the powerlessness of little bro is really felt and the bursts of strength at the end are made all the more powerful by this.   There's a phrase thrown around a lot creative writing, 'Show Don't Tell.' In games, you can take it a step further and say 'Do Don't Show.' The final moments of the game serve as some of the best examples of this that I've seen so far. The time the game takes to make you understand the reliance little bro has on big bro is done through all of the same-y puzzles and little cutscenes where big bro knows what he's doing and little bro follows along. In every interaction and ambient moment, big bro presses on while little bro acts childish. A few moments are taken to address little bro's coping with loss and his internal feelings, mainly during the scene where his gaint mom watches as big bro strangles him for concievably being the one at fault for their mom's death. A rather touching moment is displayed when that ends and is revealed to be big bro saving and comforting him. No words (at least not any real ones), and yet everything is made very clear.  There's a battle with a giant spider and a seemingly endless ending (like Lord of the Rings), and in the ending there's a part I mentioned where big bro dies. It's pretty sad, but it's truly heart-wrenching when you have to take the time to bury him. Little bro is very slow and weak, and it takes forever to drag him over and bury him while little bro sobs. It's almost like you're the bad guy for moment, making him bury his brother, and that part will stick with me. The redemptive scene afterwards where little bro learns to swim and does the puzzles on his own are all the more powerful when you use big bro's controls to help him. It's a clear understanding of the influence big bro had, and frankly it's genius.   Now with all I have just said, you might think this deserves that Overwhelmingly Positive review it's got, but here's where things get shady:  I was content to call this my new favorite game until one moment took me out of the experience. After you leave the town with the help of some Orcs, you start trekking up a mountain. On the way up there's a small area where a man is attempting to hang himself. If you act quickly, you can stop him. You do this by having big bro hold him up and little bro climbs up to untie the rope. Afterwards, the man falls to the ground and weeps, saying nothing at all, and does this permanently. All the brothers do is give him a pat on the back and carry on with nary a bit a dialogue. You can also look around in this little area and see a burnt house with the man's dead family burnt to a crisp. Now it'd be a tragedy no doubt if the brothers watched a man hang himself, but I think it's WAY more ♥♥♥♥ed up that they stop him and leave with no condolences. The man is just left there to wollow in misery over his now non-existent home. At least later when big bro died, little bro had some closure with the burial. But no, this man's dead family isn't as important, so we must move on. It's almost insulting that immediately after this part, you encounter a looney dancing scientist who charitably gives you a hang-glider as you fly off to more adventures. It's a drastic and really unnecessary shift in tone.  The next chapter in the game is the Shadow/Colossus part where you come across the aftermath of a battle fought by huge soilders. It's grim and bloody and serves as a definitive shift in tone for the game; you're away from home, you are no longer safe. It would have been a great transition if it weren't for the attempted suicide mere minutes ago. The game progresses a bit more and you come across a woman about to be killed. You save her and she helps you for a while. She's almost Superwoman with her strength and agility (kinda wasted by the fact that she only helps you like 2 times) and a bit of character comes out of big bro as you get a little sense of romance between them. This leads to big bro's only real slip-up where he opts to follow the girl into a spooky cave rather than go where the cure for his father is. Considering everything the big brother has done up to this point, I think it's against his character but it's not quite a deal-breaker like the suicide man. This leads to the woman turning into a spider and big bro getting injuried, which leads to that ending I like.  The reason I hate the suicide man so much is that it brought up a thing that the game was doing the whole time; being emotionally manipulative for no good reason. It's either Disney-levels of happy or gut-wrenching sadness, with no real resolve at the end. Sure, Lil' bro becomes stronger and stoic like big bro, but that was just for the sake of one happy moment. Remember the most recent Tomb Raider where they tried to make Lara Croft relatable by just beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of her? Same thing here. I didn't actually like little bro, I just felt sorry for him, even with the ending.  I guess if a game gave me that much to talk about, it deserves a recommendation, but only barely.",

But do not take me lightly though for that, this game also has other words that easily descibes it. One: Simple Two: Beautiful And Three: Maticulously Artistic. Now I'll tell you why I chose the words. One: Simple, Though it may not look a ton like it from a skim over it's actually a lot of fun. Basically It's a simple layout with a (Two) Unique gameplay. The Uniqueness is more than the fact your in a fantasized world. It's the movements speed differences between the two brothers. The best part of the game was doing the easter eggs also known as the achievements. Actually it's not only the achievements/easter eggs that are funny.The little brother is the little trouple maker despite how inoccent he looks from the start. The older is more mature but he's still young and does make a couple of mistakes. lastly Three: These DEV's had such a mind for fantasy that it blew my mind. Some things in the game I've not seen in many games. And all of the ESRB's rating for blood is true actually. It's only gorey at the last two chapters, not super bad though. The views in the game are unbelievable. The DEV's actually set up benches that when you sat down in them it was a perfect view always! Perfect for screenshots trust me. And that's all I have to say about this'n. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did!!!",

Pros  The gameplay: Controlling the brothers is difficult at first, but within the first 30 minutes it will feel completely natural.  The Graphics: Similar to the Fable series, this games graphics are exactly like something out of a fantasy world. The Story: It's told without a single word of english, yet the bonds formed with the characters is stronger than almost every other video game in existance. The Ending: No spoilers, but the ending is one of the most gut-wrenching experiences I've seen in my entire time of gaming.   Cons   Time: It's a fairly short game (3-4 hours), but it is one of those games that could be played through multiple times without it becoming dull   Conclusion  This is an experience like no other, but don't take it from me or the countless others, buy a copy and see for your self. Don't, I repeat don't watch a playthrough of this game, you need to play through it (preferably in one sitting)  10/10 a must buy",

A really Great Story driven game, if you want a game worth of playing this is a must have for you!  Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 8/10 (Via controller comfortable! when you need to control both, but its needs time to master both brothers @ same time1)  Graphics: 8/10 (Cell Shadered game but maybe that´s why i did feel so sad and loved the game)  Support: ?/10 (not needed, leave it out for my Rating)  Price: 7/10 (The game is really Great but 15€ for such a short game feels to much for me)  Story: 10/10 (One of my Fav. Story´s!)  Sound: 10/10 (Music, Voiceacting etc let you feel the Atmosphere the game want to produce)  Performance: 10/10 (No lagging etc and also the brothers works both great controlling them when needed)  FAZIT: 8.8/10 (Totally worth playing but wait for a sale since it is really short!)",

Its a rather easy and straight forward game, but its journey and puzzles you take along the way is where this game shines. By the end I almost wept. Starbreeze has been, in my opinion, a dev to avoid because theyve made such shallow(console/casual focus) titles lately, but its obvious that when theyre not being whipped by the big console publishers they can be an innovative and creative team. Heres to hoping for more PC games from them that isnt dictated by the evil casual/console focus publishers",

Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is very pretentious and serious about itself, it touches some sensitive matters like death, love, fear, friendship and treachery. But it presents all this things so bad, it isn't even funny. It's like a low-grade TV soap opera with really bad actors. Just painful to watch and play.  Characters are not likeable and don't evoke any sympathy. Gameplay is repetitive. Controlling two characters at a time is somewhat interesting idea, but puzzles built around that are trivial.  It boggles me how much positive reviews this game has! How is this possible!? I wouldn't have written this review in the first place if it wasn't for the fact that it seems everyone on the Internet thinks the game is great and wonderful.  I played to the end, hoping to find even the slightest thing that would touch me and make me like this game, but I didn't find anything. The only things I _really_ liked were beautiful scenery and architecture.  In the end I think that overall pretentioussness and cheesiness killed the game for me. I would have even tolerated the not very interesting but good enough gameplay. But the plot and the characters are the core part of this game and you can't ignore them.  I suppose developers worked hard on this game and tried to make it good, but, sorry, I just can't recommend it to anyone.",

It also is lacking in replayablity when it comes to giving you a challenge, because once you figure out what you should be doing, completing each section becomes rather trival although like a movie or any other narrative based media you can always enjoy a rewatch (or in this case replay.)

Unfortunately, there's not much sweet (or effectively somber) about it. The game's tone switches from 'adventure!' to 'prevent a survivor from committing suicide' to 'adventure!' to 'free a maiden from a somewhat offensive spear-weilding tribe' too often, and not with the art that allows better dramas to make you laugh, cry, and laugh again.  The problem, I suspect, is that the game offers up very little to think about as you blindly push Forward from setpiece to setpiece. The world is full of sadness and loss, clearly meant to echo the loss of the Brothers' mother and the potential loss of their father, but there's rarely much commentary or depth to these scenes, just flavors of loneliness. Then, when the game abruptly moves on to riding mountain goats for fun, it's clear that the action scenes don't serve as meaningful counterpoint to the sadness you keep being witness to. During these patches of straightforward nagivation puzzles, there's simply not much to think about. The relationship of the brothers doesn't change, nor do their fears or hopes. They're curiously static against a constantly changing backdrop of sadness and lighthearted adventure. It's hard to put into words, but the game's insistence on dwelling on the world's misery without considering it more deeply makes the whole experience feel like spending a room with a person in the middle of a bad breakup: neither insightful nor very much fun.",

Or maybe my high-hopes were to blame. Either way, I have little doubt the advocates of this game will disagree with me and down-vote this, but I think another opinion should be shared on this title. I was unanimously dissapointed with the areas all the positive reviewers raved about.  The story it tells is generic and bland. It does a good job of telling it, but that hardly makes the story itself any better or worth hearing.   The controls are not 'cool and innovative'. I think 'different' is the nicest way to describe it - other choice words would be 'Wonky', 'terrible', 'infuriating', or 'irritating'. After a few hours of play time, I may be more effective at using them, but it hardly makes them better.  I heard the art praised by many. IMO (Isn't this all? It is MY review...) The art seems to be bland, flat even. Additionally the fidelity leaves alot to be desired - it clearly a (last gen) console game.  The soundtrack is fairly decent. As I mentioned before, the storytelling is quite good, though I believe making the characters mute would have accomplished more dramatic effect than the mumbo-jumbo type noises they make.   I picked this game up on the steam sale for 75% off I believe. I would wait for it to be a $0.99 game before recommending it. At the end of the day, I feel like I've played this game before, many times over. If you're looking for a console port game that is great with a controller and gives you an AWESOME art style, I would point you over towards 'From Dust: an Elysian Tale'.",

I have not finished it, but I have played more than 90 minutes (according to most gameplay time I think am at around 50% of the game). I will try to be as objective as I can about the merits and the flaws of this game so far. The game starts with a simple, not-very-touching-but-okayish intro. Truth be told, the atmosphere got me. It was nice and smooth and fairytale-ish. The first thing I noticed which I really appreciated was that they opted not to have the characters speak in any language, but instead using random phonemes that resemble speech -- reminded me of Legend of Zelda. The atmosphere remained beautiful throughout the game, and is possibly the only really good thing about this game, in my opinion.  The second thing I noticed about the game was literally in the first 2 minutes. 'Do I really have to just sit here and keep control and space pressed simultaneously for about one minute without doing anything else?'. Yes. Apparently, I did have to do that in order to lift an elevator. This particular 'Is this really what I have to do? Are you kidding me?' feeling has kept accompanying me for the following 90 minutes. This game literally takes zero skill and zero thought. Don't get me wrong, I may be a hardcore gamer but I always appreciate games that are simpler gameplay-wise and emphasize more on other elements. However, this game overdoes it with simplicity and is boring to death. Most of the time you will just find yourself pressing one button per minute, here and there you will have to keep two buttons pressed at once for a few seconds. Sometimes I honestly felt like I was guiding two physically and mentally challenged kids. 'Go on boy, climb that rock. Yes. Good. Now climb that other rock. Good job. Now let's walk on that ledge'. Let's take Trine and Trine 2 as an example so I can further prove my point. Those games have a nice storyline, FANTASTIC atmosphere, but still they require skill and puzzle solving. They're not just a one-trick pony with their fantasy graphics and atmosphere. Brothers, on the other hand... I honestly felt the need to press more buttons, do more things other than walk and climb rocks and walk on ledges.  As far as the story goes, so far - I repeat, at 50% of the game - I don't think I have ever really felt emotionally touched. I do not believe what some other people have mentioned, that whether you have a brotherly bond in real life or not plays an important role in the way you perceive the game emotionally. I have 4 siblings and I have very strong bonds with all of them and lots of childhood memories with my closest brother. I never felt a 'brotherly bond' coming off the two protagonists, nor did I feel like 'Oh wow, this makes me feel as if the older brother is my brother and the younger brother is me'. Other than that, I don't know, I just feel like there's no real plot, let alone emotion. I could get more feelings by reading a 3 paged kids' fairytale than I have gotten from this game so far.  I still have the curiosity to see what the ending's all about though, so I will update this review once I finish the game.  From my current experience with the game though, I repeat: No clue why everyone is so attached to this game and why it's considered so great. If you want a game that requires any semblance of skill or hand-to-eye coordination or mental challenge, stay away from this game. You will find none of the above.",

Story is a big part of games, yes. In the case of Brothers it's about the only part of the game.  When you're creating art, one of the most important choices you make is what medium to create it in. You consider the advantages and disadvantages of each format, and choose what best fits your goals. If your goals are for a person to sit there with minimal effort and thought so they can consume a good story, you should not choose 'video game' as your medium. These people did. They could have chosen to make a great short film - instead, they decided to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game. Don't buy it.",

There is zip dialog (we'll cure the foreign distribution and language issue by using grunts and gestures while avoiding the expense of voice actors). There were other aspects of the game that suggested that it was made on the cheap like an invisible NPC, crude graphics in one chapter, limited camera angles, poor proportions for some items, etc.  Achievements really aren't for merit or difficulty. They seem like an after-thought and more related to finding Easter eggs in the game than showing any skill or working out anything difficult.  There is no plot beyond a quest to get a magic item to save the boys' dad, After all the trouble, there is a disappointing ending that presumably was to make you feel sad and think that doing good requires sacrifice or some such.   It had some high points like flying a glider, but the mean average is below zero in my oipinion. Basically this game is as flat as a pancake when it comes to excitement.

The wannabe-emotional and hamfisted tear-jerkers strewn about are so hollow, they're ridiculous.  Art direction, animation and character models are nice enough on their own, but not enough to redeem this game. In turn, the music ranges from 'crap' to 'barely mediocre' and the sound effects are unimaginative and lackluster.   This game would've been interesting for an hour or two back when gamepads with analog sticks were new. WOW! You have to use both of them at once! Press the triggers and move the sticks around! Sometimes even in a circle! Incredible what can be done with them 'contrulars' or whatchammacallit. This is the equivalent to the first Kinect or Wii games, clumsily trying to find a purpose, a justification for their control mechanism to exist. But it fails miserably.

I was surprised at how they avatars worked together to get solutions to problems and I am really enjoying the game. I do not own a controller yet, but I will by the end of this week.   I found the game to be short, somewhat easy as I am not used to controllers and a keyboard is not easy to use, but can be done. I read a few reviews before buying the game, but I had intended to buy the game anyway because of the story.  The music was very well done and not repetitive. Usually on a game, I would turn the volume down of turn off the music, but in this game, the music helps to set the mood and is just as important in gameplay as anything else.  The opening sequence is very important. The first time I watched it, it took me by surprise. I won't ruin it by going into it, but It think it will be better to day that this is a game about a story and the story is quite emotional if you get involved into the game. I did. Bring tissues.  Take to time to admire the scenery. The artwork is...breathtaking! I buy a lot of games for the stories they tell, but rarely do I get a game that the story and the graphics are on the same or better par than anything I have ever seen. And the characters are almost lifelike in their attitudes and actions. As an example, I sat the younger brother on a park bench and watched him play for a few minutes. The younger brother's movements were so lifelike, you could almost think it was modeled after a real child.  I have to say, I rarely buy games of this type, but I am starting to think that I may have missed something by not playing them. This game may get me into playing more. I would also like to mention that this game is one of the cheapest games that I have purchased for my PC, but it has a permanent place in my library and my heart.   Buy this game. It needs to be played and enjoyed. Not everyone will 'get it' or really immerse themselves into it. Those that do not will miss something. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",

You control two simulaneous characters (the brothers) to perform pakour and solve interactive puzzles. This may seem a bother at first, but it flows well when you get the coordination down. I used the keyboard and picked up the controls within the first few minutes. So don't let that aspect bother you.  The only thing missing is they seem to work closely together without any bickering. But alas, this is a fantasy game so this type of realism would detract from the setting.  Besides the obvious puzzle mechanism interactions, there are plenty of places to explore where each of the brothers personalities stand out. One example is the harp player, where each attempts to play the harp with mixed results.  Sit back and enjoy this adventure.",

The controls are about as simple as can be (I used a dual-analog gamepad, so not sure how it plays on keyboard) with only one stick and one button per brother, and two buttons for rotating the camera view.

            "review_text": "Brothers: A tale of Two sons Review  There are games that exist merely with the intent of making us feel like the ultimate bad ♥♥♥, there are games that test our reflexes and our minds, and then there are games like Brothers: a tale of two sons. An emotional adventure that has sealed a place in my hearts with its brilliant sets and memorable characters. Let’s take a look at this little masterpiece.  Story.  Brothers: a tale of two sons is a story about you guessed it brothers and their quest to a magical tree that holds the antidote to their father’s illness. Armed with nothing but a map and each other, these boys set off on a magical adventure that takes them to a strange land where it becomes clear that they don’t quite belong. You can go ahead and argue until your blue in the face about silent protagonists and how they are old fashioned and how you can’t get an emotional connection with the characters if they have nothing to say but that’s just untrue. These two boys show more emotion and character in a few hours than most triple A protagonists do across an entire series. The amount of emotion expressed in each movement and each grunt and nonsensical language they speak, speaks volumes to their personalities and thoughts. I can’t overstate enough about the emotional impact and will delve deeper in my story review but the tale of these two sons is one story I won’t be forgetting anytime soon.  Gameplay.  As far as the Gameplay goes there’s not much to be said here. It’s your typical puzzle solving gameplay where two protagonists each with their own unique abilites help each other through varies situations. The catch this time is that each of the brothers is controlled by an opposing analog stick on your controller. Being the uncoordinated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I am I did find the control scheme to be quite bothersome at times. Having the wrong brother running ahead while his younger sibling is plowing into a wall can be frustrating at times but luckily there isn’t any platforming that needs to be so precise that this becomes to much of an issue. As far as the actual puzzles go there isn’t anything too complex but I will give credit to the section of the game where you are roped together with your sibling as easily the highlight in the gameplay category. All in all the game is fun to play even if it is annoying at times.  Presentation  The world that Starbreeze Studio created for this game is emaculate. The amount of mystery and wonder behind each section was breathtaking. I kept wondering to myself as I was playing, what’s going on here, what are these guys doing, what kind of creature lives here?” the entire time I was playing. The art direction is fantastic even having spots where your character can sit down and enjoy the beautiful scenery. From great mountain views to creepy castles all the way to terrifying caves. The diversity in presentation is something to admire in this title.   Brothers a tale of two sons is an experience very little games these past few years that I have played have been able to accomplish. The amount of emotion put into these characters and the journey these boys go on is a one of a kind experience that no one should miss out on. Tale of two sons is a crowning achievement in the study of how games can offer a one of kind story telling experience that can not be matched in any other genre. ",

            "review_text": "I bought this game while on sale for less than $2. I was looking for a story driven game, and this seemed promising with the 'overwhelming positive' reviews....and of course the price. As almost every other review states, the game is short. I finished it in less than 3 hours (that is without going out of the way to get all the achievements tho). I wish it was longer but I wont knock it down for that.  In Short:  The technical parts of the game, like controls were good, but story-wise....eh.  I was dissapointed in the story and the feels aspect of the game.  Its not a bad game, I just didn't think it lived up to the hype.  But maybe its just me tho, I am not really the kind that looks very deeply into art.   I would say that this is an experimental game. Not in a bad way but its kind of a niche in my eyes.   Can't say I would really recommend it unless its on sale. This game is a hit or miss....it was a miss for me sadly.  I wanted to like it.  In Long (that makes sense right? lol):  Graphics are fine, nothing to complain or praise about. (as long as the graphics are decent it really doesnt affect me).  Controls are a bit weird, basically, the right side of the controller controls the younger brother, and the left side controls the older brother. And often you have to control them at the same time, so it can get confusing. BUT they did a good job so that during important parts its easier to control and not confusing, they did this by either having you control one brother at a time or by force aligning the brothers so that they are on the same side that their controls are on (Older brother will be on the left side, which matches his left side controls). So basically dont worry about raging due to the controls. I give them credit because the amount of controls is low; 1 analog stick for each brother and 1 button for each brother, 2 buttons for camera movement, and the start/pause button. So 7 in total, but you'll mainly just use 4 lol. But even with the simplistic controls you do a large range of activities, so it doesnt feel like your input to the characters is limited.  This game consists of puzzles, none of which I really found that challenging though. And there were a couple times where I'm thinking 'why dont they just do this instead, and just avoid this problem all together?' or 'how come that person doesnt just help us by doing exactly what they will do later but just do it NOW!!'. Some things i also just found silly, or some things they did just would never work. Some of the puzzles can get a bit repetitive. But thats me being picky. The game is for really casual play.  There is no understandable dialogue. The characters speak to each other, but its some language not known to our world. Which is a cool idea that i respect, and one reason i find this to be an experimental kind of game. BUT i feel that the lack of dialogue made it so i didn't connect to the characters as well and I felt it left out the details of the story. The overall story is easy to follow and understand without the dialogue, but i would have liked some more detail, personally.  The environments you go through are quite nice and i like some of them a lot. As well as interesting creatures.  Replay value: Low  Honestly, I'm mixed on whether to press the thumbs up or thumbs down for this. I wish their was a sideways thumb option. lol  Conclusion:   Its an experimental game that, in my opinion, does some things right and some things wrong. Its unique and i give it a lot of credit for that. But i guess it just didn't live up to the hype for me storywise, i didnt get all the feels most people seem to be talking about. If you are curious, like experiment games, like real casual games, or want to be a game dev, then get Brothers while its on sale. Otherwise...look somewhere else.

The puzzles are not terribly complex, but require a bit of thought. Music and atmosphere is top notch.  $15 is a bit much. I beat this game in w/e amount of time it says (think 3.4 hours?)

Having played through it now I think I can safely say that part of allure of this game is discovering the tremendous environments alongside the characters. There were many occasions where I just stood there panning the camera around to enjoy the world.  I won't spoil anything here - gameplay is quite linear with simple puzzle solving. The primary mechanic being using a single controller to direct two characters...simultaneously. This isn't particularly difficult, but it does create some interesting mechanics and the odd time when you switch places on screen but your thumbs haven't figured that out yet. The story is remarkably well developed given that there isn't any understandable dialog (any communication is gestures and intonations in a made up language). Relying on the situation and subtler details to convey love, loss, urgency etc draws you in that much more effectively. Start to finish gameplay is quite short, about 3.5 hrs depending on how much you like to stop and look at the scenery.  I thorougly enjoyed my playthrough, but there is nothing there to draw you back for another journey. Consider the shortness, lack of replayability, but very satisfying visuals and story to decide what value you might place on the game. At typical sale prices I think it is definitely well worth it.",

            "review_text": "This game gets a recommendation from me, but it comes with a number of 'buts' attached.   What does the game do right?  It shows off a nice looking world, it tells a story without any English dialog and it does single player co-op in a slightly different way. The puzzles are all straightforward and take advantage of the control scheme offered.   What does the game get wrong?  Strictly speaking, nothing. It does what it sets out to do, but I believe it could have done things differently.   Should I buy this game then?  Sure, you should, as long as you're aware that the game is quite short and quite easy. Buy it at an appropriate price.   So, if it doesn't get it  wrong , what could it have done better?  That's where there's a lot to say.  First, a small thing, graphics wise. The bloom lighting is just a little bit too much in a few places. Besides that the graphics are superb.  The biggest and most glaring issue that I have is with the tone of the game. I won't spoil anything beyond the first five minutes of the game - you're a pair of brothers on a quest to get, uhh, a something to cure a sick man who we safely assume is your father (the story telling is very minimalistic, we'll get to that). It would therefore follow that the tone of the game is one of urgency. But that feeling is entirely lacking.  What's worse is that the things that make this game interesting pull HARD against that sense of urgency. Right at the start of the game, as you go through the town where you live, there are different interactions per brother with the townsfolk. A lot of the atmosphere of the game is discovered by interacting with everyone at least twice.  There are also different ways the brothers interact with their surroundings. One brother plays in the water, the other drinks from it, etc.  Then there's the nice scenery. See a statue, walk up to and interact with it, the camera pulls down and shows off the details. There are even benches where you can sit, which moves the camera to a 'beauty shot' angle.   All of this completely takes away from the tone of urgency. This conflict in tone really took me out of the game. On the one hand I wanted to appreciate all this detail and work that went into the landscapes, the character interactions, etc, but on the other hand I felt like there was no driving force to the story.  I'll go onto the story then, more specifically how it's told. The characters don't speak a real language, so we hear a few semi-words repeated a lot. This minimalism is both good and bad. You certainly follow the story, but it's not a terribly deep story.  One brother recieves the majority of the character development but altogether it's very limited. And the story telling, perhaps because of the minimal nature, leans on cliches and tropes.  Finally, the puzzles and controls. Before you get to your first wall-climbing puzzle the game feels VERY grounded and realistic. I very much enjoyed that. And then the brothers are indivudually leapfrogging up walls, able to scale heights taller than they are, only a moment after a puzzle where one has to boost the other to climb a much shorter ledge. That also took me out of the game and felt jarring.  The game play is linear and pretty easy; you can't go the wrong way, you can't fall off ledges, though you can let go at the wrong time and fall to your death. The good puzzles are, unfortunately, towards the beginning of the game. Later in the game there are more wall-climbing puzzles, including a new mechanic that only adds to the unrealistic feeling that these puzzles create.  The game is basically on rails. Yet most of the time you feel like it isn't, and there are sequences that are VERY on-rails (the glider in particular) where you still feel totally in control and the game comes together beautifully.  And that's why I recommend this game, despite the clashing nature of certain aspects of it. The game presents a story that you can follow, makes you feel like you're mostly in control of it, and does so with nice graphics and controls. The game is both deep in detail and story and yet shallow in the same respects.",

All-in-all this game had a good story and very good mechanics. Only had one glitch that we managed to find, which required a restart checkpoint. Game lasted for nearly 3 hours. It took me awhile to set the sound up for something other than my headset (Logitech G430). Music is a mixture of classical and synthesizer. Sounds were not very great, although it is available in surround formats. There is no actual dialogue and instead it is all replaced with gestures and mumbling just like what can be found in the early LEGO games. FYI I picked this up during summer sale 2014 for $3.  My overall view: Content with the game. I would feel a bit disappointed if I bought this for the full price of $15. The gameplay was good but can not justify the price with the length of the game + the replay-ability (of which is just one play through for achievements if you would really want to A.K.A. One and done). Classic Score: 7/10 for me, 6.5/10 from my friend. How it could have been better? There needs to be actual dialogue and there is some really bizarre moments in the story that are simply WTF... moments. Some of it is great for a laugh but detracts for the seriousness of the game. Also at the very end, the older brother's action key is used for the younger brother in two situations. This should not have been the case.  Recommendation to consumers: Pick this title up during a sale or watch a playthrough if you really can't wait. But this is definitely worth the experience.",

I personally like games with a good story so I recommend this game  -I DO NOT recommend this game for people looking for hard puzzles, long game play, or an abundace of action.   I got this when it was on flash deal and I think it was worth the price. A lot better than the crap that is found on mobile phones.",

The storyline itself will have it's happy moments but also the sad ones and in a whole the game manages to drag you into the story in a very profound way.  I played this without a controller and only used a keyboard but I found it works very well and still required a certain amount of 'double thinking'.  The large collection of 'easter eggs', achievements and simple fun interactables make for a nice detour of the main quest.  The camera position can be manualy changed but I found I never had to do this. The camera automatically went to the perfect position for any puzzle in a smooth way that let you focus on the story and mechanics and not have to derp around with camera views.  The only negative I can say is that when I needed to lower a bridge and use both brothers the bridge tended to take 2 or 3 minutes to go down. This may be because I was using a keyboard or I simply didn't figure out what to press to make it go down faster. (This only happened twice in the game, so the detrimental effect on a whole was minimal)  An excellent single player game that I highly recommend.",

If you cry easily/get attatched to characters (like me ^_^*), it is still nice to play, but you might not keep it dry. I for example, cried the whole last part of the game.  I just bought this game off Steam today in the Steam Summer Sale, and I finished it in 4 hours. Here is my opinion on the game.   I really enjoyed playing this game.   Though a controller is recommended, it is not necessary, the game is playable with your keyboard as well. It takes a few minutes getting used to the controls, especially since you move two characters with two different parts of the keyboard (WASD and space for Naia (Older Brother) and UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and R-CTRL for Naiee (Younger Brother). This is the hardest when you try to move them both at the same time. Or at least for me it was.)  The puzzles were easy, but fun. All it requires is some logic thinking and paying attention to details.  The graphics of the game are quite simple, but even so this game is a beautiful one. The soundtrack is beautiful, and the story is amazing. Though the characters don't speak any actual language, you know exactly what the story is about. It's kind of sad that the story is relatively short.  This game is just too short. It only took me 4 hours to play it entirely (and that was including the several times I've died), as I've mentioned. I would have loved to see more of the game. Hence my slight disappoinment at the story/lenght of the game.  The only thing I didn't enjoy about the game though, is the ending.",

Simply put, this is a beautiful game that I recommend to any gamer, especially those who favored PlayStation's Ico many years ago. The visuals, music, story, and gameplay are amazing. Yes, it's a short game with no 'real' replay value, but I believe it makes up for that in other aspects, such as the story and how beautifully crafted the landscapes are.

This is what I wish to add first and foremost: the game is very psychologically powerful, it's brevity notwithstanding. If you are at an emotionally weak point in your life it is simply a fair warning. You are drawn into the sublime family relationship. Loss will happen from the very get-go.

            "review_text": "Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons - An Commentary  Controllers are the nexus of the the game experience, they stand at the intersection of gamer and game. Countless innovations on the controller’s design and implementation have been applied to gaming over the years. One of the most common questions game developers are confronted with is, “How do we map our controller?” In a small Danish game studio a new improvisation has emerged, providing a new paradigm for the conventional controller. In “Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons,” the controller is used in ways that exceed the standard user/avatar UI of typical role playing games. The controller functions as an inherently deep gameplay element and a powerful story metaphor for an experience of cinemagraphic emphasis. The narrative itself is simplistic, but effective, it’s minimalist approach is reminiscent of Danish 30s cinema. Ironically the game was made by the Danish Starbreeze Studios. Nothing is used unintentionally within the game’s design, this is true for all the elements from props to plot devices. The logical progression behind behind the game is clear cut, the desires, ambitions and fears of it’s characters all have causes, achieving a flawless parallel between plot and theme. One of the unique strengths of a minimalist narrative with no intelligible dialogue is that it takes away the premonition that the player can control the dialogue. This let’s an aspect of the narrative that cannot be influenced fade into the background. In “Brothers a Tale of Two Sons” by Starbreeze studios the controller is not only used for its typical interface between player and avatar, it is a story metaphor. The story itself clearly illustrates the dynamic features behind the relationship of the brother. It reinforces the story’s base narrative and operates seamlessly within the metaphors of the story. It demonstrates the reliance of the two brothers on each other during navigation and puzzles, the player being a single essence provides the uniting features of these notions, this is hammered in through the steep learning curve of controlling both characters simultaneously. The artifacts of this design choice are seen in simple plot devices where the player must give up control of the younger brother so the older can carry him through the water, and in the more sophisticated puzzles where communication between the brothers is paramount. It is always difficult to quantify emotional impact. In this case however most of the story’s weight branches from its basic narrative and the functional weight of the gameplay system. This may seem obvious, but within interactive media the term “basic narrative” is rarely seen. This particular game thoroughly engages the player through all the senses it has at it’s disposal. Visually it bares a system that places an emphasis on story elements and lets all else fade into the background. It’s soundtrack is both compelling and beautiful. The controller provides excellent tactile feedback. The metaphorical system on the controller is not only symbolically correct it provides a brilliant area where the affection of the characters can be betrayed. The controller splits vertically down it’s middle, the left side corresponds to the older brother the right side corresponds to the younger. This creates a geographic expression for the two brothers’ relationship which is not only fantastically metaphorical, the player comes to love being the means to the brother’s relationship. We see the organism of the game as an extension of ourselves. This is all an elaborate setup for the butchery of this organism, when the older brother dies the player's connection to the story is cut off. The player feels the loss and seeks comfort with the only individual that can relate to her/his plight, the younger brother. This leaves the player as an engraved element in the story’s structure when it ends, the end of the narrative leaves the player unfulfilled. The death of the older brother brings out some of our darkest fears as humans, it reminds us that even in an interactive game, just as in life, we have no control over death. The player realizes that in spite of his/her governing power over the brother’s relationship, they can only implement the choices the characters made for themselves. When the voice of the older brother returns at the resolution of the story, the player watches as their control disperses further as death, an element totally out of their control as humans, once again takes the wheel. In Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, a fixed narrative is presented, using emergence strictly as an utility for enhancing the experience of the game. The most unique element of the game is it’s use of the controller as a story metaphor and tactile plot device, reaching beyond the utilitarian design scheme of the conventional game. This mechanic fits flawlessly into it’s minimalist visuals and compelling soundtrack taking the gaming community on an emotional rollercoaster they won’t soon forget.",

This immersive plattformer brings something completely new to the table when it comes controls. With the controler (I would strongly suggest using one) you control each brother seperataly with the thumbsticks. This games offers some really innovative puzzle-solving without repeating itself (which I think is a frequent problem in many puzzle-plattformers these days). However, what really makes this such a great title is the story which is one of the most engaging story I have ever experinced. The funny thing is that the game tells it entire story without any real dialogue (all characters just speak jibberish). The game is not that lenghty (about 3 hours) but considering the price point I would consider this a must-buy.",

No questioning, where to go next - no big challanges keeping you from experiencing the whole story  CONS: - each chapter plays in another part of the world, that is not described in any way. You just have to accept the fact that everything is as it is whithout any information about HOW things got that way. - short playtime (3 - 4 hours) - price is too high for such a short playtime - the only challange is to sometimes control both characters at the same time. All puzzles are quite easy. - some may consider the heartwrenching end a big NO (though I actually liked the fact that the story did not follow the beaten track)  CONCLUSION: If you like a simple and relaxing game without any real challanges and are looking for a story and landscape that truely fire your imagination 'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons' is your game (at least for one evening).

There is no dialogue as such (they speak a less annoying version of 'simlish') but there are still some interesting characters to meet, and some fun little secrets to discover as well.  All in all, this game does what it does well, and doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Definitely good changes in atmosphere. Main characters are brothers who I assume intended to one day join the circus given how athletic they are. Achievements are neat hidden things to interact with rather than just stuff you do for beating the game, they also let you put an end to bunny prejudices. Mix of emotion with areas. (Some more adventurous areas are shown to be exciting or joyful but overall the game has a sad overtone to most of the interactions you see.)  Cons: Controlling two characters at once can get confusing. Makes you feel like an idiot when you forget which stick controls which brother and you end up running into walls. Some graphical bugs, shadows in some parts would overlap in a weird way, textures for things that collapse didn't blend well sometimes, and occasionally around cutscenes there would be black silhouettes of where the character models would eventually be standing. These weren't too bad to be a major pain though. The game is short as I said earlier, the only thing to slow you down is figuring out how to solve the little bit of platform puzzle the game has but they tend to be pretty easy.

Even if you don't like the sound of that, buy and play this game just for the experience. $15 might seem a little steep for 6 hour game, but it is worth every penny. The world is beautiful, it runs very smoothly on low end PC's, and obviously the story is superb. The characters don't speak a single actual word, but I felt more attached to them than any other character in any video game ever. The ending genuinely made me sad and had real impact.

Together you'll solve simple puzzles and explore cobblestone villages, dingy mines, and a crystalline arctic ocean. It is beautiful.  The brothers' story is told without words we understand. We become familiar with them through their actions - one uses a lady's broom to dutifully sweep the porch, the other cheekily shows off by balancing the handle on his palm.   When you first control each brother with their assigned analogue stick, it is awkward. Janky and disorganized, you stumble over obstacles. You're uncomfortable - just as the brothers are uncomfortable working together - they've never had to. But as you improve at the pat-your-head-while-rubbing-your-belly controls, so do the boys. They begin to cooperate. It's this progress that highlights the bond they establish with one another as they forge ahead. It's the second best example of control mechanics having narrative purpose in Brothers.  The best instance, will simply leave you speechless.",

The art is beautiful! The sound designer did a fantastic job. Everything that was done within this game was done with care, and it shows. Alot metaphors and symbolism. Alot of personal action that makes you dive into the story in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. With all of the pros the game is not perfect. Sometimes the brothers like to have issues with thier pathing AI. Also I felt that they enjoyed to veer off into different directions occasionly.

While the 'game' elements here are relatively light, by way of being short, leaving you kind of wanting them to be a little bit more elaborated upon, the unique character control ideas and truly excellent narrative more than make up for it. Starbreeze put an interesting spin on what is actually typical 3rd person platformer fare with the simple yet genius idea of two simultaneously controlled characters in a single-player experience. It's a bit of a shame that the small-scale indie nature of the project in conjunction with the game being focused on story means that these sequences are relatively short and take a back seat to the unfolding narrative. This leads to the actual gameplay ideas explored to feel more touched on than fully fleshed out. While this by no means makes them or the game any less special feeling, if you're looking for a challenge, you might be left wanting. The actual world presented and the story one is allowed to experience are top notch. While there are no understandable words spoken throughout, the game does a tremendous job of communicating what is going on with the characters to the player and involving the player in it all. In fact, the whole game feels a little more like an interactive experience than a typical videogame by virtue of the gameplay elements working to bring the player into the world to allow them to experience the journey, moreso than serving as a real challenge. That said, it's not that there is no challenge at all; what is there is provided by the disorientation resulting from having to control two characters at once, and this can be quite fun. The world itself is quite whimsical, yet also reserved in the use of outlandish fantasy tropes. This lends quite a unique and mature feel to what otherwise feels like a game adaptation of a child's fable a la the Brothers Grimm. Graphically the visuals don't really have much to commend them on. Instead of attempting to go for flashy the developers went for competent. While the game doesn't look impressive, the visuals themselves are adequate and look good. The artstyle itself is not particularly flamboyant or colourful either. Rather, think nordic minimalism. Everything feels lovingly crafted and subdued, nothing is superfluous. This, again, seems to be so in order to allow place in the centre stage for the actual adventure the two characters share. And what an adventure that is! The game being as short as it is, it's hard not to spoil anything by discussing details, so I won't. Suffice it to say that the journey that Starbreeze has fit into the rather short 5 to 6 or so hours of gameplay is really quite the epic and one of the best and refreshing in modern gaming in my humble opinion. Do take into account that the shortness of the experience in this case is deceptive as it is packed with content that should be able to truly touch anyone who plays this. Highly recommended, especially if you're getting this for your kids. This is the best answer yet to the saccharine world of dumb entertainment available to children these days.",

I can't imagine it playing better with a controller, anyway. The gameplay may be a little awkward to begin with as you control the movement of both characters simultaneously (one brother is controlled by the WASD keys and the other, using the arrow keys). Yet, what was initially awkward only became increasingly enjoyable once I began to appreciate what the developers were trying to achieve.   The unique gameplay, detailed sense of atmosphere and a few interesting puzzles is really what is on offer here. The story is relatively straightforward and is mainly conveyed through action rather than dialogue, as the game displaces verbal speech with exchanges of gibberish between its characters, similar to way language is used in say, The Sims. The effect is something exotic and unfamiliar if not distancing, but it is successful in conveying a sense of belonging and place for its main characters.   There's quite a fun journey to be had here and a few surprises throughout even if nothing is explained but more to evoke a sense of atmosphere and history more than anything else. Oh, and be ready for a good time, just not a long time.",

But the overall satisfaction and immersion is great.  The biggest puzzle in the game is controlling two characters at once - and that is a good thing and quite fun. I had quite a few brain-farts where I couldn't keep track of which brother was controlled by which stick/shoulder button and ended up running both of them against walls - good thing all cliffs have invisible walls or I would have died a lot more times lol. Easiest way to control them in my opinion is to have the big brother on the left and small one on the right whenever possible to mirror the controller somewhat. When the positions are flipped you need some bonafide mental dexterity not to get mixed up.   If the game wanted to be truly evil it should have included a sequence where you must control both brothers at once along winding paths, on different parts of the screen and have them be opposite the controller. Like a double chase sequence of sorts. That would seriously melt brains haha. Too bad there wasn't one like that.  I wonder how many people googled 'how to set the game to English' upon starting. I definitely did lol. Thought I had the game on some foreign language setting by accident.",

It allows for a full-scale exploration, but certain features are still limited to only going along with the story.   You really connect with the two characters, and as you play you see how they grow and develop as a character. It feels weird, when one is missing and the game will always remind you of that, considering they can't move or go on without each other. We don't understand the language they speak, but we can still see it through their actions and expressions. You don't see much games in the market now, that is simple and have a plot that you can follow. The plot is rather simple, with the two brothers searching for a 'magical' tree to save their father, but it gets more in-depth as you go along and see their past. You don't see much other characters, due to the fact the game is mainly centered around the other two, and the amount of people are also limited to a small selection.

The game doesn't have any voice acting or text. Everyone speaks with this weird made up kind of gibberish language. Everything is told to you visually. And speaking of visuals the game's enviornment is beautiful. The game actually has benches set up throughout it where the brothers can sit down and look at the landscape.  I didn't really like the control sticks and RT/LT buttons being used to control one brother each. I don't know about everyone else but for me whenever the brothers got on their opposite sides, which happened often, It was very hard to control them becuase my brain is expecting the person on the left side to be controlled by the left stick and LT button and the person on the right to be controlled by the right stick and RT button so when they're on oposite sides it just screws me all up and I have to get them back on the side of the stick and button they're being controlled with and try to keep them like that.

You can also play the game in co-op with your friend on one keyboard. Game mechanics are very simple and basic too; you'll mostly pull levers and solve simple platforming puzzles using both characters at the same time throughout the game. Even though the game has simple controls and mechanics the story, atmosphere, characters, the world around you and soundtrack are simply perfectly put together and those elements are where the game really shines. With all those elements combined the game evokes certain emotions in player through the whole journey and that’s the game’s strongest point; to make you really feel and care for the main characters. Through prologue, 7 chapters and epilogue you’ll visit various places with beautiful landscapes, environments and aesthetics. The only downside of the game for some people will be the fact that you can finish the whole game and get all achievements in 5 hours, at least I did, but even though I knew the game was short from other reviews and first impressions that never made me disappointed or not interested in this wonderful game. Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons is an amazing experience that you'll finish in one breath and I would strongly recommend it to everyone.",

I was able to play this game on my PC without a controler but oh gawd does it takes concentration to move both of them at the same time lol. Loved the graphics, the music, the ambiance and the 'puzzly' parts.   The only thing i found myself ' complain ' about was that we do not understand what the characters are saying and there's no subtitles which would have been nice but you absolutely don't need to understand a word, the story and everything speaks for itself.

There is no dialogue in the game, but you are able to understand exactly what the brothers are 'saying' when they are communicating. As you play through the game, you will begin to notice the strengths and weaknesses both brothers have. I won't spoil anything, but as an example, the older brother is blinded by his attraction to young beauty and the younger brother will do some stupid things sometimes, such as knocking something over when trying to sneak past a sleeping giant. Brothers is one of those stories where you are always surprised by what's around the corner. The world you step into is full of fantastical creatures, odd rituals and scary moments. It shows the connection 2 brothers can have with each other when it really matters. As a younger brother to a sister, I can very much relate to what the protagonists can do and will do to protect their sibling. The visuals of this game are amazing, from looking over massive mountain ranges, to creeping through small caves, you will be astonished in how good this game looks. The music is great! It's timed at the perfect moment when you enter a certain area and it never gives anything away. Finally for the verdict: Brothers is an excellent game full of heartbreak, action and surprises around every corner, it will blow you away with it's excellent movie like visuals and gameplay, along with keeping you guessing with it's soundtrack. I would pick this game up any chance you get. 10/10 in my eyes.",

And most of all, its story is amazingly well written in its minimalistic presentation, relying heavily (and surprisingly well) on its core mechanic of one movement stick and one action button per brother to tell the story to you through your own (partly optional) interactions (although there are in fact several short scripted cut-scenes, mostly serving as scene transitions and/or as most - but not all - of the emotionally really big moments), with relatively little dialog in its made up language that however transports the feelings appropriate to any particular moment perfectly. At times heartwarming, at times heartbreaking, at times both at once. Just lovely. Seriously, do not read spoilers!  As for the achievements, they are all little optional side-quests rewarding kindness and/or playfulness, some lying directly in your path, some requiring a little bit of exploration the few times it's actually possible. Same goes for the many benches you can sit on (with either one or both brothers) to really appreciate a select number of panoramas.

There are no active-time button presses or any other cheap gameplay mechanics. Every part of this game feels well thought-out.

With that being said I'd pay for games like this all day over big budget AAA titles. This game to me is worth $20. Even though I paid $5 for it on sale It is worth much more than that to me.

There is really no part of this game that I disliked. The art is unique and beautiful, and with the camera allowing you to fully take in the scope of the scenery. The world is populated with interesting creatures and people, both in design and in action. The world of these two brothers is both vibrant and disturbing, and despite the small personal story being told, you really get a sense that there are much larger events taking place in this world.  Despite no understandable dialogue, you really get a sense of characterization of the two brothers and how they are different. As well, their relationship and love carries through. Drifting too far away and having them call out to each other feels genuine. The story is a relatively simple one, but it is executed very well. And without spoiling the story, near the end the control scheme really moves away from gimmick and becomes woven into the story seamlessly.  I really enjoyed everything about this game. The music and sounds were haunting, yet fit perfectly with the atmosphere. The variety of set pieces for the different chapters really showed off a great deal of variety. Even the achievements are not difficult or lengthy, but merely require taking a few seconds to explore the depth of the world.  I cannot recommend this game enough. It is well worth both the price and your time.",

I honistly at no point seen the need to have to seperatly control both brothers at all times, a simple follow command, combined with a quick swap and such could have easaly acomplished the same thing and alowed you to take in more of the beautaful enviroments rather then worrying about trying to navigate two things at once.

Visual and audio directions are amazing. That plus the emotional ride mentioned by other positive reviews kept me playing. Unfortunately the adventure didn't live up to its hype. The control scheme is interesting but felt it wasn't fully explored in puzzle design. Puzzles, if you can call it that, are way too easy and feel more like a distraction.   There are a lot of interesting places and characters, but the game never give opportunity to explore and learn more about them. So the adventure ended up feeling like a dream. It's emotional at times but like a dream it's so random and moves so fast that in the end you weren't sure if it was a good dream or bad dream, but it leaves you feeling melancholy.

The lack of real language did not bring me 'closer to the emotion' or any such thing. It was just plain annoying and brought the level of the whole game down to a more cartoony, childish experience. A little time spent on some sparse voice acting would have done wonders for Brothers. I did not really develop an attachment to the characters, and without giving anything away let me say.. the ending scenes would have been much more effective at drawing out emotion if the two brothers were not so flat, and maybe a verbal que existed to tell me what the heck I was supposed to do..  Now, the good. The scenes were very well done, and although a lot was left unexplained that is not necessarily a bad thing. A richly detailed world fiction describing past battles and current world politics is something that would likely be ignored by most players (myself included) anyway. Creating huge, dramatic scenes and leaving me to wonder what the heck is going on around the two brothers just made those scenes more interesting and drove my imagination. Everything was beautiful to look at and the story was charming, at least what can be pieced together without dialog. Level design was always interesting and I was never bored. Some of the extra things you can do on the side were also pretty neat and unexpected. I really liked the disparity between the two brothers' personalities, how they interact with things differently.  I would not hesitate to pick this game up on sale. I did, and I don't regret it. However, if I had paid full price I would have been disappointed.",

Beautiful graphics, slightly tricky controls if all you have is a keyboard for controlling two characters simultaneously, I did get used to it and found myself whizzing around. The basis of the story: Mother has passed away, father becomes sick, he has two sons (differnt ages) who venture out to find a healing potion.  You control the two brothers in their quest, solving puzzles doing tasks. Example of a puzzle: both brothers have to get across a field where a vicious dog stand in their way with bales of hay scattered over the field. One brother distracts while the other runs &amp; jumps on a bail, then visa versa etc Puzzles are straight forward and you get to meet a few other characters, not everyone is who they seem, on your adventure where the story grows. Like other games Iv'e reviewed I don't want to give to much away as this spoils the enjoyment, like knowing the end of a film before youv'e even watched it .

I expected to be frustrated by the 'single player co-op' as the game calls it, but the controls are intuitive and the puzzles that involve both brothers make sense. Even if you don't know precisely *how* to do something, you can tell exactly *what* you're supposed to do at a glance.  As a puzzle platformer, it's probably very easy. But it's not about that. It's about the bond that's built as you play both of these brothers, interacting with each other and their environment. Like I said, less than 2 hours in I already feel a deep sense of attachment to them. I find myself moving the older brother first, to protect the younger one. But the younger one is always the first to interact with new people, because it feels like it's in his nature to do so.   With no dialogue (that you can understand--though context is easy to read here), this game relies on action to tell its story and reveal the personality of the characters, and so far it's done a phenomenal job.

There is a spark contained in Brothers that is all too soon over, and if ever the consideration was to make an extended edition, I would more than happily endulge.   The moments spent in Brothers are always thought provoking. With areas that are gorgeously lit and rendered, it's easy to see why the characters rest on benches provided along the way. Eye candy galore, and an exceptionally paced transitions of environments left me wanting more. No matter the locale, everything had the undertone of a story that took place before the brothers visited it. Perhaps if I were to replay it, I would analyze the stories untold and then perhaps have a better sense of this game's world.  Inginuity makes every moment exciting and rewarding, but ultimately in the end, as it gives you a profound amount of respect for the story being told.

Playing the game is not difficult at any point, the player needs to do very little to get the reguired outcome (usually just move next to an interactable object and press a button) and most of the 'action' parts are very pre-scripted. There are puzzles along the way but they are very simple and easy. There is very little exploration involved and you can't really change anything about the story or events.  The reason why I would recommend this game is that the things it does (above I tried to say what it doesn't do) it does very well. It shows this remarkable world in a very beatiful and deep way. Even though most (if not every) of the wonderful little things about the world are very common in many fantasy settings (like trolls, magical trees, etc.) this game presents them in a magical way that I (a grown-up) felt like a little boy who is introduced to possibilities of imagination for the first time. I played this game through in two sittings but would have played it through in one if I hadn't had to stop playing during the first time I launched the game. It truly was like watching a good movie, I didn't want to stop wathcing until it ended on its own.  I personally liked the concept of playing in coop with myself. It was on the other hand kind of sad that the possibilities it can open weren't fully explored. I'm sure that there are people who find these 'difficult' controls to be a turn-off but anyone willing to keep an open mind should find out that it works well. I personally was very surprised how well the camera was able to follow the protagonists. I very rarely needed to adjust the camera manually.  Another thing that this game does very well are the achiements. Usually achiements in games are gained by just playing the game. Nothing extra is needed. Just by finishing the game you get something like 80 - 90 % of all the achiements. In this game you will get 0 %. They are all kind of like 'side-quests' that you end up completing just because you were so drawn into the world that you wanted to interact with it and its people/creatures as much as you could.",

Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, follows in the footsteps of short art/story games like LIMBO (Brothers is only 3 hours long at most), or even something like ICO, with puzzles, mystery and beautiful visuals. As the title entails, you play as two brothers in a fantasy world full of giants (or maybe you're just dwarves), and other fantastical things, who are on a quest to find an elixir to help cure their father of whatever ails him.   If you haven't watched the trailer or read anything about this, the unique part about Brothers is the control aspect - you control two characters at once either with the joysticks (recommended) or on the keyboard. While this is certainly something very different, the implementation was a little bit weak, with the puzzles being very easy to complete. The main difficulty of the game most derived from actually co-ordinating yourself - only times I really got caught up was when I used the wrong hand. In addition, there isn't really any punishment in dying, though I suppose the point of the game was otherwise.  The most stunning part of the game is definitely the visuals, and the developers know it. I don't think I've ever seen a group of devs more in love with their game than 505 - they even provide park benches throughout the game for the player to take in the scenery, and rightly so I might add, since it is a beautifully stylised game. In addition, they have paid attention to detail on a bunch of little things, like footsteps in the snow for instance, which is nice.   Music was quite nice, and really suited the game well. Dialogue on the other hand was just jibberish, and while I completely understand that they were going for a story that was communicated visually (and there wasn't any problem with their execution there), I believe that the lack of proper dialogue reduces the ability of the audience to connect with the characters.   Speaking of which, the story and setting of the game was quite astounding. I myself was expecting a more lighthearted game, but it actually is very grim and dark, which was surprising (in a good way though). Also, despite my criticism of the dialogue previously, I did like the vagueness of some parts, as it preserved a sense of mystery about things.   So in conclusion, I found this game, despite it's short length and ease, recommendable because of it's story and beautiful visuals. It's nothing to pay full price for (I made that mistake with LIMBO), but certainly something beautiful to pick up and have a go at when it's on the cheap.

The design is simply stunning, making me feel as if I was staring at a painting in every location throughout the journey.

COD players should keep away from this :p  I would rate it 7/10",

Aside from learning to control the game using a thumbstick for each character, the difficulty is fairly minimal.  The story is great though. Regard it as you playing along with a brilliant story, you're there for the ride. The payoff is definitely worth it.  OH! Before I forget!

You control both at once using controls that at first seem quite gimmicky, but as you get used to them they are simple, they work, it gets the job done. They must overcome obstacles and solve puzzles by working together to achieve their goal of finding a remedy for their sick father.  the world itself is beautifully designed, some absolutely stunning visuals. the story is short, I finished it in around 3 hours for the main story, but if you take your time and discover all the secrets maybe a bit longer, but it surely leaves a lasting impression because it isn't afraid to go to some dark places but also knew when to highlight a truly joyous moment. The way it achieves this is by guiding you through this guiding the player through the special moments instead of just showing you a cut-scene. it is evident the developers wanted you to fully interact with the story through all parts, this is especially obvious near the very end.  overall, an incredibly impressive game for such a small one, and i would fully recommend anyone to play it.",

The story is basic, but is good and does the job (you feel for the brothers). Graphics are very good as it is appropriate for this title.

            "review_text": "A brief review of 'Brothers: a tale of two sons'  'Brothers: a tale of two sons' is a game developed by Starbreeze studios and published by 505 Games. To play it you will require a compatible game controller such as an Xbox 360 pad. This is for a rather unique game mechanic, controlling the game's two main characters at the same time, big brother and little brother (they do both have names but I could not remember what they are to save my life). You control big brother with the left stick and trigger, then the little brother with right stick and trigger. With the two brothers you will be doing some puzzle platforming. This mostly consist of making the two brothers pull levers in sync or carry an object together. The puzzles are easy to figure out, its just getting the brothers to work together in order to complete them. I can almost guarantee that more than once you will get a little confused and make the brothers run in to a wall or fall to their death, but When you do successfully get the brothers to work together it is extremely satisfying.  At the beginning of the game you are shown that your mother has died and your father is dying, you take your father to the town doctor to find that the only thing that can save him is the liquid from a far away 'life tree'. From then the brothers embark on their quest to find the tree. The game looks fantastic in the graphical department, which helps to create a colourful and vibrant world. On your quest you will find benches scattered around, I highly recommend you sit on them for a few seconds so the game can showcase some amazing vistas with its awesome art style and graphics. There is no denying that the game is a bit short (I finished it in about 3 hours), but it is definitely worth your time and money.  ***SPOILER ALERT FROM NOW ONWARDS*** IM ABOUT TO SPOIL THE ENDING SO PLEASE DONT KEEP READING IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME. Basically spider-woman comes along and ♥♥♥♥s everything up. She stabs your brother as he kills her (which admittedly is a pretty cool twist). From here on out you just play as the little brother, you manage to obtain the life saving liquid but it does not work for your brother and he dies. The scene where you bury your fallen brother is very well done and pulls at the heart strings of the player. You return to your father and save him with the liquid, I guess it only works for people who are dying but are not dead. I’m not really sure how to feel about this, you save your father but the player does not really have any bond with him (not like to big brother). I am not saying that the ending is bad, it just feels like the big brother died for nothing as the player has no idea who the father is and why the brothers would risk certain death so many times to save him.",

Gameplay- Though the puzzles are often not complex, they serve to develop a bond between the brothers and the character. This bond in turn, constructs an experience unlike any other.  Story- Though this story contains tropes familiar to the average person, it somehow transforms that into something deeper. Due to the length of the game, it would be difficult to explain further without ruining some of the experience.  Value- The value in Brothers does not lie in the gameplay. If you are looking for a lengthy game with some 'meat' to it, look elsewhere.

My expectations were that it would probably be another sweet, simple game that tugs lightly on your heart strings, but ultimately forgettable. This is where I say that I was wrong; Not only was it emotional, but I'm not ashamed to say that it brought me to tears by the end. Which is a surprise for many reasons, but the biggest being that I generally don't shed a tear for anything, especially a work of fiction.  All you need to know about the story is this: There are two brothers that set out on a perilous journey to collect the sap of a magic tree, which they believe can heal their dying father. As the game is rather short, saying more would likely spoil some key moments. There are some surprisingly dark tones and imagery, which at first caught me off guard, but it's clear they are not simply there to be edgy. Everything has a deeper meaning, even the controls (I will never think of the left trigger the same way again). The music is excellent and emotive, and the developers use it at the right times, with the right level of intensity. The main theme, especially the acoutic version heard during the credits, is still swimming around in my head as I write this. And It is worth noting that all dialouge is expressed in a fictional language; You won't understand what they are saying, but the characters use expression so effectively that you will begin to realize that you do.   I don't want to oversell it, but saying that I recommend this game isn't enough; It doesn't give it proper credit. It's titles like this that naysayers are clearly not paying attention to when they argue ignorantly against those of us that believe video games are, or can be, a true form of art.   ",

The art stlye gracefully jumps from light-hearted, medieval charm to dark, uncanny and unnerving. It feels very much like a old Grimm Brothers Fairytale with a healty dose of nordic mythology thrown in for good measure.  While the core gameplay is nothing to write home about, the story certainly is. This is a very emotional game, if you allow yourself to get invested in the world and its characters and the payoff at the end is enormous. This, however, also highlights the biggest weakness 'Brothers' has: It moves way too fast. It's not too short, in my opinion, it just gives very little breating room between one set piece moment and the next.  Still, I very much enjoyed the experience.

The story is about two brothers that have a sick father, Aeed and Aada (At least that is what it sounds like their names are) want to save the life of their father by going to the Tree of Life. On their journey you will come across obstacles that will sometimes require only one brother, but most of the time two will be needed. You will fly, swim, climb, defeat bosses, and swim through pools of blood through the story. The pace is kept at a constant and even though it is only a few hours long, you will not feel like there was anything missing. The ending, like many have said, is very good. That is all you can really say because it will only impact you if you go in without knowing the ending.  Art wise this game is up there with Journey, Killzone 2, and Super Mario Galaxy. Snow, trees, rain, and the like all have a distinct look that seemlessly blends together when traveling.   The textures are sometimes extremely bad, but the game easily hits 60fps on a 1GB HD 7850.

This is not a game designed to be fun, it simply takes you on an adventure in a way that allows you to establish a connection and relationship between a number of characters in a story told by gestures, vague vocal exchanges and the environment.  The textures, lighting, shading, camera angles, environment design and interactions are pristine. Despite some people describing this game as having puzzles, the solutions are so easy to intuit that they're mostly intended to be flavoring for the adventure rather than work your brain. They're clearly trying to tell a story as smoothly as possible, not throw roadblocks at you.  The only issues I had were a single bug that a restart fixed and there was an important voice recording that lacked a level of emotion necessary for the scene. The voice overs in general were kind of generic, though satisfactory and not distracting for most of the contexts they're used in as no words are spoken. It's not as much of an issue until emotion is important in a scene and the voices don't convey that.  Overall, the game is very tastefully creative. The creativity doesn't blow your mind so much as it impresses you that they invested the effort to bring you that experience. There are subtle surprising progressions as things go from run-of-the-mill to wild over the course of the game. Take ICO (minus the flaws), smash it together with some vague Journey inspiration, give it charming visuals, a touch of Tomb Raider and maybe throw in the occasional overlooks from Assassin's Creed by way of benches you sit on and you have Brothers.  As most of the story is told through brief interactions, it's probably best to interact with each thing in the game using each brother to see as much of their personalities as possible.  I laughed a few times, though it's not trying too hard to be funny. Cranked the music in a few spots, but the music doesn't steal the show. It's a linear game telling an extremely simple story that takes a short 3 hours to complete, so there's no need to rush through it. It works with keyboard, but a gamepad is worth using.  Similar to Journey, it is probably best to play it in one or two sittings, keeping the entire experience fresh in your mind until the end.",

On the surface it looks like a regular puzzle platformer, but the thing that sets it apart form other games is the fact that you control each of the brothers individually. And that's the thing that makes some of the latter puzzles challenging, since technically they alle are pretty simple. Controlling two characters simultaneously is an odd thing to do. Another amazing aspect of this game is the fact that throughout the game not a single word was spoken to either explain a gameplay mechanic or to progress the story, and jet it was easy to understand what was going on and what the game wanted me to do.  Both visuals and sound of this game create wonderful atmosphere that compliments the emotional story at all times. I wouldn't say the games graphic are anything special, but it by no means an ugly game. Pretty much all environments are nicely crafted and few places are down right gorgeous. This reminds me that I have to look up the soundtrack of Brothers, because some of it's tracks are still stuck in my head.  But I must also warn you of few things that may put a frown on your face. The game was designed with a controller in mind, which is a non issue if you have an access to such a thing, but as far as I know most PC gamesrs do not have them. Keyboard controls work, and you can definitely play the game, but it feels much more organic when it's played with a controller. It also isn't the longest of games. I bet it in about three hours. Which for this kind of a game is just perfect I think, but I also bought it at a discounted price(50%) and at full price I would have probably been a little disappointed. But as it stand it was worth every cent I spent on it.  TL;DR Buy it you dummy! It's amazing!",

The connection you gain to the brothers is so strong that I started to refer to myself as 'we' when I was describing what I did in the game. The puzzles are usually a little too simple, but there's some challenge in learning to control both brothers at the same time. This game really blew away the very high expectations I had for it. I'd not only recommend this game, I'd actively encourage you to play it. It's a great example of using game mechanics to tell a story, and that's a rather rare thing to find.  A few recommendations. Play through the game in one sitting. It's only 2 hours long and it has the best impact if you take it all in at once. DO NOT USE THE KEYBOARD. Use a controller. The game doesn't feel right without it, you'll understand once you play it.",

The last part, well actually I won't say anything because that would spoil it too much. Suffice to say it will leave you thinking about it for a while.   It's better if you explore a lot as it will extend the game for you, and also find a lot of those easter egg/achievements. My daughter and I played through it together and we had smiles plastered on our faces for most of the game, especially from those little discovered treasures.

When I reached what I though was the end I though, this would be a great movie – I was wrong. Don’t get me wrong, the gameplay is great and two-players is quite possible and could be enjoyable. The story is also just beautiful on its own. But the tear jerking moment when you, alone, reach the end and have to guide both brothers at the same time, the realisation that comes with the fact that you are pressing the buttons, the details like there being two stones to climb at the end (sorry if this gives away too much)… You just have to grab the controller with both hands and try it. When you do, you will understand how much sentiment a single button can convey. Just a further notice, on a more technical side of things, the game warns you it is best played with a controller and while it is playable with keyboard (I played the first levels that way), it is easier with a controller when you have to press several buttons at once. If you can, buy or borrow one and use it. I used a €10 generic one and besides a small documented bug where one of the joysticks had its y-axis switched (something that was correctable if you look it up on google and could probably be from the controller itself) everything went smoothly. Other than that the game is well built, had a few hiccups with animated portions repeating themselves (probably because I kept the triggers pressed during them) it runs smoothly and gives you a short (just the right size) yet powerful story.",

And by golly, it's a good one.  Let me preface my recommendation with this: you're likely ever going to play this once, unless you play it again in front of your friends purely to make them sob. But don't worry, regardless of if you never play it again, it's worth every single penny you will set aside for Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons. This experience will be with you for a lifetime.  Ever tried playing a video game with two controllers before, just to unlock some sick new virtual gear, or perhaps to beat up your invisible friends because you're just that pathetic? You found that to be really hard to do, illogical and counter-intuitive, right?  Although it seems daunting at first, in Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, you control both characters simultaneously with the one controller. It's stupendously easy to pick up: within five minutes of starting the game, I found myself cranking a dropbridge completely subconsciously. This core game mechanic of controlling both characters is unlike anything I've encountered before, and as it wiggles its' way deep down into the plot, it is one of the very finest mechanics I will ever encounter.  (You'll realise why I'm talking so highly about damned game mechanics by the end of the game. Trust me on that.)  The graphics and music for this game are a bit wonky and average, but I was so compelled by the plot that this took little to no accountability in my opinion of this game. I can genuinely say that you must, and I mean MUST, buy and play this game. Once. For feels' sake. For the safety of you and of those around you. For your health. Buy. This. Game.

Some small storylines made me smile while at other times I was left wondering what happened where I passed along my way. The whole story is visually driven. there's no real speech in this game, when the characters talk it's in a simple gibberish language. The scenery is very beautifully realized. This is a fairy tale nothern style: pretty little mountain villages, vibrant mountain paths can take a sudden turn for sinister forests and unsettling warthorn plains. The whole atmosphere and various aspects of the game very much reminded me of Journey on the PS3. The controls are really well done in this game. You'll need a controller to play it but once you've got one you'll have no problem leading both brothers.

There are problems with it, at times the mechanics get in the way of what you want to do but overall the puzzles are very simple and serve to pace the story (well). But overall I believe that it is an excellent example of how games can tell stories in a involved way. The mechanics tell the story, the way the brothers interact immerses you in the world. If you haven't already then buy this game.  Although, do note that if you do not own a gamepad or other twinstick controller then you will not enjoy the game half as much as the keyboard controls are sluggish and I believe at one point you are unable to progress without a gamepad.   If you are wondering whether it is worth it for £10.99 / $15 then either:  - Wait for a sale (I bought it for around £2)  - Buy it now, it is well worth it.

Even though their language is not in a tongue we can understand it still has consistencies and if you listen close you can pick up the meanings of words and even their names. The story easily captures your attention with lively characters, the two brothers being drastically different in personality with their own quirks, disadvantages and advantages and with scenery that is simply breath taking. Throughout the game you control the two brothers together at the same time and they help each other get through obstacles and puzzles. You cannot hope to solve a puzzle without both of them working together.

            "review_text": "I heard a lot of hype around this game being the best game around brothers. After playing the game I found that there are still 3 better games about brothers, but this one is still pretty good:  Def Jam: Fight for NY: This game has way more brothers like Snoop Dogg, Redman, Method Man and Ghostface Killah. Super Mario Bros. 3: The brothers in this game can turn into Tanukis and Hammer Bros., something this game lacks. Mother 3: This game about brothers actually made me cry. Their dad is also pretty cool and not a generic sick parent.  Brothers does have various advantages over those other games, like the fact that you are always controlling the two brothers, that's pretty cool, also the brothers are always cooperating in the game, unlike that jerk Luigi using all the stars. The game is short, sweet, and barely has any filler. While not incredibly hard, there is a satisfaction completing one of the multiple set pieces. The game looks decent, although the animations, especially for the emotional scenes were pretty bad (The other 3 brothers game all have superior animation quality to be honest).  The music is pretty good, and controls manage the balance between being tricky, and also being really simple. The story is also simple and emotional, although I would like more world building for some of the areas. I think the stages present well enough the state of the world and the scope of the brother’s journey. In short recommended, although the brothers aspect was lacking compared to those other 3 titles, I just hope someone makes the Citizen Kane of games about brothers one day.",

So its like I said a short and simple but gripping story of two brothers that must travel the world to save their dying father by finding some kind of 'world tree'. You control the two brothers simultaniously with one bumper and a single trigger each(I used an Xbox controller, you can play it on keyboard as well but I prefered the controller)   The game is a platformer/puzzle game where most puzzles demand that you use one brother to do one thing and the other to do another thing, the brothers also got different 'abilities'. The older brother can swim but the younger cant for example.  While the puzzles themselves arent so hard the strange control method makes it somewhat of a struggle now and then. And even if the game can at first can be seen as quite childish I promise that it will touch a few very adult matters.  I actually find it funny, while many games put in massive effort and lots of money to make their games show emotion(most fail btw) this game atleast made me feel both happy and sad at several locations despite its simple nature.",

Granted, the game does warn you at the start that it's optimised to work with a controller... But not everyone has a controller or an adapter.

This is a game created by a famous Swedish film director, called Josef Fares ('Kopps' and 'Farsan' are his most famous movies). You follow two brothers on their journey to find some plants to save their dying father. They meet all kinds of danger, everything from trolls to big spiders.  An interesting thing with this game is that you play two characters simultaneously (You need a controller to play this game, as far as I'm aware), you control one character with the left part of your controller and the other one with the right part of your controller. At first I was a bit sceptic to that mechanic, but then I tried it out, and oh man it works good! To complete the game it takes about 3 hours (at least it took 3 hours for me). It has some REALLY amazing puzzles where you need to control both brothers to continue. You can use a PlayStation 3 controller by downloading some programs (NOTE: You need to plug in the controller into an USB port).  I would give this 10/10, as I haven't find any major bugs or glitches.  To get a more detailed review, I suggest watching TotalBiscuit's review on YouTube.",

This fairy tale nestled in a fictional Nordic-like village thrusts you directly into a dramatic story which takes two brothers through a series of puzzles and challenges on their quest to retrieve an item of great sentimental value to a dying man. The puzzles are simple, so the game draws its strength from the myriad wordless interactions the boys make with each other and the world around them, many which are easily missable by those who make the mistake of plowing through the main storyline just to beat the game. The level design and sound are beautiful, and contribute to make a surprisingly moving gaming experience. The only failing is a rather clunky (yet innovative) movement system that requires both analog sticks to move both brothers, which is often disorienting and cumbersome, but all in all, this is a gem that should not be missed.",

If I might so confess, this game Does bring emotions into the whole mix, and small encounters with different characters can turn into something much greater if you let yourself drift off with the game.  The game itself lets you control two brothers. The gameplay is rather weird, as you have to control both brothers at the same time, each with one of the analog sticks on your controller (yes you must have a controller). While I do say it's weird, I would never say that it's bad per say. Some may enjoy it, I did as I became better and better throughout the game, but others may think it's crap.  One of the first things I praised about the game was the settings. Brothers is truly a tale, like the ones you would listen to as a child, that takes you through daunting mountains, frightening forests, giant castles and many other places.

The game overall is an adventure to help your father, but as you go on your journey, you find yourself as just a small part of the actual world, and in-fact the side stories in the game can be as moving or intense as your own.  The overall controls are pretty unique, and they can take some time to get used to. But once you get accustomed to using both brothers in-sync or partially in-sync, it's pretty interesting. The game is based off two different controls for each brother - moving (using the respective joystick), and interacting (using the respective trigger) - as well as camera controls.  For people who play for achievements, unless you look up the list and try for them, you'll probably complete the game without getting a single achievement.  For re-playability, it's amazing to play through the first time. The second time would be great for getting the achievements. Aside from the story, there is no reason to re-play after completing the game.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It plays like an adventure game with puzzle elements (but I wouldn't call it a puzzle game in itself).",

The dual character controls make the simple puzzles fun to go through, which is great. You don't really spend time wondering 'what am I supposed to do?', you just have fun doing it.  One minor gripe is that the main theme music can be very annoying, at least it was for me. It plays during major story cutscenes and plays loud. Every time I was really getting immersed in the story my ears were bludgeoned by what sounded like an opera singer several octaves higher than anyone should ever have to hear.

If you do decide to buy it I'd recommend doing it in one sitting (around 3 hours). The game uses a simple to grasp yet continously entertaining system of an anolouge stick for each brother and an action button for each. It can be a challenge not to mix the controls up since you control the brothers simultaniously.   The puzzles are not overly challenging but they do well to keep the game moving along at a comfortable pace without ever leaving you bored. The interactive world around you will have you exploring the mostly linier world and seeing all you can do with the Older Brother usually being mature while using the younger brother to cause mischeif and laughs! The story is truly brilliant in how enjoyable it is and fluently it blends into the gameplay. You never lose control of your characters for more than a few seconds, making you feel very involved in the story as the characters you play.  I think most people will attach themselves to one of the characters as themselves e.g the eldest sibling being protective of the younger sibling, never letting him stride too far ahead of his little brother.   Cliffnotes:  -A fantastic and memberable story that makes you feel very involved through its gameplay.  -Fun mechanics that don't feel overused as the game changes up even the simplest of obstacles as you progress. -A pleasant interactive world which will leave you wanting to explore every nook with and how you can affect the world around you. -Single Player Co-op style gameplay which thrives on the dynamic and relationship between the characters and leading to some enjoyable game mechanics which aid in great fun instead of gimmicks.",

Ok, first, the sign that says that a controller is required to play, is necessary, even if the game can be played with the keyboard, it's a game designed for two analog sticks and not for keys, so play it with a controller.  If you don't have anything to play during a afternoon or you went home 7 o' clock and tomorrow is saturday, play this game.  There can even be more people with you, it's like a movie to the viewer, but it still is a game for the player.  This game lost an oportunity for not having co-op, but if you have some remaping tool, you can play with a friend and it will be cool and fun.  The controllers in Brother are interesting, not excelent, interesting. Each side of the controller is related to a brother, and they don't change at anytime during game play, so you have two freely movable characters that are going all around the screen, changing sides all the time, and your brain has to cope with it. Sooner or later you will find out you are the worst coop partner you have ever played with.  Because of this, playing alone will be awkward at some times, the game is shorter than the time you need to became fully used, so sometimes you will became confused while playing.  Brother has a realy nice feeling to it, it's a easy puzzle platforming, quite straight forward for everything, but it will tell you a story about growing and it's a good story.  It's a little short and I realy wanted to play a little more of this game.  So, beside the awkward controls, by designer's choice, and short length, everything else is realy enjoyable, is a good movie for the viewers and a nice experience, if there is any kind of sale, buy it. But, if you just want to play something relaxing and there is nothing else to do, buy it at full price, it's worth the price tag.",

And I sorely regret getting all of the achievements in the first run through because all I want right now is a reason to play this game again. Immediately.  Like the other reviews say, this game is kind of short. My first real playthrough was maybe somewhere around 5+ hours (and I very much took my time). My hours on record lie- I had Steam issues and had to start over from being about halfway through, and I accidentally have left Brothers open for at least four or five-ish hours.  Now, getting down to the actual content, I have to first say that I honestly saw the ending coming a mile away. And then I accidentally saw a spoiler that confirmed my theory when I was nearing the end. This did not at all soften the blow or lessen my experience in any way, so hey, MAJOR props to this game and the people who put it together. They really know how to design and I am thoroughly impressed. This game's dialogue is nonexistent- the characters communicate through very purposeful-sounding gibberish, but they have very clear, deliberate story and emotion behind them. That's one thing I absolutely applaud about this game, and I think it was a very smart choice. For me, no actual voice acting using a current language could possibly trump this unusual but very fitting and beautifully executed method of communication. The controls are very simple and easy to pick up on, and thanks to the really awesome design of the voice acting, anyone who speaks any language can probably play this game just fine.  A very important note- expect some dark themes in this game. It's not a fluffy adventure thing where you always feel triumphant and justified. This game doesn't care about your preconceived notions of traversing and saving the world with two cool brothers. It just does not care.  I played this game on my PC, using the keyboard. I was first trying to play this game using a controller, but the controller wasn't cooperative. I do indeed understand that this may have somehow made the game not as fantastic for me as it was for others, but despite maybe making some maneuvering tedious, I don't really see how a controller could make Brothers any better than it already is, so if you're more comfortable with a controller or a keyboard, I say stick with it. But if you have access to a controller, definitely give it a whirl and just feel it out for yourself which method you prefer.  Two notes I want to stress about this game (the second one I didn't really bring up above): - It is emotional and beautiful and its core idea and communication of are absolutely brilliant. I  love  the story aspect of this game. - You will see some things that may make your eyes roll into the back of your head, like a patch of rock that is a bright white sort of color, compared to the darker rock that makes up the entire rest of the wall, a turtle you somehow can't pick up because it's too close to the edge of a rock wall, a rock with a pitch black shadow, some absolutely asinine deaths on occasion for absolutely asinine reasons. These are mild and the game is very forgiving with its checkpoints and overall puzzle-like gameplay. Don't let this stop you from playing the game- just work past them. However, if the occasional inconvenience is just not your slice of pie, read some other reviews maybe, and see what you think. Maybe don't get this game if you're prone to frustration at setbacks.",

Did they wanted to preserve this sort of innocence so they 'shadowing' up early in the game by explaining almost nothing? It's a bet. A big one. And honestly, I do not know if it is a win in the end. Hear 'gniada' while a tragic moment happen completely breaks the effect.  The level design is consistent (this is so rare in today's games it should be noted), and gives a very mystical air to the game. Sensibility is desired, the dev want you to feel, but it did not take, once again because of this ridiculous language. That's the big 'too bad' of this game, and I am damn sure that with a normal dialogue they could have done a really beautiful game.  Also note that the difficulty is absent, and the system 'a joystick for everyone' quickly assimilated.

            "review_text": "This is one of those games you play through because you saw the critics gave it pretty good reviews and you're interested in the unusual experience you see in preview videos and pictures. And then I finish it and wonder if it's really something I would recommend to another person.  I think the game is good enough that I do recommend it, but it's by no means a hearty, strong recommendation. At $15 I do NOT recommend purchasing this game. The price is too steep for the lack of gameplay hours. There are many other games you can spend $15 and get infinitely more playtime out of than Brothers. Is it worth paying a few bucks to play through it? I suppose so, if you're willing to pay a dollar for an hour of the game--because that's about how long the game is: 3 hours. If you don't want to spend a few dollars on something that short, then walk away from the Steam store page and skip through a Playthrough Video Guide to see what the game is all about.  *Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons* is a puzzle game with an unusual twist on the genre. Instead of the player heavily manipulating the landscape, creating 'new paths' to go through (think Antichamber or Portal), or pushing-and-pulling blocks Zelda-style, this game has you controlling two brothers /at the same time/ and using their combined abilities (mashing the 'Interact' button at everything) to make their way through the landscape. There are conveniently placed horizontal ledges, bumps on the sides of trees for horizontal climbing, ropes, and so forth you use to travel through the game. If I had any one major complaint about the puzzles, it is that I am sick of the amount of horizontal climbing they packed into 3 hours and how frequently my characters would fall because I was too fast or slow mashing the 'interact' button when the characters were ready to jump. This is most likely my own fault, though, and you shouldn't let my inability to press buttons properly influence your view of the game.  The puzzles felt a bit trite to me because it seemed like the developers didn't try to think too far out of the box when they came up with them. 'What puzzles can we design for 2 people? I know! Let's let them help each other climb a ledge slightly too high for them to reach! One of them can get a boost then throw down a rope for the second!' This is more-or-less what a majority of the puzzles in the game are like. There was one level where the brothers tied ropes to their belts and would 'swing' each other from one hand-hold to the next. But, again, this entire level was horizontal climbing, so as cool as the puzzle was I was already getting tired of the obnoxiousness of sideways-ledge-movement. (I am not a fan of this, can you tell?)  The idea of controlling two brothers at once is the reason I purchased the game. I had a good idea of the kinds of puzzles they could utilize in the game with two characters to control (some of which I saw, some of which I didn't). I, unfortunately (and probably stupidly) played the game on a computer keyboard instead of a controller. It took a little getting used to at first, but I got the hang of it pretty well after the first 15 minutes or so. I am disappointed there isn't anything more to 'controlling' them than having them run around and mash the 'interact' button at random things and the obvious puzzles. I would have preferred to see multiple actions from each character that I have to think about and choose from (like combinations between the two) in order to solve the puzzles. Maybe the older brother can punch things and climb better than the little brother? Maybe the younger brother can focus on kicking things and crawling? It would have given a much more interesting element to the game if they each had different skill sets they used in combination to complete puzzles, rather than having me just mash the 'Generically Interact Do-Something-Here' button.   One thing the game had going for it was its art. The character models are pretty 'meh' to me, but the setting of the game was beautifully done. Even the first levels of the village the boys grew up in is very pretty to look at and play through. Each 'part' of the game has a different flavor or level design--from a village, to a 'forge' level, to a 'nighttime'/cemetery design, to a giant's home and navigating the cliffs it was on, and so forth--and each of these levels has wonderful art design. There is a particular moment later in the game when the camera moves to a side-shot of your characters running along a ledge of snow and the auroras, or just a beautiful sky?, are behind them. It's a very pretty moment for the game.   Do I recommend this game? Yes, overall, but not strongly. I found the puzzles to be slightly lackluster and too obvious. The lack of voice acting (they mutter sounds to each other) hurt the game for me rathe than helped it because I would have enjoyed actually hearing the story, since the character art and puzzles weren't great. The art is beautiful, but that's probably not a reason to recommend the game. So is it worth paying $3 for? Yeah, maybe, if you like puzzle games and want to try out something like controlling two characters at a time.",

That faded about twenty minutes in, by which point the lil' Simlish-speaking brothers were growing near and dear to me, and I felt invested in seeing them through on their adventure. An hour in and the world was charming, kind of like the immersive Scandinavian fantasy realm Skyrim wishes it could offer. An hour and a half, and the charm was struck through with bits and pieces of horror and concern. By the time I finished I was pretty much a screaming, teary-eyed emotional wreck.  Bear in mind that the game's content struck very close to home for me, and I imagine that fact is magnifying the impact tremendously, but even so I adore everything that's been put together here. I've been a fan of Thatgamecompany's work for years, and Starbreeze Studios' Brothers manages to evoke everything Flower or Journey pulled off, but in a dark and haunted way that feels just right for the Scandinavian indie game scene.

            "review_text": "I honestly have to say that I went into this one a skeptic and came out on the other end a changed man. This game although difficult to explain, (it's somthing you just need to experience), delivers on levels I didn't know were possible for a game. I've been moved by a Mozart Concerto, a Vincint VanGough, and even an epic big screen masterpiece like Braveheart! I have never however, until today, been moved in such a way as to stir my very soul by such as a video game. Don't get me wrong, I've played some exiting titles, (believe me, I've played many) that evoked emotion within me to a degree. None of them even came close to what I experienced in my 4 hour playthrough of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons! Everything about the game is spectacular from the art to the music and the short but effective narrative. The visuals in this game are breathtaking, often prompting the player to simply stop and look around in order to take it all in. I wanted to be there. I could feel the wind blowing on my neck, smell the refreshing mist of a mountain stream waterfall, feel the warmth of fire, and the bitter chill of a cold dark night. The music was beautiful to say the least. It captured the emotion, surroundings and story of the game in ways I can't begin to describe. The story is simple yet complex in its messages and underlying theme . Even if one can't directly relate to the narrative, you feel for the brothers. You share their pain, their fear, and will even find yourself likley laughing out loud on occasion due to the small moments that make this story so rich and full. As wonderful as the game is, it is not without its small list of faults. First, this game doesn't hold your hand. There are no navigation markers etc. You simply have to explore. This is not difficult however, it just requires some patience. Personally this was not a negative for me, but I can see how it could be for some. Secondly If you need to have a game last for 20 plus hours in order to feel fulfilled then this game may not be for you. I played through in about 4 hours. This was after doing a fair bit of exploring but not being completly thorough. I for one feel that 4 hours was more than enough time to accomplish what it sets out to do. Thirdly, one must be mature enought to understand all the themes present in this masterpiece. In other words, for example, much would likely be lost on a 10 year old playing this. It would depent on the 10 however! In closing, if you want to experiece something beautiful, something a little off the beaten path, then this is it! If you are a skeptic like me, take a leap of faith. I promise, you won't be dissapointed!",

            "review_text": "Amazing. I'm 43 now and have seen a lot of games, but few have had this level of quality. You can downright feel how much blood, sweat and tears has been put in this title. Whether it's the accurate animations, the picturesque surroundings, or the matching sound &amp; music - nearly every single detail is made with so much love and carefulness, it will sometimes simply take your breath away. Do yourself a favor and take your time to explore what this game has in store for you, especially since people and animals usually react individually to the brothers. I really enjoyed this tale of two sons, right from the touching opening sequence until the remarkable, courageous ending. Besides Diablo III and Torchlight i'ts the best title I played in the last couple of years.  However, there are some minor things worth criticising. First and foremost, and as indicated above, this game is primarily about exploring its beauty. Brothers may be considered an adventure, but if you place importance on brain teasers, you are at the wrong place - the difficulty is mild, to say the least, the solutions are almost always obvious and easy to accomplish. In adition, it's too short - cutting corners, you can replay the game within less than an hour. In single player mode you tend to confuse the controls of the brothers, as you instinctively want to control the one who is currently located on the left side of the screen with the left analog stick, and vice versa. And last but not least, the camera won't rotate in every situation, which is out of all reason, but hey, worse things happen at sea...  The bottom line is: Don't miss this game. It's worth every penny.",

You move the bothers around with the joysticks (one for each brother) and do actions (most likely, grab something) with the triggers.  In my opinion, this game is good but not as much as I expected. The whole journey IS fun and beautifull but simple and short. At the end, there is a very emotive scene but... it doesn't make the game. The emotion and the gorgeous journey are both amazing but the story is so simple that, after playing, you just don't even care anymore.  It is the big difference with this game and any other beautifull and emotive game, there is no mind blowing story or amazing plot twist, it's just nice. You can say that part and that part were great (pretty much all of them were) but the game as a whole is lacking. (The fact that the two characters speak very rarely and in a foreign language probably doesn't help to build a story.)

The ending was not what I expected, but upon reflection made a lot of sense and was well executed. The first and middle acts dragged a little bit, but I can't put my finger on why - I suspect that it is because this game has been recommended to me so many times that I came in with expectations that were too high. The first two chapters were a little run-of-the-mill once I got used to the controls, but the third introduced some really thought-provoking and interesting landscapes and implications that it drew me back in.   The game is about 4 hours long, and stuttered occasionaly on my purchased-in-2012 pretty-standard-dell-laptop. (Review is slightly over three years after purchase). This was not sufficient to prevent me from enjoying and playing the fame, though I admit to being surprised at the problem given that the graphics do not appear to be very high end. The sound is amazing.  Without spoiling too much, Brothers is a tale of two brothers, that you control simultanously. It is a excellent way to force the player to experience the bond that the story is trying to convey. I played with an Xbox 360 controller, which I think helped with the experience, but is not required. (If you get stuck on a certain wall, there seems to be bug when playing with a controller. You need to use the keyboard and press the *up* button to swing high enough. The controller was simply not working with that section).",

The control scheme -- left stick for older brother, right stick for younger brother, plus left trigger for older brother's action, and right trigger for younger brother makes for a unique experience. It isn't just a gimick; it is part of the story and feel of the game. It's awkward, and coordinating two brothers should be awkward. But occasionally you get it going right, and it feels great to see the two brothers in tandem.   The story is told without words. The characters speak a made up language, and that is OK. Removing the words lets you focus on the story and emotion. It is part of the charm.   It should be said; this game is short. I beat it about 3 1/2 hours. If that is a problem for you, be warned. Perhaps it is my age, or maybe the fact that I'm a Steam person with way too many games to play, but the short length did not turn me off. In fact, I praise the developers for ending it when they did rather than padding it out, or adding filler levels.   I also had some issues in the beginning. For some reason, the up-down axis for the older brother was reversed on my Logitech wireless gamepad. Fortunately with some help from Google I found a simple edit that I needed to do it a .ini file and was fine.  [Note: When this game was released, a lot was said about it being designed for a dual-thumb stick controller. That is how I played the game, but they have since updated it with better keyboard controls - the older brother is WASD, the younger brother is the arrows. I tried this some, and it works just fine, and does not hinder the experience.]",

It took some getting used to the gameplay each time I started it back up, but I think it's a really unique way to play a game like this. The puzzles are easy enough to figure out, but still fun enough to keep from getting repetative. There are interactive items in most scenes that don't drive the plot, per se, but give that much more depth into the characters that you'd really be missing out if you ignored them. I loved the soundtrack, as well.   The graphics are beautiful, and this is the kind of world I would spend hours exploring. So many details that only left me wanting to know everything about this world. There are benches in most areas where you can simply sit and observe, and I would recommend doing just that, so you can fully appreciate the love and creativity put into this game.

I always liked games where you have a companion on your journeys, though (as ICO, the unfairly bashed Prince of Persia 2008 and, for those old enough to remember it, Bermuda Syndrome, among the others). I almost immediately found myself immersed in the world, and growing fonder with the two main characters.  The game starts with the very sad image of a kid still mourning his dead mother, who died drowning without the kid being able to save her. Without a single spoken word (or at least, without one you can understand) you soon find out that his father is very ill as well, when the kid's brother rushes him out and asks for your help to bring him to a doctor. There you discover that the only way to save him is to find a miracle cure somewhere in the land.  This is the beginning of the game and introduces the mechanics: a ICO-like game where you actually control both characters at the same time, in order to have them proceed together. The young and older brothers have different skills. which you'll have to take into account to solve the puzzles along the way. And the journey itself (and the choice of words here is not random: it DID remind me of Journey at times, especially the gorgeous views and the spectacular soundtrack) is amazing. Funny, exciting, charming, melancholic: every emotion is out there, in a turmoil that won't leave you until the very end.  I won't tell you a single thing of what happens: other reviews do, and I believe they can spoil the experience for you. Just go ahead and play it.

One needs the other to survive the obstacles ahead of them, and covers up each others' weaknesses.  Also, the environment and music are very well done and fit the theme and atmosphere perfectly. The former contains so many details and beautiful sceneries that changes seamlessly; while the latter brings out the emotion, tension and appreciation of this piece of art.

You are two brothers, looking to save their father's life. To do this, they embark on a journey, where the two brothers must be one. One cannot perform without the other. And you don't swap between the two, you control them both AT THE SAME TIME. And you would think that would require amazing skills, but all you need is a controller, and good hand/eye coordination, as well as paying attention. The graphics are very sweet, colorful, and brings worlds to life, as well as what you interact with it. The only thing you need to also keep in mind, is that this game is very short. That 3.1 hours on record is not what I've played so far, it's what took me to beat this game. But unlike games that are more about cinematic simulation like Everyone Goes to the Rapture, Gone Home, and Dear Esther; Brothers is constantly having you do things, with really simple gameplay that requires a good bit of thinking since you are using 2 characters at the same time.  This is a true marvel of simple/complex in almost all aspects. TotalBiscuit once declared this, his game of the year winner, and he considers this, to be favorite game, of all time. Over his former one, which was Deus Ex. I don't think this one trumps my favorite, which is Mass Effect; but if you see this game on sale, get it without thinking twice. You will not regret it.

You can also play with a controller, if you're into that sorta thing. You go through a series of event and puzzles that you must solve to move on. You must save your sick father by going on a quest to find a mystical liquid.   Story &amp; Chracaters - The story isn't anything new and original. But it isn't always how the story is, but rather how it is told. In this case it is told extremely well. You go through mountains,tundras, and various other landscapes. Each one reinforcing the feelings of being farther away from your home. The brothers work together to solve every puzzle and even disagree at times. They get along or bicker, but they always care. Even without a spoken word of English every message in this game goes through.   Graphics - The graphics of this game are pretty good for the art style. The landscapes are beautiful. Everything is pretty original. There were a few seams I noticed in the world building. They sky in the tundra has one. There was a lot of recylcing of assets. (Which is fine, because that's what you are supposed to do) But it doesn't break any of the immersion.   Mechanics - This is where it really hits you. The mechanics and puzzles were amazing. Some of these puzzles i've never seen before and they were fun to try and solve. Anything from climbing on ledges, slinking through gates only the little brother can do, or pulling big levels only the older brother could. Everything each character could do really sunk in. That's where you know the game has begun to take hold. In the end    you switch mechanics of the younger brother to the older brother to show change and the growing of age with the since the older one died. This was genius, it shoved so much emotion into the control. So extremely well done.    Overall - This game was so good. You get to have a great time and    ride an emotional roller coaster at the end of the game. I knew that ♥♥♥♥♥ was bad as soon as she leaped over that gap like a damn leaping spider.    Even though I have a short playtime on this game and beat it.That doesn't undermine what it was able to accomplish. I would say its worth the money that it is going for now.

The basic premise of the game is that you control two characters at once, and use this mechanic to solve the puzzles that the game throws your way. These range from climbing, to operating mechanical devices, to a good variety of more interesting puzzles. The game is about 2.5 - 3.5 hours long, depending on how long it takes you, but the puzzles are all fairly straight-forward.  The art style is one of the prettiest I've seen in a game, managing to look like a moving oil painting. The story, while very simplistic, is conveyed very well, even though there no intelligible dialogue, just vocalizations from the characters.  I played it with a keyboard, and just by judging by how it's clearly an Xbox port, I can only assume it plays much better with a controller. (EDIT: I originally played this without an anti-ghosting keyboard so the controls were kind of messy to work with. If you don't have a mechanical keyboard, I'd recommend using a controller, but it IS doable on a standard rubber dome keyboard, just clunky). It was fairly well optimized - didn't have any crashes, and only had two or three frame drops throughout my play time.  Overall, I'd recommend this game if you enjoy this type of thing - a mostly slow-paced, quite easy but very beautiful and touching puzzle game.",

The game is platformer with various puzzles that are all relatively easy to solve. You contrrol two characters: the little brother, and the big brother. You often have to combine the two to negotiate the challenges the landscape poses. For example; can't yank a lever with the little brother? Well you'll need the big brother for that then. Can't fit the big brother through some railings? Thats where you're little bro comes in handy.  Aside from these gameplay features, the game features a charming art style and a folkloric fantasy world which rarely deviates from standard scandinavian fantasy tropes.   So far it seems pretty standard fare, right?   Where this game succeeds is the way it builds a strong emotional connection between the player and the game's protagonists. No mean feat considering our protagonist are speaking a different language (no subtitles are offered either).  It's difficult for me to explain how the game does this so well without depriving you of the pleasure of experiencing it all first hand. All I can say is that this is a game about family and friendship, about adventure and companionship, and about those all too human emotions that require no vehicle of language for translation.  This game is a work of art. A benchmark for all game designers trying to connect their audiences with their creations.  Basically, just pay the 11 quid and thank me later. You won't regret it.",

( At least I havent seen that befor) It is really funny to see, how you manage to controll the two brothers each with one thumbstick. It takes some coordination, but has a cool style to it.  The thing I dont like, is how the story is told. The story is quiet basic yet somehow a bit cloddish. Since the character do not speak a real language, you can only imagine what they are 'talking' about. To be fair, through the gesture of the characters it's not hard to understand what's going on, but there is a lack of depth in the narration.  Like ' Oh no your father is about to die. Go there to find the only thing that can revive him ' - 'OK' -   The other thing I dont like, is the overall lenght of the game. About 3hours... it's short.   Well all in all, if you really like atmospheric adventures and dont want to spend too much time, give 'Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons' a try.",

I liked the graphics style for the most part, although I admit to being slightly distracted by the younger brothers hair looking like he'd had a bowl of custard poured over his head. Seriously though, the game looks nice.   I got on fine with the controls (you really do need a controller), nice to see some original ideas and a new way to solve puzzles.  The story is a simple one, two brothers go off to find some special healing stuff to save thier dying father.  The ending... Well, I was little disappointed. But only because I didn't feel any connection to the characters. Maybe because the game is only a couple of hours long, and not very challenging. If there had been more time and longer puzzles to solve to create the bond between the brothers it would have had much more effect. If you look at Shadow Of The Colossus, despite the underlying simplicity of the game I still nearly broke down in tears the first time Agro falls down the ravine. You spend so much time with Agro as a truely reliable and faithful companion it's impossible to feel nothing. This game does nothing like that. You just jog your way between puzzles, completing each one with ease then on to the next. Despite this I will admit that the use of the control scheme to evoke an emotional response is genuinely remakable and remains the best bit of the game.  So to summarise, if you're a casual gamer you'll probably like it more. If you play a lot of games and have mastered games like Portal then you'll find this a doddle, and will be less likely to feel the emotional ending. It would have been better if it were 10 hours or more with more intricate puzzles.  It is a good game, and definitely worth playing, but for me it was too short and a too easy to buy into the story fully. ",

            "review_text": "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons; man, where do I begin?   General:  Brothers is the coming of age story of two young boys on a quest to save their sickly, dying father. Having already lost one parent to a tragic accident, the two brothers refuse to let fate run its course, and set out on an adventure to gather an ancient medicine in a land far away.  This game is absolutely beautiful in all the best ways; it's gorgeous, atmospheric, unique, deep and interesting. Brothers takes you on an emotional roller coaster as the boys make their way across the land and encounter challenges and dangers they never expected.  My favorite thing about this game is how you're thrown into a world without an understandable language, and yet the story is told so well that you'll intuitively know what's happening and being said.   Visuals:  The design in this game is what really stands out to me. While I do have a bit of an issue with not being able to scale up the graphics quality, the art direction is still nothing short of a masterpiece. Cinematics and atmospherics are so outstanding that you'll find yourself stopping to take in the world around you more than a handful of time. The levels are designed in a way that you get immersed in the surroundings, and it's a refreshing change from the static design of many other adventure games I've played.   Mechanics:  The gameplay itself is very simple, you control both brothers simultaneously and interact with each other and the world around you to progress through each level. There's the occasional snag here and there, but I didn't run into any problems that couldn't be quickly resolved. While I'm not sure if this game can actually be played with a keyboard, I'd suggest playing with a controller if you have one.  In reality, there are only two main actions, and the rest is done through movement. One action button triggers the little brother, and the other action button causes the big brother to interact. Despite the simplicity of the mechanics, I found that it was more than enough for me to have fun without feeling too limited.   Value and Replayability:  In terms of value, I can't say I would spend the full price for this game just for the simple fact that it's so short. Even constantly pausing and taking screenshots, I only managed to land just under four hours of gameplay. While I deeply enjoyed the story and visual aspect of the game, I'm not sure that warrants the price you're paying for playtime at retail value.  Replayability, well, your milage may vary. Chances are good that I will pick this game up again down the road because of what a work of art I found it to be, but I also understand how it may not be worth a second run for many players. The story's been told, the game's been played, and what's done is done. If you find yourself typically part of that group, then chances are you're not going to find much replay value.   Overall,  I found Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons to be a fantastic story, and while a bit pricey at the full cost, well worth picking up on sale. There's a reason this game has been talked about so widely, and if you like adventure games, this is absolutely one to add to your collection.",

It's definitely one of the best, if not the best, singleplayer story driven games that I picked up in 2015.  This game is kind of a tear jerker if that's something you're into. The characters don't speak any language and most players seem to think this cheapens the game somehow, at first. Even without the ability to understand what the characters are saying you can still emphasize with them fully; something most games can barely do even with dialouge.  I bought this game mistakenly thinking it was a two player co-op that I was going to play with my brother. We both ended up realizing the mistake but sat through and played it together anyway. Both playing our own copy and just generally progressing at the same pace. What sticks out to me about this memory is the total silent respect that came over us when we both got towards the end of the game. Not many games can command attention like this game does, especially at the end, and you will find yourself gazing in awe at the scenery and events that unfold infront of you.",

I would urge people to play this game on a 360 controller because unlike other games where you need to set 'character A' up on the a pressure pad then switch to take control of 'Character B' as you move her through the door, in this game you are able to control both characters simultaneously using the thumb sticks and running two people in different directions at the same time adds another level of challenge and enjoyment. I fairly certain I lack the coordination to pull this off with keyboard and mouse though.  In a world where films drag on with little thought to plot, with their pointless explosions and shakey-cam and the need to drag out scene beating you over the head with them, you need Brothers: A tale of two sons to remind you the art of story telling is still alive.",

At times I caught myself just staring at the background, which is something the game even encourages.  The mechanics and controls are fun, and while a controller is mandatory, it quickly becomes second nature. You control each of the brothers with with a separate analog stick, something I hadn't heard of before this game.  While it only took me about 2 hours to complete entirely, I would still recommend this experience to anyone just looking to get lost in a truly wonderful and inspirational world.

So the story is simple but it is still very well written. One of the game's flaws is it's puzzles, while they are fun to do they are way to easy. And the talking they don't say very much and repete a lot so it gets annoing after a while. I did run into some buggs where I couldn't go on because of them, but to fix them you just go back to the last check point or restart the chapter which was very annoying, it happened twice to me.
