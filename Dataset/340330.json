            "review_text": "When I first played this game over at another site, I had no experience at all with recruit/monster taming type rpgs so the learning curve was very high for me. But I stuck with it, and found the appeal of this well crafted game was huge. Talk about lots to do and lots to learn.  As a freshly graduated lower god you are sent out to an area of three maze/dungeon like worlds to gather recruits, find treasures, and battle nonsters that you do not recruit until you are strong enough to challenge the 'other' lower god who graduated with you for supremacy. Then the game moves to other areas, I suppose because I have spent hours and hours in the first world (including the other site) just learning the game and preparing for the showdown. (I tried the 'showdown' battle just a couple of times with no success ---- much more to do). And the amazing thing is, I'm just motivated to keep trying. The game stays fresh, the levels are interesting, and the game mechanics, though tough to learn for me, are very well done. So I'm happy to keep playing and see what's next.  I should add that there have been numerous improvements and upgrades to the Steam version from the older one I played at the other site.  Great soundtrack, too!  This is an excellent title that I believe will grow on you the nore you play (and learn), and is highly recommebded.",
