The graphics are bright and cartoonish. In some respects, the atmosphere of the game sort of reminds me of Costume quest. It's easy to get the hang of, and a fun way to kill time.",

I wish there was a reason to play it again, other than just liking it so much the first time. I spent $2 on the game so it was worth it for the time spent. I'm going to load it up again now to play while watching TV in the background.",

I kinda wish it wasn't so DO THIS! NOW THIS! and would let people wing it a bit more. Maybe have a difficulty level setting or something along those lines.  Minor glitches here and there near the end that made me thankful the game was over quickly after the glitches popped up.  I'd recommend to people with children or for older folks who are easily amused. Pretty cute game. Hopefully they fix some of the kinks though for people who plays this game in the future.  Took my time and beat it within 8 hours. No replay value. 6/10",

Very good time management game, very child friendly (if they don't get scared at cute spookies) mild exploration and questing. Enjoyable as a good time waster, and cerebral enough to relax the mind. Very cutsie and amuising.",
