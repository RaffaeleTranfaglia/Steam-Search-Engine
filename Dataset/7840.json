            "review_text": "Despite all the issues this game suffers from It isn't really that bad. I see far too many people complaining that using an Xbox controller has a terrible preset and I have to agree. It's downright awful! But with some tweaking you can easily get it to where It should be. But that's part of the problem I suppose- These days people cannot be bothered to do that.  What the game really lack is phasing. Simple as that. Even the cutscenes are somewhat slow and confusing! (Though most people should get the idea quickly enough.)  At the very start of the game you get the feeling your going backwards in time due to the races being so utterly slow but the more you progress the faster it goes. Not to mention the usage of powerups. Even so it will never be as fast as one expects but be thankful for it as the later tracks may prove somewhat difficult.  Although the Storyline is extremely short and some obvious issues with the game I'd still recommend it. Though not at full price but around $3.",
